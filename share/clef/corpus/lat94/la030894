 Cheese burglar?As if the Southland's image hasn't suffered enough, we now 
learn there's a rival claimant for the invention of the cheeseburger. 
</P>
<P>
 American Heritage magazine, as we have previously pointed out, gives Pasadena 
the nod. The magazine related how a chef named Lionel Sternberger daringly 
tossed a slice (variety unknown) on a burger in the early 1920s "and lo! the 
cheeseburger sizzled to life." 
</P>
<P>
 The inspiring story still brings a tear to our eye. 
</P>
<P>
 But Diane Balkin, an extensive collector of cheeseburger knickknacks, wrote to 
point out that Denver has a granite monument stating: "On this site in 1935 
Louis Ballast created the cheeseburger."  
</P>
<P>
 She sent along a newspaper article recalling that, before turning to cheese, 
Ballast had experimented "with sauces, tomatoes and other variations. He even 
tried peanut butter and chocolate bars in search of the perfect topping. One 
customer, he said later, became so enamored of the peanut butter burger that he 
would eat nothing else." 
</P>
<P>
 Ballast even is said to have registered cheeseburger with the secretary of 
state's office although Balkin, a chief deputy district attorney in Denver, 
says she has been unable to verify that claim. 
</P>
<P>
 We plan to do some investigating ourselves. What about the possibility that 
Sternberger's trade secret -- admittedly not that complicated -- was passed on 
to Ballast? Also, while we're at it, how legitimate is Denver's claim to the 
omelet?

 No snow jobs here: Of the big chill in the East, Kevin Cowherd of the 
Baltimore Sun writes: "The good thing about the terrible winter we've had is 
that it gives the people in Los Angeles something to laugh about. . . . People 
in L.A. can pick up the paper and see a picture of some poor slob shoveling 
snow in Baltimore and think: "God, can you imagine living there? Why don't 
those people just move?"

 Nothing like a batch of tasty oatmeal quakies: The Jan. 17 wake-up call has 
inspired a whole line of earthquake products, so why not some 6.8 sweets? Toni 
Duncan of Hidden Hills says that the quake "dumped food from our pantry and 
refrigerator onto the middle of the kitchen floor -- flour, sugar, oatmeal, 
milk, eggs." Duncan scooped up the mess, poured it "onto a cookie sheet and 
baked it."

 We presume her kitchen floor is usually clean enough, as the saying goes, to

AL MARTINEZ: BRING YOUR ROSARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The latest union ploy for prying money out of management is to threaten the 
source of company profit in a non-confrontational manner. 
</P>
<P>
 This can be accomplished by spreading bad news about the product: like the 
melons at Joe's market are tainted or rat droppings have been found in Juan's 
Coffee or the average life span of a tourist in L.A. is only 82.5 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 You do this by writing letters, renting billboards, making telephone calls or, 
in a more devastating syntax, by creating a video. 
</P>
<P>
 Producing a video about what's rotten in L.A. is precisely what the Los 
Angeles Police Protective League is threatening to do unless the city comes 
through with a raise. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea the league is trying to get across is that it would be a lot less 
costly for the city to grant a long-overdue salary increase to its cops than to 
see its $8-billion tourist industry slide into hell. 
</P>
<P>
 They figure that a video depicting crime in the streets in all of its creative 
formats would cause thousands of tourists to either stay home this summer or go 
to places like Allentown, Pa., instead. 
</P>
<P>
 The prototype for a video depicting L.A. as Sarajevo comes from the Restaurant 
and Hotel Employees Union, which, in an effort to wring money from its 
employers, did the same thing 18 months ago. The contract was settled shortly 
thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
 Subsequent to that, the United Teachers-Los Angeles threatened to send out 
letters bashing L.A. if the school board didn't stop talking about a 17% salary 
cut. They got a 10% pay cut instead. 
</P>
<P>
 And now we have the cops. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There is something ominous about police telling you the city isn't safe. I 
mean, if it isn't safe for big guys with guns and radios, what's it going to be 
like for my sister Emily from Oakland with only her rosary beads? 
</P>
<P>
 That, of course, is precisely the question the Protective League would want 
everyone to ask if it does send out a video. But then, one wonders, why would 
more money for the cops be better for the tourists? 
</P>
<P>
 "They're going to have to be careful about that," Helen Bernstein said the 
other day. She's president of the teachers union. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their message confuses me. If the streets are unsafe because there aren't 
enough of them, OK. But if the message comes across that they're not doing 
their job, that's no good." 
</P>
<P>
 Choosing the right approach is important, she explained. The teachers spent 
days discussing whether billboards they rented should say they were unhappy or 
discontented. They finally chose unhappy, as in "L.A., the home of 32,000 
unhappy teachers." 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein related that with such pride I didn't have the heart to ask why it 
took days to decide. I'm just glad I made it out of the public schools before I 
was 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Protective League spokesman Geoffrey Garfield bristles at the notion 
that our boys in blue aren't doing their job. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one can ever accuse us of holding back!!" he said with multiple 
exclamation points. "It was as if God himself had tested us after the Rodney 
King verdict!! We had fire, flood and earthquake, and we kept the city 
together!!" 
</P>
<P>
 Since the cops are asking for more money and not more cops, that still doesn't 
explain why a raise for the league's 7,500 members would make L.A. safer for 
tourism. Perhaps they would simply try harder. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I'm for giving cops more money. No one has a tougher job in this town than the 
police, with the possible exception of newspaper columnists. 
</P>
<P>
 If workers at the Department of Water and Power can get a 9% pay hike for 
flipping switches and turning faucet handles, the men and women who protect and 
serve ought to get at least twice that. 
</P>
<P>
 Cops ought to be paid at least as much as the little thugs who make a bundle 
running dope. I just don't think a video trashing L.A. is the way to go about 
it. Even at its worst it's just another 60-minute episode on "Cops" and it's 
not going to keep anyone away. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. County has been torn by riots, ravaged by fires, drenched by storms, 
covered by floods and shaken by a killer earthquake, but still the tourists 
come in their colorful Hawaiian shirts and checkered shorts. 
</P>
<P>
 Does anyone seriously think the fear of ending up dead in front of an ATM 
machine is going to dissuade a guy who dreams of seeing Heather Locklear in 
person? No way. 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Protective League is going to have to come up with something better 
than a video urging everyone to stay away. Even with the chaos we've already 
had, my sister Emily is still planning a trip. 
</P>
<P>
 She's just bringing along an extra set of rosary beads.

SCOUT RULING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * For the 4th District Court of Appeal to label the Boy Scouts of America a 
"business" ("Scouts Can't Bar Atheists, Court Rules," March 1) is an absurd 
technicality. The Boy Scouts are composed almost entirely of unpaid volunteers, 
draw their support mostly from donations and transact "business" among 
themselves primarily for convenience with profits plowed back into camps and 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 For young boys, the discipline, teamwork, self-reliance and altruism they gain 
as Scouts is second only to values instilled by family and church. Statistics 
prove only a minuscule percentage of Scouts ever get into trouble with the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet because the Scouts forbid homosexual Scoutmasters and require their young 
men to pledge an oath to God, they are constantly under attack.  
</P>
<P>
 So tell me, who in America stands for the family? Who in America stands for 
the church? Who in America stands for God? Not the courts. Not the media. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 * In your editorial "Business of Scouting" (March 2) you ask, "If the young 
people are uncomfortable swearing allegiance, why not leave them alone. . . .?" 
That's exactly what the Boy Scouts have wanted to do from the beginning. The 
boys are unwilling to leave the Scouts alone. They want to join a private, 
voluntary organization, but they want to force that organization to change its 
rules of admission. What crap.

POLITICIAN WATCH; CREDIT LIMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Citizens across California can benefit from an Orange County water district 
scandal if Gov. Pete Wilson signs, as he should, a bill expected to land on his 
desk soon. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill would cut from $1,000 to $250 the annual limit on gifts or 
honorariums from any single donor to an elected official or an employee of a 
special district or local government body such as a city council, county board 
or school district.While the ideal limit would be zero, or maybe a cup of 
coffee and a hamburger, the $250 cap is about as good as can be expected now in 
Sacramento. It indeed would help. 
</P>
<P>
 Another good provision requires employees or elected directors of special 
districts to list bills totaling more than $100 for meals, lodging, travel 
expenses or other costs if they were reimbursed with taxpayer dollars. That 
will give the public the opportunity to evaluate the spending. 
</P>
<P>
 The impetus for the legislation, sponsored by Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden 
Grove), was the disclosure of lavish expense-account spending by the general 
manager of the Santa Margarita Water District and his assistant. The two, who 
since have resigned, are under investigation for possible violations of laws 
limiting gifts and barring conflicts of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 After its practices were publicized, the water district imposed a virtual ban 
on gifts and required more expense-account disclosure. This is good. But a 
tough law at the state level well might prod special districts, councils and 
boards elsewhere to keep a closer eye on their ethics and their purse strings, 
heading off future scandals.

HEBRON: THE NECESSARY STEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly half the members of Israel's Cabinet, including Housing Minister 
Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, a former general and commander on the West Bank, are now 
reported to be favoring the removal of all 450 Israelis living in the West Bank 
town of Hebron. Other government ministers indicate they too are leaning toward 
the politically bold -- and necessary -- step of ordering eviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, providing military protection for the settlers, especially 
after the Feb. 25 massacre by an Israeli of dozens of Arabs as they prayed in a 
mosque, forces Israel to keep 1,000 to 1,500 troops in Hebron, which has an 
Arab population of 65,000. More urgently, as Ben-Eliezer and other officials 
suggest, the presence of the activist settlers is seen as encouraging friction 
and conflict at a time when the government is struggling to resuscitate a peace 
process that is now in deep distress. 
</P>
<P>
 Hebron, revered as the burial place of Abraham and Sarah, resonates with 
religious significance for Jews and Muslims alike. That Israel's government is 
even considering the eviction of 42 ultra-religious Jewish families and 100 or 
so seminary students indicates the importance now being given to trying to 
prevent the more extremist of the 130,000 Israeli settlers in the disputed 
territories from sabotaging the government's peace efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 But to ponder a course of action isn't the same as taking it. Prime Minister 
Yitzhak Rabin, currently negotiating to bring a small right-wing party into his 
shaky coalition, is keeping silent for now on the Hebron settlers issue. And 
demands from the Palestine Liberation Organization for the removal of all 
settlers in and around Arab towns all but assure that Israel will do nothing 
that can be construed as yielding to that clamor. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the timetable agreed to last September by Israel and the PLO, the 
settlements question isn't to reach the negotiating table until 1996. To try to 
force it to the top of the agenda now would mean the collapse of the peace 
process. But at the same time there's nothing to prevent Israel from taking 
unilateral action in regard to those few hundred or few thousand who are the 
most extreme and troublesome among the settlers. The justification for such 
action wouldn't be to appease the Palestinians. It would be to protect the 
Israeli government's own peace policy from the subversion it faces.

A FORWARD MOVE FOR RU-486; PROMISING TALKS ON U.S. IMPORTATION OF ABORTIFACIENT 
ARE NOW UNDER WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The process by which new prescription drugs are licensed for use and sale in 
this country has come under increasing criticism, in large measure because many 
people believe it takes too long. However, in the case of the drug RU-486, the 
length of that process has had little to do with the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration's formal testing and licensing procedures and everything to do 
with politics. 
</P>
<P>
 RU-486 has been the subject of intense debate since it was legalized for use 
as an abortifacient in France in 1988. The so-called abortion pill, commonly 
taken in conjunction with a second hormone, is now used legally in four 
countries. One of the four, Britain, last month agreed to allow Americans and 
other foreigners to obtain the drug there for a $500 fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Testing in Europe has found RU-486 to be 96% effective in terminating a 
pregnancy and to cause fewer side effects and complications than the 
traditional surgical abortion. But precisely because RU-486 appears to be 
medically less risky than a surgical abortion, as well as quicker and more 
private, abortion opponents have acted -- successfully, so far -- to block its 
testing and introduction in the United States. Groups contending that the pill 
would encourage abortion have intimidated the drug's skittish European 
manufacturer, Roussel Uclaf, by threatening to organize consumer boycotts of 
its other products if it made RU-486 available for testing in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the Population Council, a New York-based nonprofit group devoted to 
improving access to birth control, is negotiating with the French 
pharmaceutical maker to provide the drug for formal testing by the FDA and 
eventual distribution in this country. That formal process could take one to 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
 That Roussel Uclaf is talking about U.S. distribution is certainly welcome 
news. The negotiations have the support of the Clinton Administration, and 
early indications are that they will be successful. If they are, RU-486 could 
redefine the politics of abortion and make the confrontations at clinics 
obsolete.

PUMPING UP CIVIL RIGHTS; PATRICK IS A STRONG NOMINEE FOR FEDERAL POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Washington needs a tough, principled and skillful advocate for civil rights at 
the Justice Department. Race remains a decidedly tortuous subject for Americans 
to discuss honestly. Passions and fears often discourage a thoughtful political 
discourse on how to protect the rights of minorities without usurping the 
rights of the majority. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton has nominated Deval L. Patrick, a prominent Boston attorney, 
to become the assistant attorney general in charge of the civil rights 
division. Depending on a President's philosophy, that division aggressively or 
minimally enforces laws that prohibit discrimination in employment, public 
education, housing, public accommodations and funding of federal programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick, Clinton's third choice for this important post, is expected to clear 
the political hurdles to confirmation. He has no paper trail like the 
President's first choice, Lani Guinier, the brilliant but controversial law 
professor whom Clinton abandoned after she was pilloried because of some of the 
statements in her prolific legal writings on voting rights. Patrick was 
Guinier's co-counsel on discrimination cases when both worked for the NAACP 
Legal Defense Fund, but even her most rabid detractors have yet to make stick 
any suggestion that Patrick is another Guinier.  
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Clinton's second choice, Washington attorney John Payton, Patrick is 
knowledgeable on voting rights law, perhaps the most immediate challenge facing 
whoever gets the job. He is also known for his intellectual toughness, 
negotiating skills and leadership capabilities. In the job Patrick would face 
the formidable task of reviving an agency that sleep-walked during years of 
White House failure to vigorously enforce federal civil rights laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress should approve Patrick and in its nomination hearings explore why 
this nation still needs strong federal enforcement nearly 30 years after 
passage of the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 
1965. 
</P>
<P>
 Minorities have made major advances in terms of where they live and work, but 
employment and housing discrimination remains. Ballots are no longer denied 
through discriminatory tools like poll taxes and literacy tests, but 
intimidation and other tactics sometimes still are used to suppress the black 
and Latino vote. Redistricting too is misused to dilute the minority vote. And 
even when minority candidates prevail, local governing bodies sometimes change 
the rules to weaken their newfound power. 
</P>
<P>
 These challenges require constant federal vigilance, and sometimes 
intervention. It is a never-ending fight. Patrick should prove a capable 
warrior in the cause.

 * Re "Guns That Nobody Needs," editorial, Feb. 26: You call for a ban on 
"assault weapons," since they have "no use other than to kill people." Your 
generic definition of these firearms has in the past been so broad as to 
include the target-modified, semiautomatic military service rifles used by 
thousands of people who have been engaged in high-power rifle target 
competition. This activity has long been sanctioned by the U.S. Army. One can 
assume that the majority of the thousands who enjoy this sport have invested 
several thousand dollars in their firearm and accessories. What have we done 
wrong to have the government withdraw its sanction and confiscate the 
investment it has encouraged? Your editorial acknowledges that a ban on assault 
weapons will have little effect on crime. These target firearms do not cause 
carnage. Is this not the taking of private property without just compensation, 
or does the last portion of the Fifth Amendment apply only to the militia?

 * The Times asks what possible legitimate use could anyone have for a 
military-style, semiautomatic rifle such as the Colt Sporter. The answer can be 
found in the Feb. 23 article "Some Gun Owners Take 2nd Look at Fingers on Other 
Triggers." In describing a burglary thwarted by an armed citizen, the author 
states, "Murphy, who lives in Tucson . . . has twice faced down burglars 
breaking into his parent's home. The last one he held at bay with his Colt 
Sporter was 19 years old and had a rap sheet with 34 felonies." 
</P>
<P>
 According to FBI crime statistics, less than 1% of firearms crime is committed 
by criminals wielding "assault weapons." The issue is nothing more than a red 
herring for gun control proponents to advance their agenda of disarming 
America.

 * Bill Boyarsky's Feb. 27 column offered a responsible message on how citizens 
can resist crime, but it erred in identifying the murder of Los Angeles police 
officer Christy Hamilton as an act of "random violence." On the contrary, it 
was a predictable outcome of a radical gun user providing his drug-addicted son 
with a military assault weapon. A similar misstatement appeared in your Feb. 27 
story on the murder of 7-year-old Kim Bracey by a playmate, again armed with an 
assault weapon. The writer implied that it may be open to question "whether 
anyone in the household had been negligent for leaving the weapon within reach" 
of a child. Negligent, yes, for owning the gun in the first place, and 
deserving of a jail sentence now that it has led to a senseless (but 
predictable) killing.

<TEXT>
<P>
 * "Brava" to The Times for publishing the perceptive commentary by Michelle 
Krisel concerning Kathleen Battle's dismissal from the Metropolitan Opera (Feb. 
21). Opera lovers such as myself were dismayed and bewildered by the news 
accounts of the career setback sustained by this fine artist.Krisel's 
penetrating yet compassionate analysis is the only account I have read that 
makes clear the circumstances that led to this saddening event. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 * I found Krisel's hatchet job on Battle to be presumptuous, poorly informed, 
spiteful and rude. It's easy to see why someone like Krisel, a business person, 
would be unable to understand the temperament of a dedicated artist like 
Battle. Or how Krisel might fail to fathom the degree to which ambience and 
atmosphere weigh on an artist's performance, making her sensitive and 
demanding. But making jokes about someone's name, as Krisel did with her 
"Battle-Ax" crack, is the lowest form of sophomoric insult, and reveals the 
vindictiveness behind Krisel's article. 
</P>
<P>
 Krisel lays the phony sentiment on pretty thick while telling us of how sorry 
she is that Battle's "sudden stardom" (20 years is sudden?) has ill-prepared 
her for the demands of the Met. She then goes on to whine about how sad she is 
to find that an "Olympian" like Battle could be petty. Who cares what Battle 
(or Krisel, for that matter) does offstage? We love Battle for her dedication 
to art, her flawlessly professional performances, her keen insight and 
intuition, and her enormous talent. What facts about Battle has Krisel offered 
that could discredit any of these?

PRIVATE CABINS IN PUBLIC FORESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to "Making Themselves at Home," Feb. 18: 
</P>
<P>
 Your article generalizes an unfortunate incident of leaseholder arrogance to 
suggest that those of us who own cabins on U.S. Forest Service land are ripping 
off the public and hogging the very best forest locations with barbed-wire 
fences and attack dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 While I would agree that there are lessees who are violating the terms of 
their leases with the Forest Service, there are far more of us who adhere to 
the restrictions and covenants which are decreed by Congress -- and which we 
can agree with and follow or disapprove and give up our leases. Many of the 
violations described are not new and cannot be blamed by Forest Service 
representatives on budgetary limitations. Some of the full-time residence 
violations cited in the article have actually been knowingly tolerated by the 
Forest Service for over 45 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Forest Service is certainly facing limited funding and staff and must 
decide where to focus its time and energies. Clearly, past decisions have been 
to not enforce all aspects of the cabin lease program. In this time of short 
budgets, leaseholders such as ourselves in the San Bernardino National Forest 
have donated many hours of our weekends to cleanup and repair jobs of public 
property, which the Forest Service does not have time to do. 
</P>
<P>
 This article identifies a very real problem which should be addressed and 
corrected -- that problem being widespread violation of residence restrictions. 
To suggest that the entire recreation residence program is mismanaged and bad 
policy is not correct. 
</P>
<P>

 * It is an outrage to hear of such abuse of public land. What is more 
outrageous is the fact that little is being done to prevent it. Residents who 
are overstaying their temporary welcome are spoiling a program that was 
designed to enhance the use of our public lands; now others are inhibited from 
enjoying it. 
</P>
<P>
 It disgusts me to know that what little recreational land we have set aside in 
Southern California is threatened in a twisted game of "King of the Mountain"!

FAST FOOD OVERSEAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Whether the consumers are American, Asian or Russian, the basic attraction 
of American fast-food restaurants lies in the adjective "fast" (Column One, 
Feb. 19). 
</P>
<P>
 Fast-food chains keep costs down by buying in bulk, operate efficiently using 
time-tested methods, and the end products are consistently uniform and the 
service is fast. Not too very long ago, eating out was the sole privilege of 
the affluent. Now, any plain Joe (or Chong or Ivan or Kim) can pack up the kids 
and go out to eat at a local fast-food restaurant (or Joe can grab a quick 
lunch and not have to carry a lunch box). No wonder the world community 
embraces this American innovation.

PLATFORM; THE IMAGE MATTERS

By LINDA McKEEVER BULLARD, a Los Angeles screenwriter, is the 
great-granddaughter of the black rodeo cowboy Wild Bill Pickett. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After 300 years of the holocaust of slavery and legally sanctioned 
segregation, African Americans still cannot tell our own stories without white 
"overseers." The problem is that these artists, filmmakers and TV producers 
keep getting the African American picture wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the way in which a 29-cent stamp honoring my great-grandfather, Wild 
Bill Pickett, was handled by the Postal Service. Pickett was the Michael 
Jordan/Shaquille O'Neal/Charles Barkley of the turn of the century, the rodeo 
cowboy who invented bulldogging "bite-em" style. Instead of wrestling a steer 
to the ground, he would alight on its back, twist its head up with his hands 
and bite its lip, temporarily paralyzing the beast. Together they dropped to 
the ground. He was beloved by blacks and whites alike for his courage and 
showmanship. 
</P>
<P>
 The Postal Service commissioned a white artist who probably hadn't heard of my 
great-grandfather (obviously he'd never seen his likeness). He used the wrong 
picture, causing the Postal Service to incur $1.2 million in reprinting costs. 
It was my family who pointed out the error. The Postal Service is throwing us a 
party in Oklahoma (no expenses paid). The white artist received $60,000 and the 
chance to try it again.

PERSPECTIVE ON HEALTH REFORM; THE ONE HUGE FLAW OF 'SINGLE PAYER'; THERE'S NO 
EVIDENCE THE GOVERNMENT CAN EFFICIENTLY ADMINISTER MEDICAL CARE -- OR ANYTHING 
ELSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAIN C. ENTHOVEN and SARA J. SINGER, Alain C. Enthoven is a professor of 
management at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business and a member of 
the Jackson Hole Group, an organization of health-care executives and policy 
analysts. Sara J. Singer is his special assistant. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Single payer, single payer" has become the health-reform mantra of the left. 
It combines the twin appeals of simplifying the current system by turning the 
whole thing over to government management and saving on administrative costs by 
eliminating the health insurance industry. Unfortunately, reduced complexity is 
unlikely in any program administered by the government -- federal or state. 
Without changing the incentives to raise costs in the current system, 
administrative savings alone will not solve our health-care cost and access 
problems, at least not without sacrificing quality. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, single-payer advocates would have the government pay for all 
health-care services and raise the required revenue through a payroll tax on 
earned income. But government is inherently an ineffective, incompetent, 
inefficient purchaser of whatever it buys. Scandals regularly plague government 
agencies -- memorable incidents include the the Defense Department's infamously 
wasteful procurement policies, past political favoritism in the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development and the horrific fraud and high default rate on 
government-backed education loans. Local stories about Medicare or Medicaid 
fraud and abuse are a common occurrence. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a systemic explanation for such ineffectiveness. Brookings 
Institution economist Charles Schultze explained that government cannot be seen 
as directly harming individuals, such as by putting them out of work or out of 
business, especially individuals who also happen to be constituents. All 
government suppliers create jobs in some congressional district or another and 
therefore are protected by some member of Congress. So government typically 
ends up paying on the basis of cost reimbursement, which assumes that those 
whose costs are higher need more money. This type of reimbursement formula has 
been disastrous, both in terms of cost and quality of health care. By contrast, 
the private market permits lower-quality, inefficient providers to fail, 
allowing better ones to replace them. 
</P>
<P>
 Legislators are constantly under intense pressure to deliver particularized 
benefits -- also known as "pork barrel" -- to constituents and electoral 
supporters. Thus, decisions are made on political grounds, not on the basis of 
maximum value for money. This is also why veterans hospitals are not built 
where they are needed most; they are built in the districts of Veterans Affairs 
Committee members. 
</P>
<P>
 Government is especially weak on questions of volume, appropriateness of 
services and quality -- subtle issues where judgment is necessary. Civil 
servants are not allowed to use judgment. Formulas to determine who gets how 
much health care lend themselves to political manipulation, waste and abuse. 
Quality would suffer because quality is not a government priority. According to 
Vice President Al Gore in the 1993 National Performance Review, "In 
Washington's highly politicized world, the greatest risk is not that a program 
will perform poorly, but that a scandal will erupt. Scandals are front-page 
news, while routine failure is ignored." Instead, a market-based approach 
relies on consumer choice and wide dissemination of information so people can 
judge for themselves where to spend their money. 
</P>
<P>
 Single-payer advocates like to point to Medicare's low administrative costs as 
evidence of efficiency. Administrative costs may be low relative to the private 
sector, but total Medicare expenditures continue to grow at unacceptable rates, 
despite government's ability to lower reimbursement rates and shift costs to 
private payers. Medicare is not efficient; it is undermanaged. In the name of 
budget reduction, Congress and the executive branch cut back on the number of 
civil servants needed to manage these programs properly. The program spends 
billions on unnecessary and inappropriate care. No competitive private company 
would pay out large sums of money with so little management. 
</P>
<P>
 Health-care costs account for approximately 14% of this nation's economy. 
Direct federal spending accounts for nearly one-third of health-care costs; 
federal spending overall comes to 22% of the gross national product. A 
single-payer system would increase government's reach by half. But according to 
the vice president, "the average American believes that we (the federal 
government) waste 48 cents of every tax dollar. . . . In the name of 
controlling waste, we have created paralyzing inefficiency." 
</P>
<P>
 While the private sector in health-care purchasing has undergone a revolution 
-- roughly 100 million people have converted from traditional fee-for-service 
free choice of provider insurance to health-maintenance organizations and 
preferred-provider insurance -- government has been incapable of changing. 
Fewer than 2.5 million of the 36 million Medicare beneficiaries are in HMOs. 
Bruce Vladeck, head of the Health Care Financing Administration, which 
administers Medicare, admitted: "Our payment methodology is so primitive that 
it doesn't save money, . . . We are losing money on HMO patients" because the 
HMOs seem to skim off healthier enrollees but are still paid 95% of the average 
Medicare bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-nine years after enactment of Medicare, government is unable to take 
advantage of an innovation that provides high-quality care at less cost to more 
than 40 million private-sector patients. As Gore put it, "the federal 
government seems unable to abandon the obsolete . . . the federal government is 
not simply broke; it is broken." State governments are no better. California's 
Medi-Cal program only recently began to adopt managed care, years after the 
private sector. Still, it's among the first states to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 While there is much that can be done to improve the current state of the 
health-insurance industry, government is too rigid and inflexible to accomplish 
it. Only market forces can create a system in which informed, cost-conscious 
buyers switch to the most efficient system because they see that it is in their 
own best interest to encourage efficiency.

luggage. 
</P>
<P>
 Travelers laden with art objects, portfolios, pinatas, overstuffed garment 
bags, musical instruments and carefully wrapped baby gifts are being required 
to slip those items into a baggage sizer before boarding any of the airline's 
90 discount-fare Project High Ground flights to East Coast and Midwest cities. 
Oversize items get checked as baggage. Starting April 4, USAir will use the 
sizer for all of its flights.

high-stepping a capella Zulu rhythms were catapulted to world fame by Paul 
Simon's "Graceland" album, and who have since toured the world, won a Grammy, 
sung the ABCs on "Sesame Street" and performed on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gift of the Tortoise," released today by Music for Little People/Warner Bros. 
Records, is the group's debut children's album. A rich blend of traditional 
South African music and storytelling, the recording has a deeper meaning for 
Ladysmith leader Joseph Shabalala. It is part of his mission to preserve his 
country's indigenous culture and traditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time to follow the footsteps of our ancestors," Shabalala said from New 
York, where the group of 10 Zulu singer-dancers was wrapping up an extensive 
Canadian-U.S. tour. "That's the only way to know ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Shabalala, a father of nine and grandfather of four, is soft-spoken and quick 
to laugh, but he is passionate about salvaging traditions of spirituality and 
family that he has seen eroding during decades of political and social 
upheaval. 
</P>
<P>
 On the album, which includes South African pop star and anti-apartheid 
activist Johnny Clegg on guitar, Zulu and English lyrics and narrative paint 
vivid pictures of a land "under a bright blue sky" and of a people to whom rain 
can be a matter of life and death. 
</P>
<P>
 The songs tell of mothers coming home with bundles balanced on their heads, 
filled with treats bought with a harvest's surplus. They tell about a boy who 
is turned into a cat as punishment for his intolerance of others' differences. 
And they tell of how children miss parents who can only support them by working 
in cities hundreds of miles away from home. 
</P>
<P>
 The heart of the album, however, is the first song, "Kanje Kanje" ("This Way 
and That"). As Ladysmith Black Mambazo wraps the Zulu lyrics in trademark 
velvet harmonies, a wind kicks up, growing louder and louder. The narrator, a 
wise old Tortoise, breaks in. (Gcina Mhlophe, a professional storyteller and 
former director of Johannesburg's acclaimed Market Theatre, performs the 
narration, which she co-wrote with Leib Ostrow). 
</P>
<P>
 "Listen to the winds blow. The trees are bending in the storm and the birds 
are having a hard time staying in the trees. . . . Why is there such a gale?  
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps the ancestors are unhappy so many of the old songs aren't being sung 
and are disappearing from the face of the Earth. The songs must be sung to be 
saved."  
</P>
<P>
 Children's voices rush to join in, piping English lyrics layered over the soft 
Zulu voices. The winds die. 
</P>
<P>
 "Music creates order out of chaos," Shabalala said. "When the people came, the 
white people in South Africa, the (indigenous) music was there a long time, but 
they don't understand. They build many schools and many universities, but the 
music of the regional people has no home." 
</P>
<P>
 That is what gives the song "Homeless" on the "Graceland" album its resonance 
for Shabalala and he expresses warm appreciation for pop star Paul Simon, who 
"opened the big gate. All the South African musicians, the scholars, they all 
have a chance now." 
</P>
<P>
 To further that chance, Shabalala and co-producer Ostrow, Music for Little 
People's CEO, are donating their producer royalties from the recording to the 
planned Ladysmith Black Mambazo Academy of Music, a school to be dedicated to 
the teaching and preserving of indigenous South African music. 
</P>
<P>
 Classes have already begun at Natal University near the city of Durban and 
land has been donated for an independent facility, but funding for construction 
is needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gift of the Tortoise" almost didn't happen. Indeed, two years ago, the future 
of the group itself was in doubt. Shortly after Shabalala agreed to Ostrow's 
proposal for the children's album in 1991, his brother Headman was slain. An 
off-duty security guard was charged with the killing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was thinking this is the way of God telling me to not continue," Shabalala 
said. "From that day, I was telling myself I'm not going to sing anymore. But 
as the time goes, the dream came to me at night, it was like somebody telling 
me that this is your gift. You must carry on. God gave you this to teach and 
lead. And from that day when I wake up, I feel like (his brother's) spirit is 
still with me." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his personal tragedy, Shabalala -- whose brother-in-law is Mangosuthu 
Gatsha Buthelezi, leader of the ANC rival party Inkatha -- and his group remain 
apolitical. 
</P>
<P>
 "We (black South Africans) are recognized now," Shabalala said. "People know 
that this country is for us all, not only for the white people. That is very 
important, but we are still praying to see people coming together . . . we are 
praying for peace." 
</P>
<P>
 His voice heavy with emotion, Shabalala issued a challenge to the world's 
leaders. "Forget about hating each other, forget about colors, forget about 
different languages. Let us try to find the right way to get to the right 
point." 
</P>
<P>
 About his country's troubled past and unclear future, Shabalala said, "The 
simple answer is that we have hope, because we are born with hope. . . ."

 Marvel-ous: Marvel Entertainment Group's super-heroes are getting around these 
days. The "Marvel Action Hour," a new one-hour syndicated series scheduled to 
launch in September, will star the Fantastic Four and Iron Man. Both were 
created by legendary Marvel artist Stan Lee in the 1960s. Lee will serve as the 
program's co-executive producer and host, offering live-action 
behind-the-scenes glances at the Marvel Universe. Meanwhile, Spider-Man is the 
subject of a major feature film and a new network series, and the X-Men will 
premiere their third consecutive season on Fox this fall.

 * It's a Midnight Thing: "The Arsenio Hall Show" is being bumped by KCOP-TV 
Channel 13 from its 11:30 p.m. slot to midnight starting next month, officials 
said. The move apparently was made because of declining ratings for the show, 
which was criticized recently for playing host to Nation of Islam leader Louis 
Farrakhan. KCOP's 11:30 slot will feature reruns of "Night Court" starting 
April 4.

 * Shirley Temple Goes Video: If you want to get an idea of how red Shirley 
Temple's hair really was, FoxVideo will release a collection of the child 
star's movies in color for the first time. "Heidi" (1937), the first of three 
titles in the collection, will be available this spring, followed later by 
"Dimples" (1936) and "Bright Eyes" (1934). "The Shirley Temple Collection" is 
being marketed under the new Fox Family Features banner.

 * Presidential Mom: Emmy-winning actress Rue McClanahan has been hired by 
Simon & Schuster Audio to record Virginia Kelly's autobiography, "Leading With 
My Heart," which will be released in June simultaneously with the book. 
McClanahan was recommended to Simon & Schuster by Kelly's son, President 
Clinton, who said that the former co-star of "The Golden Girls" had been his 
mother's favorite actress. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gray Returns: Fox confirmed Monday that Linda Gray, who starred for 11 years 
as Sue Ellen Ewing on "Dallas," has been signed to head the cast of "Models 
Inc.," a drama series that will be spun off from "Melrose Place" this summer. 
Gray will turn up in four episodes of "Melrose Place" beginning April 27, 
playing the mother of Amanda Woodward (Heather Locklear). Gray's character owns 
a modeling agency in Los Angeles that will be the focus of the new series.

 Schindler's Fallout: Emily Schindler is fed up with Steven Spielberg's epic 
movie about her husband Oskar and said she won't be watching tonight's gala 
opening in Argentina, where she now lives. "I've sat through that film twice 
already. I don't want to see it again," she said Monday, complaining that the 
three-hour movie was too long for someone of her 86 years. Instead, she plans 
to sit in the foyer while Argentine ministers, foreign diplomats and other 
dignitaries watch the film, in which she is a minor character. The movie, 
nominated for 12 Oscars, shows how her husband, a German industrialist, fooled 
the Nazis and saved his 1,200 Jewish workers from death camps. Emily Schindler 
has endorsed the movie, but she shuns the hordes of journalists who have 
tramped through her tiny house outside Buenos Aires, where she has lived with 
the help of the Jewish organization B'nai B'rith since after World War II. "For 
40 years nobody came. Now I can't get away from it," she said.

 * 'The Crow' Flies: "The Crow," the film that martial-arts star Brandon Lee 
was working on at the time of his death, has been picked up for distribution in 
the United States by Miramax/Dimension Films. The company plans to release the 
action movie on May 13 on 1,500 screens. Directed by Alex Proyas and described 
as a "Gothic urban fantasy for the '90s," "The Crow" is based on the comic-book 
series and comic strip by James O'Barr, and features Lee as a dead musician who 
returns to Earth to avenge his murder. Lee, the son of Bruce Lee, was 
accidentally shot to death during the filming of the movie last year. . . . 
Meanwhile, "Wagons East" resumed production in Mexico on Saturday, a day after 
star John Candy died of a heart attack. The producers said that most of his 
scenes already had been filmed. ART

THEATER REVIEW; 'TENDER' '50S TIME CAPSULE GETS TRAPPED IN TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Among the many pleasures of Jack O'Brien's hip and zippy revival of "Damn 
Yankees," now on Broadway after moving from San Diego's Old Globe Theatre, is 
how it embraces the show's 1950s sensibility while exploiting its retro 
funkiness. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien brought "Yankees" back with the awareness that the '50s looks more 
cartoonish every year. But what to do with a revival of Max Shulman's and 
Robert Paul Smith's 1954 "The Tender Trap"?  
</P>
<P>
 Much better known for the greatly altered movie version with Frank Sinatra and 
Debbie Reynolds (and with that inimitable title song), it's a pure '50s view of 
the battle of the sexes, with opposites combatting and attracting. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the kind of play where the women are always "girls," where one girl named 
Sylvia who plays classical violin explains that New York is the only place to 
go for the career-minded, where a girl named Julie explains that a girl's only 
real calling is raising a family. It's the kind of play where an unalterable 
bachelor named Charlie is going to get trapped by a girl like Julie. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if "The Tender Trap" is revivable, it can't be updated to the '90s -- at 
least not the way director Wally Silvers has done it at Costa Mesa Civic 
Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Trap" is firmly stuck in its era: "the Atomic Age," as Julie terms it. But 
Silvers seems to want to run away from it all while, oddly, forgetting to cut 
the anachronisms.  
</P>
<P>
 In other words, this show is throttled in a weird time warp of its own making. 
We see people dressed in contemporary garb and living in a fairly contemporary 
New York apartment (John Brammer's set, though, is too unattractive for a 
bachelor pad), yet they're also talking about finding a cure for the common 
cold or playing with Leonard Bernstein or dating a ton of "girls" at once. It 
doesn't fly, and, because of AIDS alone, "Trap" can't be nudged, pushed or 
cajoled into today.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Shulman's and Smith's belabored action and dialogue certainly would make this 
a tough sit even if it were taken back to its rightful place in the Eisenhower 
Era. 
</P>
<P>
 The play is pretty ludicrous, down to a medical-lab technician (Spencer Fox's 
badly judged Earl) who behaves like Bugsy Siegel's right-hand man. The comedy 
requires -- but never delivers -- the kind of Noel Coward-ly repartee that lets 
you glide over plot stupidities, and seldom has a happy end felt more unearned. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Silvers' cast is stuck in this time-warp effect, a kind of badly 
comedic "Twilight Zone." 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Zeman's Charlie looks and sounds studly enough, but like nearly everyone 
else, his comic timing is always a few ticks off. As Charlie's buddy Joe, Shawn 
Smyth not only doesn't look like the married man he's supposed to look like, he 
comes off as yuppie meat-market material. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not clear what Rachel Kelley intends as Julie, but her flat, grating 
voice alone would be enough for Charlie to immediately show her the door. 
</P>
<P>
 The comedy's most irritating problem is that Charlie shouldn't be trapped by 
Julie, but by smart, grown-up Sylvia, and Judy Dudek Neal's likably 
straightforward Sylvia only drives that point home. 
</P>
<P>
 Neal is the only cast member who makes the anachronisms listenable, although 
Ian Downs' funny cameo as a drunken trombonist has fun with retro style. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Tender Trap" may even be beyond retro, but it's still the only way to 
view it. The sexual wars have changed too much to take this as anything but a 
curio. The real curiosity is why Silvers' production seems so oblivious to the 
obvious.

TV REVIEWS; 'SESAME STREET' JAMS WITH THE BEST OF THEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Yes, there is one TV series that pop acts consider even hepper to land 
themselves a guest spot on than "The Larry Sanders Show." 
</P>
<P>
 For those of us who like watching "Sesame Street" for the music, then, but get 
impatient because we already know how to count, there's sweet relief tonight in 
the form of "Sesame Street Jam: A Musical Celebration," a solid home-taping 
prospect that rounds up a good number of recent celeb song sightings from the 
tyke telecast. 
</P>
<P>
 Best of all is En Vogue's bouncy "Adventure," an actual stab at emulating the 
form of a music video, in which the vocal quartet tells several apocryphal tall 
tales and gives the kids something they can feel -- i.e., fuzz-balls Elmo and 
Ernie. It's as irresistible, in its way, as anything running on MTV; they're as 
swell as big sisters as they are as sex bombs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Less lavishly produced, but also priceless, is Los Lobos' variation on their 
eerie, soothing lullaby "Kiko and the Lavender Moon," recast with Elmo as the 
tune's contented nighttime dreamer, dancing fecklessly on a picket fence. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the more obvious lesson plans, Queen Latifah turns in a charmingly 
spunky hip-hop ode to the letter O, and Maya Angelou pipes up with a way-catchy 
paean to taking pride in one's name. For novelty's sake, there's Marilyn 
Horne's operatically rendered "C is for Cookie" and Little Richard's slightly 
tired "Rubber Ducky." The equally ubiquitous Aaron Neville trades vibratos with 
Ernie. 
</P>
<P>
 The new interstitial material plots Big Bird's search for some "la-la-ers" for 
the special, which finally bears fruit in a climactic deus ex machina 
appearance by South African a cappella troupe Ladysmith Black Mambazo -- a 
fitting end to an hour that draws as avid a parental as juvenile viewership. * 
"Sesame Street Jam: A Musical Celebration" airs at 7:30 tonight on KCET-TV 
Channel 28. CHRIS WILLMAN

TV REVIEWS; MESSAGE CLEAR IN 'DARK AGES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A watchable young cast and an earnest script make a case for sexual abstinence 
among teen-agers in "Love in the Dark Ages," today's installment of the "CBS 
Schoolbreak Special." 
</P>
<P>
 Aspiring artist Jenny (Missy Crider) and swimming star Mart (Tom Everett 
Scott) fall hard for each other.The romance is shattered, however, when Jenny 
learns that Mart has given her a sexually transmitted disease. 
</P>
<P>
 That disillusionment, plus meaningful talks with her supportive mother (Alley 
Mills) and doctor (Sue Bugden), make Jenny decide not to have sex with anyone 
until she has taken time to develop a committed relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Since both Mart and Jenny are obviously "good" kids -- high achievers with 
solid futures ahead of them -- the only villain in Joseph Maurer's script is 
the prevalence of teen promiscuity. 
</P>
<P>
 But mom's line, "When I was young, sex came after commitment," may raise 
eyebrows, since she would have been a teen-ager in the free-wheeling, free-love 
'60s. 
</P>
<P>
 The show, directed by Bradley Wigor, is as short on subtleties as most 
hourlong, issue-oriented afternoon specials, but its how-to demonstrations of 
non-judgmental communication between parent and child are as important as its 
message of sexual responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Love in the Dark Ages" airs at 3 p.m. today on CBS (Channels 2 and 8).

THEATER REVIEW; ACTORS ALLEY'S 'AUDIT': INSIPID MEETING OF THE MINDLESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN BRESLAUER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Actors Alley has had some bum luck lately, what with the quake damage to its 
new home at the El Portal Theater and all. That's why it moved the play that 
would have reopened that landmark venue to Los Angeles Valley College. 
Unfortunately, Peter Lefcourt's "The Audit" just adds to the woes. 
</P>
<P>
 An insipid little comedy about a bickering clan hovering in a New York 
hospital waiting room as the father/husband/son in their lives croaks from a 
coronary offstage, "The Audit" adds up to little more than stereotypical 
characters, pat confrontations and creaky plot mechanisms. 
</P>
<P>
 Myra, a.k.a. ex-wife No. 1 (Joan Benedict), arrives on the scene early. She's 
bitter, surly, uptight and none too happy to see her ex-father-in-law, Sol 
(Elliott Goldwag). Ex-wife No. 2 (Linda Phillips) -- the ditsy 
"bimbo"/"home-wrecker" and erstwhile Playboy pinup -- trots in. Her name is 
Bambi . Need one say more? 
</P>
<P>
 Lenny's kids also show: the resentful gay son Stephen (Joe Garcia) and his 
hostile sister Janey (Karen Reed). Later, the comparatively catatonic Margaret 
(Carolyn Field), who was Lenny's last squeeze, joins the group. 
</P>
<P>
 Add to this meeting of the mindless one surly nurse (Cynthia Newton) and a 
distracted doctor (Gene Freedman) and you've got the setup. Unfortunately, 
you've got nearly the entire play as well, for there's little surprise to come 
from these cardboard figures. 
</P>
<P>
 The recriminations fly throughout Act I, which ends with the announcement that 
Lenny has died. Occasioned by a fantasy "audit" that would give Lenny (Carl 
Strano) one last chance, Act II is told in short flashbacks, as each character 
gets to relive a past incident that shows what a lousy guy Lenny was. 
</P>
<P>
 He cheated on his first wife. He lied to his second. When he took his young 
son out to play ball in the park, he told Stephen that he threw "like a girl." 
And so it goes. Lenny had a litany of bad deeds -- but apparently not an 
original sin, so to speak, among them. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst part about "The Audit" isn't that it bores us with moralistic 
truisms familiar from countless other sentimental plays and TV dramas, but that 
it obscures the talents it does employ. 
</P>
<P>
 The actors are stuck in one-dimensional roles, which means they end up merely 
playing their single notes off against each other. The result is, for the most 
part, simply dissonance. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Goldwag manages to inject a surprising amount of humanity into 
Sol, and Phillips is also convincing. But most of the rest of the players fall 
victim to Lefcourt's unctuous, if light, melodrama. And director Jeremiah 
Morris hasn't thrown them a lifeline. 
</P>

 Consumer Credit Rises Again, but Pace Slows: Consumer credit rose $6 billion 
in January -- the eighth straight increase -- but at a slower pace than in the 
previous month.Borrowing climbed at a 9.1% annual rate -- after rising 11.5% in 
December -- revised from the previously reported 11.2% and a 10.7% rise in 
November, the Federal Reserve Board said. The December increase was $7.5 
billion. The Fed said growth in revolving credit, which includes credit cards, 
accelerated in January, while growth in auto loans and other consumer debt 
slowed.

 Labor, Consumers Join Utilities Against 'Wheeling': Unions, independent power 
producers, consumer activists and environmentalists -- including San 
Francisco-based Toward Utility Rate Normalization and the Natural Resources 
Defense Council -- announced that they oppose any move to deregulate retail 
electricity sales. Wholesale generation is now largely deregulated, but some 
big industrial power users -- including General Motors Corp. -- want to shop 
for electricity outside their local utility's territory, with that utility only 
delivering the power.Consumer activists and the utilities say this could let 
big users "cherry pick" low rates, leaving small businesses and residential 
ratepayers to pay more of their local utilities' fixed costs. Environmentalists 
fear that retail deregulation could reduce utilities' efforts to conserve fuel 
and reduce air pollution. Industrial users say that retail "wheeling" would 
result in lower rates for households as well as their companies.

PEPPERDINE MAKES IT TO NCAA TOURNAMENT BY BEATING SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite Pepperdine's domination of San Diego in recent seasons, the last thing 
Coach Tom Asbury expected Monday night was an easy game. 
</P>
<P>
 He was right. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego gave Pepperdine all it could handle as the Waves rallied from an 
eight-point halftime deficit to gain a 56-53 victory and advance to the NCAA 
tournament for the third time in four seasons by winning the West Coast 
Conference tournament at Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
 The Waves entered the WCC tournament final having won seven in a row and 12 of 
the last 13 meetings against the Toreros, including victories of 10 and 19 
points this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "But that does not amount to anything," Asbury said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Pepperdine had enough in the end. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Jones' close-range basket with 1:42 to play gave the Waves the lead for 
good, 54-53, and Damin Lopez added two free throws with 20 seconds left. San 
Diego guard David Fizdale missed badly on a three-point shot with one second 
left. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones scored 11 of his 17 points in the second half and was selected the 
tournament's most valuable player. The Waves (19-10), gaining their seventh 
consecutive victory, forced several steals in the second half to help turn the 
game around.  
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine took its first lead, 42-41, on a free throw by Jones with 8:17 to 
play, but San Diego (18-11) answered with a three-point play by center Chris 
Grant, and a 7-0 run to lead, 48-42, with a little less than seven minutes 
left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Waves came back to tie the score, 52-52, with a 6-0 run capped by Lopez's 
layup with 3:25 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine's lack of depth was a concern at the outset. The Waves entered the 
tournament in Santa Clara with eight injury-free players and Asbury feared it 
would dwindle to seven because of a slight concussion suffered by starting 
forward LeRoi O'Brien in Sunday's semifinal victory over San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien started and made the Waves' first basket, but it was by no means an 
encouraging beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego led by controlling the middle and strong outside shooting. The 
Toreros outrebounded Pepperdine, 23-18, and made four three-pointers in the 
first half, two by guard Neal Meyer, who had three points in the first two 
tournament games. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine, meanwhile, struggled. The Waves shot 29% in the first half, the 
Toreros 34.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks Barnhard, a 6-foot-9 all-conference forward, had nine points and nine 
rebounds for San Diego. Jones paced Pepperdine with six points. 
</P>
<P>
 WCC Notes 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco guard Gerald Walker underwent surgery Monday to repair ligament 
damage and insert a screw in his right ankle. Walker, who also suffered a 
broken right leg, was injured during Sunday's game against Pepperdine.

NBA ROUNDUP; AGAINST THE HEAT, CELTICS GET HOT AND WIN SECOND IN A ROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Boston's hot and now Miami's not. 
</P>
<P>
 Dee Brown scored six key points in the final two minutes and the Celtics shot 
61% (45 of 74) to defeat the Heat, 112-104, Monday night at Miami and end 
Miami's team-record seven-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 The Celtics gained their second consecutive victory after a franchise-record 
13-game losing streak. They also ended an eight-game road skid. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown scored 21 points. Teammate Sherman Douglas had 20 points and 11 assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami's Grant Long hit 10 of 12 shots and scored 24 points. Rony Seikaly had 
22 points and 14 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Heat lost for only the second time since the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 99, Detroit 85 -- John Starks scored all but two of his 21 points in 
the second half and sparked a 20-0 fourth-quarter run to help the Knicks win at 
Auburn Hills, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pistons, who have lost seven in a row, led 73-57 before going seven 
minutes without scoring to trail, 77-73. 
</P>
<P>
 Starks and Patrick Ewing each scored 21 points for the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
 Portland 137, Golden State 108 -- Clifford Robinson scored 25 points, 17 in 
the first half, at Portland to lead the Trail Blazers to their ninth victory in 
10 games. 
</P>

THE NHL / HELENE ELLIOTT; HIS OFF-ICE BEHAVIOR ONLY ADDS TO GRETZKY'S GREATNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Everyone who has seen Wayne Gretzky has a favorite memory of him, whether it 
is Gretzky slicing through a wall of defenders to score a goal or making one of 
his dead-on pass-outs from behind the net. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps as soon as Wednesday, Gretzky will pass Gordie Howe and become the 
NHL's goal-scoring leader. His hockey feats are incredible. I'll remember some 
of them, but I'll also recall his human side, a man who is afraid of no 
opponent but still fears flying, the man who remained classy in the face of 
great ridicule. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1983 Stanley Cup finals, the New York Islanders, trying to win their 
fourth consecutive Cup, were facing Gretzky's brash, young Edmonton Oilers. 
Islander goalie Billy Smith spent the series jabbing Gretzky with words and 
with his stick, calling him "Whine Gretzky" and claiming Gretzky fell when an 
opponent touched him. He was so bad defensively, Smith said, that "someone 
should take him by the hand and introduce him to his own goaltender." 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky took it all in and said nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Islanders won that series and Smith was voted the most valuable player. 
Afterward, Smith held a news conference. Gretzky stood by the door, awaiting 
his turn at the microphone. Smith never looked at him. But as Smith left the 
room, Gretzky silently stuck out his hand in congratulations. Surprised, Smith 
hesitated, shook it once, and walked on. Class in the face of crass. 
</P>
<P>
 I admired Gretzky then, and learned to like him in May of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers were about to sweep the Boston Bruins and win their second 
consecutive Cup when a power failure at Boston Garden forced suspension of the 
game. That meant a return to Edmonton, a trek everyone dreaded. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers allowed reporters on their plane, affording them a nonstop flight 
and a close look at Gretzky's paralyzing fear of flying. Before the plane took 
off he had turned pale, pacing the aisle and gripping seats. Thinking he might 
relax if he were distracted, I said something to him as he walked by. He 
stopped and after a few minutes, sat down. 
</P>
<P>
 Other reporters drifted over, and we talked about the Oilers, Boston Garden 
and enough other things to keep Gretzky too busy to think about air pockets and 
turbulence. The topics were forgettable, but the experience was memorable 
because that day Gretzky, so incomparably talented and so formidable on the 
ice, showed a weakness that made him a lot like the rest of us. 
</P>
<P>
 Breaking Howe's NHL record of 801 goals is equivalent to Hank Aaron's breaking 
Babe Ruth's record of 714 home runs -- it was unthinkable until someone of his 
genius and skill came along. Someday, a plaque in the Hall of Fame will detail 
his feats. That he is also a decent human being shouldn't be forgotten. CRASH 
LANDING 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Salcer, who pointed out as suspicious some of Alan Eagleson's dealings 
during an unsuccessful 1989 attempt to unseat Eagleson as head of the NHL 
Players Assn., could have been forgiven an "I told you so!" when Eagleson was 
indicted last week on 32 counts of racketeering, fraud and embezzlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Salcer, however, said the news gave him no personal satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're saying everything I knew four years ago, but this wasn't about 
vindication for me," he said. "Throughout the '80s, he was exploiting players. 
We had an executive director who was working for management and representing 
players. I was a player agent, and I felt like I had one hand tied behind my 
back because I got no support from the players' union." 
</P>
<P>
 At his peak, Eagleson represented 150 players and the union besides 
negotiating international deals for the NHL. Players say that he kept parts of 
their pensions and, for keeping salaries low, was allowed to pocket revenue 
from Canada Cup tournaments. He was ousted in 1991 and the FBI began 
investigating him after the Lawrence Eagle-Tribune of Lawrence, Mass., reported 
that he kept as "expenses" 75% of the $24 million he raised from administering 
Canada Cup tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we wanted to achieve in terms of salary increases, we've since basically 
achieved through a natural evolution process," Salcer said. "The only remorse I 
have is for players who were friends during the '80s and never got the money 
they deserved. A guy like Terry Ruskowski, who played 15 years and was the 
captain of six teams, he never got $200,000. A lot of players were stifled 
because of Eagleson." FADING IN FLORIDA 
</P>
<P>
 Making the playoffs was not Bill Torrey's priority for the Florida Panthers 
this season. But after holding an Eastern Conference playoff spot most of the 
way, the club president is finding it painful to watch that berth slip away. 
</P>
<P>
 Until a few weeks ago, the Panthers seemed certain to become the first 
post-1967 expansion team to qualify for postseason play in their debut season. 
Then their longest slump of the season -- five consecutive losses and eight of 
nine before beating Vancouver Monday -- dropped them into ninth place. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're missing four players, and we can't sustain that," Torrey said, alluding 
to injuries suffered by forwards Jesse Belanger, Mike Foligno and Andrei 
Lomakin and defenseman Keith Brown. "One or two you can fluff off, but not 
four. That's the problem with first-year teams. After the first level of 
players, it really drops." 
</P>
<P>
 Torrey so far has resisted panic trades. He won't sacrifice a prime draft pick 
for immediate help. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our objective hasn't changed, and that's to build a foundation for the 
future," said Torrey, who was general manager of the Islanders during their 
four-Cup run. "If we steal a playoff berth, fine, but we've got to build and 
we've got to play the kids. . . . The attitude is very good. That's the thing I 
like best. We're battling and hanging in there. I've never had a better bunch 
of guys." SINGING THE BLUES 
</P>
<P>
 The St. Louis Blues accomplished two objectives in signing holdout Petr Nedved 
to a free-agent offer sheet that will pay him $4.05 million over three years: 
They kept him away from Central Division rivals Chicago and Toronto, who were 
hotly pursuing him, and added depth at center. Vancouver was expected to ask 
for Brendan Shanahan as compensation and the Blues were expected to offer Jeff 
Brown. If they can't agree by today, an arbitrator will determine the 
compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 Shanahan, a 50-goal scorer last season, is too high a price for Nedved, who 
excelled for Canada in the Olympics last month but has only last season's 
38-goal effort with the Canucks to his pro credit. SLAP SHOTS 
</P>
<P>
 Will seeing the Olympic gold medal determined by a shootout sway NHL governors 
to adopt shootouts? "If anything, it'll go the other way," said Jack Ferreira, 
general manager of the Mighty Ducks. "Nobody wants to see the Stanley Cup 
decided that way." Expect shootouts during the season, but not in the playoffs.

<P>
 Cam Neely tied Mario Lemieux in becoming the second-fastest player in NHL 
history to reach the 50-goal mark, leading the Boston Bruins to a 6-3 victory 
over the Washington Capitals Monday night at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Neely scored his league-leading 49th and 50th goals in only his 44th game of 
the season as the Bruins extended their unbeaten streak to seven games at

</P>
<P>
 Wayne Gretzky scored 50 goals in 39 games during the 1981-82 season and 42 
games in 1983-84. Lemieux reached 50 in 44 games during the 1988-89 season. 
</P>

the Red Wings scored the last four goals to win at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis 3, Toronto 2 -- Newcomer Petr Nedved assisted on two of Steve 
Duchesne's three goals as the Blues recorded their first regular-season victory 
in Toronto's Maple Leaf Gardens in more than three years.

<P>
 Quebec 2, New Jersey 2 -- Stephane Richer scored early in the third period to 
rally the Devils to a tie at East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>

 Her name will never appear in the official records, but Marianne DiFabio of 
Washington, Pa., is 1-0 as the Pittsburgh Pirates' manager. 
</P>
<P>
 DiFabio's husband, Bill, a Pittsburgh sportscaster, was the high bidder at a 
charity auction for the right to manage the Pirates for a day in spring 
training. DiFabio knew the ribbing he'd take if he managed himself, so he 
turned the job over to his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Pirate Manager Jim Leyland made out the lineup card and the pitching 
assignments, but allowed her to set the infield, apply the bunt and steal signs 
and position the outfielders. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Marianne's call to bunt the runners along in the ninth inning, setting 
up a game-winning wild pitch in the Pirates' 3-2 exhibition victory over the 
White Sox. 
</P>

<P>
 Add manager: Leyland's appraisal: 
</P>
<P>
 "She ought to be in the highlights on TV. It was her day. She was right on the 
ball. I told her the key to managing is winning the one-run games, and she won 
a one-run game in the bottom of the ninth. I'm just glad I have a three-year 
contract."

LAKERS BREAK THE MILWAUKEE JINX, 106-84; PRO BASKETBALL: THREATT AND SMITH LEAD 
WAY AS LOS ANGELES ENDS A SEVEN-GAME LOSING STREAK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He has a shooter's mentality, which is a nice way of saying that within 20 
feet of the basket even he doesn't know what he's doing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can go one for 10 in a game," Sedale Threatt said, "and in my mind it was 
10 for 10." 
</P>
<P>
 But when Threatt has the shooter's touch to go with the shooter's mentality, 
he's at his most dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 Such has been the case in the seven games since he was moved into the starting 
lineup, and it continued Monday night as he made nine of 16 attempts and scored 
20 points in a 106-84 win over the Milwaukee Bucks in front of 14,978 fans at 
the Bradley Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Threatt could have done more, but came out with 8:57 remaining and the Lakers 
coasting during a fourth quarter in which they led by as many as 27 points. 
That created added opportunity for Tony Smith, the former starter, who 
responded by recording career highs with 25 points and 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers are averaging 102.9 points in their last seven games, an increase 
of about about three per game as they try to avoid a sub-100 season for the 
first time since the team moved to Los Angeles. Threatt's contribution is 
obvious: 20.9 points, 6.3 assists and 55.4% from the field since being 
promoted. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's my game," he said after the Lakers recorded their second-largest 
winning margin of the season. "My shot is there. Van (Nick Van Exel) is doing a 
great job of getting me the ball. All the guys are looking for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Threatt got his shots, but Smith got an opportunity and took it from there. 
After missing his first three attempts, all within a few feet of the basket, he 
recovered to make 11 of 14 the rest of the way, highlighting the return to his 
hometown and his former home court while at Marquette with 19 points in the 
fourth quarter. The 29 minutes was the most he has played in a month and a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "That just made it all the better," said Smith, who went from starting 14 
games in a row to not playing at all the next five and then getting eight 
minutes Saturday at Washington. "I was happy to just get in the game, for Randy 
(Pfund) to give me the opportunity to play. It was extra special to be at home 
and then to play so well." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Pfund: "I believe you've got to give a guy a chance in his hometown." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers had a seven-game losing streak in Milwaukee, including five 
consecutive defeats at the Bradley Center. Pfund used that as motivation. 
</P>
<P>
 It worked so well, with the help of the Bucks and their 25 turnovers, that the 
Lakers built an eight-point lead in the first quarter and went ahead by 11 in 
the second period before turning the game into a blowout after halftime. That 
allowed them to earn a split of the four-game trip, their final extended swing 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just said to them it had been eight years since we won here," Pfund said. 
"We had never won at the Bradley Center. We get a lot of talk of what we aren't 
anymore. I thought this was an opportunity for us to do something our good 
teams didn't do." 
</P>
<P>
 Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Elden Campbell was off to a good start -- 12 points and 10 rebounds by 
halftime -- before a sprained ankle early in the third quarter ended his night 
after 26 minutes. "I did want to keep going," he said, "but it wasn't worth 
taking a risk. I thought it was best for me to come out." . . . The annual trip 
to Milwaukee, which has the largest Serbian population in the United States, is 
always a highlight for Vlade Divac, but especially this year because of his 
part in a fundraiser Sunday that helped raise more than $7,000 for the children 
of all backgrounds in the former Yugoslavia. On Monday night, some fans at the 
Bradley Center held up a Serbian flag as he got a warm ovation. "It's a nice 
feeling," said Divac, who had 10 rebounds and seven points. "Real nice. Like a 
home game."

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE MAJORS; SCIOSCIA'S HOMER HELPS IN A PINCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pinch-hitter Mike Scioscia, the former Dodger veteran, hit a two-run homer in 
the ninth inning, lifting the Texas Rangers over the Boston Red Sox, 4-2, at 
Port Charlotte, Fla. Scioscia, a non-roster catcher bidding for a job as the 
backup to Ivan Rodriguez, homered against Joe Caruso. 
</P>
<P>
 Butch Davis led off the ninth with a single against Chris Howard and, one out 
later, Scioscia had his first home run of the spring.

 The Michael Jordan watch: Jordan was hitless in four at-bats, striking out 
once and hitting three grounders as a Chicago White Sox split squad lost to the 
Pittsburgh Pirates, 3-2. Jordan is now hitless in eight bats in his attempt to 
make the transition from the NBA to the major leagues. He fielded three fly 
balls cleanly in his second start of the exhibition season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel I have to do something better at the plate," Jordan said. "It's just a 
matter of taking it from batting practice to the games. I've been on base. The 
next thing is getting a hit."

 John Kruk, Philadelphia Phillies first baseman, will be sidelined about two 
weeks because of an inflammation in his groin. Kruk, who suffered the injury 
last July when he was hit by a throw to first by reliever Mitch Williams, will 
be examined in Philadelphia today. 
</P>
<P>
 Kruk, an All-Star last season, said the injury caused him steady pain through 
the remainder of last season and throughout the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just tried to ignore it and hope it would go away," Kruk said. "As I got 
down here (Clearwater, Fla.) and started running a lot . . . it got worse and 
worse."

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; WITH NEW FACES, EDMONDS IS OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim Edmonds couldn't wait. This was going to be his year. 
</P>
<P>
 He figured he had nothing left to prove in triple A, having batted .315 last 
season for Vancouver. There was no doubt in his mind he could do the same in 
the big leagues, predicting that one day he could win a batting title. 
</P>
<P>
 "I planned all winter on being be at least the fourth outfielder," Edmonds 
said before the Angels' 9-2 loss Monday to the Colorado Rockies at Tucson. "I 
figured I finally was going to be in the big leagues." 
</P>
<P>
 Edmonds' world came crashing down on Jan. 31, the day the Angels signed Bo 
Jackson and Dwight Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they got Bo, it discouraged me," Edmonds said. "But when they signed 
Dwight Smith, that really got me down. . . . They didn't sign those guys for no 
reason. I know they're not going anywhere, so that leaves me out." 
</P>
<P>
 Edmonds, 23, met with General Manager Bill Bavasi, asking for reassurance that 
he wouldn't be buried in the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was up front with him," Bavasi said. "I told him, 'Hey, I know this isn't 
good for you, but don't let yourself be buried.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Said Edmonds: "I still don't know quite what to expect, but I've learned that 
things can change pretty quickly in this game. Now, it's up to me to force some 
more changes." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Pete Janicki last pitched in a game 11 months ago, but he reminded the Angels 
that it would be foolish for anyone to give up on him. 
</P>
<P>
 Janicki pitched two perfect innings without a a ball leaving the infield in 
the Angels' finest pitching performance of the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what they have planned for me, but everything's going the way I 
hoped," Janicki said. "I don't have very high expectations, I just want to 
pitch the whole season this time." 
</P>
<P>
 Janicki, the club's first-round pick in 1982, suffered a broken right elbow 
last April 12 in his first appearance at Class A Palm Springs and sat out the 
entire season.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Russ Springer gave up seven hits and seven earned runs in his spring-training 
debut. "We're not going to give up on Russ Springer, but he's got to get 
control of his pitches," Manager Buck Rodgers said. "It boils down to the same 
old thing with him, consistency." . . . What does Rodgers think about his 
pitching staff, which has a 9.00 ERA in the first four games? "If we were to 
break camp tomorrow, it would be a real (chore) trying to come up with 10 
pitchers. Our pitching has been pretty bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Center fielder Chad Curtis forgot to take his jersey on the trip, and wound up 
wearing coach Sam Suplizio's No. 52. "I told him he was taking his life in his 
own hands," Suplizio said, "I might have some enemies he doesn't know about." . 
. . Left fielder Eduardo Perez, who underwent arthroscopic surgery on his right 
elbow in October, was scratched from the lineup because of tightness in his 
elbow. . . . Second baseman Kevin Flora skipped the trip because of a strained 
right thigh muscle and infielder Spike Owen has a sore arm that is expected to 
sideline him today. BOB NIGHTENGALE

PARK TAKES A BOW DURING HIS DEBUT; BASEBALL: UNORTHODOX SOUTH KOREAN ROOKIE 
PITCHES THREE SCORELESS INNINGS AGAINST THE METS. HE DRINKS TEA WITH LASORDA 
NIGHTLY.

 He bows to the umpire before he bats and has Mike Piazza considering a Korean 
language course. But the fascination growing about right-handed pitcher Chan Ho 
Park has more to do with his performance on the mound than it does his nightly 
tea session with Manager Tom Lasorda. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first start against another major league team Monday, Park stymied the 
New York Mets with three scoreless innings, giving up one hit and walking one. 
He faced 11 batters, retired six in order and threw 13 consecutive strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a 94-m.p.h. fastball, a hard slider and an unorthodox series of 
deliveries that confused the batters and sometimes even Piazza, Park retired 
seven batters on ground balls.  
</P>
<P>
 "What I wished was to strike them out, but these guys are major league hitters 
and the fastballs I threw they were able to get a bat on," Park, 20, said 
through an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
 Park began the game with a hesitation move at the start of his windup, pausing 
so long that the first batter, Fernando Vina, stepped out of the box in 
bewilderment.  
</P>
<P>
 "I did that to throw the batter's timing off," said Park, who pitched only 
three innings in the Dodgers' 7-1 loss. "I'm used to doing things like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Three times, batters called time and stepped out after Park had begun that 
particular motion. The final time, Lasorda argued unsuccessfully with umpire 
Larry Vanover that the batter had called time out too late.  
</P>
<P>
 "When Tommy came out, I walked up to the mound to talk to Chan Ho, in case he 
was confused about what was going on," Piazza said. "And the Mets were yelling 
things at me, like John Franco yelled, 'Mike, what the hell are you going to 
say to him?' I was laughing. My Korean is a little rusty. But Chan Ho knows a 
lot more English than you would think. And I just told him it was a good pitch, 
don't worry, and throw it again. He understood." 
</P>
<P>
 When Park stepped into the batters' box, he bowed to Vanover, a Korean custom 
and sign of respect. 
</P>
<P>
 "Initially, I thought maybe the umpire thought I was a crazy guy," said Park, 
who walked. Later, Vanover asked Park's interpreter what the bowing was about.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was laughing when Chan Ho did that," Piazza said. "But I don't think Larry 
was laughing. He wasn't in a very good mood." 
</P>
<P>
 In a short time, Park has endeared himself to Dodger players and employees, 
notably Lasorda. Nearly every night after dinner, Lasorda goes to Park's room 
at Dodgertown and they have tea. 
</P>
<P>
 "On his wall in his room is a poster with a runner crossing the finish line 
and it says, 'Because God sees me as a winner, I am,' " Lasorda said. "So Chan 
Ho says to me, 'Because Tommy sees me as a winner, I am.' You have to love this 
guy."

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; CHANGE IN ROTATION HAS GROSS UPSET

 Nothing against Chan Ho Park, but Kevin Gross wasn't happy when the Dodgers 
started Park instead of him Monday in an exhibition against the New York Mets. 
It was Gross' scheduled day to start.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't appreciate not getting to start, that's my job," Gross said after 
following Park and pitching two innings. "Did you see them doing that to Orel 
(Hershiser) or (Tom) Candiotti? They planned this a week ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Gross has been battling slight tendinitis in his right shoulder since the 
winter workouts and pitched batting practice for the first time Saturday. 
Monday's game would have marked his first spring start. 
</P>
<P>
 Gross pitched two innings in the Dodgers 7-1 loss and said his shoulder felt 
good. 
</P>
<P>
 "I held back the first inning, but the second inning I started letting it go a 
little and that's when I started getting hit," he said. "I feel a lot better 
and I am about a week behind where I would usually be right now."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Park's given name is Chan Ho, but in Korean, it is customary to use the 
family's last name first. The Times follows the Korean style throughout the 
paper, but Park said it has caused him some problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people are calling him Mr. Ho," said Don Yi, Park's interpreter. "So he 
asked if the paper would Americanize his name." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Darryl Strawberry worked out Monday and played in the game after having been 
sidelined Sunday because of a stomach virus. . . . Omar Daal took a line drive 
off his wrist hit by coach Burt Hooton during pitching drills and suffered a 
bruise. 
</P>
<P>
 Darren Dreifort did not work out for the second day because of a chest virus. 
. . . The Dodgers received second analyses on the MRI results of pitchers Todd 
Williams and Mike Milchin. Williams, who had 21 saves at triple-A Albuquerque 
last season, has a slight ligament tear in his pitching elbow, and might 
require surgery. Milchin, a non-roster player who appeared to have the most 
promise for the left-handed relief spot, has a slight tear in the muscle of his 
pitching elbow, but is expected to pitch this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Top outfield prospect Roger Cedeno is back in camp after having arthroscopic 
surgery on his knee and is expected to be playing in about a week. . . . Delino 
DeShields' outpatient surgery on his broken cheekbone went well and he is 
expected to be playing in games this weekend. MARYANN HUDSON

COLLEGE DIVISION / ARA NAJARIAN: CHANGING OF THE GUARD FOR WOMEN

<TEXT>
<P>
 The significance might be lost on Cal State San Bernardino, and the innocence 
might be lost for Cal Poly Pomona, but things have changed in California 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. women's basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because San Bernardino (25-3) won the CCAA tournament last weekend to 
become the first team other than Cal Poly Pomona to do so. Pomona won the 
previous nine CCAA tournaments and has had a share in every regular-season 
title since the conference formed in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 How significant was it to San Bernardino? 
</P>
<P>
 "Five more games is what it means," said San Bernardino guard Tammy Beckley. 
"Five more games to win the national championship." 
</P>
<P>
 The Coyotes talk as good a game as they play -- and they have played hard and 
mean the past two seasons.

 A year ago in the CCAA tournament final, their play was so physical and taunts 
so upsetting that Pomona refused to shake their hands after the game. This 
year, there were reports that several of the San Bernardino players sat in the 
stands and taunted Pomona while the Broncos were losing to Dominguez Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 But the rest of the CCAA need not like them to know that they earned their 
title. Coach Luvina Beckley runs a strong program that does not back down from 
any challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, Pomona and San Bernardino tied for the regular season title. 
Pomona lost in the first round of the CCAA tournament to Cal State Dominguez 
Hills -- a team that was 0-30 against the Broncos. San Bernardino won its 
first-round game against UC Riverside and then beat Dominguez Hills Saturday 
night for the title. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory gave the Coyotes an automatic bid to the NCAA Division II playoffs 
that start tonight. By virtue of that automatic bid, San Bernardino will have a 
bye and then play the winner of UC Davis and Pomona, who will play at Pomona at 
7:30 p.m. tonight. 
</P>

 Riverside won the men's CCAA tournament by beating Bakersfield, 73-68, 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Riverside won the regular-season conference title, the Highlanders 
(21-6) were still ranked No. 2 in the NCAA Division II West Region behind 
Bakersfield. So Riverside needed to win the tournament to be guaranteed a spot 
in the NCAA playoffs. As it turned out, both teams will have a first-round bye 
in the NCAA playoffs that start tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Chances are that the teams will meet next Saturday night in the regional final 
at Riverside. Both will play first-round winners on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure that's on everybody's minds," Riverside Coach John Masi said. "But 
we have to win Friday night first. Any time Riverside and Bakersfield play, 
there will be a lot of intensity, but Friday night our motivation will be that 
a loss will eliminate us." 
</P>
<P>
 Bakersfield's higher ranking wasn't too surprising because the Roadrunners had 
a better record (22-6) than Riverside (21-6) and returned all five starters 
from last year's undefeated national championship team.  
</P>
<P>
 But this is a different Bakersfield team, a team that has probably gotten a 
little fat off the success of its program. Last season, all of the breaks went 
the Roadrunners' way; this season, they aren't. The prestige of being national 
champions also has made a bigger target out of Bakersfield.  
</P>
<P>
 Most of all, other teams have done their homework and have been able to slow 
Bakersfield's offense.  
</P>
<P>
 The shadow of last season's 33-0 team is so big that many forget that 22-6 is 
a peak year for most programs. Bakersfield still plays great defense and point 
guard Tyrone Davis still has the ability to take over a game.  
</P>
<P>
 We should see a CCAA rematch Saturday night at the UC Riverside Student 
Recreation Center, where the Highlanders are 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a bit premature to say that we are establishing a home-court 
advantage there after only three games," Masi said. "Don't forget, Bakersfield 
has played three games there, too."  
</P>
<P>
 True, but two were losses to Riverside.

 The Cal Lutheran men's basketball team advanced to the final 16 of the NCAA 
Division III playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 They will play Greensboro College of Pride, N.C., Friday at St. Thomas in St. 
Paul, Minn.  
</P>
<P>
 It is the second time in the past three years that the Kingsmen have advanced 
to the sectionals. Cal Lutheran is 25-2 and ranked first in the NCAA West 
Region. The Kingsmen were also co-champions with Pomona-Pitzer in the Southern 
California Intercollegiate Athletic Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran had a first-round bye and beat UC San Diego, 95-81, in the second 
round. Pomona-Pitzer lost in the first round to UC San Diego, 67-66.

OKENWA, MASTER'S TOP BIOLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It would be unfair to say that Emeka Okenwa of The Master's College wanted to 
win Monday's championship game of the NAIA Far West Region Independents men's 
basketball tournament more than any of his teammates, but no Mustang player was 
more demonstrative on the court. 
</P>
<P>
 And for good reason. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Okenwa who had missed all seven of his free throws in a four-point loss 
to Biola on Feb. 18, but the 6-foot-7, 230-pound center from Owerri, Nigeria, 
redeemed himself in the game at Corcordia University by scoring 22 points and 
making 12 of 13 foul shots to lead Master's to a 93-80 victory over Biola. 
</P>
<P>
 The win was the fourth in a row for the Mustangs (28-4), their 17th in the 
last 18 games, and most importantly, it propelled them into the 32-team NAIA 
Division I tournament for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 The tournament will be held at Oral Roberts University in Tulsa, Okla., from 
March 15-21. The pairings will be released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys and me just wanted to play up to our potential," Okenwa said of 
his animated play. "We wanted to leave everything on the court, If we lost, we 
wanted to make sure that we couldn't have given any more." 
</P>
<P>
 Master's never trailed as the Mustangs hit five of their first seven shots to 
take an 11-4 lead less than three minutes into the game and they extended their 
advantage to 42-32 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Biola (24-10) narrowed its deficit to five points twice in the second half, 
but Master's repelled the Eagles' charge both times. 
</P>
<P>
 Biola trimmed the Mustangs' lead to 56-51 with 12 minutes seconds remaining, 
but Andy Thompson hit a three-point shot and followed that with a layup off a 
steal. Okenwa added a pair of free throws to give Master's a 63-53 lead with 11 
1/2 minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles went on a 9-2 run to narrow their deficit to 70-65 with seven 
minutes to go, but Okenwa hit a shot inside, was fouled and made the free 
throw, and Mike Penberthy drained a three-pointer to give Master's a 76-65 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a huge game for us because I'm going to Oklahoma," Thompson yelled 
above a crowd of well-wishers. "We had one goal and that was to go to Oklahoma 
and we did that." 
</P>
<P>
 Six Master's players scored in double figures. Thompson and Penberthy each had 
16 points, followed by Doug Leaman with 13.

EX-BOXING TRAINER ARCEL DIES AT 94; OBITUARY: HE HANDLED 19 CHAMPIONS, RANGING 
FROM GOLDSTEIN IN 1924 TO HOLMES IN '82. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ray Arcel, who trained 19 boxing champions and worked in fighters' corners 
until he was 82, died Monday at 94. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, Stephanie, said she took him to Beth Israel Medical Center in the 
morning because he was feeling ill, The New York Times reported Tuesday. He 
died there several hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 Arcel started his boxing career as a club fighter in New York and finished it 
as a cornerman for Larry Holmes in his 1982 heavyweight title victory over 
challenger Gerry Cooney. 
</P>
<P>
 Arcel's first world championship as a trainer came in 1924 when Abe Goldstein 
outpointed Joe Lynch for the bantamweight crown. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was great because he and I ran around," Arcel said. "We played together, 
laughed together and wept together." 
</P>
<P>
 In the next decade, Arcel worked with lightweight champion Benny Leonard and 
heavyweight champions Jimmy Braddock and the late Ezzard Charles. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles became one of the most important fighters in Arcel's career -- the 
only one of 14 fighters Arcel sent in to face heavyweight Joe Louis who emerged 
victorious. Charles defeated Louis on Sept. 27, 1950, when Louis was attempting 
a comeback from retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 After training the likes of Barney Ross, Tony Zale, Jackie Kid Berg, Freddie 
Steeler, Ceferino Garcia, Lou Brouillard, Jackie Fields and Sixto Escobar, 
Arcel began a career as a matchmaker and producer for television's "Saturday 
Night Fights" from 1953 until 1955, when the series went off the air after 
Arcel said there was a lack of money and interest. 
</P>
<P>
 He took a 17-year leave from the sport and finally returned at the request of 
Carlos Eleta of Panama to work with Alfonso (Peppermint) Frazier, who won the 
title under Arcel's training from Nicolino Loche on March 10, 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 The relationship between Arcel and Eleta blossomed and the Panamanian used the 
veteran trainer to hone the skills of a young fighter, Roberto Duran, who went 
on to hold titles in four weight classes. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Duran who figured in one of of the most striking moments in Arcel's 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 With 16 seconds left in the eighth round of his WBC welterweight rematch with 
Sugar Ray Leonard, Duran quit. Arcel said at the time he thought the bell had 
rung. Then, he discovered Duran had yelled, " No mas. " 
</P>
<P>
 "He was like my son. I don't think he let me down," Arcel said two years after 
the fight. "I don't blame Duran. Duran was never a quitter. Duran brought glory 
to boxing and glory to Panama. . . . This was one of those things that happen. 
Who knows what happens to a human being from one moment to the next? These 
things are incidents. There is more to life."

GOLF / DAN HAFNER; FINALLY, SIGEL IS A CUT ABOVE THE REST AS A PROFESSIONAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Senior PGA Tour and a challenge issued by Jack Nicklaus have given Jay 
Sigel an opportunity to answer, at least partially, a question that has been 
asked many times. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly two decades, Sigel has been the best amateur golfer in the world -- 
the best according to Lee Trevino "to come down the pike since Bobby Jones." 
</P>
<P>
 A freak accident in 1963, in which his left hand was badly cut, deprived Sigel 
of a chance to make it as a pro golfer in his prime. At the time, his only 
ambition was to join the Tour. Missing his chance for a pro career was a major 
blow, but looking back he sees the injury as a blessing. 
</P>
<P>
 After a long recovery period Sigel became the king of the amateurs, winning 
consecutive U.S. Amateur titles, playing on a record nine Walker Cup teams and 
winning the British Amateur. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, he was low amateur at least once in all the majors that permit 
amateurs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't trade the amateur experience for all the money in the world, " 
said Sigel, who won Sunday at Ojai in only his fourth Senior event. "I'm not 
just talking about the tournaments I won. It's the people I met, the honors and 
a lot of other things. 
</P>
<P>
 "More important, I might never have met my wife nor had a family." 
</P>
<P>
 But always, there was the burning question: Could Sigel have made it against 
the likes of Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer and Gary Player? 
</P>
<P>
 That question can't be answered. But Sigel turned 50 last November and that 
was his chance for at least a shot at pro golf. A talk with Nicklaus gave him 
the final impetus and Sigel went to the senior qualifying school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jack said I had a choice, but he added that I had won all the honors anyone 
could get as an amateur and they could never be taken away," Sigel said. "But 
unless I gave it a try, I would never know if I could make it in the pros. 'You 
have the ability,' Jack said, 'but it's up to you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But his four tournaments as a professional have established Sigel as the 
budding star of the 50-and -older set. 
</P>
<P>
 After serving notice with a first-round 65 in his third event, Sigel hit the 
jackpot Sunday at Ojai.  
</P>
<P>
 In an amazing performance, Sigel set a professional golf record when he came 
from 10 shots down in the final round, shooting an eight-under-par 62, then 
beating Jim Colbert on the fourth hole of a sudden-death playoff and reaching 
his first goal as a pro -- winning a tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 It also meant that he no longer had to wait to find out if he was eligible for 
any given tournament. He is now exempt for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 After a grueling 5 1/2 hours Sunday, Sigel said he figured it would take about 
two days for his amazing feat to sink in. But he already knows for certain he 
made the correct move. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never played in more than 12 tournaments in any year as an amateur," he 
said. "And I never played from October to March. It's meant a change in 
lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't be here if I didn't think I could do well. After three 
tournaments, I already was sure I belonged. I have been well received and 
treated great by the professionals."  
</P>
<P>
 Sigel was attending summer school as a sophomore at Wake Forest, following in 
the footsteps of Arnold Palmer, when the accident occurred. Just a few weeks 
before, he had won the Atlantic Coast Conference championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone went out the door of our fraternity (house) in front of me and I 
reached out to catch the door before it closed," Sigel said. "Instead of 
catching the frame, I rammed my left hand through the glass. The doctor that 
sewed me up quit counting after 70 stitches. He'd reached par. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hand didn't stop hurting for five years and I didn't start playing a good 
game again for 10 years. By that time I had a family and an insurance business. 
It was really a blessing. I probably would have been just another good pro, not 
a great one. And all the amateur honors would never have been mine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a finalist for the Sullivan Award one year and was sitting next to the 
winner, Edwin Moses. He was astounded to learn that I paid all my own golf fees 
and earned only trophies when I won. He wanted to set up a foundation to pay my 
expenses. I finally made him understand that probably the only real amateur 
sport left is amateur golf." 
</P>
<P>
 The hand injury delayed Sigel's golf career a decade. By 1974 he was 
competitive and in 1977 he began his record-breaking Walker Cup tour. In 1982 
he won the U.S. Amateur and repeated the next year to become the dominant 
figure among the non-professionals.

THE PREPS / ERIC SHEPARD: A MATER DEI-CRENSHAW FINAL IS THE ONE MOST FANS WANT 
TO SEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once again, the talk this week is about a possible matchup of Crenshaw and 
Santa Ana Mater Dei in the boys' CIF Southern Regional basketball tournament 
Saturday night at Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The schools have won more games than any others the last 10 years, with six 
State titles between them. This will not be the first meeting between the teams 
and certainly not the last. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw defeated Mater Dei on a buzzer-beater in the regional final last 
year, 63-61. In their previous meeting, the regional final in 1986, Crenshaw 
won an overtime thriller, 59-57. 
</P>
<P>
 Settling those old scores may be a motivating factor for Mater Dei, which 
begins the regional as the top-seeded team in Division I. It is 31-0 and ranked 
No. 1 in the Southland by The Times, No. 2 in the state by Cal-Hi and No. 2 in 
the nation by USA Today. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw, seeded second, is 25-2, having lost only to nationally ranked teams 
during a holiday tournament in South Carolina. The Cougars are No. 2 in the 
Southland, No. 1 in the state and No. 5 in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The rankings make this year's possible matchup the most attractive ever. 
Officials at the CIF are warning fans to buys tickets early, since they will 
probably be scarce by the end of the week. A capacity crowd of 17,000 would set 
a state record. 
</P>
<P>
 If the schools survive the first two rounds of the regional tournament, which 
begins tonight and continues Thursday, the buildup for the championship will be 
immense. 
</P>
<P>
 Is the attention justified? 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly there will be plenty of talent on the court worth watching. Mater 
Dei is young and deep, with senior guard Miles Simon leading the way. Simon 
signed with Arizona last November. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw counters with a squad resembling that of an all-star team. Three of 
its starters, Kristaan Johnson, Tremaine Fowlkes, and Tommie Davis, have 
already received scholarships--to UCLA, Cal and Houston, respectively. The 
Cougars have a deep bench as well, helping the team average an impressive 100.8 
points this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams, however, are not made up of neighborhood kids who grew up in the 
community, dreaming of playing for the school. Instead, they reflect the 
changing priorities of high school sports.  
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei is a Catholic school drawing primarily from Orange County. Many of 
its players are friends from summer all-star teams who want to stay together. 
Others are drawn by the success of the program. Coach Gary McKnight has won 
nine section titles since he took over 12 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei has an advantage over public schools in that it does not have to 
abide by attendance boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 That made it easy for Schea Cotton, the Monarchs' starting guard, when he 
decided to transfer from Bellflower St. John Bosco three weeks into this 
season. To gain eligibility, the Cotton family only had to change residences, 
not move to Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotton, a highly touted freshman, has played a key role in the team's success. 
He scored 25 points in the Monarchs' victory over Huntington Beach Edison in 
the Southern Section Division I-A championship Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 His transfer, however, outraged many, who said it was a case of the rich 
getting richer. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Crenshaw is part of the Los Angeles Unified School District and must 
abide by attendance boundaries, the Cougars also are built primarily on 
transfers. Johnson is from Van Nuys Montclair Prep, Fowlkes from Culver City, 
Davis from Fremont, Reggie McFerren from Gardena Serra and Ronnie Arch from 
Westchester. And there are others. 
</P>
<P>
 The circumstances vary in each case. Davis, for example, was supposed to 
attend Locke but received a special permit to go to Fremont. Last summer, he 
got into trouble at Fremont and got a special permit to move on to Crenshaw. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Mater Dei nor Crenshaw has been punished for any wrongdoing in 
obtaining transfer players, and administrators and coaches at both schools 
maintain that their programs are clean. Section officials acknowledge, however, 
that it is difficult for them to monitor everything. Most policing, they say, 
is up to the individual schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei and Crenshaw continue to win, and winning programs attract quality 
athletes. What all this teaches the players is uncertain, but it probably is 
not the values high school sports are supposed to be about. Sportsmanship, 
winning and losing, responsibility and respect have taken a back seat to 
championships and manipulation. 
</P>
<P>
 If the teams meet as expected Saturday night, the winner will probably go on 
to take the State title. The loser will feel as if the whole season was a 
waste, since many of the players chose their schools with the idea of taking 
home first-place trophies. 
</P>
<P>
 And there is something terribly wrong with that scenario. 
</P>
<P>
 Prep Notes 
</P>
<P>
 There will be six regional basketball finals at Anaheim Arena on Saturday 
beginning with the girls' Division III game at 9:30 a.m. A new game will begin 
every two hours, finishing with the boys' Division I at 7:30. The Division IV 
and V championship games will also be played Saturday at Cal State Dominguez 
Hills. The quadruple-header begins at 2 p.m. with the girls' Division V final.

VALLEY-AREA DIGEST: AGOURA'S SKIERESZ TO SKIP TRACK TO FOCUS ON ACADEMICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amy Skieresz of Agoura High, the two-time state Division I girls' 
cross-country champion, will not run for the Charger track and field team this 
season in order to concentrate on academics. 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura Coach Bill Duley said that Skieresz, a junior, is academically eligible 
to compete, but her grades do not meet her parents' standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always encouraged athletes to get good grades, so it's hard to argue 
with her father's feelings," Duley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Agoura has several talented distance runners, Skieresz' absence will 
hurt the Chargers, especially at the Southern Section championship level. She 
is the defending Division I champion at 1,600 and 3,200 meters. 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura originally finished third behind Long Beach Poly and Long Beach Wilson 
in last year's Division I championships. The Chargers moved into second, 
however, after Long Beach Wilson was forced to forfeit 26 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Skieresz has a personal best of 4 minutes 53.97 seconds in the 1,600 meters. 
She placed third in that event in the 1992 state championships as a freshman 
and was expected to contend for the state title last year before a case of 
mononucleosis forced her to withdraw from the Masters Meet, the Southern 
Section qualifying meet for the state championships. JOHN ORTEGA

COMMUNITY COLLEGE NOTEBOOK / STEVE KRESAL: RANCHO SANTIAGO'S SNEDDON NOT 
PREPARED FOR THIS COACHING MILESTONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Don Sneddon, Rancho Santiago's baseball coach, has built much of his success 
around being prepared for anything his opponents might try. 
</P>
<P>
 His army of assistants often can be seen scouting and re-scouting Orange 
Empire Conference opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 But even Sneddon had no idea that he could have a chance to claim career 
coaching victory No. 400 as soon as Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sneddon, in his 13th season, starts the week with a record of 398-135-1. 
Rancho Santiago, the defending State champion, has won four consecutive 
conference titles and five of the last six. 
</P>
<P>
 "I honestly didn't know about that," Sneddon said when asked about being so 
close to 400 victories. "I'll have to think about that one and come up with 
something good to say." 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago, which has become the dominate team in Orange County in the 
last six years, is off to another strong start. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons (15-2) have won 12 in a row and are 3-0 in conference. Rancho 
Santiago travels to Cypress (12-4, 2-1) today and plays host to Riverside 
(13-2, 3-0) Thursday. Both are 2 p.m. starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago then plays host to Fullerton (7-8-1, 1-3) at noon Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're chugging along," Sneddon said. "But talk to me at the end of the week 
and that will give us some idea of how we stand." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 400 Club: Once Sneddon gets his 400th victory, he will move into some lofty 
company among Orange County baseball coaches. Fred Hoover had a record of 
478-269 in 22 years at Golden West. His teams won seven conference titles and 
finished second seven times. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Mayne had a mark of 400-188 in 15 seasons at Orange Coast. He won six 
conference titles and a State title. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Women's hoop wrap: LeAnn Kazmer of Orange Coast and Michelle Kravik of Golden 
West were selected to the all-state team. Kazmer, a sophomore forward, finished 
a standout career as OCC's all-time rebounder (563) and second in scoring (973 
points). 
</P>
<P>
 Kazmer had 21 points, but the South lost to the North, 93-84, in the State 
all-star game Saturday. She has considerably increased her stock with Division 
I coaches, according to OCC Coach Mike Thornton. 
</P>
<P>
 Kravik, a sophomore forward, scored a game-high 30 points as Golden West beat 
Merritt, 90-79, in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West's Kristin Brun, a sophomore guard, and Cypress' Sara Works, a 
freshman forward, made the All-Southern California team. 
</P>
<P>
 Works set Cypress' single-season scoring record with 650 points. Yolanda 
Hearvey, a sophomore forward, ended her career as Cypress' all-time rebounder 
with 570. 
</P>
<P>
 Works was a curious omission from the all-state team, considering she was 
co-most valuable player of the Orange Empire Conference with Kazmer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No locals: The State men's basketball tournament starts Thursday at UC Irvine 
without an Orange County team to boost attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's last hope -- Saddleback -- lost to Long Beach, 72-66, 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is the way the first round stacks up: West Valley (29-3) against Long 
Beach (29-6) at 2 p.m.; Columbia (31-4) vs. Riverside (31-4) at 4 p.m.; San 
Jose (30-4) vs. Chaffey (31-5) at 6 p.m. and Cosumnes River (22-9) against 
Ventura (34-2) at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's semifinals are at 6 and 8 p.m. and Saturday's title game is at 7:30 
p.m. The all-star game is at 5:30 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Air Johnson: As strange as it might seem, Cypress' Don Johnson was seen 
throwing a paper airplane in the parking lot at Saddleback Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who is stepping down at the end of the school year, was attending 
Saddleback's playoff game with Rio Hondo. Afterward, he and his wife Colette 
were trying out a paper airplane with solid results. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's Colette's design," Don said. "I just made a few adjustments."

UC IRVINE NOTEBOOK / JOHN WEYLER; MIRACLES ASIDE, DRAW COULD LEAD ANTEATERS TO 
BIG WEST FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 UC Irvine in the semifinals of the Big West basketball tournament? The team 
that won only four of 18 regular-season conference games? The group Coach Rod 
Baker describes as "good players who don't do good things?" 
</P>
<P>
 Baker says he is "just dumb enough" to think his team can make it that far and 
beyond, but he isn't the only Big West coach whose intelligence might be 
questioned. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of respect for Irvine," said UC Santa Barbara Coach Jerry Pimm, 
whose Gauchos beat the Anteaters twice by four points, once in overtime. "They 
play good, aggressive defense. I think anybody can win this tournament, and I 
think Irvine is one of those anybodys." 
</P>
<P>
 Pimm's team plays the Anteaters in the first round of the Big West tournament 
at 1 p.m. Thursday, so he might be prone to hyperbole. Winning it all would be 
considered a minor miracle for Irvine. But beating the Gauchos and then 
second-seeded Utah State Friday in the quarterfinals seems feasible, based on 
pretty sound reasoning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think either Santa Barbara or Irvine will have a good chance of beating 
Utah State," Long Beach State Coach Seth Greenberg said. "They've both proven 
they can do it this season." 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters, who can blame lapses of concentration and offensive droughts 
for nearly half of their defeats this season, certainly aren't outclassed in 
matchups with the Gauchos and Aggies. 
</P>
<P>
 At Santa Barbara, the Gauchos needed a three-pointer by Clayton Madden with 30 
seconds remaining in regulation to send the game into overtime. At Irvine, they 
needed Anteater guard Chris Brown to miss a three-pointer with 30 seconds left 
to avert a tie. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters pulled off a rare upset of Utah State in Logan on Jan. 17 and 
then lost to the Aggies in the Bren Center in overtime, 79-77. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've really struggled against Irvine both times we played them," Utah State 
Coach Larry Eustachy said. "The game up here was one of only two conference 
losses we had at home." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, the Anteaters have the talent to compete with both teams. But which 
Irvine team will show up? The inspired bunch of blue-and-gold streaks that 
erased all but two points of a 20-point lead in less than 4 1/2 minutes against 
the Gauchos last Thursday? Or the one that blew a 12-point lead with nine 
minutes to go against Utah State? 
</P>
<P>
 Baker admits he doesn't have a clue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're talented enough (to win the tournament)," Baker said. "And on 
certain nights, we're as good as anyone around. But I've not yet figured out 
the mental makeup of this group." 
</P>
<P>
 He would like to forget the insights he learned Saturday night during the 
course of a 91-72 pasting by Long Beach State. 
</P>
<P>
 "They kicked us up and down the floor, but the real shame is that it seemed 
like nobody, well, not enough guys, anyway, seemed to care," he said. "I mean 
Long Beach played really well, but we could've put up some resistance." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Point breakdown: Baker is faced with a dilemma when deciding who to play at 
point guard. Senior Lloyd Mumford offers the spectacular. Junior Zuri Williams 
brings stability. 
</P>
<P>
 Mumford and Williams are at opposite ends of the offensive scale. Mumford is 
always a threat to drive to the hoop and doesn't shy away from shooting 
outside. Williams seldom does either, although he has been penetrating a bit 
more recently. 
</P>
<P>
 So Baker has to choose between exasperation with Mumford or virtually playing 
four against five when Irvine has the ball because teams sag so far off 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all know that Lloyd is capable of doing both, so he'll get the first 
option to get it done," Baker said. "But if Lloyd gets tired or isn't getting 
it done, then Zuri gives us another look." 
</P>
<P>
 Mumford started Saturday night against Long Beach State, but was back on the 
bench in less than 2 1/2 minutes after a wild, spinning layup attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't what we talked about," Baker said. "We had made some adjustments 
for them and on two straight possessions the guy we made the adjustments for 
was wide open and Lloyd didn't see him." 
</P>
<P>
 Mumford has averaged 8.8 points over the last 10 games. In 10 games previous 
to that, he averaged 17.6. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams has scored more than eight points only once this season and is 
averaging 1.5 points. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wavering Avie: Forward Jermaine Avie is second on the team in minutes played 
and he started the first 23 games of the season. But the junior transfer from 
College of Eastern Utah has been on the bench for the last three tip-offs. 
</P>
<P>
 Avie, who has scored in double figures 10 times, has hit that mark only twice 
in the last 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's feeling sorry for himself a little bit," Baker said. "He just 
needs to go out there and play. He's given us some pretty good minutes lately, 
but LaDay (Smith, who is starting in place of Avie) is giving us some defense 
and rebounding." 
</P>
<P>
 Anteater Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Shaun Battle, who injured his side while diving on the press table 
Saturday night against Long Beach State, did not practice Monday because of 
general soreness. . . . Freshman Laura Monson continues to better her 
personal-best times in the 3,000 meters. She won the event in 9 minutes 53.7 
seconds Saturday during a four-way swim meet with USC, Cal State Northridge and 
Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. Irvine's Todd Coulston won the 3,000 in the men's 
competition. . . . The crew team opened its spring racing season with victories 
in the men's varsity eights, men's varsity fours and the two women's novice 
eights races Saturday in the North Lido Channel. . . . The women's basketball 
team (4-22, 3-15 in conference) will be making its first appearance in the Big 
West Tournament since 1990. The Anteaters failed to qualify the last three 
seasons when only the top eight teams advanced. Irvine plays Cal State 
Fullerton at 8 p.m. tonight.

 Soccer / Forward

 Rubenstein broke her leg in a club game before the prep season, so she was 
sidelined with a cast when she wanted to be helping her teammates add to their 
unbeaten streak.When Rubenstein returned, it took some time to work out her 
rustiness, but in the playoffs she was one of the Vikings more prolific 
producers. Last week, she scored a goal in each of their victories, 3-1 over 
Mater Dei in the Division I semifinals and 3-0 over Palos Verdes Peninsula in 
the title game. Her other playoff goal came with a minute left in a 2-1 victory 
over Dana Hills. Other notables: 
</P>

 * Julie Adams, Cypress, had 21 points and nine rebounds in a 60-51 loss to San 
Bernardino in the Division II-A semifinals.

<P>
 Kohler's business card lists him as vice president of investments and already 
he sees his team paying dividends. In his first year at Laguna Beach, Kohler 
takes over for Donn Munsell, who coached the Artists for two years. Kohler has 
some solid stock in McDonald, a first-team all-league second baseman. McDonald 
hit .374 with two home runs in his junior year and is an all-around athlete who 
makes few fielding errors. Sauers seems to be drawing the most interest, as 
UCLA, Army and Louisville are among the schools looking to invest in his 
services. Sauers was a second-team all-league selection last season after 
hitting .311 with five home runs and 27 runs batted in. Kohler is particularly 
impressed with his young team's attitude and thinks it can improve on its 
fifth-place league standing last year. The Artists have finished with identical 
10-15 overall records the past two years, but lost two more games in league 
last season than in 1992. Look for the Artists to get an immediate test in the 
Pacific Coast League when they open league play at Laguna Hills on March 18 and 
then travel to Trabuco Hills for their next game March 22.

 Seven returning starters make up the core of Trabuco Hills' squad, which 
finished third behind Laguna Hills and Century last season. Brouwer begins his 
third season with the Mustangs and believes his team will be right in the 
middle of the league race. Cervantes is a big, power-hitting first baseman who 
is headed for USC after his all-league junior year. Anderson and Poe also were 
second-team picks. Rechner and Beckham should give the Mustangs one of the 
fastest outfield units in the county. Pitching will be a question mark for 
Trabuco Hills, which lost staff ace Carey Smith to graduation. Sperling and 
Pintsak will have to develop and progress if the Mustangs are going to make a 
run at Laguna Hills. The Mustangs have a difficult nonleague schedule that 
begins with the Newport Elks tournament. Participating in the tournament are 
teams such as Capistrano Valley and Mater Dei. The Mustangs open the tournament 
against Orange, the defending Century League champion. League play begins with 
a trip to Century on March 18.

</P>
<P>
 Deats has inherited a program that can only get better after the Mustangs 
suffered through a winless 1993 league campaign. With few players and even less 
equipment to work with, Deats is optimistic his team can overcome all the 
hurdles and establish a quality program. Deats, a Costa Mesa graduate, is the 
first on-campus coach the program has had in the last 13 years. The lone 
returning starter for the Mustangs is Steck, who is a senior left-handed 
pitcher and first baseman. Returning lettermen Adelmund, Rice and Estrella 
should give Costa Mesa some experience at the infield positions. Chatman and 
Niebling are all-around athletes who played for the Mustangs' football team and 
should give the baseball team some much-needed offensive support and 
base-stealing capabilities. Schroeder is a newcomer to the varsity, but he has 
caught Deats' eye in practice and will take over much of the duty behind the 
plate. Costa Mesa should get an early indication of its abilities when the 
Mustangs participate in the Newport Elks tournament this week. Rivals Trabuco 
Hills and Estancia, which finished third and fourth in the Pacific Coast League 
last year, are also participating.

<P>
 It is safe to say the Hawks, one of the top teams in the county, are 
legitimate candidates to win their sixth league title in a row. Five starting 
pitchers return as well as the Nos. 3, 4 and 5 spots in the batting order. 
Nista is an all-everything preseason pick who hit .455 last year and had 11 
home runs. DeVito is a two-time all-league designated hitter, and Bennett hits 
behind him and was a first-team all-league pick. Johnson, McDermott, Hills, 
Miller and Milo, the lone left-hander, all got starts on the mound for the 
Hawks last season. Also, several younger players have stepped up from the lower 
levels and should push for playing time. Throw in the Hawks' good defense and 
team speed, and this could be Laguna Hills' best team ever.

OUTLOOK 
</P>
<P>
 Century begins its fourth varsity season of baseball competition and the 
Centurions have come a long way in a short period of time. After finishing in 
second place, two games behind Laguna Hills last season, the Centurions have 
enough power to once again nip at the Hawks' heels. First-team all-league 
players Duran and Inocencio return as well as second-team selections Cevallos 
and Ochoa. All four hit better than .300 last season, with Duran leading the 
pack with a .370 average and five home runs. Replacing Pacific Coast League 
player of the year Tommy Reimers will be the biggest test for Century. Andrade 
will be called on to fill his pitching spot and the Centurions will have to 
collectively match his offensive output.

 VIDEO THUMBS UP: Maybe a good omen for this season's California Angels? The 
club walked away with two top 1994 Golden Matrix awards for use of video 
displays during home games -- using that same Sony Jumbotron, now being 
repaired, that got rumbled to death in the recent earthquake. . . . Rod Murray, 
the Angels' entertainment production manager, attributes the winning, dazzling 
displays on the center-field board to improved computer graphics, plus "we like 
to put a lot of high energy into our productions."

 FLUSH WITH SUCCESS: Here is a different kind of award they're boasting about 
in Anaheim: The city has won the top state water conservation award for its 
"Flush for Bucks" plan, persuading residents to buy ultra-low-flush toilets. 
Students at Katella High School made $15 for their school for each toilet 
traded in to be recycled for roadbed materials. That amounted to $9,570. Also, 
the city says this could save 75 million gallons of water over the next 10 
years.

 HAUNTING ART: When political humorist Art Buchwald was stationed at the El 
Toro Marine base as a young man, many evenings were spent in Newport Beach, he 
writes in his new autobiography. But he has a more tragic remembrance of his 
Marine duty here. . . . A fellow Marine crashed his plane, and Buchwald recalls 
standing stunned -- alongside others -- rather than trying to rescue the pilot, 
who later died, from the flaming cockpit. Writes Buchwald: "To this day, I ask 
myself if I committed a cowardly act by standing by."

 BOSNIA-BOUND: Golden West College is promoting the campus's cultural diversity 
with a four-day Festival of Friendship this week. Today, for example, students 
from cultures not usually associated with basketball will play a three-on-three 
tournament in the college gym. And there's a "Different but the Same" panel 
discussion in the Business Building. One major project for the week: Students 
are sending letters giving hope to people in war-torn Bosnia.

 PALOMINO PASSION: The Grammys, exactly one week late, are coming to the 
Valley. Well, at least, one Grammy winner is. Lucinda Williams, the songwriter 
whose bittersweet tune "Passionate Kisses" won song of the year in country 
music, will perform briefly tonight at the Palomino in North Hollywood. . . . 
This will be a homecoming for Williams, who hasn't officially played the club 
in years.

 SILVER LINING: The quake could be the best thing to happen to low-income 
housing in the Valley. Huh? It's simple, according to real estate entrepreneur 
Michael Goodman. He says many buildings abandoned by owners who can't afford 
repairs could be rehabilitated and converted to affordable housing. . . . Times 
staff writer John Johnson interviewed Goodman about how the plan could be 
implemented. (B5)

 TEACHER'S PET: Can you believe the nerve of this creature? Two weeks ago,

 BRAVE BUYERS: Quake or no quake, people are still buying real estate in the 
Valley. Sales of homes and condos in February, in fact, jumped 16% from the 
same month last year, though they did drop 20% from January's pace. Northridge 
and Granada Hills had the deepest decline. . . . Owners also continue to pay a 
lot less, and that isn't likely to change in the near future. See Valley 
Business, Page 5. 
</P>
<P>
 BANKING ON TIME: The units have damage. The tenants have deserted. What's an 
apartment owner to do? Worry, that's what, especially when banks won't delay 
mortgage payments. Some owners get time to repair the buildings hit in the 
quake and some don't. . . . "You can drive yourself crazy thinking about 
different possibilities," one owner said. See Valley Business, Page 3. Michael

COUNSEL ASKS CONGRESS TO AVOID WHITEWATER HEARINGS; ETHICS: FISKE ARGUES THAT 
SUCH SESSIONS WOULD POSE A RISK TO HIS INQUIRY. DEMOCRATS USE HIS PLEA TO BLUNT 
GOP CALLS FOR INVESTIGATIONS ON THE HILL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With pressure mounting for congressional hearings into the Whitewater 
controversy, special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. Monday implored the 
legislative leadership to avoid such sessions because they would "pose a severe 
risk to the integrity" of his inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske argued that Congress would want to interview the same witnesses, running 
the risk of "premature disclosures" and "tailored testimony." He also said that 
congressional grants of immunity to witnesses would seriously undermine his 
efforts to conduct a full and impartial investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats immediately cited the Fiske plea as protection from the rising tide 
of Republican calls for open-ended congressional hearings into the legal and 
financial dealings of President Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton 
in Arkansas and the behavior of the Administration during the current 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 As Congress sparred over the Whitewater investigation, officials at the White 
House narrowed their list of candidates for White House counsel, with Lloyd N. 
Cutler, former counsel to president Jimmy Carter, and Harry C. McPherson Jr., 
who served as counsel to Lyndon B. Johnson, viewed as the leading contenders. A 
final decision is expected as early as today. 
</P>
<P>
 The appointee would replace Bernard Nussbaum, who submitted his resignation 
Saturday after a series of missteps on Whitewater and other matters. 
</P>
<P>
 In another day of furious fallout from the spiraling Whitewater controversy, 
aides throughout the White House complex combed through overflowing trash 
receptacles and computer files in search of material that might be covered 
under a Fiske subpoena. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last week Fiske subpoenaed nine current and one former Administration 
official to produce testimony and records related to several meetings between 
White House and Treasury officials about Whitewater. Acting White House general 
counsel Joel Klein instructed all White House officials to search for papers 
that might fall under the special counsel's order. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton acknowledged Monday that he was informed last October that he and his 
wife were under scrutiny in a federal investigation into the failure of an 
Arkansas savings and loan owned by James B. McDougal, a former business 
partner. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said he knew nothing of meetings between regulators and White House 
aides to discuss the status of the investigation into the failed thrift, 
Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan. 
</P>
<P>
 At an East Room appearance with Georgian leader Eduard A. Shevardnadze that 
was dominated by questions about Whitewater, Clinton insisted that he and Mrs. 
Clinton had done no wrong and repeatedly stressed his intention to cooperate 
fully with the special counsel's investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not covering up or anything; we are opening up. We are disclosing," 
Clinton said. "No one has accused me of any abuse of authority in office. . . . 
There is no credible evidence and no credible charge that I violated any 
criminal or civil federal law." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that comparisons to the Watergate scandal that drove Richard Nixon 
from office are "hysteria" from partisan Republicans. And he pleaded with 
reporters to reduce the intensity of coverage of the spreading scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 The special counsel, in a move that at least indirectly benefits the White 
House, expressed in a letter to congressional leaders his "strong concern" 
about the possibility of hearings on the Whitewater scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 On Capitol Hill, Democratic leaders used the Fiske letter to rebuff 
increasingly strident Republican calls for congressional hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.), chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing 
and Urban Affairs Committee, quickly responded to Fiske's letter, saying that 
his panel would "defer to your investigation" and conduct no hearings on the 
Whitewater scandal while it is under criminal investigation. House Banking, 
Finance and Urban Affairs Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.) gave a similar 
response. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican lawmakers expressed outrage at what they called Democratic efforts 
to stonewall their attempts to conduct their own investigation. Senate Minority 
Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) threatened that Republicans would hold up the 
confirmation of Ricki Tigert, Clinton's nominee to head the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Commission, until Riegle's committee agrees to conduct hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Jim Leach (R-Iowa), ranking minority member of the House Banking 
Committee, said in an interview that, while Fiske's letter "looks thoroughly 
reasonable, its implications are chilling for the constitutionally mandated 
oversight responsibility of Congress and for free speech." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, in a scathing speech on the House floor, Leach questioned Clinton's 
ethical fitness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whitewater is about the arrogance of power, political conflicts of interest 
that are self-evidently unseemly," Leach said, adding that the White House 
handling of the scandal proved that "cover-ups can be as troubling as the 
crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Leach said that the subpoenas issued by Fiske over the weekend showed that the 
focus of the investigation has shifted "from possible illegal acts committed by 
a President prior to taking office to possible illegal actions committed in 
office" and that "obstruction of justice is now clearly at issue."

MICHAEL DEWELL; THEATRICAL PRODUCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael Dewell, Tony Award-winning theatrical producer who co-founded the 
National Repertory Theatre and took classical plays such as "The Seagull" and 
"The Madwoman of Chaillot" from Broadway to stages throughout the United States 
and Canada, has died. He was 63. 
</P>
<P>
 Dewell died Friday at his Los Angeles home of lung cancer, colleagues 
announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1973, backed by his National Repertory Theatre, Dewell also founded the 
short-lived but enthusiastically received Los Angeles Free Shakespeare 
Festival. He produced "As You Like It" at the Pilgrimage Theater with Joan Van 
Ark, Roscoe Lee Brown and John Ritter, and the next year staged productions of 
"Macbeth" and "The Comedy of Errors" in parks across Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Dewell's work with the National Repertory Theatre in the 1960s won him the 
Tony, Broadway's highest accolade, for distinguished contribution to the 
American theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Five of his repertory productions played on Broadway -- "The Crucible," "The 
Seagull," "Tonight at 8:30," "A Touch of the Poet" and "The Imaginary Invalid." 
Others, including "Mary Stuart," "Elizabeth the Queen" and "Ring Around the 
Moon," graced stages in more than 200 cities. 
</P>
<P>
 At the request of then Secretary of the Interior Stuart Udall in 1968, Dewell 
revived the historic Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C., where President 
Abraham Lincoln was fatally shot by actor John Wilkes Booth. Dewell produced 
the all-star CBS special for the reopening and formed a company to perform 
works by Shakespeare and other classic writers. 
</P>
<P>
 Dewell had been based in Los Angeles since that two-year stint in Washington, 
commenting in 1980: "It's nice to feel that if you're going to drop a pebble in 
a pool, you're doing it from the middle and the ripples will go further. Los 
Angeles has the feeling of being a world capital." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the Shakespeare Festival, Dewell founded and served as trustee 
of the Bilingual Foundation of the Arts, which performs throughout the 
Southwest, and established the National Playwrights Award. 
</P>
<P>
 The producer had spent the past few years translating with Carmen Zapata the 
plays of Spanish writer Fredrico Garcia Lorca. Their work on "Yerma" won a 
Dramalogue award for writing in its 1980 Los Angeles production. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in West Haven, Conn., Dewell was educated in literature and fine arts at 
Yale University and the University of London, and also trained at the Royal 
Academy of Dramatic Art. 
</P>
<P>
 He began his career as an actor, but soon became a magazine editor. Still 
interested in theater, he worked nights as a stage manager in Greenwich 
Village. The dual job routine was interrupted by a stint in the Army, where he 
was assigned to television. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being drafted was one of the best things that ever happened to me," he told 
The Times in 1980. "I produced 200 hours of television programming in color, an 
opportunity I'd never have had at age 26 in civilian life. By the time I got 
out, I was an experienced producer." 
</P>
<P>
 The year was 1958, and Dewell went to the National Phoenix Theatre in New York 
where he produced three nationwide touring productions that played 122 cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We broke box office records across the country, and with just one tour 
changed the thinking of a lot of people about classic theater in America," he 
said. "There were no repertory theater movements or regional theaters at that 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 After a summer as executive producer of Boston's American Arts Festival, 
Dewell, with Frances Ann Dougherty, launched the National Repertory Theatre in 
1961. 
</P>
<P>
 Dewell was married to Nina Foch in 1967. The couple divorced last year after a 
separation of more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 He is survived by his sister, Patricia Dewell Wallace of Woodbridge, Conn., 
and three nieces. 
</P>
<P>
 The family has asked that any memorial donations be made to the NRT 
Foundation, P.O. Box 71011, Los Angeles, Calif. 90071.

SENSITIVITY TRAINING IS URGED FOR TRUSTEES; EDUCATION: TEACHERS GROUP WANTS 
OXNARD SCHOOL DISTRICT BOARD TO LEARN ABOUT LATINO CULTURE. SPANISH-LANGUAGE 
INTERPRETER AND A MEDIATOR FOR MEETINGS ARE ALSO RECOMMENDED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Oxnard Elementary School District board should undergo cultural 
sensitivity training and provide a Spanish-language interpreter at its 
meetings, a Latino teachers group said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard chapter of the state Assn. of Mexican American Educators 
recommended in a letter to the school board that each of the five trustees -- 
three of whom are white and two Latina -- attend training sessions about Latino 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
 The educators made a similar recommendation last fall after tensions between 
board members led to public acrimony, but the board took no action. 
</P>
<P>
 And Monday, while most board members said they will consider the suggestions, 
Trustee Jack T. Fowler said Latinos are the ones who need to adjust. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody should be supportive and understanding of other people's culture, 
particularly those who come to the United States," Fowler said. "They should be 
delighted to be in this country and should make an effort to learn our ways." 
</P>
<P>
 A local Latino leader said that Fowler should not quickly dismiss the Latino 
educators' recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we are asking is fairness," said Arturo Hernandez, co-chair of the Latino 
Coalition for Fair Representation. "We need to sit down and learn about each 
other instead of passing judgments." 
</P>
<P>
 The debate Monday was the latest round in an ongoing dispute about whether the 
school board is effectively serving the 13,000-student Oxnard district, Ventura 
County's largest and most heavily Latino. About 80% of students are Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 Tensions between trustees have recently eased, members said. But the Latino 
educators' group said improved communication is still needed. It recommended 
not only a board interpreter and sensitivity training but also that the 
district hire a mediator to help board members work together. 
</P>
<P>
 The board generally agreed Monday that a mediator is probably not necessary. 
And all five members agreed that funds are too tight to provide an interpreter 
at all board meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President James J. Suter said the educators' association has placed a 
log on an old fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "This letter to me is just a way for them to start stirring up stuff again," 
Suter said. "Suddenly, we started getting along wonderfully. We have no need 
for a mediator." 
</P>
<P>
 Fowler said having an interpreter at all meetings would be wasteful. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is too expensive just to have a translator sitting there just in case 
someone who doesn't speak English shows up," Fowler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar to other heavily Latino school district, such as Fillmore and Santa 
Paula, the Oxnard district has a Spanish-speaking interpreter who is available 
for board meetings if the district is notified of the need. 
</P>
<P>
 If someone shows up at a meeting unexpectedly, the board can use its two 
Spanish-speaking members, Supt. Norman R. Brekke said. In addition, Brekke said 
school staff members who speak Spanish often attend board meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 But school board members remained split about the need for sensitivity 
training. 
</P>
<P>
 Suter said he is willing to undergo sensitivity training only if complaining 
Latino educators take it with him. "I don't mind taking sensitivity training if 
the people who wrote the letter take it, too." 
</P>
<P>
 But Trustee Mary Barreto said the board needs to understand the culture of the 
large majority of district students before making decisions that affect them. 
</P>
<P>
 "By sitting on the board you have to want to help children," Barreto said. "We 
should take the responsibility to teach all children well. And to do that 
effectively, we need to understand from where they come."  
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Dorothie Sterling said that she would undergo sensitivity training if 
the board decides there is a need for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "People can always learn from one of those experiences," Sterling said.

VOLUNTEERS FOCUS EFFORTS ON HOSPICE; VENTURA: AFTER FOUR YEARS, WORKERS ARE 
CLOSE TO COMPLETING CHRISTOPHER HOUSE, THE COUNTY'S FIRST LOW-INCOME AIDS 
FACILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 They have given a table here, a chair there, and lots of time and sweat -- 
volunteers and donors offering a hand to complete Ventura County's first home 
for low-income people dying of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, it was a crew from Home Depot on their day off, stripping the 
inside of one of the two cottages that stands in back of Christopher House, the 
renovated Victorian scheduled to open May 1 near downtown Ventura. After 
replacing some fixtures and drywall, the volunteers prepared the yellow-stained 
walls for painting. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been a struggle that has taken four years, organizers say, one that 
would have been impossible without hundreds of volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've kept us going and will keep us going," said Tim Rawle, manager of the 
property. "We've had people dropping off so much furniture that we've been able 
to distribute it outside the home, even furnishing one family's apartment." 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher House was the dream of Christopher Dye, the Ventura County 
resident who helped establish the first AIDS clinic in the county and served 
for two years as president of AIDS Care, a nonprofit organization serving local 
AIDS patients. Dye envisioned an AIDS hospice modeled after one in Santa 
Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990 he succumbed to the disease before he could start the project. Family 
members and local organizers took up Dye's idea, forming the nonprofit 
Christopher House Foundation. After receiving a loan from American Commercial 
Bank and a federal grant of $260,000, they purchased the property on East 
Thompson Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rawle said the need for the home is evidenced by the dozens of people already 
on the waiting list. One of the future tenants has lived in a camper van for 
the last three years, he said. Other future tenants include a family struggling 
to pay their rent. The husband has AIDS, and his wife and young daughter have 
both tested positive for the virus that causes Acquired Immune Deficiency 
Syndrome. They will be among the 12 people who will stay in the house and two 
cottages. 
</P>
<P>
 Too sick to continue working and unable to find affordable housing, many of 
those on the waiting list will probably spend their last days in cheap motel 
rooms provided by the county, or in an expensive hospital bed, Rawle said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the $73-per-day cost per patient at Christopher House versus the 
$1,200 daily cost of hospital treatment is reason alone to support the new 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "With that kind of savings it's hard to see why it isn't encouraged more," he 
said. Martina Rippey, a Ventura County public health nurse who works with AIDS 
patients, said the hospice is urgently needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There should be no reason for people to die alone," she said. "We know with 
Christopher House they're going to live in a supportive, caring environment." 
</P>
<P>
 Since a ceremonial groundbreaking a year ago, Rawle said the Christopher House 
Foundation has been struggling to raise the $225,000 needed for renovations and 
the additional $218,000 it will take annually to run the 24-hour care facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "That pressure is not going to go away," Rawle said, adding that the 
organization hopes to obtain a long-term commitment of corporate sponsorship. 
</P>
<P>
 But the organization has succeeded in raising more than $100,000 with 
everything from garage sales, private donations and a few grants, Rawle said. 
Then there are the legions of volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think many have lost friends, and this is part of the grieving process," 
said Kathy Powell, volunteer coordinator for Christopher House. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell saw her best friend die of AIDS last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get more than you can ever give caring for someone with AIDS," she said. 
"There is such serenity in the end." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 people have contacted Powell in recent months, offering to do 
the cooking, cleaning and landscaping at Christopher House. While she said the 
hospice experience can be positive for volunteers, it can also take an 
emotional toll. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll do extensive interviews just to make sure people know what they're 
getting into," she said. "One woman told me she wanted to start outside the 
house working in the garden and slowly move to chores inside. She wasn't sure 
if she would be ready to see people she cared for die." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fitting insulation along the wall in one of the cottages on Monday, Mike 
Ulrich, a salesman for Home Depot in Thousand Oaks, said he did not mind 
spending his day off working. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have anything better to do," he said. And although he doesn't know 
anybody with AIDS or HIV, he said the small porch he was working on, with its 
windows and abundant sunlight, would make a perfect playroom for children. 
</P>
<P>
 Cecilia Rockey, the Home Depot official who coordinated the volunteers, said 
the idea of helping children prompted the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the only licensed AIDS care facility in the county," Rockey said. 
"When we read that in the paper, we couldn't pass up a chance to get involved." 
FYI 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher House is still in need of concrete or asphalt to pave its 
driveway, and non-perishable food to provide meals for patients. Prospective 
donors or volunteers may call Christopher House at 653-0468.

OFFICIALS CALL BOARD MEETING A MANEUVER TO AVOID PANELS; CAMARILLO: 
SUPERVISORS' PLANNED DISCUSSION OF TWO AIRPORT ISSUES IS CALLED 'END RUN' 
AROUND AVIATION ADVISORY COMMITTEES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Angry Camarillo officials are charging that a special meeting scheduled for 
Thursday on operations at Camarillo Airport represents an "end run" around a 
20-year-old agreement between Ventura County and the city. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the public meeting, called by the Board of Supervisors, 
ignores a long-standing agreement that major issues regarding the airport's 
operation first be considered by the Camarillo Airport Authority and the 
Ventura County Aviation Advisory Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor John K. Flynn scheduled the meeting to discuss two ideas proposed 
by county staff: merging the Department of Airports into the Public Works 
Department, and eliminating the post of county airports administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the supervisors directed staff to cancel interviews with 
applicants for the top airports post, vacant since the departure of Marshall A. 
MacKinen late last year. The airport administrator oversees all operations at 
Camarillo and Oxnard airports. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo City Councilman David M. Smith, who is on the Airport Authority, 
said he thought the supervisors' disregard for the long-kept procedure amounts 
to an "end run" around the Airport Authority and the advisory commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would appear that there was an attempt to slide this past us," Smith said. 
"I expect elected bodies to abide by their agreements. I'm very upset about 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo Mayor Ken Gose -- at the City Council's unanimous direction -- sent 
Board of Supervisors Chairwoman Vicky Howard a letter asking that the meeting 
be postponed and that the notion of doing away with the county airport 
administrator's job be rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 Gose said he believes Flynn did not intend to slight Camarillo officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have to think it's a mistake," Gose said. "I don't think John would 
do something like that purposely." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn, however, said he was unsure of the terms of the agreement between the 
city and the county regarding airport issues and said he will have to check the 
language of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn added that he saw no reason to cancel the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole point is to take a look at these ideas," Flynn said. "After we look 
at them and talk about them, we will of course send them back before the two 
advisory bodies. This was not intended as any kind of method to duck these 
groups." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Maggie Kildee also dismissed the idea that the county was trying to 
avoid the advisory groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just called the meeting so as to discuss the possibilities," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Should the two facilities be merged into the county's Public Works Department, 
between $180,000 and $220,000 would be saved in personnel and overhead costs, 
county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the savings would not alleviate the county's budget crisis: The county is 
forbidden by law to tap into any of the revenues generated by the airports. 
Should the merger idea be approved by the board, Flynn said the county would 
funnel the savings into airport improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 But some observers feel that the proposed merger is a ploy by the county to 
replace airport staff with public works personnel who would be paid from 
airport revenues, thus reducing overall county payroll costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what they're trying to 
do," said Wally Boeck, a member of the Aviation Advisory Commission. "If this 
goes through, you will end up with badly managed airports by people who have 
little experience in aviation." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Public Works Director Arthur Goulet first presented the merger 
proposal in a memo in March, 1993. That document identifies several airport 
staff positions that could be eliminated by the merger. If the county decided 
to eliminate the airport administrator's position alone, officials said the 
savings in salary and benefits would be nearly $90,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting will start at 1 p.m. Thursday in the third-floor conference room 
of the Hall of Administration at the County Government Center in Ventura.

D.A. ACCUSES PRIEST OF LIES, WORD GAMES; TRIAL: PROSECUTION WRAPS UP ITS CASE 
AGAINST FATHER DAVID DEAN PIROLI, CHARGED WITH EMBEZZLING CHURCH COLLECTION 
MONEY. THE JURY IS EXPECTED TO GET THE CASE TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an attempt to persuade a jury that he did not embezzle $60,000 in 
collection money, Father David Dean Piroli has blamed the crime on others, 
played games with words and flat-out lied, a prosecutor argued Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Simi Valley priest has also slipped up on several key points and now 
deserves to be convicted, Deputy Dist. Atty. Mary Peace said. 
</P>
<P>
 Peace's comments came during closing arguments in Piroli's six-week-long trial 
for embezzlement and grand theft. The case is expected to go to the jury today. 
</P>
<P>
 Piroli was arrested May 29, 1992, when police in Hollywood found him and a 
Mexican national, Israel Palacios, sitting in a church-owned Chevrolet with 
$10,000 in small bills, collection envelopes and trace amounts of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 Church officials later found bundles of cash in Piroli's room totaling nearly 
$50,000. The charges stem from his tenure at both St. Peter Claver Church in 
Simi Valley and Sacred Heart Church in Saticoy. 
</P>
<P>
 In his closing arguments, defense attorney Richard J. Beada said the 
prosecutor is the one who has consistently deceived the jury during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Beada noted that Peace had earlier asked Piroli on the witness stand whether 
he smokes crack cocaine. She never presented a shred of evidence to suggest 
that he does, Beada contended. Piroli denied that he smoked crack. 
</P>
<P>
 Beada said Peace lacked evidence to convict his client and is trying to plant 
negative images of Piroli in the minds of the jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no evidence about him using crack, smoking crack," Beada declared, 
angrily. "If there was, you'd be seeing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Piroli faces charges of skimming money during his tenure at both 
parishes, Peace spent nearly her entire three-hour argument on the priest's 
alleged theft of money from St. Peter Claver. 
</P>
<P>
 Peace said collections at the church nearly doubled after Piroli was arrested 
and suspended. In the six months before his arrest, collections stood at 
$13,000, she said. They rose to $25,000 in the six months after he departed, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Peace devoted much of her argument to reiterating testimony that had been 
given by prosecution witnesses. But she also took pains to point out what she 
believes have been major inconsistencies in statements Piroli has made. 
</P>
<P>
 She also noted that a church official at St. Peter Claver had testified to 
seeing Piroli dip his hands into a church collection bag April 26, 1992, take 
out some cash and then put it into a grocery bag. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was arrested a month later, Piroli had a grocery bag with money in the 
back seat of his church-owned car and in the trunk. 
</P>
<P>
 "What a coincidence," Peace remarked. 
</P>
<P>
 Peace also noted that the defendant told authorities upon arrest that he had 
stopped in Hollywood to buy a suitcase at a flea market for Israel Palacios, 
the Mexican national whom he claimed to be taking to the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's very important," Peace said of that statement to police. "That's not 
true." 
</P>
<P>
 Peace said a security guard at a nearby Sears, Roebuck & Co. store saw 
Piroli's Chevrolet Lumina parked near another car and called police because he 
suspected the occupants of the cars were looters. The men in the cars had been 
passing some type of bags back and forth, Peace said. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers who arrived found $934 under a floor mat, much of it in 
denominations of $1 and $5 bills, Peace said. Piroli explained to the officers 
that he had withdrawn the money from the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "In court, he does not give us the same explanation because we have bank 
records," the prosecutor said. Instead, Piroli said on the witness stand that 
the money came from Mass stipends he had saved over the previous six years, 
Peace said. 
</P>
<P>
 Peace said some of the money found in Piroli's room and office at St. Peter 
Claver was folded like an airplane, which is how some of the parish's children 
put money in the collection plates. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no doubt that this is missing collection money," she said.

NEWSPAPER SUBSCRIPTION SALESMAN IS FATALLY SHOT; SANTA PAULA: POLICE STILL HAVE 
NO SUSPECT AND NO APPARENT MOTIVE IN THE SLAYING OF ERIC VELASQUEZ, 21, A LOS 
ANGELES TIMES EMPLOYEE. 
</P>

<P>
 A 21-year-old Ventura newspaper subscription salesman was fatally shot after 
leaving a friend's apartment in Santa Paula early Monday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 An unknown gunman standing in the parking lot felled Eric Velasquez with a 
single shot to the chest and Velasquez died at the scene, said Cmdr. Mark 
Hanson of the Santa Paula Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Monday, police still had no suspect and no apparent motive for the 
slaying. Family and friends of Velasquez described him as devoted to his 
family, his girlfriend, and his work as a subscription salesman for the Los 
Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think whoever did this is sure suffering in some way or another," said 
Susan Ventura, Velasquez's mother. "But it's all over the city -- not just in 
Los Angeles. They can't control the guns."  
</P>
<P>
 Many residents of the apartment complex said they were unaware of the incident 
until police or friends told them later in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bino Barretto, 25, whose unit adjoins the apartment parking lot, heard a 
strange noise outside after midnight. Walking out to the parking lot to see if 
someone had hit his car, he found Velasquez's body lying in the carport and 
called police. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very strange around here," Barretto said. "I've lived here almost a 
year, and it's usually really peaceful around here." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other witnesses at the small apartment complex said the gunman may have been a 
man who was involved in an argument with Velasquez earlier in the evening.  
</P>
<P>
 An 18-year-old woman who lives in the complex but would not give her name said 
Velasquez was visiting her brother, Raymond Baldonado, who lives in a nearby 
unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Baldonado and Velasquez came by her apartment earlier that evening, she said, 
and she saw Velasquez arguing with the friend of a man who lives in the 
apartment complex.  
</P>
<P>
 "Eric said something to one of them like, 'You're the punk that pulled a gun 
on me in Ventura,' " she said. "But the other guy said 'No, you've got the 
wrong person, it wasn't me.' And then they shook hands."  
</P>
<P>
 Velasquez's girlfriend, Alicia Arreloa, 19, said she had heard Velasquez talk 
before of a man threatening him with a gun.  
</P>
<P>
 "About six months or so ago, this guy in Santa Paula got mad at him because he 
was driving too close to him, or something," she said, adding that Velasquez 
had possibly encountered him once more since the incident. "Eric didn't even 
know who he was." 
</P>
<P>
 A student at UC Santa Barbara for one semester, Velasquez dropped out in 
January, 1992, because he and his family could no longer afford the tuition, 
his mother said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he worked from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. every weekday night, walking door to 
door selling subscriptions to The Times. Most months, he was either the top 
salesman in the office or the second from the top, said Doug Menick, 
Velasquez's immediate supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did a good enough job that he didn't need to work more," said Menick. "He 
was an excellent worker and did his job with pride." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Menick, and Velasquez's other friends and relatives, said he was gregarious, 
outgoing and persuasive -- the consummate salesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "He could sell you the shoes off your feet," said his uncle, Andre Archuletta. 
</P>
<P>
 Velasquez, who lived with his parents to save money, baby-sat his 10-year-old 
brother in the afternoons and on the weekends drove to La Puente, where he had 
attended high school, to visit Arreloa. He was returning from La Puente Sunday 
when he stopped off in Santa Paula to see a friend and subsequently got shot, 
his mother said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing stopped him from going to see (Arreloa)," Ventura said. "If he didn't 
get a car, he would take the bus, he loved her so much."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; GUGGENHEIM ENDORSES SCHILLO FOR SUPERVISOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Former state Assembly candidate Alan A. Guggenheim, who had been considering 
running for the Ventura County Board of Supervisors, on Monday instead endorsed 
Thousand Oaks Councilman Frank Schillo in the supervisors' race. 
</P>
<P>
 With Schillo standing by his side at a press conference in front of Thousand 
Oaks' City Hall, Guggenheim said he had decided to bow out for personal and 
business reasons.He also hinted that he may run for City Council in November. 
</P>
<P>
 If Schillo is elected to the Board of Supervisors, Guggenheim said, "that 
means we need to find a good replacement for Frank on the City Council, and I 
will work hard on that, obviously." 
</P>
<P>
 Pressed about a possible council candidacy, Guggenheim said "a lot of people 
who asked me to run for the board have also asked me if I would consider 
running for the City Council, and we need to think about that. I might consider 
it. Obviously today is Frank's day, so let's talk about the board race." 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo is one of four candidates competing for the 2nd District supervisorial 
seat held by Maria VanderKolk, who will not seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 The other candidates are former Ventura County Supervisor Madge L. Schaefer, 
taxpayer advocate H. Jere Robings and attorney Trudi Loh. 
</P>

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: FURTHER STUDY URGED FOR HOSPITAL EXPANSION 
</P>

 A member of the county Public Facilities Corp. called Monday for Ventura's two 
large hospitals to set aside their differences and jointly hire a private 
consultant to study ways to work together to meet the community's health needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Facilities Corp. director Norman Blacher also asked Ventura County officials 
to prepare reports to answer questions raised by Community Memorial Hospital 
about a $38-million outpatient wing and parking garage the county wants to 
build at nearby Ventura County Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Community Memorial told the facilities board in January that 
the new hospital wing is not needed, is too costly and is part of an aggressive 
county plan to compete for private patients and not just treat the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 County hospital officials argue that they need to replace a hodgepodge of 
dilapidated hospital clinics and must act now or miss a chance at a 70% state 
reimbursement for the project. The county also maintains that it has no plan to 
compete for private patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to find out what the real facts are," Blacher said. "That's one of 
the reasons I wanted the answers in writing." 
</P>
<P>
 The Public Facilities Corp. was established by the County Board of Supervisors 
in 1974 as a separate entity to sell bond-like certificates. Its approval is 
required before the county can raise money for improvements at the aging county 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Blacher's recommendation that a consultant be hired to analyze the hospitals' 
common needs must be considered by the Board of Supervisors, according to 
Health Care Agency director Phillipp K. Wessels. 
</P>
<P>
 A second request that the facilities board meet jointly with the supervisors 
to discuss county hospital goals also will go to the Board of Supervisors, he 
said. DARYL KELLEY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: 9 GROUPS RECEIVE $43,000 IN GRANTS

 Nine organizations that provide or help people get health care in Ventura 
County have received $43,000 in grants from the Swift Memorial Health Care 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Recipients include Help of Ojai, which received $6,760 for its low-cost meals 
program for senior citizens, and Ventura County Medical Center, which was 
awarded $7,500 to help pay for a transportable incubator for the neonatal 
intensive care unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our objective is to meet Ventura County's health care needs," said Frank 
Leiblein, president of the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Swift Memorial each year gives out about $150,000 to community groups and 
agencies, Leiblein said. The nonprofit foundation was endowed with money from 
the mid-1980s sale of Channel Islands Hospital, Leiblein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other grant recipients were the Assistance League School of Oxnard, $8,200 for 
playground and therapy equipment for handicapped children; the Channel Islands 
Multiple Sclerosis Society, $2,500 to expand exercise programs; Fillmore Senior 
Center, $2,500 to provide transportation to medical visits for senior citizens; 
Lutheran Social Services, $1,000 to help low-income families pay for 
prescriptions; American Diabetes Assn., $3,000 to help local needy children go 
to camp; Long-Term Care of Ventura County, $5,000 for counseling to families 
that have a relative in a long-term care facility, and Planned Parenthood of 
Ventura County, $7,500 to help pay for a new minority outreach program. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation also gave out six scholarships of $1,000 each for Ventura 
County college students pursuing careers in medicine. BRENDA DAY

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; LIMITING GIFTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Citizens across California can benefit from an Orange County water district 
scandal if Gov. Pete Wilson signs, as he should, a bill expected to land on his 
desk soon. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill would cut from $1,000 to $250 the annual limit on gifts or 
honorariums from any single donor to an elected official or an employee of a 
special district or local government body such as a city council, county board 
or school district.While the ideal limit would be zero, or maybe a cup of 
coffee and a hamburger, the $250 cap is about as good as can be expected now in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Another good provision requires employees or elected directors of special 
districts to list bills totaling more than $100 for meals, lodging, travel 
expenses or other costs if they were reimbursed with taxpayer dollars. That 
will give the public the opportunity to evaluate the spending. 
</P>
<P>
 The impetus for the legislation, sponsored by Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden 
Grove), was the disclosure of lavish expense-account spending by the general 
manager of the Santa Margarita Water District and his assistant. The two, who 
have since resigned, are under investigation for possible violations of laws 
limiting gifts and barring conflicts of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 After its practices were publicized, the water district imposed a virtual ban 
on gifts and required more expense-account disclosure. This is good. But a 
tough law at the state level well might prod special districts, councils and 
boards elsewhere to keep a closer eye on their ethics and their purse strings, 
heading off future scandals.

RALLY IN STOCKS EXTENDED; DOW CLIMBS 23.92 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Market Overview * Stocks ended broadly higher Monday, aided by lower market 
interest rates and news that defense giant Martin Marietta will buy rival 
Grumman. 
</P>
<P>
 * Long-term bond yields initially plummeted as inflation concerns eased, but 
rates rose later in the day in a renewed bout of bearishness. Stocks  
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the higher bond prices and correspondingly lower credit market 
interest rates were driving forces behind the stock market's rally, which 
extended Friday's upward movement. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 23.92 points to 3,856.22 on Big Board 
volume of 285.58 million shares. In the broader market, advancing issues 
outnumbered declining ones about 13 to 7 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, shares were battered by rising interest rates, prompted by the 
Federal Reserve Board's Feb. 4 decision to tighten credit for the first time in 
five years. That decision kicked off a 96-point drop for blue chip issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Stock investors don't like to see interest rates rise because it raises the 
cost of money to companies and makes shares less attractive relative to 
interest-bearing investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks were also encouraged by strong share prices overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankfurt's DAX 30-share average closed up 48.82 points at 2,108.91; London's 
Financial Times 100-share average rose 27.9 points to 3,305.9. However, Tokyo's 
225-share Nikkei average ended down 154.12 points at 19,811.88. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico City's Bolsa index rose 32.37 points to 2,601.89. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Grumman soared 14 1/4 to 54 1/8 on news that it plans to merge with Martin 
Marietta in a $1.9-billion deal. Martin Marietta gained 1 1/4 to 46. 
</P>
<P>
 * Northrop rose 1 3/4 to 41 3/8, E-Systems added 1 3/8 to 44 7/8 and United 
Technologies was up 1 to 68 5/8.  
</P>
<P>
 * USAir Group fell 1 1/4 to 9 after announcing a loss of $200 million in the 
latest quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 * SciMed Life rose 1 1/4 to 37 1/2 after announcing a smaller-than-expected 
settlement of a patent infringement suit against a Pfizer European unit. 
</P>
<P>
 * Unum rose 2 3/4 to 55. The company will be added to the Standard & Poor's 
500 stock index after Thursday's close, replacing Ethyl, which fell 3/8 to 17 
1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other major market indicators, the S&P index rose 2.17 to 466.91, while 
the NYSE's composite index rose 1.37 to 259.07. The Nasdaq composite index rose 
4.50 to 795.05. Other Markets  
</P>
<P>
 Treasury bond prices initially surged Monday as a drop in oil and gold prices 
eased concerns about inflation. But the gains were eroded as investors worried 
about government statistics on wholesale and consumer price inflation, due out 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond market's advance quelled last week's speculation that the Fed might 
move to tighten credit again on Monday, said Lawrence Rice, chief market 
strategist at Josephthal Lyon & Ross. 
</P>
<P>
 The key 30-year bond yield fell to 6.79% from Friday's 6.83%. Its price, which 
moves in the opposite direction, advanced 3/4 point in early trading, but 
closed up only 7/16 point, or $4.38 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the market's retreat from the first big price advance in more 
than a week showed how easily fixed-income investors can turn negative these 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 The worries apparently faded a bit early Monday. Bond prices opened higher 
after gaining ground in overseas trading, which starts earlier than the New 
York session. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other markets: 
</P>
<P>
 * Crude oil futures prices fell sharply on the New York Merc, after a weekend 
meeting of Arab oil producers ended without any agreement on cutting output to 
boost prices. Light, sweet crude oil for April delivery tumbled 47 cents to 
$14.10 a barrel -- the lowest settlement for near-term deliveries since Feb. 
16. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gold prices fell on the New York Comex to $375.90 an ounce, off $1.70 from 
Friday. Silver closed at $5.176 an ounce, off 6.3 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 * The dollar barely budged from its closing levels against major currencies 
last week, as traders stayed on the sidelines in the absence of any influential 
news. The dollar fluctuated in narrow ranges against other currencies in 
extremely light trading Monday.

 Treasury Bill Rates Rise: The Treasury Department sold $12.6 billion of new 
three-month bills at an average discount rate of 3.52%, up from 3.40% last 
week. Another $12.6 billion of new, six-month bills was sold at an average 
discount rate of 3.75%, up from 3.61%.The three-month bill rate was the highest 
since they were sold at 3.59% on June 29, 1992. The six-month bill rate was the 
highest since they averaged 3.77% on June 22, 1992. The new discount rates 
understate the actual return to investors: 3.60% for three-month bills, with a 
$10,000 bill selling for $9,911.00, and 3.88% for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,810.40. The discount rate reflects the price discount received when 
government securities are purchased at less than face value. T-Bill Auction

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: DID FOX JUST MISS THE JOKE ON 'FREAKED'? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Hollywood, it's no accident that "youth market" and "good taste" are rarely 
uttered in the same breath. From "Porky's" to "Animal House" and "Wayne's 
World," successful adolescent movies have been distinguished largely by their 
unrelenting reliance on jock humor. 
</P>
<P>
 But 20th Century Fox may have missed the joke in the case of "Freaked," a 
low-budget comedy about an obnoxious TV actor who gets trapped in a South 
American mutant colony. The filmmakers claim that Fox freaked out at the idea 
of being associated with "Freaked" after Chairman Joe Roth, who championed the 
off-center comedy in the early going, was replaced by Peter Chernin. 
</P>
<P>
 The studio walked away from the movie after limited runs in Los Angeles and 
New York last fall, despite some favorable reviews in both the underground and 
mainstream press. Now it's set for release on video, where films rarely fly 
without benefit of a big-screen buildup. Directors Alex Winter and Tom Stern, 
both 28, who have done everything short of peddling "Freaked" door-to-door, 
insist it could have succeeded if Fox had hung in longer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a masterpiece, but it's a really fun comedy for the youth culture," 
says Winter. "It kicks 'Wayne's World's' butt around the block, as far as I'm 
concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 Fox denies that the change in management had anything to do with its treatment 
of "Freaked." Executive Vice President Tom Sherak, who runs distribution, says 
audiences just didn't go for it. 
</P>
<P>
 But many people still feel Fox missed the chance to snare some change from 
snickering adolescents everywhere. Winter is already known to that audience 
from his co-starring role in the "Bill & Ted" movies. His co-stars in "Freaked" 
include Randy Quaid, Brooke Shields, an unbilled Keanu Reeves and, in the most 
inspired piece of casting, Mr. T as the bearded lady. 
</P>
<P>
 While some reviewers branded it inane, "Freaked" got a respectable notice in 
the New York Times last fall. Several underground publications were even more 
enthusiastic, especially over its sophisticated special effects. And this 
week's Entertainment Weekly gives the upcoming video an A-minus, calling it a 
"deliriously rude comedy." 
</P>
<P>
 Winter and Stern brought "Freaked" to Fox in 1992, before Roth departed for 
Caravan Pictures. The writer-directors say Roth quickly grasped its warped 
point of view. Fox's subsequent investment in the movie was minimal by 
Hollywood standards. It put up roughly half the $10-million production cost for 
domestic rights, with the rest coming from the foreign partners. 
</P>
<P>
 While it would have cost millions more to market the film to a national 
audience, producer Harry Ufland, whose other credits include "Night and the 
City," says the "economics were such that no one could get hurt." Ufland claims 
the film was "totally non-supported." 
</P>
<P>
 Many people in Hollywood believe that Chernin orphaned "Freaked" because of an 
edict passed down by Fox Inc. Chairman Rupert Murdoch to focus on more 
mainstream-style movies. But Sherak says the studio gave "Freaked" every 
possible chance to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The film didn't work," Sherak says. "We tested the film. We showed it to 
audiences. We wanted it to work. But we couldn't get an audience that wanted to 
come." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources say the fate of "Freaked" may have been sealed at a disastrous test 
screening in the San Fernando Valley, where it was trashed by a young audience. 
Winter says the film was seen only in rough form -- which rarely works for 
comedies. Co-director Stern says the crowd was composed of preteens and that 
the film needed a more delicate treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 The test audiences "were expecting 'Bill & Ted 3,' but it required a bit more 
eccentric taste," Stern said. "We knew they would only give us a small release, 
but we didn't know how small. They only made two prints of the film and no 
posters. Public awareness was basically nonexistent." 
</P>
<P>
 Winter and Stern had hoped "Freaked" would launch their feature filmmaking 
careers, after their experimental MTV series, "The Idiot Box." Since fall, 
they've vigilantly campaigned to have it seen -- both by hand-carrying it to 
individual art house theaters around the country and by promoting it to film 
festivals -- with the support of Sherak. 
</P>
<P>
 Their best hope now is that "Freaked" will gain a cult following. Both have 
already moved on to other, separate projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "The saddest thing is the pox that was put on our film, which I consider an 
artistic success," Winter said. "Otherwise, it was the greatest experience of 
my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Stern: "I feel like I'm a piece of steel being hardened by the 
hellacious flames of Hollywood. It's prepared me for my next hellacious 
experience -- which I'm actually already in." 
</P>

 Frans flap: Reports of Frans Afman's absence from this year's American Film 
Market appear to have been greatly exaggerated. After this column reported that 
he was said to be a no-show at last week's gathering, several people have come 
forward to attest to Afman's presence there. 
</P>
<P>
 The explanation seems to be that the colorful Dutch executive kept a lower 
profile this year. Afman, who was known as "the banker to the stars" when he 
worked for Credit Lyonnais, has shifted his operations to Amsterdam, where he 
is focusing on individual projects.

EXECUTIVE SUITE: IT'S OFFICIAL: JON PETERS WILL RETURN TO WARNER BROS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Producer Jon Peters' return to Warner Bros. has happened sooner rather than 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 Warner Chairman Robert A. Daly and President Terry Semel announced Monday that 
Peters has signed an exclusive joint venture agreement to develop movies and 
other projects at the Burbank-based studio. Under the terms of the five-year 
deal, Peters is also expected to bring outside financing to the table. 
</P>
<P>
 Peters co-produced "Batman," Warner's highest-grossing movie of all time, 
before moving to Sony Pictures in 1989. At that time, Sony was forced to pay 
Warner a reported $500 million for hiring Peters and his partner, Peter Guber, 
away while they were still under contract. Sony paid another $200 million for 
the pair's production company, Guber Peters Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Peters spent a stormy two years as co-chairman of Sony Pictures before 
stepping down to take a producing deal on the lot. Speculation that he would 
return to Warner began when Sony let him out of his exclusive deal last month. 
Peters is very close to Semel. He has also told friends that he is anxious to 
return to Warner. Sony is expected to follow through on several Peters 
projects, including "Money Train."

A MAN AND HIS DOG -- AND 4 DAYS BEHIND BARS; COURTS: A TEMPLE CITY MAN IS 
ARRESTED AFTER FAILING TO APPEAR TO ANSWER CITATION FOR NO LICENSE AND RABIES 
INOCULATION FOR HIS PET. JUDGE SAYS HE HAS BEEN FORCED TO ADOPT A GET-TOUGH 
POLICY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Temple City pet owner who had forgotten to license his dog spent more than 
four days behind bars -- a casualty, authorities said Monday, of a patchwork of 
competing seat-of-the-pants policies that have cropped up amid the struggle to 
balance a lack of jail space with the political mandate to get tough on crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert C. Lewis, a 52-year-old equipment courier who was cited by a dogcatcher 
in September after his dog, Samantha, chased a cat into the street, was 
scheduled to be released late Monday night from Men's Central Jail, where he 
had spent the weekend, sheriff's officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities confirmed that Lewis had been behind bars since Thursday, when 
Glendora police arrested him on a no-bail misdemeanor warrant issued by 
Alhambra Municipal Judge Michael Kanner after Lewis failed to answer his 
citation in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Kanner dismissed the charges Monday after Lewis produced paperwork showing 
that he had gotten his Labrador-shepherd mix licensed and inoculated for rabies 
the day after the dogcatcher had cited him. But the judge said the no-bail 
warrant -- while regrettable -- had been part of a blanket policy he has been 
forced to adopt in an effort to close loopholes in a system that has allowed 
more serious misdemeanor offenders to ditch court. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis could not be reached for comment late Monday because he was being 
processed out of jail. But his daughter said the episode has pushed him "to the 
boiling point, and with good reason." 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, the humiliation," said Jackie Lewis, 24, of San Dimas. "There he was 
in court, in one of those little blue jumpsuits. It was sad. He didn't belong 
there. He looked at me and tried to wave, but, well, you know." 
</P>
<P>
 Kanner said Lewis was an unfortunate victim of the policy he felt forced to 
initiate after the Sheriff's Department began automatically releasing certain 
misdemeanor suspects in an effort to keep from illegally overcrowding the 
county's jails. 
</P>
<P>
 The "citation release program," which allows suspect to go free on a promise 
to appear later in court, applies only to misdemeanor offenders arrested on 
warrants of less than $2,500 or given bail of less than $12,499 -- who are, in 
other words, not considered risky or dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 But the judge said that over time the policy had allowed so many troublesome 
offenders to skip court dates with him that "after being burned over and over 
again (I) said no bail" to everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, on Sept. 20, when Lewis failed to appear on charges of failing 
to license his dog and to have it inoculated for rabies -- both misdemeanors -- 
he was slapped with the same treatment that all defendants can expect in 
Kanner's court -- a no-bail warrant was issued for his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis' daughter said her father had believed that he had taken care of the 
matter the day after the citation was issued, when he finally managed to corral 
8-year-old Samantha and drive her to the local Humane Society for a rabies 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
 The family had known they had to get Samantha a license, she said, but had 
never gotten around to it. Besides, she said, the dog tunneled under the 
back-yard fence about twice a week to chase cats, and no one in the 
neighborhood had ever complained. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, you know -- she'd get tired, and the cats would sit on the wall and 
tease her, and she'd dig her way out, the way dogs do," Lewis said. "Well, one 
day the dogcatcher saw her and she saw him and he got to my father before she 
could get back into the back yard. And the dogcatcher said, 'Is she licensed?' 
And my dad said, 'No.' And he said, 'Does she have a rabies vaccine?' And my 
dad said, 'No.' And he said, 'Well, I have to cite you for it.' 
</P>
<P>
 "And that's how it all began." 
</P>
<P>
 After her father got the dog vaccinated and licensed, Lewis said, the family 
forgot about the whole thing. Then on Thursday night, she said, her father's 
truck was spotted in a park-and-ride lot by Glendora police who checked his 
license plate on a whim and saw the warrant. 
</P>
<P>
 "He spent the night in Glendora City Jail, and on Friday they took him to 
Citrus (Municipal) Court," Lewis said. "But for some reason, they had it wrong 
and the case had to be transferred to Alhambra. Meanwhile, he had no idea what 
he was being held for." 
</P>
<P>
 She said officials offered to release her father if he would sign an agreement 
promising to appear in court Monday, but by that time, he was so furious and 
confused that he refused to sign anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next thing he knew, they were taking him to the L.A. County Jail," Lewis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Frantically, the family tried to get information about their father's arrest, 
she said, but his phone calls from jail kept missing them and their phone calls 
were greeted with a report from jail officials that Lewis had been moved to the 
medical ward so he could be kept safe from violent inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, she said, her father managed to contact lawyer Thomas Thaxter, a 
family friend, and Thaxter relayed the news that Lewis was angry but safe and 
was scheduled to appear in Kanner's courtroom Monday morning. Even with the 
dismissal of the charges, his family was unable to talk to him -- and had not 
reached him by late Monday evening because of the vagaries and delays inherent 
in inmate processing. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is terrible," Thaxter said about 10 p.m. Monday. "This is beyond all 
reasonableness -- and all unreasonableness." 
</P>
<P>
 Kanner said it was regrettable that Lewis had gotten such a stiff punishment 
for a minor offense, calling the case "one of the more grotesque examples" of 
the criminal justice system's problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "But this is just the tip of the iceberg," Kanner said. "This situation has 
created an uneasy pact: Judges understand that the Sheriff's Department has a 
definite problem, but a judge represents the people who elect him or her. And 
the people who keep me in office expect that people who violate the laws will 
be punished. And I can't punish anybody who isn't brought before me."

2 FEARED KILLED IN FLASH FLOOD; WEATHER: A MAN AND HIS 9-YEAR-OLD SON 
APPARENTLY WERE SWEPT DOWN A CANYON ABOVE SIERRA MADRE. A SECOND DAY OF STORMS 
BRINGS LIGHTNING AND HAIL TO SOUTHLAND.

<P>
 A Sierra Madre man and his 9-year-old son were missing and feared dead Monday 
after a flash flood apparently swept them down Bailey Canyon above their home 
on Sunday and buried them in the muddy depths of a catch basin. 
</P>
<P>
 The search for John Henderson, 34, and his son Matthew continued into the 
night Monday after more downpours struck Southern California at sunset, pelting 
Los Angeles with marble-sized hail and snarling homebound commuter traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 A lightning strike in South-Central Los Angeles knocked out power to the Metro 
Blue Line on Monday evening, interrupting rail traffic and temporarily 
stranding commuters. About 5,000 Los Angeles homes lost electrical service 
temporarily because of lightning strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Flash flood warnings were issued about 5 p.m. Monday for many of the 
communities below hillsides stripped of trees, brush and grass during last 
fall's devastating brush fires. The only place where damage was reported was 
the San Bernardino County town of Mentone, where about 50 homes were invaded by 
water and mud. 
</P>
<P>
 Rescuers with search dogs dug through the muck in the Bailey Canyon Wilderness 
Park catch basin Monday, but they held out little hope of finding the missing 
father and son alive after digging the boy's shoe out from under seven feet of 
mud and water. 
</P>
<P>
 Henderson and his son were hiking with several dozen others Sunday afternoon 
when thunderstorms began raking the fire-scarred highlands above them. 
</P>
<P>
 Runoff coursed down the eroding slopes, building swiftly into a torrent that 
plummeted through the canyon, uprooting trees, unearthing large boulders and 
smashing a small bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 The hikers said they heard a terrible rumbling as the flash flood approached. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no stream at all, maybe a half-inch of water, and then this wall of 
water came down that you would not believe," said Neill Southwick, 52, a 
retired mail carrier. "It was like a dam breaking." 
</P>
<P>
 Southwick said he scrambled up the canyon wall, but others were caught in the 
rising flood, the water clutching at their drenched clothing and threatening to 
pull them under. Moments later, the fury of the flood had passed and the 
torrent slowed, first to a stream and then to a trickle. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight of the hikers found themselves stranded on ledges and had to be plucked 
to safety by helicopter, but most of the others walked out . 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed for awhile that everyone had made it to safety. It was not until the 
rest of the hikers had left that rescuers noticed a lone car sitting empty in a 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Sierra Madre police traced the plates on the red Honda Civic and discovered it 
was Henderson's. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sierra Madre Search and Rescue Team, along with canine units from the Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department and personnel from the Sierra Madre Police 
Department, searched all night and much of Monday before turning up the boy's 
shoe, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shoe was found about five feet from the bottom of the catch basin, 
officials said. The thunderstorms late Monday set off more mudslides that added 
another seven feet of mud to the catch basin by Monday night, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 The search was scaled back at nightfall, but workers from the Los Angeles 
County Public Works Department brought in backhoes and bulldozers to continue 
digging through the catch basin after dark. 
</P>
<P>
 The thunderstorms Monday evening were largely unexpected. Curtiss Brack, a 
meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., said a storm system was supposed to tiptoe 
out of the state during the day without causing much fuss. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead, the storm system just slowed down and decided to sit still for a 
while," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hail was reported throughout Los Angeles, and the Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority said a lightning strike near the Florence Avenue station knocked out 
power along a four-mile stretch of the Blue Line. Thirty-six buses ferried 
passengers around the blacked-out section of the line. Delays of up to 45 
minutes were reported. Trains were expected to be back in operation by this 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Brack said skies should be mostly clear for the rest of the week, with warmer 
temperatures. He said rain is not expected again until next Monday, at the 
earliest.

POLICE KILLER MAY BE TIED TO ROBBERY; CRIME: INVESTIGATORS ARE TRYING TO 
DETERMINE IF DAVID FUKUTO, THE GUNMAN IN THE FATAL SHOOTING OF TWO OFFICERS, 
ALSO HELD UP FIVE PEOPLE LAST YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 A photograph taken by an automated teller machine camera provides more 
evidence of what investigators believe is a possible link between the gunman 
who killed two police officers at a Holiday Inn in Torrance last month and an 
armed robbery last year at a real estate office in Gardena. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardena Police Lt. David Morgan said Monday that Torrance detectives have 
notified his department they are attempting to determine whether David Fukuto 
-- slain after the hotel attack that claimed the lives of two Rancho Palos 
Verdes officers -- is the same man who burst into a real estate office in June 
and robbed five people at gunpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 In both cases, witnesses say, the gunman announced a holdup, wore military 
clothing, hid his face behind dark netting, brandished an automatic rifle and 
carried a bag filled with flexible plastic handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you look at both cases, there are similarities," Morgan said. Police 
declined to elaborate Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Akira Tabata, 45, an electronics engineer from Gardena, said Monday that 
Redondo Beach Police Detective Phil Keenan told him that Tabata's driver's 
license -- stolen during the robbery at the C & C Real Estate office in Gardena 
-- was found in Fukuto's home shortly after his death during a struggle with 
police after the killings in the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 "The policeman said it was very important," Tabata added. 
</P>
<P>
 Tabata said his ATM card also was taken in the real estate office holdup June 
11, 1993. He said he later was told by Union Bank officials that the stolen 
card had been used at an ATM machine at the bank's branch in Gardena a few 
minutes after the robbery at the real estate office. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bank said they had a picture of the man who had taken my card, and they 
said he looked Oriental," Tabata said. "They sent me a fax of the picture to 
see if I knew the man, but I didn't know him." 
</P>
<P>
 Tabata said that was the last he heard of the robbery until he received the 
call from Keenan about 10 days ago, and Keenan told him his stolen driver's 
license had been recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 "He asked me if I knew David Fukuto," Tabata said. "I told him no." 
</P>
<P>
 Tabata said he, three other men and a woman were studying Chinese astrology in 
a class at the real estate office in June when a man appeared at the open door 
brandishing a machine gun. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was wearing Army clothes and he had a dark net masking his face," Tabata 
said. "When we realized it wasn't a joke, we put our hands up.  
</P>
<P>
 "He told us to put our belongings on the table -- our wallets and a handbag -- 
and then he moved us to the back of the room. He had these plastic handcuffs 
with him, and he made us put them on each other.  
</P>
<P>
 "He asked me for my PIN number (the personal identification number needed to 
activate an ATM card), " Tabata said. "He told me: 'I have your driver's 
license, and if you lie, I can find you.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I gave him the right number," Tabata said. 
</P>
<P>
 The robber later took $600, using the ATM card for transactions at the Union 
Bank branch and another bank, Tabata said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He said that because of the mask, he is unable to describe the features of the 
man who robbed him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was small, 5-2 or 5-3," Tabata said. "He spoke English clearly, with an 
American accent." 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses of the shooting that claimed the lives of Sgt. Vernon Thomas 
Vanderpool, 57, and Capt. Michael Tracy, 50, described Fukuto as about the same 
height. They said Fukuto, who was born in this country, spoke clearly.

CITIZEN CRIME FIGHTER'S VAN NUYS HEADQUARTERS RUNS AFOUL OF POLICE; LAW 
ENFORCEMENT: HOLDING FORTH FROM A DOUGHNUT SHOP, MARY LOU HOLTE SAYS SHE SPOTS 
AND REPORTS EVILDOERS. BUT OFFICERS SAY THE PLACE ATTRACTS UNDESIRABLES AND 
THEY WANT ITS HOURS CURTAILED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Working out of a doughnut shop in a crime-plagued neighborhood in Van Nuys, 
Mary Lou Holte has been acclaimed by Barbara Walters, Larry King and the Wall 
Street Journal as a force for good, a citizen crime buster who stands up to 
street thieves and prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
 But Holte now finds that the Los Angeles Police Department has called the shop 
a magnet for crime, branded it a public nuisance and asked that its operations 
be sharply restricted. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting at the request of police and neighbors, a city zoning official on 
Monday decided to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
 Holte, who has made the doughnut shop her base of operations for street 
patrols for five years, said rivals are trying to "blow me away from the 
corner." 
</P>
<P>
 "Why don't we just take Mary Lou and shoot her down?" Holte said. "They're 
trying to do this just to get me away." 
</P>
<P>
 It's nothing personal, said Capt. James McMurray. Police have pursued similar 
actions against dozens of businesses, and McMurray said the primary concern 
remains the presence of suspected criminals and prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "She talks to them," said McMurray, who commands the Van Nuys station. "It's 
like she's gathering intelligence, but it's certainly not like she's driving 
them away." 
</P>
<P>
 The shop provides "the same haven for the street people that are preying on 
the citizens of the neighborhood," McMurray said. "If a prostitute sees a cop 
coming, she runs in and buys a cup of coffee and a doughnut. That makes it kind 
of hard to remove them from the road." 
</P>
<P>
 Police and neighbors have filed complaints about the Sepulveda Boulevard shop, 
Orville's Originals, along with California Coin Laundry, located in the same 
mini-mall. McMurray said he wants city zoning officials to implement the same 
restrictions imposed against a convenience market in the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, the city forced the convenience store to cut back its 24-hour 
schedule to 6 a.m. to 1 a.m. on weekdays and Saturdays, and to close at 
midnight on Sundays. The store also was forced to hire a night security guard. 
</P>
<P>
 The desire to restrict hours at the doughnut shop has puzzled Ulysses 
Contedor, owner of the shop for five years. Holte has no financial connection 
with the shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prostitutes come into my store for doughnuts, coffee, but never do their job 
here," he said. "For me, this place is as safe as any place in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Contedor also blamed Holte for his troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's not good for me," Contedor said. "Before she came here, I had no 
problems. The city did not say, 'I want to cut the hours at your store.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Holte, 45, began her crusade against street crime after she was nearly raped 
while walking home from Valley College. When she is not walking Sepulveda with 
her flashlight and note pad in search of suspected criminal activity, Holte 
spends her time looking for trouble from the doughnut shop. 
</P>
<P>
 She reports the license plate numbers of suspected criminals, confronts those 
she suspects of illegal activity and occasionally calls police for help from 
the doughnut shop. She made one citizen's arrest at the shop. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Holte has been hailed in the national news media for her 
crime-fighting exploits. Barbara Walters lauded her as a "fantastic . . . 
one-woman vigilance team" on ABC-TV's "20/20," and the Wall Street Journal 
called her "the vigilante of Van Nuys." She was featured on the nationally 
syndicated "Jerry Springer Show" in Chicago, has done numerous radio 
interviews, and received the "Doberman Award" from a lock manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The media made Mary Lou," Contedor said. "She comes in, but she doesn't have 
any power." 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, says Holte. She claims to have talked several prostitutes out of their 
line of work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have definitely helped the police clean up a lot of the crime," Holte said. 
"When I go into the doughnut shop, they clear out. (The criminals) know 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 McMurray acknowledges that Holte has occasionally been a valuable tipster. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Holte said McMurray is biased because of her criticisms of the 
police in the media and her complaints that residents are "jealous" of her 
recent fame. The problem, she says, is that the alcohol sales in the mini-mall 
are still luring undesirables. At the same time, she says police are 
unresponsive to her calls. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot tell you how many times we have called the police and they have not 
showed up," Holte said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Holte's crime-fighting calls for help may come back to haunt her. 
Horace Tramel, associate city zoning administrator, said Monday he will 
investigate the number of calls for help from the doughnut shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "The volume of police response is an indication of the problem," Tramel said. 
Holte does not plan to go anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody is going to intimidate me and nobody is going to control me and I'm 
not going to stop what I'm doing," said Holte. "You don't get the awards and 
you don't get the national attention if you've done something wrong."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; HIGH 
SCHOOL CAREER ACADEMY TO BE BUILT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Unified School District announced plans Monday for its first 
career academy high school to be built on a 24-acre site near Downtown, to 
serve 2,000 students who now are bused across town. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt.Sid Thompson called the $50-million campus "the most significant 
education enterprise" in the last 20 years. As well as offering basic high 
school courses, the school will provide specialized training and 
apprenticeships in the public and social service, business and health service 
fields. 
</P>
<P>
 The new campus, scheduled to open in about four years, will relieve severe 
overcrowding at 4,000-student Belmont High School, the largest high school in 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The district also will negotiate to build low-income housing and a small 
shopping center on a portion of the land at Temple Street and Beaudry Avenue.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; EX-WIFE 
SUES AXL ROSE, ALLEGING YEARS OF ABUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Axl Rose's ex-wife sued the lead singer of the rock group Guns N' Roses in Los 
Angeles on Monday for assault and battery, sexual battery, false imprisonment 
and intentional infliction of emotional distress. 
</P>
<P>
 Erin Everly's Superior Court suit charges that Rose repeatedly beat Everly 
throughout their four-year relationship by punching, slapping, shoving and 
kicking her.The suit also says that Rose spit on Everly, hit her with "foreign 
objects" and dragged her by the hair. 
</P>
<P>
 Everly is seeking payment for injuries, pain and suffering and unspecified 
punitive damages. Rene Tatro, Everly's attorney, said she is considering asking 
the Los Angeles County district attorney's office to examine the complaint for 
possible criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for Rose said she could not comment because she had not seen the 
lawsuit.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LAKE LOS ANGELES; TESTS 
URGED FOR STUDENTS POKED WITH NEEDLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Twenty-one middle school students who were poked with a needle brought to 
campus by a classmate should be tested for hepatitis, school officials have 
recommended. 
</P>
<P>
 In what Principal Greg Gerard called a bizarre incident, a student took blood 
test needles belonging to her diabetic grandmother to Challenger Middle School 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Some students were poked with the needles, some several times either by choice 
or maliciously, officials said. The student who brought the needles to school 
handed them to a classmate, who then poked other students with them, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some kids were being poked, some were saying, 'Poke me again,' " said Gerard. 
At least two students at the 675-student school, which serves grades six 
through eight, may be expelled as a result of the incident. Gerard said two 
students were suspended and face an expulsion hearing March 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerard doubts that the students realized the danger involved. "I don't think 
they saw it is being anything serious or malicious. A typical kid thing, 
perhaps. I don't think there was any intent to create a health problem."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; 'LORD 
PETER THE CHEATER' SENTENCED IN ART CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A shop clerk who once posed as a smooth-talking British lord failed Monday to 
talk himself out of an American prison term on a stolen painting charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Crutcher Jr.-- whose antics in London earned him the tabloid nickname 
"Lord Peter the Cheater" -- was sentenced in federal court to a year in custody 
despite his plea that he is a changed man. 
</P>
<P>
 Crutcher, 45, admitted in January that he tried last year to sell a 
350-year-old work by Flemish master David Teniers the Younger that had been 
stolen in 1987 from a London gallery. His admission came as part of a plea 
bargain agreement with federal prosecutors after two Los Angeles juries were 
unable to reach a verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 Crutcher asked for mercy Monday from U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer 
in Los Angeles, saying he is a remorseful man who has decided to change his 
life's direction. But federal prosecutor Stephen McConnell said Crutcher -- who 
now calls himself Charles de Crevecoeur -- deserved the stiffest sentence 
allowed under the plea bargain. "He isn't simply a charming rogue," McConnell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In London, Crutcher posed as Lord Peter Charles de Vere Beauclerk, an 
international financier and polo-playing chum of Prince Charles. He jilted a 
string of English women and twice escaped police -- once by knocking an officer 
out and later by driving his car through a hedgerow outside a country pub.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; JUSTICES 
LET STAND AWARD AGAINST SCIENTOLOGISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday let stand a $2.5-million award won by a man 
who said the Church of Scientology of California brainwashed him and caused 
permanent psychological injury. 
</P>
<P>
 The court, without comment Monday, turned down the church's argument that the 
lawsuit should have failed because religious practices are protected by the 
Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence Dominic Wollersheim, who lives in Golden, Colo., was a member of the 
Church of Scientology of California from 1969 through 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 He later sued the church, contending that it used "thought reform" practices 
that caused him to become a manic-depressive and to consider suicide. After he 
left the church, members sought to destroy his photography business, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A California state court jury upheld Wollersheim's claim that the church 
intentionally inflicted emotional distress on him. The jury awarded him $5 
million in damages to compensate for his injury and another $25 million in 
punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 A state appeals court upheld the verdict, saying the church had used physical 
restraint and psychological pressure tactics. But the court said the award was 
"preposterous" and reduced it to $500,000 in compensatory damages and $2 
million in punitive damages. The state court reaffirmed the damage award after 
being ordered to restudy it by the nation's highest court.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: SURVEY TO DETERMINE TECHNOLOGY INTEREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an attempt to find more efficient forms of transportation and 
communication, Caltrans is surveying Ventura County residents to determine 
their interest in high-tech travel alternatives, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal is to gather information about how residents, educators, government 
agencies, health-care professionals and others could use "electronic options" 
to communicate and conduct their business without travel, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Four thousand four-page questionnaires were mailed to randomly selected 
Ventura County households in January, and state Department of Transportation 
officials said they hope to have the results by late March. 
</P>
<P>
 The questionnaire asks residents what kinds of telecommunications or 
transportation systems, such as cellular phones and alternative energy 
vehicles, they use or are familiar with. It also asks residents if they would 
be interested in high-tech computer systems that would, for example, allow 
individuals to obtain medical services from home without having to drive to a 
doctor's office or hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, six focus groups made up of Ventura County educators, city and 
county officials, health-care professionals, consumers, students and business 
leaders met last week in Thousand Oaks to discuss ways of using advanced 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're inviting comments on the . . . ways that the telecommunications 
technology could assist various entities," Caltrans spokeswoman Margaret Moilov 
said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see a dynamic public-private partnership emerging and are presently 
working with GTE on development of demonstrations which would showcase the 
electronic highway travel alternatives," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans is working with the Ventura County Transportation Commission and the 
city of Thousand Oaks on the project. TRACY WILSON

 Julia Salanoa says she plans to visit family in her native Samoa. Isabel 
Sapien will bank her money now that she is retired. And Maria Godinez says her 
check will be spent on a baby due in June. 
</P>
<P>
 The three women are part of a class-action sex discrimination lawsuit against 
the Oxnard Lemon Co. settled last year. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 current, former and prospective packinghouse employees are 
sharing in the $575,000 settlement. On Monday, they started collecting their 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very happy," said Godinez, 37, who picked up a check for $1,176 at 
work on Monday. Godinez, who will collect a total of $4,248, will receive two 
more checks within the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is very good for us," added the 16-year packinghouse laborer. "It gives 
us more opportunity to have work." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, filed in 1991, alleged that Oxnard Lemon upheld a pattern of 
discrimination against women in hirings, promotions and job assignments. The 
suit alleged that women were given fewer regular and overtime hours and no 
access to or training for higher-paid positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Last June, U. S. District Judge David D. Kenyon ruled that the company was 
guilty of discriminating against women in hiring. A settlement was reached a 
few months later. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of the settlement, Oxnard Lemon agreed to maintain 
non-discriminatory hiring and promotion practices. In addition, the company 
reserves for women some jobs traditionally held by men. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials have said that the settlement was not an admission of 
wrongdoing but an attempt to avoid a costly, drawn-out legal battle. They also 
have maintained that women have always been able to hold any packinghouse job 
they applied for and were qualified to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of the settlement, five named plaintiffs will get $20,000 each; 
two other named plaintiffs who complained of discrimination in hiring each will 
receive $10,000; $325,000 will be divided among 94 current and former workers 
who were discriminated against in job assignments and promotions; $115,000 will 
go to 29 hiring discrimination victims, and $15,000 will go to pay for 
arbitration, if necessary, to enforce the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, California Rural Legal Assistance and a private Chicago law firm 
will split $675,000 in attorney fees. More than a dozen former and prospective 
employees showed up at CRLA's Oxnard office Monday to collect the first 
installment of the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Salanoa picked up the first of three checks toward her $6,372 settlement 
amount. 
</P>
<P>
 "For those girls, it was good for them," said the 65-year-old Salanoa, who 
retired last year after 26 years with Oxnard Lemon. "Now women are able to work 
where they want." FRED ALVAREZ

CONFERENCE AIMS TO CURB DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PLAGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN MOFFAT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While public debate over street crime reaches a fever pitch, the biggest 
threat to women's safety in fact lies at home: 75% of women murdered are killed 
by their husbands or lovers, participants in a conference on domestic violence 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 And as "three strikes and you're out" goes into effect against repeat felons, 
the fact remains that some women are assaulted dozens of times by a domestic 
partner before the justice system gets involved, said Barbara Hart, an attorney 
and victims' rights advocate. Even then, poor coordination among police and 
prosecutors too often lets the perpetrator off, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 450 police officers, social workers, judges, doctors and victims' 
advocates jammed the Police Academy gymnasium for Los Angeles' first 
large-scale conference on domestic violence, which was conceived by 
psychiatrist Marjorie Braude and co-sponsored by her husband, Councilman Marvin 
Braude, and the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The theme of the conference was how to increase coordination within the 
justice system to stop family batterers, and participants both criticized the 
lack of a stronger response to domestic violence and praised ongoing efforts to 
control abusers. 
</P>
<P>
 Swamped by increasing domestic violence in the city, the LAPD is beefing up 
its response to assaults and murders among family members and working closely 
with victim advocacy groups that assist with investigations and violence 
prevention. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials said that domestic violence constitutes 40% of police calls 
in many areas of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Domestic violence is a threat not only to its direct victims, but to the 
police who spend so much of their time dealing with it. Volatile family 
disputes are the deadliest assignments for police officers, accounting for 40% 
of police deaths nationwide last year, according to the National Assn. of 
Chiefs of Police. When rookie Officer Christy Lynne Hamilton was fatally shot 
last month in Northridge, she was responding to a domestic violence call.  
</P>
<P>
 And violence in the home contributes to violence throughout society, 
participants said. They noted that most of the inmates crowding California 
jails have either been victims of battering in the home or grew up in an 
atmosphere of domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
 There has often been inadequate coordination of police and prosecutors, 
leading to batterers evading conviction, conference participants said. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to increase the successful prosecution of domestic violence, the 
Police Department last September launched a pilot program in its Southwest 
Division that dedicated seven detectives to domestic violence cases and 
increased coordination with prosecutors. In the past, a case usually bounced 
through several assistant city attorneys or assistant district attorneys before 
it was prosecuted. The program will be implemented departmentwide in a few 
weeks, Cmdr. John White said. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar program started in San Diego in 1992 has helped reduce domestic 
violence homicides by more than 50%, said San Diego Police Sgt. Anne O'Dell. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to increased communication with prosecutors, police are 
increasingly relying on private groups to help out with investigations and 
assistance to victims. In the pilot program in the Southwest Division, officers 
take the victims of domestic violence and their children to an organization 
called the Jenesse Center or to one of the shelters in its referral network. 
The center also makes available vouchers so battered women can stay in motels 
if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 The division also provides the names and phone numbers of victims of domestic 
violence so the Jenesse Center can make follow-up calls, since batterers rarely 
strike just once. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the Los Angeles Harbor area, a group called Rainbow Services has a similar 
program of working closely with police. Last weekend the police and Rainbow 
Services started dispatching teams of Rainbow volunteers who go to the site of 
an arrest within 20 minutes to assist the victim. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Chief Willie L. Williams said more coordination is needed 
among all service agencies. "When we have to arrest someone or take someone to 
the hospital, it means other parts of the system have failed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart rejected a notion that she said is held by many judges and others, that 
if a battered woman would only leave the abusive relationship she would be 
safe. "At the time she leaves (her husband or lover) she may be at greatest 
risk of being killed," because the jealous partner cannot stand to lose control 
of her. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, women in Los Angeles often have nowhere to go once they decide to 
leave home. Assistant Dist. Atty. Audrey Collins said there are only 250 beds 
for battered women and their children, nowhere near enough.  
</P>
<P>
 Both police officers and victims' advocates at the conference complained of a 
lack of financial resources for efforts against domestic violence. Dr. Braude 
said that the city has set up a $10,000 domestic violence trust fund and is 
seeking corporate donations.

SHERIFF FIRES AN EARLY VOLLEY IN BUDGET BATTLE; FINANCES: BLOCK SAYS A PROPOSED 
SHIFT OF $100 MILLION IN COSTS TO HIS DEPARTMENT IS CONTRARY TO VOTERS' WISHES 
ABOUT SUPPORT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Beginning the annual budget battle two months earlier than last year, Sheriff 
Sherman Block has accused the county's new administrative officer, Sally Reed, 
of trying to shift $100 million in costs to his budget, which he says would 
force him to drastically cut personnel and anti-crime services. 
</P>
<P>
 Block claims that Reed's moves are contrary to promises made to the electorate 
last fall that if it passed Proposition 172, making a half-cent sales tax 
increase permanent, law enforcement would at least be kept even. The statewide 
ballot measure passed with 62% of the vote in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 The sheriff said he has talked to Gov. Pete Wilson about the matter, and the 
governor agreed that such a promise had been made, and assured him that, if 
necessary, he would seek legislation to force the county to avoid cuts and give 
law enforcement a priority. 
</P>
<P>
 A Wilson spokesman, Sean Walsh, confirmed that Wilson agrees with Block that 
"the various counties in the state have a responsibility to see that the 
voters' will is carried out." 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh added that Wilson is reviewing the situation to see if legislation is 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
 But Reed, supported by Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, the chairwoman of the Los 
Angeles County Board of Supervisors, is insisting that some cutbacks in the 
Sheriff's Department are required to avoid unacceptably drastic cuts among 
other county agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sheriff must absorb some additional costs -- in salary increases and 
funds for the new facility in Lynwood," Reed said. "It is not without pain that 
we are requiring that, but we have treated him very fairly. He's not going to 
get as much as we would like to give him, or he would like to have." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As it is, the administrative officer said, other departments may suffer 36% 
cuts, while the Sheriff's Department will have a 20% reduction, according to 
preliminary calculations. 
</P>
<P>
 Burke, in a Feb. 17 letter to Wilson, informed the governor that according to 
these calculations, Los Angeles County "will be short $900 million in local 
revenues sufficient to operate county government," including the Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The county has lost about $1.1 billion in property taxes that have been 
shifted to schools over the past two years, the supervisor said, adding that 
only $348 million has been replaced by the public-safety sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can no longer shield public safety, as we have in the past, from 
significant budget reductions," Burke said. 
</P>
<P>
 Block, however, said he believes such county policies "will really be a 
betrayal to those people who voted for 172," relying on the promises he and the 
governor made. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the public has spoken very clearly . . . that public safety is the 
top priority," Block said at a recent news conference. "There are many other 
programs that are important, but they cannot function effectively if there is a 
threat to the safety of the people who participate in them." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Board of Supervisors quickly restored funds to the Sheriff's 
Department after Block announced that he was closing a jail and releasing 
hundreds of prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 But Reed said she does not believe there will be such a retreat this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Am I going to say no, we have to give you the money after all?" asked Reed. 
"I don't think so." 
</P>
<P>
 But, the administrative officer added, pressure in Sacramento may get the 
state to give the county more money to avert the most drastic cuts.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; FRAUD CHARGES AGAINST COMPANY ARE DROPPED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 U.S. attorney's office prosecutors have decided to drop fraud charges against 
Del Manufacturing of Oxnard, saying the likelihood of collecting fines against 
the bankrupt company were slim. 
</P>
<P>
 However, on Monday those same federal prosecutors reiterated their vow to 
pursue 15 counts against three Del employees, saying they defrauded the U.S. 
Army of more than $3 million in a complicated double-billing scheme.The firm 
made practice bombs for the army. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. Chuck Kreindler said he will proceed with the 
prosecutions of Richard Ceniseroz, 41, and Paul Delgado, 40, both of Oxnard and 
Teresa Delgado, 65, of Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 Ceniseroz has been charged with three counts of theft of government property, 
two counts of money laundering, seven counts of false claims and one count of 
obstructing a federal audit. Paul Delgado has been charged with obstructing a 
federal audit and perjury while Teresa Delgado has been charged with perjury. 
</P>
<P>
 The case is set to go to trial in U.S. District Court March 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Kreindler said the decision to drop the fraud charges against Del 
were based on financial considerations, an attorney for the firm said he viewed 
the decision as a "complete vindication" for the company. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dismissal of the government's criminal case now clears the way for Del to 
complete its reorganization under Chapter 11 and get back to business," 
attorney William E. Winfield said. J.E. MITCHELL

POLICE CRITICIZE 4 1/2-YEAR DRUG SENTENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHAU LAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a decision that dismayed police and prosecutors, a federal judge Monday 
sentenced a former convict who confessed to selling drugs near a Pacoima school 
to 4 1/2 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr. ignored the provisions of a 1991 
agreement in which Bobbie Marshall pleaded guilty in exchange for a 14-year 
prison term. On Monday, Hatter also reduced the sentence far below an amount 
later agreed upon by himself, prosecutors and defense lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Assistant U.S. Atty. Steven Madison, the judge was impressed with 
the amount of public service work Marshall had performed since his arrest. But 
Hatter's view was not shared by Los Angeles police. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel betrayed by the U.S. attorney's office," said Los Angeles Police 
Detective Everett Berry, who arrested Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
 Madison said his office may appeal the sentence, which was half of the 
nine-year term his office had agreed to. Because Marshall was in custody for 18 
months awaiting trial, his sentence was further reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall was charged in a nine-count indictment after his arrest in 1989 for 
selling crack cocaine from his home across the street from Vaughn Learning 
Center in Pacoima. At that time he faced a life term without possibility of 
parole because of three prior state drug dealing convictions, Madison said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the deal made in 1991, Marshall pleaded guilty to a single felony count 
of possession of crack cocaine with the intent to distribute near a schoolyard, 
in exchange for a 14-year federal prison term. Marshall's lawyer, Denise Meyer, 
could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 In the years since he was freed on bail, Marshall has become a community 
activist, Madison said, leading prosecutors to agree to the further reduction 
in his sentence to nine years. 
</P>
<P>
 "He performed laudable community work and he is on the way to rehabilitating 
himself," Madison said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case is very unique," Madison said. "The judge took a chance on him 
(Marshall) and it worked out." 
</P>
<P>
 Based on Marshall's record of service, prosecutors also decided not to object 
to repeated decisions by Hatter to postpone sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall helped the children at Vaughn Learning Center by speaking about drugs 
and gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Yvonne Chan, principal of Vaughn, said she was shocked to learn that Marshall 
had admitted selling cocaine near her school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I must have seen Bobbie's good side," Chan said Monday. "He has not done 
anything to hurt this school or the children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Has he done everything he can for the community? Yes. Can I vouch for the 
good work he did for the past three years? Yes," the principal said.

NEW CHIEF OF SIMI VALLEY POLICE WILL TAKE IT ONE STEP AT A TIME; LAW 
ENFORCEMENT: WILLARD R. (BILL) SCHLIETER SAYS HE WILL STUDY THE ISSUES BEFORE 
ANNOUNCING PLANS. HE SPENDS FIRST DAY MEETING WITH TOP OFFICIALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Simi Valley's new police chief spent his first day at work Monday greeting the 
troops and boning up on issues ranging from earthquake damage to school 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Willard R. (Bill) Schlieter, 53, settled in quickly in Simi Valley after 
driving in last week from his previous posting as police chief in Urbana, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 By Monday afternoon, Schlieter (pronounced SHLY-ter) had met with City Manager 
Lin Koester, most of the city's department heads and many of his new 
department's top officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Monday, Schlieter and his wife signed a lease on a house in Simi 
Valley's Indian Hills neighborhood, where they plan to stay for up to three 
months while shopping for a permanent home. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, he planned to attend Monday night's meeting of the City Council, 
which was to vote on seeking consultants to study a new police headquarters to 
replace the existing earthquake-fractured building. 
</P>
<P>
 Schlieter said the quake damage in the department's Cochran Street 
headquarters "looks somewhat depressing," but he shied away from announcing any 
plans for the department until he learns more. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really trying to find out what are the needs and the primary issues in 
the department," Schlieter said Monday between meetings. "Hopefully, I'll have 
the opportunity to learn the organization and the culture here a bit before I 
have to make any decisions."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But he added: "Crises have a way of happening unannounced." 
</P>
<P>
 Koester said he is pleased with the new chief's cautious approach to taking 
control of the department. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the type of individual we were looking for," said Koester, who hired 
Schlieter after Chief Lindsey Paul Miller's retirement. "I think we've got a 
police chief here who, at least in my opinion, is cut out to do a real good 
job." 
</P>
<P>
 Koester said he and Schlieter agreed that the chief will spend the first few 
weeks talking to all his officers, learning the department carefully and 
listening to people. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe there's people there that want to have an input to the new chief, 
and he should do a lot of listening and asking questions," Koester said. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Jerry Boyce said he and the department staff dropped thick stacks of 
briefing papers on Schlieter's desk Monday to help bring him up to speed. 
</P>
<P>
 Schlieter said he was already wading through them Monday afternoon, reading up 
on the proposed new police headquarters and the in-school Gang Understanding 
and Resistance Development program. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He also met briefly with police union officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wasn't willing to rush into things, and he said he wasn't even willing to 
say things need to be changed yet," said Sgt. Gary Collins, president of the 
Simi Valley Police Officers Assn. "He reacted the way I'd hope he would react 
-- cautious." 
</P>
<P>
 Collins added: "I told him we want him to succeed and we want to do what we 
can to help." 
</P>
<P>
 Schlieter said he will be catching up on a number of issues as he settles in, 
including his own certification as a California peace officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Schlieter said his Peace Officers Standards and Training certification has 
expired since his last in-state job as Taft police chief ended in 1984. But he 
said he expects papers will be processed quickly for him to be recertified 
without having to repeat police academy training -- a procedure allowed for 
chiefs of police. 
</P>
<P>
 Schlieter said he also met privately with Capts. Boyce and Richard Wright to 
let them know about "some of my panic buttons." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like surprises," Schlieter said, explaining he expects his officers 
to keep him thoroughly abreast of department business. "I just feel that if 
it's going to affect the department, I ought to know about it ahead of time." 
</P>
<P>
 He left Illinois on Wednesday driving a small rented truck full of enough 
clothing and personal items for several weeks, while his wife drove his 
ice-gray Porsche 944 coupe. 
</P>

THOUSAND OAKS DEBATES TOUGHER STANCE ON TRASH; ENVIRONMENT: NEW LAW WOULD 
OUTLAW MIXING RECYCLABLE WASTE WITH OTHER GARBAGE. RESIDENTS WOULD HAVE TO 
PARTICIPATE IN CURBSIDE PROGRAM. 
</P>

<P>
 The Thousand Oaks City Council tonight will debate a tough new trash law that 
would make it a criminal offense for residents to mix recyclable cans, bottles 
and other waste with other garbage. 
</P>
<P>
 Chucking a soda can in with banana peels and other garbage would violate the 
proposed law. So would tossing away an old newspaper, a plastic milk jug, or an 
empty beer bottle. 
</P>
<P>
 The comprehensive trash law -- one of the strictest in Ventura County -- would 
require all residents to pay for, and participate in, curbside recycling 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Thousand Oaks households already subscribe to trash collection services, 
and the monthly fee includes curbside recycling. Under the law, the 5% of 
homeowners without regular trash collection would have to sign up with a 
city-approved hauler. 
</P>
<P>
 And everyone would have to separate their garbage for curbside recycling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Technically, we could find you guilty of a misdemeanor if we found you 
throwing out a yogurt container at home," solid waste planner Carolyn Greene 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Crafted after long discussions with the city's trash haulers, the new 
regulations are designed to reduce the amount of garbage Thousand Oaks sends to 
landfills. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the next seven years, the city must cut in half the amount of solid 
waste dumped in landfills or face hefty state fines. About 75% of Thousand 
Oaks' households now recycle at least occasionally -- but that compliance rate 
may not be good enough, especially as the state deadline approaches. 
</P>
<P>
 City trash experts hope to meet their waste reduction goals by educating the 
public about recycling. They would also like to offer financial incentives to 
recycle, such as lower trash-collection fees for residents who keep garbage to 
a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 But as a backup, they've written a strict and sweeping ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Each violation of the solid waste law would carry a maximum penalty of six 
months in jail and $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ojai City Council recently passed a mandatory recycling law similar to the 
draft before the Thousand Oaks council tonight. Yet the city's solid waste 
planner, Marilyn Miller, said she did not anticipate slapping residents with 
jail terms or hefty fines for failing to separate the garbage. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thousand Oaks, too, code enforcement officials said they would treat 
prosecutions gingerly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going after Joe Blow citizen," said Deputy City Atty. Nancy 
Kierstyn Schreiner. 
</P>
<P>
 An anti-scavenging provision, for example, would be used only against 
organized trash-pickers who steal recyclables and trade them for cash. "It's 
not our intention to enforce this against a person who's pulling cans out of a 
trash barrel in a park," Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
 And few people are likely to be fined for violating the "customer 
responsibilities" section of the law, which defines exactly how long trash cans 
can remain on the curb in public view (a maximum of 30 hours, starting at 6 
p.m. the evening before collection day). 
</P>
<P>
 "The ordinance is written as an ultimatum -- 'Thou shalt' -- but we see our 
enforcement on a realistic basis," Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reluctant to even threaten jail terms for residents who refuse to separate 
their trash, most Ventura County city councils have not considered mandatory 
recycling. Simi Valley, Camarillo, Oxnard and Ventura all rely on voluntary 
compliance with various recycling programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to make the point that it is a community responsibility," said Oxnard 
recycling specialist Jay Duncan. "I'd like to see a mandatory recycling 
ordinance, but as far as imprisonment, that's a little extreme." 
</P>
<P>
 Voicing yet another concern, Ventura Councilman Gary Tuttle predicted that 
enforcement of mandatory recycling would be nearly impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if a code enforcement official spotted a recyclable bottle in someone's 
garbage, Tuttle said, "How do you know who's putting it in (the) trash can? How 
do you catch the culprit?" 
</P>
<P>
 Still, several Thousand Oaks council members on Monday indicated support for 
the solid waste ordinance, including the mandatory recycling provision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't think the city is stepping onto individual freedoms here," 
Thousand Oaks Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski said. "Proper waste disposal is a 
part of living in a community." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But some trash experts voiced skepticism about the law's effectiveness -- and 
alarm about its broad provisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Recycling is just like morals. You can't legislate it," said Perri Jean 
Schlosser, a manager at Simi Valley Recycling Center Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that the law grants the city complete control over all solid waste set 
out for disposal, Schlosser added: "This is a pretty overwhelming, and perhaps 
over-regulating, law. Maybe they've expanded their police powers more than they 
should." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he supports the law in general, trash hauler Mike Smith expressed 
doubt that the recycling mandate would work. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you tell people they have to do something, they don't always take too 
kindly to it," said Smith, the chief executive officer of Conejo Valley 
Disposal. "We want to be politically correct in encouraging people not to throw 
things in the landfill."

LENDING SUPPORT TO SENIORS; THOUSAND OAKS: FITZGERALD HOUSE ACTIVITIES RANGE 
FROM MUSIC AND CRAFTS TO AN ALZHEIMER'S DAY-CARE PROGRAM.

 Ben Lipman, 86 years old and grinning broadly, leaned close to his 
wheelchair-bound buddy and let fly with his favorite joke. 
</P>
<P>
 "What does a dog do that a man steps into?" Lipman asked. 
</P>
<P>
 A dozen senior citizens looked at him quizzically. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pants!" the octogenarian announced in triumph. "A dog pants, and a man steps 
into pants! Get it? Pants!" 
</P>
<P>
 A few groans, a few laughs. Another afternoon at Thousand Oaks' Fitzgerald 
House, where dozens of senior citizens gather each day for jokes, music, crafts 
and a strong dose of love. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded more than 15 years ago, when the notion of sending senior citizens to 
day-care programs was considered crass and cruel, Fitzgerald House has 
developed into a vital support center for the Conejo Valley's elderly 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit group Senior Concerns keeps Fitzgerald House bustling with two 
daily programs: a structured social calendar for 30 elderly residents, and 
close supervision for 10 memory-impaired adults, including those suffering from 
Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Concerns also runs the Meals on Wheels program, which provides hot 
lunches and nutritional snacks to thousands of elderly Thousand Oaks residents. 
Other programs offer support to senior citizens living on their own, and to 
families responsible for elderly parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "The single word underlying that whole operation is love," said Councilwoman 
Judy Lazar, who directed Senior Concerns for six years before entering 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Priced on a sliding scale that peaks at $36 a day for the Alzheimer's program, 
Fitzgerald House is nearly always filled to capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 But still, staff members seized a recent opportunity to recruit more elderly 
participants. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Using cameras, technicians and script-writers donated by GTE's in-house film 
crew, Senior Concerns members shot three 14-minute videos about their programs. 
They hope to show the videos to local companies, to educate baby boomer 
employees about caring for their elderly parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitzgerald House staffers also hope the videos will help them recruit more 
volunteers -- and more donors to support the day-care programs, which run 
entirely on grants and gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 GTE's donations, and the resulting films, have been "a dream come true," said 
Lynn Engelbert, director of the Fitzgerald House. 
</P>
<P>
 By teaching middle-aged adults about the options for elder care, Engelbert 
said, "we're getting away from the negative stereotype about senior day care. 
People are beginning to realize that if they delegate the care-giving process . 
. . for at least a few hours a day, they can keep their (elderly) loved ones at 
home much longer." 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing the need for such services, executives at biotechnology giant 
Amgen Inc. have agreed to show the Fitzgerald House video to the firm's 2,300 
employees working at research labs and offices in Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're preparing for the aging of the parents of people in our work force," 
spokeswoman Lynne Connell explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, the senior citizens themselves need a little educating as well. 
</P>
<P>
 When her mother-in-law moved in with her four years ago, Peg Skieresz heartily 
recommended the Fitzgerald House program. She figured her mother-in-law, then 
79 years old and lonely, would enjoy the companionship and the various 
activities, from sing-alongs to dances to gardening. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Skieresz said, her mother-in-law flat out rejected the idea: "She said, 
'I'm not going to some place where only old people are.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A visit to Fitzgerald House, however, changed her mind. Now Helen Skieresz 
considers herself a regular -- welcomed with smiles each day, even though she 
admits to cheating at cards. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I didn't like it, I wouldn't be coming," she said. "At first, there were a 
lot of strangers here, but now everybody's a friend." 
</P>
<P>
 Director Engelbert hears such testimony every day from the participants, the 
staff and the volunteers who contribute more than 650 hours a month, doing 
everything from scrubbing the floor to listening to nostalgic reminiscences. 
</P>
<P>
 "This really is a joyful place," Engelbert said. "We laugh a lot, we share a 
lot -- and at any age, that's what we need."

SCOTT HARRIS: AFTER AN ACT OF GOD OR NATURE, PERSEVERE; THE RECORD SHOWS THIS 
TO HAVE BEEN AN ECUMENICAL EARTHQUAKE. . . . IT SEEMS THAT THIS QUAKE LEFT NO 
FAITH UNSCATHED.

 The day before, John Moody had run more than 26 miles. If he was feeling a bit 
stiff, he was also feeling good. This was his seventh consecutive Los Angeles 
Marathon, and though he's run it faster in the past, this was his most 
satisfying yet. 
</P>
<P>
 A month ago, Moody, the 41-year-old pastor of First Presbyterian Church in 
North Hollywood, figured there'd be no way he'd be able to run this year. The 
earthquake that some fundamentalists interpret as the wrath of God had severely 
damaged the sanctuary at the corner of Colfax and Addison, earning it a red tag 
from city inspectors. For a month the minister was just too busy tending to 
quake chores to jog. Then, with the marathon a few weeks away, Moody decided 
to, as the shoe company advises, just do it. 
</P>
<P>
 Shielding his eyes from the glare of the sun, the minister seemed to be 
pointing toward the heavens. "The quake snapped the rebar in the columns that 
support the roof," he explained. "It's like someone took a slice with a 
hacksaw." 
</P>
<P>
 Repairing the sanctuary might cost $1 million. And this is the work of God? 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of my congregation, if not all," Moody suggests, "would say this was a 
natural disaster -- that God didn't cause the earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This is an irony that seems to have escaped certain preachers. On TV the other 
night, I saw an evangelist suggest that the Almighty wasn't just punishing Los 
Angeles for its general wickedness, but the San Fernando Valley in particular. 
The Valley, he correctly pointed out, is the hotbed of the porno industry. A 
mere coincidence? He thought not. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, perhaps the preacher went on to explain why places of worship were hit 
harder than the smutmeisters. I don't know. I changed the channel. 
</P>
<P>
 The record shows this to have been an ecumenical earthquake. In some parts the 
damage was minor, but it seems that this quake left no faith unscathed. The 
Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles has estimated the damage to its 
churches and schools at between $85 million and $100 million. Kimberly Hall, a 
spokeswoman for the San Fernando Valley Inter-Faith Council, notes that within 
her Mormon faith, three churches have been shut down. 
</P>
<P>
 Another telltale sign: This quake, according to Judson Studios of Highland 
Park, has caused more damage to stained glass than any disaster before it. The 
Judson family, which for 100 years has designed stained glass for churches and 
synagogues, has business backed up for months. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news for the religious community is that the constitutional 
separation of church and state doesn't prevent the federal Small Business 
Administration from making loans to repair structural damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any kind of nonprofit is eligible for a loan for physical damage," said Diane 
Brady, an SBA spokeswoman. Religious institutions, she said, are treated 
"pretty much like a business" -- with one exception. Other businesses may apply 
for loans to cover "economic injury," a stopgap measure to make up for lost 
profits. Churches may not seek SBA money to compensate for a hardship in 
passing the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency, meanwhile, may provide grants to some 
churches that provide "government-like" assistance on their sites. First 
Presbyterian of North Hollywood, for example, is hoping that the community 
services it provides or hosts -- the preschool, the county-run senior meals 
program, the Alcoholics Anonymous meetings -- will help the church qualify for 
a grant. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Several congregations face the quandary that burdens First Presbyterian. One 
option at Moody's church is to repair the building. The other is to salvage the 
pews, the stained glass, the organ, the marble chancel and then demolish the 
sanctuary and build a new one. 
</P>
<P>
 If that's the option, they should also the salvage '60s-era light fixtures 
that look like a tribute to Sputnik. They are magnificently tacky examples of 
the so-called Googie style in architecture, typified by the coffee shop of that 
era. "Every time I come in here," Moody says, "it reminds me of Ship's." 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways, First Presbyterian is luckier than some churches. Only the 
sanctuary was red-tagged, so worship and programs were squeezed into auxiliary 
buildings. Its small chapel, with seating for 140, survived the quake and is 
nearly large enough to seat the entire congregation. To many members, the 
sanctuary, built in the early 1960s to seat 750, was a financial albatross. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a history here. Back when the sanctuary was built, the congregation 
had about 1,000 members. But not long after the sanctuary went up, the 
congregation was riven by a theological and political dispute. About 35% of the 
congregation left, taking 60% of its financial resources. Those left behind 
were saddled with the debt created by a larger congregation. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Moody arrived 10 years ago, the membership had dwindled to its 
current size. Since then, Sunday attendance has risen and the church has 
launched several programs, opening its doors to the community. Right now, there 
are many more questions than answers. "To ask this congregation to take on a 
million-dollar mortgage -- it would be very difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 Moody, the marathon man, figures to take it a step at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perseverance and endurance are two qualities important in doing ministry," he 
says. "The marathon is certainly a lesson about that."

PAINTING A POSITIVE PORTRAIT; YOUTH: KIDS' ENTRIES FOR ANNUAL PACOIMA PRIDE 
ARTS PROJECT REFUTE NEGATIVE IMAGES OF THEIR COMMUNITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BYRNES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 For most of their young lives, Pacoima schoolchildren have seen their 
community portrayed in stereotypes: streets teeming with violence, rampant drug 
activity, despair. 
</P>
<P>
 But according to the nearly 2,000 children who depicted their community for 
the fourth annual Pacoima Pride arts project judged in Pacoima and Sherman Oaks 
Monday, the stereotypes tell only part of the story. 
</P>
<P>
 In brilliant markers, watercolors and crayons, the children's artwork tells of 
a Pacoima replete with smiling suns, grassy hills and families holding hands. 
"I am proud of me and my family because we work so hard" is the message 
scrawled on one. "People in Pacoima live together and share things," says 
another. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual contest is sponsored by TransWorld Bank, which opened its doors in 
Pacoima in 1941 and is now the only bank there. This year, organizers invited 
children from four Pacoima elementary schools to interpret the contest theme: 
family and community pride. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, five judges chose first- and second-place winners from each grade 
at Haddon Avenue Elementary School, Pacoima Elementary School, the Vaughn Next 
Century Learning Center and Mary Immaculate School. 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel Velasquez, a muralist and counselor for Community Youth Gang Services 
who helps judge the contest every year, said he was struck by the overwhelming 
number of positive images this time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Children know the stereotype of Pacoima," Velasquez said. "They also know the 
positive and the good. They just don't have the opportunity to express it very 
often." On Monday, the judges traveled to each of the schools, where rows of 
colorful drawings and paintings of houses, parks, neighborhoods and families 
hung in hallways or auditoriums. They narrowed the entries to about 100 and 
took them from the schools for final judging at TransWorld headquarters in 
Sherman Oaks. There, in a basement training room, organizers hung the winning 
art on walls, doors and chalkboards. Judges circled the room in silence, 
studying the artwork and taking notes as if appraising great masterpieces. 
</P>
<P>
 "You learn a lot from children," said Cecilia Aguilera, who is Mayor Richard 
Riordan's East Valley representative. "They tend to be positive and not 
disillusioned. They only see solutions." 
</P>
<P>
 The bank will host an awards dinner for the winners and their families in 
mid-April at the bank's Pacoima branch, where the art will first be displayed. 
First-place winners will receive $100 savings bonds. In June, the winners will 
travel by bus to Downtown Los Angeles, where their work will be presented to 
the City Council and displayed at the Children's Museum.

CITY INVESTIGATING CRIME VIGILANTE'S BASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Based in a doughnut shop in a crime-plagued neighborhood, Mary Lou Holte has 
been acclaimed by Barbara Walters, Larry King and the Wall Street Journal as a 
force for good, a citizen crime-buster who stands up to street thieves and 
prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
 But Holte now finds that the Los Angeles Police Department has called the shop 
a magnet for crime, branded it a public nuisance and asked that its operations 
be sharply restricted. 
</P>
<P>
 At the request of police and neighbors, a city zoning official on Monday 
decided to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
 Holte, who does not work at the shop but has made it her base of operations 
for street patrols for five years, said rivals are trying to "blow me away from 
the corner." 
</P>
<P>
 "Why don't we just take Mary Lou and shoot her down?" Holte said. "They're 
trying to do this just to get me away." 
</P>
<P>
 It's nothing personal, said LAPD Capt. James McMurray. Police have pursued 
similar action against dozens of businesses, and McMurray said the primary 
concern remains the presence of suspected criminals and prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "She talks to them," said McMurray, who commands the Van Nuys station. "It's 
like she's gathering intelligence, but it's certainly not like she's driving 
them away." 
</P>
<P>
 The shop provides "the same haven for the street people that are preying on 
the citizens of the neighborhood," McMurray said. "If a prostitute sees a cop 
coming, she runs in and buys a cup of coffee and a doughnut. That makes it kind 
of hard to remove them from the road." 
</P>
<P>
 Police and neighbors filed complaints about the Sepulveda Boulevard shop, 
Orville's Originals, along with California Coin Laundry, located in the same 
mini-mall. McMurray said he wanted zoning officials to implement the same 
restrictions that were imposed against a convenience market in the shopping 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, the city forced the convenience store to cut back its 24-hour 
schedule to 6 a.m. to 1 a.m. on weekdays and Saturdays, closing at midnight on 
Sundays. The store also was forced to hire a security guard for the night 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The request has also puzzled Ulysses Contedor, the owner of the doughnut shop 
for the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prostitutes come into my store for doughnuts, coffee, but never do their job 
here," he said. "For me, this place is as safe as any place in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Contedor also blamed Holte. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's not good for me," Contedor said of Holte. "Before she came here, I had 
no problems. The city did not say, 'I want to cut the hours at your store.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Holte, 45, says she began her crusade against street crime after she was 
nearly raped while walking home from Valley College. When she is not walking 
Sepulveda with her flashlight and note pad in search of possible criminal 
activity, Holte keeps an eye out for trouble from the doughnut shop. 
</P>
<P>
 She reports the license plates of suspected criminals, confronts those she 
suspects of illegal activity and occasionally calls police for help from the 
doughnut shop. She has made one citizen's arrest there. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Holte, who is on disability, has been hailed in the national media 
for her crime-fighting exploits. Barbara Walters lauded her as a "fantastic . . 
. one-woman vigilance team" on ABC's "20/20" and the Wall Street Journal called 
her the "Vigilante of Van Nuys." She was featured on the nationally syndicated 
"Jerry Springer Show" in Chicago, has done numerous radio interviews and 
received the Doberman Award from a lock manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The media made Mary Lou," Contedor said. "She comes in, but she doesn't have 
any power." 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, says Holte. She claims to have talked several prostitutes out of their 
line of work. She also said that she works extensively with local police in 
reporting suspicious activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have definitely helped the police clean up a lot of the crime," Holte said. 
"When I go into the doughnut shop, they clear out. (The criminals) know 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 McMurray acknowledges that Holte has occasionally been a valuable tipster. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Holte said McMurray is "biased" because of her criticisms of the 
police in the media and that complaining neighbors are "jealous" of her recent 
fame. The problem, she says, is that the alcohol sales in the mini-mall still 
lure undesirables. At the same time, police are unresponsive to her calls, she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot tell you how many times we have called the police and they have not 
showed up," Holte said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Holte's crime-fighting calls for help may come back to haunt her. 
Associate Zoning Administrator Horace Tramel Monday said he will investigate 
the number of calls for help from the doughnut shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "The volume of police response is an indication of the problem," Tramel said. 
"That's one of the things we use in determining where to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Holte says she does not plan to go anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody is going to intimidate me and nobody is going to control me and I'm 
not going to stop what I'm doing," she said. "You don't get the awards and you 
don't get the national attention if you've done something wrong."

TESTS URGED FOR STUDENTS POKED WITH NEEDLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Twenty-one middle-school students who were poked with needles brought to 
campus by a classmate should be tested for hepatitis, school officials have 
recommended. 
</P>
<P>
 In what Principal Greg Gerard called a "bizarre" incident, a student took 
blood test needles belonging to her diabetic grandmother to Challenger Middle 
School last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Some students were poked with the needles, some several times either by choice 
or maliciously, officials said. The student who brought the needles to school 
handed them to a classmate, who then poked other students, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some kids were being poked, some were saying, 'Poke me again,' " said Gerard. 
"It's kind of bizarre, the whole incident." 
</P>
<P>
 At least two students at the 675-student school, which serves grades six 
through eight, may be expelled as a result of the incident. Gerard said two 
students were suspended and face an expulsion hearing March 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerard doubts the students realized the potentially deadly act they were 
engaging in. "I don't think they saw it as being anything serious or malicious. 
A typical kid thing, perhaps. I don't think there was any intent to create a 
health problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Chet Caldeira said his "biggest concern (is) the health of the students 
involved. We're just hopeful there is no contamination or spread of any disease 
because of this." 
</P>
<P>
 Health officials said it is unlikely the students exposed themselves to the 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis B by poking one another with 
the small needles, used by diabetics to prick the skin to get drops of blood to 
test for blood-sugar levels. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a very, very small risk," said Dr. Shirley Fannin, director of 
disease-control programs for the Los Angeles County Department of Health 
Services. "This happens to be the group with the lowest level of hepatitis B 
and the lowest level of HIV. The 5- to 14-year-old has the lowest prevalence in 
the county." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, however, Fannin said, "if you're looking for reassurance 
that it couldn't possibly happen, that there wouldn't be exposure to hepatitis 
B, I couldn't give that." 
</P>
<P>
 The incident occurred Feb. 28, although school officials did not become aware 
of it until the next day, when parents contacted the school, Caldeira said. The 
parents of the 21 students who are believed to have been pricked with the 
needles were advised by the school to seek medical assistance to test for 
hepatitis. As for HIV testing, officials said students should follow the advice 
of their doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have contacted our insurance carrier," Caldeira said. "The student 
insurance will be made available to those students who seek medical attention." 
</P>
<P>
 Most parents are heeding the school's advice, he said. "There's a high level 
of concern among parents for their children." 
</P>
<P>
 Fannin recommended that the students who were pricked receive a tetanus 
booster, which the school started making available last week. 
</P>
<P>
 A majority of the students have already taken up the school's offer to receive 
the injection, Gerard said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for HIV and hepatitis B testing, Fannin said it will be some time before 
the students can do that. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you got a transmission of, say, hepatitis B, the incubation period is six 
weeks to six months," she said. "With HIV, the earliest is three weeks and 
usually three months to six months." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the 21 students, the school's vice principal was accidentally poked 
with one of the needles as he was searching the student who brought them to 
school, Gerard said.  
</P>
<P>
 In hopes of preventing a similar incident from occurring, Gerard said all the 
students have been spoken to about the seriousness of the incident. A letter 
was also sent to the entire student body.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCIES GET GRANTS FROM AT&T 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 El Proyecto del Barrio, a human-services group hard hit by the Jan. 17 
earthquake, was among several social services agencies to receive grants from 
telecommunications giant AT&T on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The medical clinic and social services agency, which received $6,000, has been 
operating out of a borrowed mobile home parked in front of its yellow-tagged 
rental building since the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the money won't allow the agency to reopen its building, it can help 
boost services. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're going to try to do is gear some of this money to the senior 
citizens," said Joe Dominic, vice president of El Proyecto.  
</P>
<P>
 "What we found in the earthquake was that a lot of the senior citizens were 
left out." 
</P>
<P>
 The agency, which provided more than 5,000 people with food and clothing after 
the Northridge quake, wasn't the only San Fernando Valley group to receive aid. 
</P>
<P>
 AT&T donated $4,000 to El Nido Family Centers, $4,000 to Vaughn Family Center, 
$10,000 to Meet Each Need with Dignity and $10,000 to Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "In addition to the American Red Cross and Salvation Army, we decided many 
grass-roots and social action agencies needed help and El Proyecto was an 
example of many agencies we were able to assist," said Daylanne Jackson, 
contributions manager for AT&T. REBECCA BRYANT

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: CSUN MATADORS OR QUAKES? -- THAT IS THE QUESTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It started as a playful suggestion: As Cal State Northridge struggled to 
recoup from the Jan. 17 quake, some ventured that changing the school nickname 
from "Matadors" to "Quakes" might be the best way to turn a bad break into a 
marketing boon. 
</P>
<P>
 The theme was quickly picked up by Matador basketball coach Pete Cassidy, who 
has long winced at the existing moniker's echo of an ignominious tactic -- the 
so-called "matador defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, CSUN Associated Students Vice President Rodney Lazar is ready to take the 
joke a step further. 
</P>
<P>
 Lazar has drafted a formal resolution to be presented to the Student Senate 
today proposing that the name change be put to a vote by students. 
</P>
<P>
 If passed, the resolution would ask students to state their nickname 
preference when they vote for student government candidates on April 12 and 13. 
</P>
<P>
 If a majority of students support the change, the proposal would then go to 
the athletic program for review, then to CSUN President Blenda J. Wilson for 
final approval, Lazar said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would help the campus be recognized nationally," Lazar said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone knows where Northridge is now." 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Northridge's alleged image problem has been the topic of much campus 
debate in the past year, particularly when the administration unveiled a new 
logo for the school late last year -- a move aimed at increasing CSUN's 
prestige outside the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Adoption of the new logo prompted a brief flurry of protests from students who 
felt they'd had no say in the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Lazar said letting the students have a go at changing the nickname might 
smooth over any residual bad feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 Athletic Program Associate Athletic Director Paul Bubb said the athletic 
officials are willing to support any appropriate proposal that students want, 
and even added his own swipe at the beleaguered Matador symbol. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have said the name Matadors refers only to males. While there are 
female matadors I'm sure, in this time of political correctness maybe Matadors 
isn't appropriate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lazar dismisses any suggestion that "Quakes" might be in bad taste considering 
the earthquake's deadly and devastating consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the ways I deal with fear and things I'm afraid of is laughing about 
them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The name Matadors just doesn't cut it, he said, adding "I bet if you came on 
this campus and asked people, three out of 10 wouldn't even know we are the 
Matadors." JILL LEOVY

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHADOW HILLS; DESPERATELY SEEKING OWNER OF AN IGUANA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Have you seen this face? 
</P>
<P>
 It's a mystery whether this scaly, slippery-tongued cutie is another 
earthquake-displaced victim or merely a vagabond iguana. 
</P>
<P>
 But those who found the roaming reptile two weeks ago at a Shadow Hills school 
for developmentally disabled adults say they are trying to locate the owner 
before its mug ends up on the back of a carton of iguana chow. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frustrating," said Barbara Cone, animal management instructor at Tierra 
del Sol School, who has put out three ads in local papers and contacted animal 
shelters. "You don't often find missing iguanas." 
</P>
<P>
 This particular lizard was discovered in a pasture at the 7 1/2-acre complex, 
which provides vocational training to about 150 students and houses about 70 
animals for animal-care classes. The iguana was healthy enough to chase a horse 
before a worker nabbed it with an oven mitt. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, however, Cone and co-workers have had problems finding the 
reptile's rightful owner. 
</P>
<P>
 Cone is keeping some of the details about the animal a mystery for a good 
reason. Iguanas, which are native to Central and South America, are becoming 
popular, but expensive, pets. Large, friendly ones can fetch up to $500. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to give too many details because there are people who may just 
know the value of the animal and may call in to try to claim it," Cone said. 
</P>
<P>
 The only clues available are that it is big, green, tame and has an 
identifying scar somewhere on its body. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the gender of the animal is a mystery. "Most reptiles, you have to do an 
internal investigation to find out," said Cone. "I'm not going to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 The students, who have been caring for the iguana in a cage in the classroom, 
have even given it a name: Jade. 
</P>
<P>
 The students in Cone's class, all of whom are receiving vocational training to 
work with animals, will care for their mystery guest for at least a month, Cone 
said. Their hospitality has included providing a lamp for warmth and fresh 
vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's the responsibility when somebody finds a stray animal that they 
muster all forces possible to find the owner," Cone said. JEFF SCHNAUFER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; COURTHOUSE PARKING STRUCTURE REOPENED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOM MROZEK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five weeks of parking nightmares for prosecutors, public defenders and jurors 
will end today when the four-story structure serving the two Van Nuys 
courthouses is reopened. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got our parking lot back, that's the order of the day," said Richard D. 
Johnson, chief of valley court operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1,200-space parking lot was red-tagged the night of Jan. 31, two weeks 
after the devastating Northridge earthquake. The closure shocked those who used 
the lot at Sylmar Avenue and Delano Street because the building was declared 
safe two days after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous aftershocks had caused additional damage, including sheared bolts, 
prompting officials to close the structure and order retrofitting. That job was 
completed over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the closure, those who work in the courts or serve on juries scrambled 
for a limited amount of parking in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials provided some relief when an unofficial parking ticket 
moratorium was declared, allowing people to park at expired meters and in red 
zones for much of February. 
</P>
<P>
 The county also provided shuttle service to a satellite parking lot at Sherman 
Way and Van Nuys Boulevard, although most employees begged, borrowed and paid 
for closer parking. 
</P>
<P>
 Judges, on the other hand, fared better, with most parking right next to their 
buildings. THOM MROZEK

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SUN VALLEY; CHILDREN TO HELP PAINT MURAL OF LOCAL HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Sun Valley group has begun recruiting children to paint a mural of the 
community's history, assisted by an artist who painted a commemorative mural 
for the 1984 Summer Olympics near the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 The painting, which will include panels depicting different eras of Sun 
Valley's history, is scheduled to be started April 9, said Jan Liptak, head of 
the Sun Valley Community Venture Council. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the location of the mural, once planned to be on the side of Roscoe 
Hardware at Sunland Boulevard and San Fernando Road, has been moved to the Al 
Jal Inc. building on Penrose Street, known locally as the swap meet building. 
The mural itself would still be on San Fernando Road facing the railroad 
tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 Artist Joe Gonzalez and the mural organizers met with seven boys who were 
either local junior high or high school students. Liptak said she is still 
trying to recruit about 10 more teen-age volunteers and is hoping to involve 
girls in the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really don't want the girls to think it's a male-only activity," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez painted several murals in East Los Angeles before he was hired for 
$10,000 to complete the Sun Valley job. 
</P>
<P>
 The site of the mural was moved because the owner of the building could not 
pay for the wall to be sandblasted before the painting could start, Liptak 
said. The sandblasting on the new site is being paid for by Peter Wald, the 
owner of the building on Penrose Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The new site offers two advantages -- a larger wall to work with and ivy that 
will be trimmed back so that it will frame the mural when it is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sun Valley Chamber of Commerce is donating sandblasting equipment for the 
project. Liptak said she is trying to solicit help from other local businesses 
that could serve lunches for the volunteers as they work on the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The painting is expected to take two months of work on weekends and holidays 
to complete. 
</P>
<P>
 The mural will be a history of the Sun Valley area told in five panels from 
prehistoric times and Native American habitation to the times of Spanish 
missionaries, stagecoaches and, finally, the 20th Century. ED BOND

GETTING INVOLVED: MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR COMMUNITY; PUPPY RAISERS GIVE 
EYESIGHT TO THE BLIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By REBECCA BRYANT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 It was Doggie Day at Ralph's, but the pickings were pretty slim for the dog. 
</P>
<P>
 As master Cherry Teter roamed the produce section, the squat, paddle-pawed, 
black Labrador beside her worked the tile floor. A sprig of mint here, an 
onionskin there -- nothing to perk even a puppy's palate. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the hard part about the grocery store -- learning to leave stuff 
that's on the floor," Teter said, tugging on the leash of 5-month-old Odyssey. 
</P>
<P>
 But learn Odyssey must. In a year, she will have more responsibility than 
keeping candy wrappers out of her mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 Odyssey is one of a batch of 205 puppies -- Labradors, golden retrievers and 
German shepherds -- being trained as seeing eye dogs by a Sylmar organization 
called Guide Dogs of America. 
</P>
<P>
 That makes Teter one of 205 foster parents, or puppy raisers, who must give up 
the dogs when they reach adulthood -- something that many expect would be 
heart-wrenching. 
</P>
<P>
 But Teter has done this before, if with some difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
 Odyssey is the third puppy she's raised for Guide Dogs. The first, a golden 
retriever named Rainbow, didn't make it through the program. Rainbow's trainers 
feared she might snap at a child and Teter eventually adopted the dog as a pet. 
</P>
<P>
 Teter's next venture as a puppy raiser came with Treasure, a retriever now in 
training. 
</P>
<P>
 After successfully doing her part and returning Treasure to the Sylmar center 
for further training, Teter suffered puppy withdrawal and picked up the phone. 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks later, Odyssey came to live in her Reseda home. 
</P>
<P>
 Though puppy raisers know they're raising the dogs for someone else, they must 
constantly remind themselves their bond cannot be a permanent one. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're giving the dog a lot of love. You're taking the dog to a lot of places 
with you. They become your buddies," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But an occasional chat with one of the hundreds of blind individuals who has 
been given the guide dogs and through them, independence, keeps the puppy 
raisers on track. 
</P>
<P>
 Formerly called International Guiding Eyes, the organization was founded in 
1948 after former machinist Joseph Jones was refused a guide dog because, at 
57, he was deemed too old. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones' union local set up funds and International Guiding Eyes started 
providing dogs at no cost and with no limits on the age of the recipient. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the nonprofit organization graduates 50 to 60 dogs a year, at a cost of 
$20,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all the dogs bred at Guiding Eyes make it through the program. Some can't 
handle the training, some are disqualified because of physical problems. The 
dogs who are rejected -- at Guiding Eyes they call it a "career change" -- are 
generally adopted by puppy raisers or families on a two-year waiting list to 
give the dogs homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 30% of the golden retrievers and German shepherds make it to graduation. 
But 70% of the Labradors finish. Which means that Odyssey has a pretty good 
shot. That is, if she can maneuver the grocery store obstacle course of 
children shrieking "Sit! Sit!", runny packages of chicken parts, and of course, 
the temptations on the tile floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the market is a new stop for Odyssey, she's already conquered -- with 
considerable effort -- elevators, toy stores, malls and a police firing range. 
Next comes the bus, the train, perhaps even a movie theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more situations you expose them to, the better they're going to be with 
the person," Teter said. 
</P>
<P>
 And, she added, it's no more difficult than taking a child to the store. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easier. You can't put your kids on a leash," Teter said. "And you don't 
find any surprises in your shopping cart when you get to the checkout stand." 
</P>

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; COUNCIL CONSIDERING HEALTH CLUB ORDINANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Burbank City Council tonight will consider regulating health clubs with an 
ordinance requiring at least a $75,000 bond to ensure that membership fees can 
be returned if a club closes. 
</P>
<P>
 Checking the backgrounds of club owners is another element of the ordinance 
under consideration. If approved, the new ordinance would go into effect in 30 
days. In the meantime, a moratorium on issuing permits for health clubs that 
went into effect in December would be extended. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is also considering a permit fee of at least $100 for clubs. ED

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; HUD OFFERS RENT AID TO QUAKE VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Glendale Housing Authority is scheduled to vote today on whether to accept 
$2.2 million in emergency rental certificates from the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development is providing the city 
with the certificates, meant for low-income families who were displaced by the 
Jan. 17 earthquake, after assessing damage to the city's rental units, said Ray 
Vargas, housing programs administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale sustained more than $30.5 million in property damage from the 
6.8-magnitude temblor -- with a majority of these damages centered in the 
city's homes and apartment units, according to the city's office of emergency 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 About 600 of the city's 50,000 housing units, many of them made of masonry and 
brick, were labeled unsafe following the temblor, Vargas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the quake, the Community Development and Housing Department has received 
more than 400 applications for emergency housing assistance. More than 200 of 
these families have received approval for aid, including 120 families who found 
alternate housing using aid from the housing authority's current Section 8 
program.  
</P>
<P>
 Applicants for HUD assistance must fall below income limits of $16,900 a year 
for a one-person household, $19,300 a year for a family of two and $24,150 a 
year for a family of four. The city still has slots available to receive aid, 
Vargas said.  
</P>
<P>
 HUD assistance becomes available if a local building inspector determines that 
the house or apartment cannot be lived in, Vargas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Applicants, who are required to show they are a U.S. citizen or living here 
lawfully, must also provide documentation that the family lived in the house 
listed on an aid application.  
</P>
<P>
 HUD will reduce or increase funding available to the city depending on the 
demand for housing assistance, Vargas said. 
</P>
<P>
 After an 18-month period specified by the contract, residents will be required 
to enter into lease agreements with landlords without the rental subsidy, 
Vargas said. JENNIFER OLDHAM

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; COMPOST FROM RECYCLED SEWAGE TO BE OFFERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's nothing to sniff at: Within months, residents of the Las Virgenes area 
will be offered free compost made from the effluent of their own toilets. 
</P>
<P>
 Las Virgenes Municipal Water District officials say their new, $50-million 
compost plant will be rid of the foul smell of sewer sludge and suitable for 
use on their customers' flower and vegetable gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not set how it will happen," said district spokeswoman Bobbe Wymer. "But 
the district is committed to the idea of offering free compost to our customers 
who, you might say, have a personal investment in it." 
</P>
<P>
 The district already purifies waste water from the 20,000 homes it serves and 
uses most of it for irrigation. But with the start-up of the Rancho Las 
Virgenes Composting Facility later this month, the small water agency will 
become one of the world's first to recycle nearly all the water and solids from 
the sewage it collects. 
</P>
<P>
 Only about half a dozen agencies in the United States use such sophisticated 
indoor compost facilities. The city of Los Angeles sends most of its sewer 
sludge to farmland in Arizona and a simple outdoor compost facility in the San 
Joaquin Valley, but lets most treated waste water flow into the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 In a way, the Las Virgenes compost facility works like a digestive system in 
reverse. 
</P>
<P>
 At the upper end of the hillside plant, sewer solids flow from the Tapia Water 
Reclamation Facility through a two-mile pipe. The sludge will be kept in tanks 
for two months, while microscopic bugs feed on the harmful bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, the ooze will be spun dry and pushed through a series of conveyor belts 
to another building, where it will be mixed with sawdust and baked for another 
month. The entire facility is enclosed, to prevent odors from escaping. 
</P>
<P>
 "It kind of resembles what goes on inside the human body," said reclamation 
Supervisor Steve Witbeck. "Except that the product is somewhat nicer." 
</P>
<P>
 Some people may turn up their noses at the idea of shoveling cured human waste 
into their prize gardens. But the loamy stuff is valuable fertilizer, and a 
commercial company already has offered to provide sawdust in exchange for most 
of the compost produced at Las Virgenes. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility enables the district to avoid injecting sludge into its nearly 
saturated farm soil, as it does now, or paying a landfill to accept the solid 
waste, as do many districts. But officials concede that the plant will be no 
money maker. 
</P>
<P>
 "We justify it in ecological terms," Wymer said. "We take a lot of pride in 
the total beneficial reuse of resources." 
</P>
<P>
 Pride, along with a few snickers about the origin of the compost. 
</P>
<P>
 A visitor to Rancho Las Virgenes might see workers wearing shirts stenciled 
with "We're number 1 in the number 2 business" and probably would hear, at 
least once, a favorite slogan: "Compost happens." 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to have a sense of humor about it," Wymer said. "Look at what we're 
dealing with." KURT PITZER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; WATER DISTRICT FIRES GENERAL MANAGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Las Virgenes Municipal Water District board has terminated its contract 
with the agency's general manager in a disagreement over management style. 
</P>
<P>
 The board gave notice to Charles McClain after a closed-door meeting last week 
and plans to hire someone with a leadership approach that more closely 
resembles the hands-on style of McClain's predecessor, Edward E. McCombs, said 
board President Harold V. (Hal) Helsley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking for a little stronger leadership," Helsley said. "Mr. McCombs 
was constantly out there presenting material and making people think. Mr. 
McClain is a little more laissez-faire. It's not that he was lax, but we're 
looking for someone who will push the district's policies more." 
</P>
<P>
 The agency, which serves about 20,000 homes between Topanga Canyon and the 
Ventura County line, prides itself on an aggressive water-conservation agenda 
that includes public awareness programs and state-of-the-art reclamation 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "They prefer a person who is more externally oriented, and I don't function 
well in that type of a context," McClain said. "Our parting was amicable." 
</P>
<P>
 Helsley said differences between McClain and other managers also helped spur 
the board's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "There may have been some minor personality conflicts," Helsley said. "We just 
want to see more of a total team working together. The shoes of the previous 
manager were tremendous, and it's hard to get someone to fill them." 
</P>
<P>
 McClain was brought on board for the $100,000-a-year job two years ago, after 
McCombs retired. His contract expires April 3, Helsley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The board will probably appoint James E. Colbaugh, currently the director of 
planning and engineering at the district, as the new general manager, Helsley 
said. KURT PITZER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; SCHOOL PANEL TO DISCUSS INCREASING SECURITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Las Virgenes school board tonight will discuss whether to take steps to 
increase on-campus security that could cost the district nearly $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The security measures that will be considered by the board include the 
purchase of walkie-talkies for $12,000, conflict-resolution training for 
lunchtime monitors for $2,500, programs to promote student awareness, the 
hiring of campus security guards at $3,600 to $7,200 and fences around schools 
for $25,000-70,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Other options whose costs are not known at this time are surveillance cameras 
and more lights for school parking lots and other areas. Including these 
unknown costs, the total price tag for the measures is estimated to be just 
under $100,000, Assistant Supt. Donald Zimring said, for a school district 
whose annual budget is $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a district our size that's quite expensive," he said. "I don't anticipate 
that the board will adopt all of those recommendations." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, he said, there seems to be support for the purchase of two-way radios 
and for training for both supervisors and students. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue of youngsters not being wise to the ways of the world is a major 
one," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many principals and students are unenthusiastic about the prospect of putting 
up fences, saying they interfere with the feeling of openness and mar the 
overall appearance of the school, Zimring said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district is considering implementing the increased security measures after 
an incident in Simi Valley in which a student was stabbed and another incident 
in Thousand Oaks in which a gun was fired into a crowd, injuring three Westlake 
High School students. KAY HWANGBO

INDIA QUAKE VETERANS STUDY LOCAL RESPONSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 N. Raghunathan, chief secretary for the Indian state of Maharashtra, witnessed 
massive death and destruction in the 6.4-magnitude earthquake that killed more 
than 8,000 people in his country in September and caused nearly $800 million in 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, as he stood before the collapsed Northridge Meadows Apartments building 
Monday as part of an official delegation visiting from India, he was taken 
aback by the random destruction caused by the Jan. 17 Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing," Raghunathan said as he stared at the remains of the flattened 
three-story complex where 16 people died, while another three-story complex 
next to it did not collapse. "How could that happen?" 
</P>
<P>
 The four-member delegation from India was only the latest in a growing number 
of foreign government officials visiting Los Angeles to study the joint federal 
and state response to the 6.8-magnitude quake that killed 57 people. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past few weeks, government officials from Canada, Korea, Germany, 
France, Argentina, Chile and Taiwan have visited disaster relief centers and 
earthquake damage sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, 30 government officials from Japan visited an Earthquake Service 
Center in Chatsworth. They represented Japan's ministries of health and 
welfare, transport, posts and telecommunications and construction, as well as 
Japan's Fire Defense Agency, National Land Agency, Science and Technology 
Agency and National Police Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 There are many similarities among the Northridge and Killari, India, quakes. 
The Sept. 30 quake in a remote area of southwest India struck at 3:56 a.m., 
only 35 minutes minutes earlier than the one here. In both quakes, most people 
were asleep at the time and had very little time, if any, to escape. The 
immediate loss of electricity also left both areas in total darkness during the 
first few hours after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the dead in both quakes were crushed to death. 
</P>
<P>
 Both quakes also seemed to destroy some buildings while leaving others on the 
same block virtually untouched. The massive destruction in both quakes 
attracted curious spectators, which in the early hours of the Killari quake 
impeded relief efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuljit S. Sidhu, secretary and special commissioner with the earthquake relief 
and rehabilitation commission in Bombay, said the death toll was higher in 
India primarily because it hit densely populated villages where most of the 
homes were old and constructed of mud with stone rooftops. 
</P>
<P>
 "Killari was an area not prone to earthquakes," Sidhu said. "The buildings 
were very old and not built according to any seismic codes. After seeing the 
damage here, it seems you have buildings constructed to seismic codes." 
</P>
<P>
 The Indian delegation met with officials from the California Governor's Office 
of Emergency Services and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which are 
jointly coordinating post-quake assistance efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 The group then toured disaster sites, including Cal State Northridge, the 
Northridge Fashion Center and the Northridge Meadows Apartments, as well as an 
Earthquake Service Center in Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 Raghunathan said that unlike the disaster assistance process in the United 
States, in which centers were set up for victims to apply for aid, Indian 
government officials went to the people to offer help. Instead of assistance 
consisting of grants and low-interest loans, the Indian government awarded only 
grants. 
</P>
<P>
 "But in an urban area like this, this approach is probably best," Raghunathan 
said after touring the service center in Chatsworth. "I think they are doing a 
great job. I'm very impressed."

ALARCON DEPUTY QUITS 2 MONTHS AFTER TRANSFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A deputy to San Fernando Valley Councilman Richard Alarcon has quit only two 
months after he was reassigned amid allegations that he verbally abused 
constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 But in an interview, Leo Briones, who left his post Friday, said he did not 
quit because of his transfer from community liaison to manager of the office's 
mail operations. Instead, he said, it was because he was offered a more 
appealing job. 
</P>
<P>
 Briones, who served as Alarcon's press secretary during the councilman's June 
campaign, said he has taken a job as vice president of Howell Communications 
Group, a public relations firm in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 He said his departure from Alarcon's office was amicable and he is likely to 
work with Alarcon again. "Richard and I are good friends," he said. 
"Professionally, I have the highest regard for Richard." 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon conceded that Briones probably had not been happy with his new duties 
overseeing the constituent mail operations, but agreed that there are no hard 
feelings. "Leo's my friend," Alarcon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Briones was transferred in January after allegations that he yelled and used 
profanity with constituents. Although Alarcon said at the time that Briones had 
not been demoted, he conceded that Briones "rubbed some people the wrong way." 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon said that after his election, Briones originally had sought the job of 
press relations officer, but that duty was passed on to another aide, Sybil 
MacDonald. Because of that, Alarcon said he was not surprised that Briones had 
taken the public relations job. 
</P>
<P>
 MacDonald said a replacement for Briones had not yet been chosen. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, Alarcon launched the biggest staff shake-up in his young tenure 
when he hired Mayor Richard Riordan's press secretary, Annette Castro, to be 
his chief City Hall adviser and head of his media operations. 
</P>
<P>
 His previous chief of staff in City Hall, Lupe Vela, was assigned to head up 
Alarcon's field operations.

PROSECUTION SAYS ACCUSED HOME DEPOT KILLER HAD DRUG PLAN; COURTS: SEAN DARNELL 
SLADE COULD FACE DEATH PENALTY IF CONVICTED IN FATAL SHOOTING OF GUARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOM MROZEK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Calling it a "brutal assassination," a prosecutor asked a jury Monday to 
convict a prison parolee in the shooting death of an armored guard, a case that 
could lead to the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Sean Darnell Slade, 27, faces murder charges in the July 20, 1992, 
execution-style slaying of Edwin Maldonado during a robbery at a Home Depot 
hardware store in San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Cynthia L. Ulfig portrayed Slade as a hardened criminal who 
developed a plan to obtain a large sum of cash so he could purchase drugs and 
become a dealer. 
</P>
<P>
 "This plan probably started to form while he was in custody," Ulfig said. "He 
wanted to buy a 'dope sack' and they would be on Easy Street," the prosecutor 
said, referring to Slade and his wife, Jalanda Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 Slade was paroled from state prison after being convicted of manslaughter in 
1988, only 25 days before the Home Depot case. 
</P>
<P>
 Slade had several friends who worked at the hardware store -- friends who were 
not at work "when the bullets flew" -- and he knew the armored courier arrived 
at about same time every day, Ulfig said during her closing argument. 
</P>
<P>
 Slade said he had set up a "lick," meaning "where you lick the place clean, 
where there are no witnesses left," the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 The robbers snuck up behind Maldonado, 26, who had just removed $82,000 from 
the Home Depot safe, and fired into the back of his head before he had a chance 
to turn around, according to evidence presented at the trial. The gunman then 
stood over the guard as he lay on the ground and pumped two more bullets into 
his head, witnesses testified. 
</P>
<P>
 A Home Depot employee, who was standing just a few feet from the guard when he 
was shot, identified Slade as the killer. 
</P>
<P>
 A police officer testified that with the $42,000 in cash obtained in the 
robbery -- the balance was in checks -- a person could have bought more than 
five pounds of cocaine that could have been cooked into crack cocaine. "That 
$42,000 investment would yield you a quarter-million dollars tax-free," Ulfig 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 When jurors begin deliberations, a process expected to begin Wednesday, they 
will weigh charges of murder and special circumstances of murder during a 
robbery and while lying in wait. 
</P>
<P>
 If the jury convicts Slade of murder and either of the special circumstance 
charges, it will be reconvened to determine if he should be executed or spend 
the rest of his life in prison without the possibility of parole.

MAN FACING 14 YEARS GETS 4 1/2 FOR DRUG SALE; COURTS: EX-CONVICT BECAME AN 
ACTIVIST WHILE OUT ON BAIL. BUT THE DETECTIVE WHO MADE ARREST FEELS BETRAYED BY 
JUDGE'S DECISION. 
</P>

<P>
 In a decision that dismayed police and prosecutors, a federal judge sentenced 
an ex-convict who confessed to selling drugs near a Pacoima school to 4 1/2 
years in prison Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr. ignored the provisions of an agreement 
in which Bobbie Marshall pleaded guilty in exchange for a 14-year prison term. 
Hatter further reduced the sentence because Marshall has devoted his life to 
community service since his arrest, according to the prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel betrayed by the U.S. attorney's office," said Los Angeles Police 
Detective Everett Berry, who arrested Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. Steven Madison said his office may appeal the sentence, 
which was half of the nine-year term his office had agreed to. Because Marshall 
was in custody for 18 months awaiting trial, his sentence was further reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall was charged in a nine-count indictment after his arrest in 1989 for 
selling crack cocaine from his home, located across the street from the Vaughn 
Learning Center in Pacoima. At that time, he faced a life term without 
possibility of parole if convicted due to three prior drug-dealing convictions, 
Madison said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the deal made in 1991, Marshall pleaded guilty to a single felony count 
of possession of crack cocaine with the intent to distribute near a schoolyard 
in exchange for a 14-year federal prison term. Marshall's lawyer, Denise Meyer, 
could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Since he was freed on bail in 1990, Marshall's sentencing was delayed because 
Hatter allowed him to continue his volunteer work. Marshall became a committed 
community activist, said Madison, leading prosecutors to agree to the further 
reduction in his sentence to nine years. 
</P>
<P>
 "He performed laudable community work and he is on the way to rehabilitating 
himself," said Madison. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case is very unique," said Madison. "The judge took a chance on him and 
it worked out." 
</P>
<P>
 Based on Marshall's record of service, prosecutors also decided not to object 
to Hatter's repeated decisions to postpone sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall helped the children at Vaughn Learning Center by speaking about drugs 
and gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughn Principal Yvonne Chan said she was shocked to learn that Marshall had 
admitted selling cocaine near her school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I must have seen Bobbie's good side," Chan said Monday. "He has not done 
anything to hurt this school or the children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Has he done everything he can for the community? Yes. Can I vouch for the 
good work he did for the past three years? Yes," Chan said.

RACIAL SCUFFLES BREAK OUT IN COURTHOUSE LOCKUPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 About 35 to 40 African American and Latino inmates scuffled in lockups Monday 
in Santa Clarita and Van Nuys courthouses, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two inmates at Van Nuys Superior Court were treated for minor injuries as a 
result of a five-minute fight at about 11:30 a.m., said Sgt. Robert Stoneman, a 
spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 One man was cut over his left eye in a three-minute battle at a court lockup 
in Santa Clarita that occurred around 10:30 a.m., said Deputy Benita Hinojos. 
Authorities said the fights were unrelated. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest skirmishes at Santa Clarita and Van Nuys are part of a series of 
battles between African American and Latino inmates. There have been similar 
outbreaks at West Los Angeles, Downtown and Santa Monica court lockups in 
recent months. The fights began after more than 1,000 black and Latino inmates 
battled at the Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho in early January. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Van Nuys court, African American and Latino inmates are segregated 
"whenever possible," said Sheriff's Lt. Dave Long, a court supervisor. But the 
Northridge earthquake damaged some portions of the San Fernando court and has 
created an overflow at Van Nuys, Long said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the 80-prisoner lockup facility has been near capacity most of the 
time and well beyond its capacity on Mondays, when inmates pack Van Nuys 
courtrooms for arraignments and other court hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Inmates are always separated by sexual preference, gender, age, gang 
affiliation and whenever there is a known history of conflict between two 
individuals, Long said.

CRASH ON GOLDEN STATE FREEWAY TRAPS 3 PEOPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three Bakersfield residents were trapped for more than two hours Monday when a 
Ford Explorer rear-ended their pickup truck at about 60 m.p.h, pushing it into 
the back of a semitrailer truck stuck in a traffic jam on the Golden State 
Freeway, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we first got there, we had three people who were awake, alert, conscious 
and talking, but pinned in the pickup truck," CHP Officer Wendy Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County firefighters worked for more than two hours to dismantle 
the pickup truck to free the trapped motorists, who were airlifted to Henry 
Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the Explorer, Wayne Reynolds, 35, of Castaic, was not injured in 
the crash, she added. He told investigators that he did not realize that 
traffic had halted until a car swerved in front of him as he approached the 
line of stalled cars on the northbound side of the freeway near the Magic 
Mountain Parkway exit, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wendy Wurster, 22, who suffered minor bruises in the accident, was admitted to 
the Valencia hospital, said a nursing supervisor. Her mother, Suzie Roggention, 
was treated there for minor cuts and bruises, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Christy Matheson, 22, also of Bakersfield, was admitted to Holy Cross Medical 
Center in Mission Hills, suffering from deep cuts on her left knee and back 
pains, a nursing supervisor there said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent Galarza, 36, of Caldwell, Ida., driver of the semitrailer truck, was 
treated for minor injuries and released, said a nursing supervisor.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; SMALL BUSINESS CENTER AWARDED $30,000 GRANT; 
ASSISTANCE: THE SANTA CLARITA FACILITY WILL USE THE STATE COMMUNITY COLLEGE 
SYSTEM'S MONEY TO HELP MERCHANTS RECOVER FROM THE EARTHQUAKE. 
</P>

<P>
 The state community college system has granted $30,000 to a local small 
business center to provide long-term assistance to businesses still suffering 
from the Northridge earthquake, a city official said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that during the next three months, the center at College of the 
Canyons, at 26455 Rockwell Canyon Road, will offer free individual counseling 
sessions and 10 special workshops aimed at hundreds of local business owners 
who are attempting to recover from the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody who wants help should get in on this," said Gail Foy, city 
spokeswoman. "This counseling can help people get back on their feet." 
</P>
<P>
 The grant from the Chancellor's Office of California Community Colleges will 
pay for two additional workers at the center, which was jointly launched three 
years ago by the city and The Newhall Land and Farming Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The recently hired accountant and financial adviser will provide assistance in 
applying for state and federal aid packages and give financial advice on 
operating small businesses, said Mike Haviland, city economic developer. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a flood of people going for (Small Business Administration) loans 
right now and what we're doing is trying to build up the capacity to handle 
that," Haviland said. "There are lots of questions on how to fill out forms and 
on how the system works in general." 
</P>
<P>
 Haviland said the grant would pay for the two new workers to focus on such 
questions for the next six months. He said that so far there has been no sign 
of a slowdown in people requesting help. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how long this will last," he said. "But it's not done yet -- I 
can see that."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; MAN SOUGHT IN DISAPPEARANCE OF 3-YEAR-OLD BOY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies are searching for a man who disappeared with his 
girlfriend's 3-year-old grandson and her check for $2,300 she gave him to 
deposit more than one week ago, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph Courtney Sykes, 39, left girlfriend Beverly Ann Smith's Newhall home 
last Tuesday, supposedly headed for a bank to deposit a Federal Emergency 
Management Agency check for $2,300 into her account, said Deputy Rich Erickson 
of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Montice Kaylon Williams, 3, was with Sykes when he drove off in Smith's 
two-door, gray 1976 Oldsmobile Starfire, which bears a California license plate 
number of 868-RVA, Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, 41, fears for her grandson's safety because she said that Sykes is a 
cocaine addict, and may have taken the boy and the check to South-Central Los 
Angeles where he apparently has connections to obtain drugs, Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith reported her grandson missing and her car stolen last week, Erickson 
said. She has discussed the disappearance of the check with detectives, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sykes is African American, 5-feet-9 and weighs about 148 pounds. Montice has 
brown hair and brown eyes, is about 3 feet tall and weighs about 35 pounds. He 
was wearing a white T-shirt, a gray sweat shirt, a black jacket and black 
tennis shoes, authorities said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; 
SUPERINTENDENT SEEKS MORE SCHOOL POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles schools Supt. Sid Thompson called on the Board of Education to 
spend $3.5 million to hire 22 school police officers and retain 300 campus 
security aides as part of a program to prevent violence unveiled Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson also recommended that all school principals work with teachers and 
parents to devise a safety plan that includes anti-violence curriculum as well 
as safety precautions around campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Education praised the initiatives and several members said they 
will push hard to allocate money for the safety officers during upcoming budget 
debates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how we can afford not to do this," said school board member Mark 
Slavkin. 
</P>
<P>
 With the additional school police, an officer will be assigned to every 
district high school and middle school. Because of state funding cuts, the 
district must come up with $2.3 million to continue its campus security aide 
program, which places safety officers at schools.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; CAMPAIGN MATERIALS CRITICIZED IN COUNCIL RACE; 
POLITICS: CARL BOYER'S POSTING OF CITY HALL PHONE NUMBER ON HIS BILLBOARDS AND 
JILL KLAJIC'S USE OF ALTERED CITY LOGO DRAW FIRE. BOTH ARE INCUMBENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Controversy continued Monday over what City Council candidates must, may or -- 
in the most recent scuffle -- may not print on their campaign signs and 
literature. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbents Carl Boyer and Jill Klajic both have drawn criticism for reelection 
materials that some say are linked too closely to the elected posts that they 
now hold. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics believe that Boyer shouldn't print the Santa Clarita City Hall's main 
telephone number on his billboards alongside his home phone number, saying it 
costs the city money to answer those calls. They also object to Klajic's recent 
use of the city logo on letters asking for financial support in her reelection 
bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Receiving campaign-related calls on city phone lines is acceptable under 
campaign laws, said City Atty. Carl Newton, although making outgoing calls 
would be a violation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The limitation is that city resources cannot be used for personal purposes," 
said Newton. "I don't see this as a city expense of substance." 
</P>
<P>
 Boyer, 56, defended his use of the number, saying that he is not using his 
city office for reelection efforts and that he printed the city number because 
it is a convenient place to pick up messages. 
</P>
<P>
 "Giving out my work phone number and home phone number is typical of what I've 
done for years," said Boyer. "I've never had anyone calling about (the) 
campaign . . . come in on a city phone line." 
</P>
<P>
 Boyer said he'll be happy to tell anyone who calls the city regarding his 
reelection efforts to call him back on his home telephone, but that he has no 
plans to take the phone number off the billboards. 
</P>
<P>
 The placards have not generated any additional phone calls into the city 
switchboard since they were put up at the end of February, said Debbie Porter, 
who handles incoming calls to that phone number. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't had any more calls for him than normal," Porter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar complaints were recently lodged against Klajic, when a mailer that she 
distributed included a slightly modified version of Santa Clarita's city logo, 
positioned on top of her name and title. 
</P>
<P>
 Although shaded differently and printed in blue, some critics felt that the 
symbol of a trail over grass hills and an oak tree is too close to Santa 
Clarita's blue, white, green and brown seal. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Boyer, Klajic was quick to correct the perceived problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "We heard about (the criticism) three or four days ago," said Klajic, 47. "As 
soon as we did, we trashed all our materials" bearing the logo. 
</P>
<P>
 About 900 copies of the letter had been recently mailed to residents, 
following an earlier mailing of 500 copies that generated no complaints, she 
said. About 1,000 letters were destroyed after she learned that it was a policy 
violation, Klajic said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I (had) checked to see if there was an ordinance against using the city seal, 
and there wasn't," Klajic said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Santa Clarita has no specific laws prohibiting use of its logo, 
residents must apply to the city for permission, and Klajic never did, Newton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city does have the power to control the city seal," said Newton. "We get 
a lot of requests for use of the city seal, but we turn most of those down." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the latest in the continuing saga of campaign-material complaints in 
Santa Clarita's council race. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half of the 13 candidates were tripped up by a city disclosure 
ordinance passed in December, 1992, requiring that all published or displayed 
campaign materials list who paid for them. 
</P>
<P>
 All three incumbents violated the ordinance by not indicating who financed the 
materials, including Boyer and Councilwoman Jo Anne Darcy -- who approved the 
ordinance -- and Klajic, who had called for even stricter requirements. 
Challengers Tim Jorgensen, Clyde Smyth and Linda Storli similarly failed to 
indicate who paid for their placards. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidate Fred Heiser brought the issue to the attention of Santa Clarita's 
city clerk, prompting the mailing of reminder letters to candidates. Heiser did 
have the disclosure on his signs, but he violated the ordinance because the 
typeface was too small. 
</P>
<P>
 Only candidate Dennis Farnham correctly followed the legislation, and he took 
his 50 signs down last week out of concern that he might have been in 
violation. The race's five other candidates, including two who dropped out of 
the race last month, have never posted signs. 
</P>
<P>
 More coverage of the Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys appears today on B6.

THE WEEK AHEAD: TOKYO; CHRISTOPHER IN ASIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher visits Tokyo this week, and is scheduled 
to go on to Beijing, facing crisis talks at both stops. His meetings in Tokyo, 
which begin Wednesday, will concentrate on growing trade frictions.The Clinton 
Administration's decision to renew a provision of trade law that could be used 
to retaliate against Japanese imports has produced a wave of protests in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S.-China relations have reached a low point because of China's human rights 
record. State Department officials hinted last week that Christopher may skip 
the Beijing visit altogether, but so far it remains on. 
</P>
<P>
 On his way home next Monday, the secretary plans to stop in the Russian Far 
East port of Vladivostok for talks with Russian Foreign Minister Andrei A. 
Kozyrev.

MEDIA; FROM MONGOLIA TO MOSCOW, TRACKING THE LIN PIAO MYSTERY; JOURNALIST FINDS 
NEW EVIDENCE ON 1971 DISAPPEARANCE OF CHINA'S NO. 2 LEADER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In his rattling Russian jeep, Peter Hannam was bouncing across the Mongolian 
steppe 200 miles east of Ulan Bator when he spotted the solitary man astride a 
white horse descending a distant hill. The rider, sky-blue cloak and orange 
sash flapping in the bitterly cold wind, was the only sign of humanity on the 
vast and barren plain. 
</P>
<P>
 Hannam instructed his driver to leave the dirt track and intersect the rider's 
path. 
</P>
<P>
 Possibly, Hannam thought, the horseman would know the place where Chinese 
Communist leader Lin Piao's airplane had crashed under mysterious circumstances 
more than 21 years before. He sensed he must be getting close to the crash 
site. Earlier in the day he encountered villagers who bragged of owning pots 
and pans made from the Trident aircraft's aluminum fuselage. 
</P>
<P>
 Close up, he could see that the horseman was elderly, with silver hair and a 
craggy face ravaged by the extreme climate of Mongolia, where temperatures in 
the Gobi Desert range between 105 and 50 degrees below zero.  
</P>
<P>
 "To find the airplane," the old man said, showing no surprise at encountering 
a foreigner and his small entourage on the remote steppe, "you must first find 
the Marshal."  
</P>
<P>
 Thus began the journey that led Hannam, a 29-year-old free-lance journalist, 
on an international quest to solve one of the greatest mysteries of Asia: What 
happened to Lin Piao, the Chinese Communist Party leader accused of a 1971 plot 
to overthrow Chairman Mao and, according to some accounts, shot down over 
Mongolia as he tried to escape to the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Six months and six countries later in a Moscow military morgue, Hannam 
obtained a KGB file that until that moment had been seen by only four other 
men: two Soviet pathologists and the late Soviet leaders Leonid I. Brezhnev and 
Yuri V. Andropov, the latter when he was head of the KGB. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the KGB file, two extensive Soviet secret autopsies conducted at 
the site of the crash near a fluorite-mining village in north-central Mongolia 
proved without a doubt that Lin Piao, once Chairman Mao's handpicked successor, 
had been killed in the crash, as were Lin's wife and son. 
</P>
<P>
 The newly unveiled evidence ended years of wild speculation and conspiracy 
theories about Lin Piao's bizarre end that, in Asia at least, rivaled those 
surrounding the John F. Kennedy assassination in the United States. Scholars of 
the Lin Piao era in Chinese history praised Hannam's work, reported in articles 
that appeared last month in Hong Kong, Russian and U.S. publications, including 
U.S. News & World Report. 
</P>
<P>
 "In terms of the physical evidence he collected, it is a major step forward," 
said Kau Ying-mao, a China specialist at Brown University and author of a book 
about the Lin Piao affair. 
</P>
<P>
 For the historians, Hannam's work was confirmation of an important detail in 
the era of the Cultural Revolution. Lin Piao, after all, was the creator of 
Mao's "Little Red Book" of quotations. One of the most famous photos of that 
era shows the diminutive Lin standing next to Mao at Tian An Men Square during 
a review of the Red Guards. 
</P>
<P>
 But in an age dominated by television, Hannam's work was a throwback to an 
earlier era, when roving free-lance reporters went to the ends of the earth in 
search of a good story. Global television ended most of the ends-of-the-earth 
stuff. Satellite feeds make Somalia beach landings look like another episode 
from "Baywatch."  
</P>
<P>
 The itinerant free-lancer, Stanley in search of Dr. Livingston, is a 
disappearing breed. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there is Mongolia.  
</P>
<P>
 Mongolia was practically virgin territory for journalists when Hannam arrived 
there in 1991, one of the first resident Western reporters -- and for almost 
two years the only one -- in one of the most remote regions on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Until popular demonstrations ended one-party rule in 1990, Mongolia was the de 
facto 16th republic of the Soviet Union for more than 65 years.  
</P>
<P>
 Outside Ulan Bator, the dreary, frigid capital, conditions are extremely 
primitive. Half the population still lives in hemispherical tents called yurts. 
One-third of the population, like the man on the white horse, are nomadic 
tribesmen. 
</P>
<P>
 In the capital, cultural life revolves around the stolid, Stalinist-inspired 
Ulan Bator Hotel. The hotel is a magnet for every variety of adventurer, con 
man, vamp, born-again missionary, oil and mineral prospector and dinosaur bone 
hunter the world has left to offer. One regular visitor is a tall, bearded 
cross-dresser from Venice Beach who publishes a Mongolia newsletter. Another in 
Hannam's time was Indian Ambassador Kushok Bakula Rimpoche. In addition to his 
ambassadorial duties, Bakula, from the Ladakh region of India, is considered by 
many followers to be a reincarnation of Buddha. "India dispatched a god as its 
envoy to Ulan Bator," said Hannam admiringly.  
</P>
<P>
 In short, the hotel was a perfect work environment for a free-lancer like 
Hannam. Also, it was usually warm inside. If power failures deprived the rest 
of Ulan Bator, the hotel was a welcome refuge. 
</P>
<P>
 When he first arrived, Hannam moved into the neighborhood of Ulan Bator named, 
literally, Outer Space. It seemed to fit. How Hannam ended up in Outer Space, 
Mongolia, is mostly a tale of career mismatches and Asian yearnings. 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating from Harvard University magna cum laude in 1987 with a degree 
in social studies, Hannam returned to his native Australia. His first job was 
in the personnel department of a chocolate factory. That didn't last. "Most of 
my time was spent trying to find an efficient way to sack people," Hannam 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he tried banking in Hong Kong. Also no good. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hannam had attended high school in Singapore and developed a passion for 
Asia. At Harvard, his senior thesis was on non-governmental political 
organizations in Indonesia, where he spent a year doing research. So in 1991, 
he quit a radio job in Australia and came to Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 A radio job he had been promised in Beijing fell through. Attempts to find 
permanent work with newspapers and news agencies also failed. His Chinese visa 
was expiring. 
</P>
<P>
 So in September, 1991, he leaped at the opportunity to accompany his friend 
and Harvard classmate Susan Lawrence, a journalist working in Beijing, to Ulan 
Bator, where Lawrence was covering a visit by the Dalai Lama. 
</P>
<P>
 Hannam and Lawrence went straight from the airport to Gandan Monastery, where 
the Dalai Lama was giving an audience. The Mongolian authorities, unlike the 
dour government officials in Beijing, had been warm and welcoming to the 
visitors. They actually invited reporters into their newly reopened land. 
</P>
<P>
 Hannam quickly realized that Mongolia meant opportunity. "All foreigners had 
been locked out for two generations. Only a handful of academics followed the 
country through the pages of the official Mongolian Truth newspaper. I realized 
that any story I picked would be reported upon for the first time." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, it was a brilliant autumn. "The mountains were gold and the sky blue 
and the weather was still above freezing." Winter seemed far away. In his first 
week in Ulan Bator, his apartment was burglarized and his computer equipment, 
as well as much of his cold weather gear, stolen.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite the early hardships, he broke a story about managers of the Mongolian 
central bank squandering the country's entire $90-million foreign reserve in 
risky foreign exchange dealings. He accompanied Japanese archeologists on a 
hunt for the lost tomb of Genghis Khan, who the Japanese claimed was originally 
a samurai warrior. 
</P>
<P>
 But his biggest story, and biggest adventure, was chasing the mystery of Lin 
Piao. 
</P>
<P>
 The quest began in May, 1993. Hannam, 5-foot-10, thin and bespectacled with a 
mop of dark brown hair, rented a jeep from the Mongolian People's Revolutionary 
Party -- the ruling Communist Party in the Soviet era -- and set off in search 
of the crash site. "We just pointed the jeep not really knowing what we would 
find." 
</P>
<P>
 Two hundred miles east of Ulan Bator, near the fluorite-mining burg of Bekh, 
they encountered the lone rider on the white horse. The Marshal recommended as 
a source by the rider turned out to be an elderly village gadfly so named 
because of his penchant for wearing Soviet medals and campaign ribbons pinned 
to his chest. 
</P>
<P>
 So willing was the Marshal to join in the quest that he first jumped into the 
jeep wearing his nightshirt. 
</P>
<P>
 After Hannam reassured him that there was time to dress, the Marshal slipped 
into his beribboned jacket and led the party to the crash site. For years after 
the crash, wolves had lived in the plane's shell. It provided roosts for eagles 
and vultures. But after two decades of salvaging by local residents, only a few 
strips of the plane, the longest about two feet in length, remained when Hannam 
arrived.  
</P>
<P>
 Other residents of Bekh led Hannam to the plot where the bodies found on the 
Trident 1E aircraft were first buried. Finally, two eyewitnesses to the crash 
surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
 One of them, Dugarjavyn Dunjidmaa, chain-smoked cigarettes rolled in scraps of 
newspaper and told how she saw the crash while she was on guard duty at the 
Bekh explosives depot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard some roaring and wondered what was going on," she told Hannam. "I 
took my rifle and went out." She said she saw flames pouring out of the rear 
engines of the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Ulan Bator, Hannam kept on the case, interviewing two dozen people who 
had some role in the investigation of the crash while continuing his work as a 
free-lance journalist. One of his duties as a local stringer for several 
newspapers and Reuters news service was to make a daily check of the coal 
supply at the power plant to see if the Mongolian capital would survive the 
winter. During some cold spells, the coal stock dwindled to a two-day supply. 
</P>
<P>
 From often-wandering interviews conducted in the padded vinyl chairs on the 
fourth floor of the Ulan Bator Hotel, Hannam began to collect details of field 
autopsies conducted by Soviet pathologists. 
</P>
<P>
 One source described how the Soviets severed the heads and boiled the skulls 
of the crash victims to remove the hair and flesh. From another source he 
obtained a photograph of the Soviet specialists at a dinner with Mongolian 
officials at the site. The centerpiece was a huge roasted ram, horns still 
intact. 
</P>
<P>
 He also learned that the visiting Soviets were from the 3rd Medical Institute 
in Moscow and that one of the lead pathologists was named Vitali Tomilin. Armed 
with this promising material, Hannam used some of his free-lance earnings to 
buy an Aeroflot airplane ticket to the Russian capital. 
</P>
<P>
 But that trip turned out to be the low point of his quest. It was August, 
1993. The 3rd Medical Institute, for one thing, no longer existed. By visiting 
morgues all over the Russian capital and showing photographs of the Russians 
feasting on the horned ram, Hannam finally met someone who knew Tomilin and 
where he could be found, working as a consultant in a military morgue. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tomilin, who held the official rank of professor-general, refused to talk 
without permission from the KGB. 
</P>
<P>
 "Was Lin Piao among the dead found in the crash?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Can't say." 
</P>
<P>
 "Why not?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Oath of secrecy." 
</P>
<P>
 August is the month many Russian officials spend in their rural dachas. It was 
clear that Hannam's visa would expire before he would hear from the KGB. He 
would need to return to Moscow a second time.  
</P>
<P>
 He discovered, noting the irony, that round-trip air fare prices to the United 
States were less expensive than a one-way ticket back to Ulan Bator. Despite 
the setbacks in his story, U.S. News had chipped in with a modest advance to 
help him follow his leads, so Hannam opted to travel to Washington and Los 
Angeles, stay with friends and pursue leads on a Taiwan angle of his story.  
</P>
<P>
 Among those he interviewed was former Taiwan intelligence chief Lt. Gen. Chang 
Shih-chi, 74 years old and retired in Alhambra. Chang gave details of an 
exchange of secret messages allegedly initiated by Lin Piao to Chiang Kai-shek. 
</P>
<P>
 The messages suggested that Lin Piao, although viewed internationally as 
Chairman Mao's most faithful supporter, had fallen from favor and might be 
willing to defect to archenemy Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, Hannam met someone who knew Zhang Ning, the former fiancee of 
Lin Piao's son, Lin Liguo, alleged by the Chinese to be one of the principal 
authors of the plot against Mao. Zhang, who now lives in New Jersey, had been 
present in the Beidaihe resort compound on the coast of China the night Lin 
Piao's plane took off and headed toward Mongolia and the Soviet Union beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracking her down through a restaurant in New York's Chinatown, Hannam 
arranged to meet Zhang at the Plaza hotel on the edge of Central Park. A former 
dancer, daughter of one of the men who accompanied Mao on his famous Long 
March, Zhang had lost little of her beauty that won the heart of Lin Piao's 
son. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid quacking ducks, she spoke for several hours with Hannam in Central Park. 
She described the Lin family desperation and frantic drive to the airport on 
that night in 1971.  
</P>
<P>
 Hannam's biggest breakthrough, however, came on his return trip to Moscow on 
Oct. 31, after the Moscow capital's first heavy autumn snowfall. Tomilin, he 
was delighted to learn, had been granted permission to speak. Walking between 
stretchers and autopsy materials in a main Moscow military morgue, Hannam and 
an interpreter went to Tomilin's fourth-floor office. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining Tomilin was Gen. Alexander Vasilievich Zagvozdin, a retired KGB 
investigator who had been part of the Mongolia Soviet autopsy team. The 
pathologists, inured to the morbidity of the surroundings, ordered tea and 
cakes from the morgue's bakery. It was Zagvozdin who said that, before this 
date, they had shared their findings with just two other men, then-KGB chief 
Andropov and Communist Party leader Brezhnev. 
</P>
<P>
 "Virtually the second sentence in the conversation was the confirmation that 
Lin Piao had died in the crash," Hannam said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pulling out a sheaf of grisly photographs and materials, Tomilin detailed how 
he had matched wartime wounds to Lin Piao's head, documented in the old Soviet 
medical records and in rare photographs, with grooves in the skull found at the 
crash site.  
</P>
<P>
 The Soviets, it turned out, had extensive medical and dental records on Lin 
from a 1938-41 stay in Moscow when he received extensive treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dead people don't talk," Zagvozdin told Hannam. "There are not names written 
down on their skulls or identification. You have to have photos of them when 
they were alive, and then compare the smiling person and the photograph of the 
rotten corpse." 
</P>
<P>
 The KGB, for example, had in its files a rare photo of a hatless Lin that 
showed clearly an indentation on the right side of Lin's skull where he had 
been wounded. Dental records ("they had a lot of gold in their mouths") also 
matched perfectly. Measurements of the lengths of the corpses matched the 
heights of the couple. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could have made my determination from the shape of his earlobe alone," 
Tomilin told Hannam. "Or just by comparing the dental work. Or just by 
photo-fitting the skull and his photograph. All three tests proved conclusive, 
plus the height, age and his wartime wounds. It couldn't have been better." 
</P>
<P>
 Tomilin said the Soviets carted the heads of Lin Piao and his wife back to 
Moscow, where in all likelihood they are stored in a KGB vault. 
</P>
<P>
 But just to be absolutely sure about the identity, he said the pathologists 
returned to Mongolia a second time and dug up the bodies, searching for a trace 
of tuberculosis in Lin's charred lungs that they had neglected to find on the 
first autopsy. Tuberculosis causes the lungs to harden, leaving a bony material 
detectable to specialists.  
</P>
<P>
 The Soviets had X-ray records showing the tuberculosis. "We found it there, on 
exactly the same spot on the right lung," Tomilin said. 
</P>
<P>
 This was clearly the high point of Hannam's quest. Yet he said he felt a 
strange letdown hearing the overwhelming proof of the Soviet pathologists. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I was hoping that they would say there was no Lin Piao among the 
dead. But after the first wave of disappointment, I realized that I was looking 
at something historic. It was the first independent proof that Lin was in 
Mongolia." 
</P>
<P>
 Hannam celebrated his success over a bottle of Italian white wine at a Moscow 
pizza parlor. The wine and pizza were a stunning extravagance. But after 
solving an important part of the mystery of Lin Piao, he felt he had earned it.

<P>
 Uprooted by war, forced to flee famine and flood, made homeless by economic 
and political upheaval, millions of frightened and largely forgotten people are 
moving across the global landscape, creating a new crisis for the post-Cold War 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 No corner of the world is exempt. In the 1990s, the migrants -- the 
"internally displaced" -- can be found in European capitals, remote African 
villages, Asian industrial sites and the mountains of Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to seek aid and comfort across national frontiers, the displaced are 
not refugees in the classic sense. Instead, they are trapped within their own 
borders, often still exposed to crisis conditions, and usually deemed by the 
world community to be someone else's problem. Judy Mayotte, an American relief 
worker and author, dubs them the "disposable people." 
</P>
<P>
 The dimensions are daunting. While the world is awash with 18 million 
refugees, the internally displaced now total more than 24 million, according to 
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and private refugee groups. And their ranks 
are growing fast. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the course of this decade, a total of 200 million to 500 million people 
are expected to be internally displaced at least temporarily, according to the 
Washington-based Refugee Policy Group. The pace of growth is far higher than 
that of refugees or the world population in general. 
</P>
<P>
 "The situation of the internally uprooted threatens to become one of the most 
explosive issues of the coming decades," said Mahbub ul-Haq, chief adviser to 
the U.N. Development Program. "It's a sleeper issue of the 21st Century." 
</P>
<P>
 Although an awesome problem, it is not a new one. The displaced have been a 
problem throughout history. 
</P>
<P>
 In this century, a prominent legacy of both world wars was the displacement of 
huge populations across both Europe and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in the post-Cold War period, the situation is intense because most 
countries are increasingly reluctant to take in foreigners as refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 In a world devoid of ideological competition, there are no political points to 
score, only a physical and social burden and indefinite expense to absorb. The 
result is burgeoning numbers who can't stay at home but who also can't cross 
borders. So they drift within their countries, looking for safety and 
sustenance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many would be refugees if they could, but today they don't have that 
opportunity. Barriers are going up and doors are closing all over the world," 
said Bill Frelick, senior policy analyst at the U.S. Committee for Refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 Afghanistan, past and present, is illustrative. After the 1979 Soviet invasion 
and occupation, 3 million Afghans fled to Pakistan, which was encouraged by 
hefty Western aid to take them in. Most remained for a decade, until the Soviet 
army withdrew from their homeland in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Afghanistan is aflame again in a civil war among political and religious 
factions that broke out at the first of the year. Once again, masses of Afghans 
are fleeing contested areas. But this time, without the Cold War factor that 
led to Western support, Pakistan has closed the door. It now requires travel 
documents, a tactic designed to keep asylum-seekers out, Frelick said. And no 
foreign donors are rushing in to help. While their factional leaders were once 
welcomed at the White House, war-weary Afghans are now virtually forgotten in 
Western capitals. 
</P>
<P>
 But Western disinterest does not make the problem go away. The displaced are a 
product of many factors. The projected tenfold or twentyfold increase will be 
influenced mainly by the breakdown of nations and changes in the nature of 
conflict, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
 Where wars once were largely conducted between states, they now increasingly 
take place within a single country. Internal war or unrest, for example, has 
produced the 10 biggest crises worldwide: in Sudan, South Africa, Mozambique, 
Angola, the Philippines, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Liberia, Ethiopia, Azerbaijan and 
Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 Urban warfare, aerial bombardment, long-range artillery and changes in 
strategy have also shifted front lines from rural to densely populated 
settings. Wars once tended to be fought in the countryside by uniformed armies. 
But today, ordinary people are under fire, and increasingly they are taking 
flight. In World War I, 5% of casualties were civilian. The figure increased to 
more than 50% in World War II, according to statistics of the Refugee Policy 
Group. In the 1990s, up to 90% of casualties in war-torn areas are civilian. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnia is the most vivid case. The two-year-long Serbian siege of Sarajevo and 
fighting elsewhere among Bosnian Serbs, Muslims and Croats have produced 2.7 
million displaced people within the embattled little country -- more than twice 
the 1.2 million Bosnian refugees who have fled to neighboring states, the U.N. 
high commissioner for refugees has reported. 
</P>
<P>
 War is not the only factor driving people from their homes. Others, for 
instance, are natural or man-made disasters, which create the so-called 
eco-migrants, or environmentally displaced people. 
</P>
<P>
 They range from Ukrainians who fled the nuclear fallout at the Chernobyl 
reactor to Bangladeshis forced from their homes by floods and Kazakhs leaving 
the Aral Sea region as its waters dry up. 
</P>
<P>
 In India, an average of 25 million people are affected every year by floods, 
recurrent disasters that also eliminate 15 million acres of crops, according to 
Michelle Schwartz of the Natural Heritage Institute in San Francisco. Temporary 
displacement is typical in flood season. 
</P>
<P>
 But the increase in the environmentally displaced is more often linked to 
human factors. High birth rates combined with land overuse and erosion, for 
example, are expected to put up to 135 million people at risk over the next few 
decades in Africa, Latin America and Asia, the U.N. Population Fund reports. 
</P>
<P>
 "People keep going to marginal lands, and once those lands are degraded, 
they're forced to even more marginal lands. It's a problem that feeds on 
itself," Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even attempts to better conditions can backfire and displace more people. The 
World Bank estimated that about 100 bank-financed development projects 
displaced at least 1.6 million people between 1980 and 1990. Environmental 
groups give much higher estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Development projects like the Narmada dam project in India and the Three 
Gorges dam project in China -- two of the largest irrigation projects in the 
world -- could displace several million over the next few years," Schwartz 
said. "These are only a small fraction of development activities worldwide that 
will cause displacement over the next decade." 
</P>
<P>
 Industrial disasters have also displaced significant numbers. The 1984 toxic 
chemical release at a Union Carbide plant in Bhopal, India, and the 1986 
Chernobyl nuclear meltdown episode together killed several thousand people, 
injured tens of thousands -- and at least temporarily displaced hundreds of 
thousands. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the cause, the plight of the displaced is usually worse than that of 
refugees. No international agencies are officially mandated to deal with 
displaced people. And no legal conventions delineate their rights or provide 
mechanisms and standards for their care. In contrast, the 1951 U.N. Convention 
Relating to the Status of Refugees and a 1967 U.N. protocol define and offer 
the right of protection to refugees worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even refugee people did not look at the displaced as a problem unto itself as 
recently as 1989 and 1990," relief worker Mayotte said. "A refugee is someone 
who is defined and recognized. But because the world is built around 
nation-states and sovereignty is sacrosanct, the world is not supposed to 
meddle in the affairs of countries with large numbers of displaced. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a domestic violence case. If the husband or boyfriend says 
nothing's going on here, then the authorities have to go away." 
</P>
<P>
 The displaced have no one to demand accountability on their behalf or to turn 
to for diplomatic or political intervention. They generally have to depend on 
the very governments or environments responsible for the conditions that have 
forced them from their homes. Internationally, their plight often goes 
virtually unnoticed, except among humanitarian agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of the biggest gaps in the existing international machinery," said 
Lionel Rosenblatt, executive director of Refugees International. 
</P>
<P>
 "We find ourselves spending more and more time on the displaced problem and 
how to get some kind of response. There needs to be an international conference 
to devise some mechanism." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside intervention is complicated -- and limited -- by the issue of 
sovereignty. It risks running into the political, military or environmental 
flash point that triggered an exodus, and having to solve that problem before 
getting disentangled. 
</P>
<P>
 Governments facing a refugee influx generally welcome outside help. But states 
facing a problem with their own displaced can feel threatened when outsiders 
assume the humanitarian responsibilities, possibly portraying the regime in a 
bad light. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States and the United Nations could intervene in Somalia with a 
free hand only because the state had broken down completely. But normally a 
recalcitrant government draws a line at outside intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the right of initiative in contacting governments in the case of 
internal conflict to ask for Red Cross intervention. But the government has the 
right to refuse. That's a problem a lot of organizations face," said Francoise 
Derron, spokeswoman for the International Committee of the Red Cross. 
"Governments say we're interfering in internal affairs." 
</P>
<P>
 In Sudan, the Islamic government in Khartoum and southern rebels have abused 
millions of the displaced during the civil war -- using them as shields or as 
pawns to get food aid for troops. It was in Sudan that the risks of relief work 
caught up with Mayotte, a former nun and Emmy-winning television producer who 
had also worked in Cambodia, Thailand, Pakistan, India, Mozambique, Ethiopia, 
Eritrea, Mexico, Peru, Brazil and Guatemala, a list that illustrates the 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Last September, while she was working on a film project about Sudan's nearly 5 
million displaced, a 200-pound bag of sorghum fell from a relief plane and 
struck her leg. She lost the leg and almost her life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd go back to Africa tomorrow if I had a leg," she said last month in 
Washington. "And I will," added Mayotte, who's awaiting further surgery so she 
can be fitted for a prosthetic. 
</P>
<P>
 As Mayotte and other members of the international relief community have long 
argued, the problem is not supplies or the willingness to deliver them. It's 
getting them there. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the displaced, there's no guarantee relief agencies will get access to 
them. Renegade governments and rebels often won't allow humanitarian 
organizations to have access to them," said Barbara Francis, U.S. spokeswoman 
for the U.N. refugee agency. 
</P>
<P>
 An exception followed the 1991 Gulf War when more than a million Iraqi Kurds 
fled to Turkey and Iran after their uprising against Iraqi President Saddam 
Hussein's weakened regime failed. Iran took in more than half a million Kurds, 
but Turkey was less hospitable, leaving hundreds of thousands stranded in the 
snow-covered mountains of northern Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 Media attention to starvation and death among the Kurds prompted a U.S.-led 
coalition to launch Operation Provide Comfort in north Iraq, a mission that 
defied convention by operating in a country without permission. Despite Iraqi 
protests, the postwar political climate and U.N. resolutions made the mission 
internationally acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 Provide Comfort has turned out, however, to be an exception in the post-Cold 
War world. 
</P>
<P>
 "It had such international consensus and a commitment of military force. No 
other situation has that consensus or will," said Frelick, the U.S. Committee 
for Refugees analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 Provide Comfort also explains international reticence to get involved in many 
relief operations. Three years later, 1,500 Gulf War coalition troops in 
Provide Comfort -- at a cost so far of hundreds of millions of dollars -- are 
still involved, with no end in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Initially there was optimism that we'd set a new example in Iraq. Then we had 
the examples set in Bosnia and Somalia, where we're basically saying we can't 
or don't want to intervene because of all the difficulties for us," said Dennis 
Gallagher, executive director of the Refugee Policy Group. "Now, the 
international community is reacting to that lack of success. There's a sense 
we're not able to help people inside countries, yet we're no more interested in 
letting people move across borders." 
</P>
<P>
 For the displaced, social services such as health and education are also 
usually nonexistent. Because the displaced are often unwanted populations, they 
have limited if any opportunities for jobs to support themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, a host of U.N. and international agencies deal with refugee 
problems, handling everything from identity papers to schooling. The 1994 
budget of the U.N. refugee agency is $1.2 billion -- double the 1990 budget -- 
while other relief groups spend millions more worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 But millions of the displaced do not even have the benefit of makeshift camps 
for shelter and relief aid. In Bosnia, they may be displaced only a few blocks 
from home to a crowded basement garage without electricity, water or heat. In 
Sudan and Somalia, they may be forced to live in open country. In Peru, they 
may form illegal and unserviced squatter camps. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 2 million displaced Sudanese have wandered into Khartoum, Port Sudan 
and several other cities from the famine-devastated countryside since 1986. 
There, they have "poked sticks into the dry ground and covered them with 
discarded burlap grain bags, empty cardboard boxes, or whatever refuse they 
could find in the surrounding garbage dumps, and called it shelter," Mayotte 
writes in her book, "Disposable People." 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of the highest death rates ever recorded are among the internally 
displaced, up to 20 times the rates that are normal even for very poor 
populations say in Bangladesh or Sierra Leone," according to a Refugee Policy 
Group report. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1980s, as many as 1.2 million displaced Sudanese are believed to have 
died because of the combined effects of conflict and famine. In the 1990s, 
entire villages in Somalia have been depopulated as up to half the residents 
died of malnutrition and disease and the other half fled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rarely does food or nutrition assistance arrive in time to support the needs 
of the internally displaced when they need it the most," the Refugee Policy 
Group reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Within their own countries, neighboring communities block integration because 
the displaced are considered political enemies or rivals for limited resources, 
said Derron, the Red Cross spokeswoman.  
</P>
<P>
 In Angola, 2 million people -- almost one out of four -- have been displaced 
by Africa's deadliest war. Because the conflict breaks down along tribal lines, 
the displaced rarely find refuge on the other side. 
</P>
<P>
 The same is true in the strife between Sri Lanka's predominantly Hindu Tamils 
and Buddhist Sinhalese and for Georgia's Ossetian and Abkhazian minorities. Sri 
Lanka has 600,000 displaced; Georgia has 250,000. 
</P>
<P>
 An exception is Tajikistan, the poorest former Soviet republic, where tens of 
thousands fled after fighting erupted between the holdover Communist government 
and pro-democracy forces in 1992. By 1993, the total displaced exceeded 
500,000. Many crossed into Afghanistan, but most stayed inside Tajik borders. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. refugee agency became involved after government troops prevailed, and 
fighting died down. While improving the domestic situation so refugees would 
return, the agency also aided the Tajik displaced with food and plastic 
sheeting to help them through the winter. It then helped them return to their 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the number of displaced dropped to 30,000. The crisis has been 
comparatively short-lived and far less of a local or regional problem than it 
could have been, according to David Nassar, a Tajik specialist at Refugees 
International. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it weren't for the (U.N. refugee agency's) agenda being informally 
expanded, then there'd be no one to take care of these people. Most displaced 
don't have that kind of protection," said Francis, the agency spokesman. The 
agency had the authorization of the Tajik government to enter the country and 
provide aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the agency's intervention in Tajikistan, the former Yugoslavia, 
Azerbaijan and northern Sri Lanka, the U.N. General Assembly last December 
supported the agency's efforts to help the displaced, especially in cases 
related to refugee problems. But the General Assembly's support still falls far 
short of a formal mandate and funding for the displaced. 
</P>
<P>
 International aid is limited also by the "burnout factor," according to George 
High, director of the Center for Immigration Studies in Washington. "When you 
have one international disaster after another, they challenge the capability of 
relief organizations to handle them all. In turn, people get tired of giving 
money to bail out one crisis after another." 
</P>
<P>
 If no international mechanism or formula is found to deal with the displaced, 
U.S. officials and world relief agencies warn, the problem will continue to 
snowball. 
</P>
<P>
 "The international community is ill-equipped to tackle the magnitude of the 
problem. We're equipped only to deal with immediate problems involving 
refugees," a U.S. official conceded. 
</P>
<P>
 "To find solutions for displaced people, someone has to sort out problems 
ranging from human rights and social justice to economic equity. The 
international community will also have to deal with the sovereignty problem and 
finally delineate at what juncture who has what rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the moment," he added, "we're treading water while a tidal wave is 
building." Tallying the Human Toll 
</P>
<P>
 There were more than 24 million displaced persons in 1993, according to U.N. 
estimates. The top 10 nations: 
</P>
<P>
 Sudan: 4,000,000* 
</P>
<P>
 South Africa: 4,000,000 
</P>
<P>
 Mozambique: 2,000,000

 One of the greatest mass movements in human history was caused by World War 
II. Streets throughout Europe were crowded with millions of refugees or 
displaced persons, forced to flee because of bombing, political decrees or 
newly altered borders. 
</P>
<P>
 BEFORE THE WAR: France coordinated a movement from populated areas near the 
German border. 
</P>
<P>
 DURING THE WAR: Civilians migrated from cities to avoid bombing raids. In 
France, by harassing them at some points and ignoring them at others, the 
Germans cleverly herded the weary escapees onto the main roads, so that they 
hampered the progress of the French troops. 
</P>
<P>
 * One-fifth of the housing destroyed during WWII was lost to "structure 
evacuation," or smashing down homes and other buildings for firebreaks. Broad 
strips of open land surrounded factories, transport centers and military bases 
where houses and shops once stood, leaving more than 3.5 million city residents 
homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hitler forced about 600,000 Germans to return to their homeland through 
agreements with other European nations. And residents of eastern Germany moved 
west when the Soviet Union invaded. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Russia, Stalin allowed Germans to leave areas annexed by the Soviet Union 
but later deported to Siberia those remaining on the Volga River along with 
some minority groups native to the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 AFTER THE WAR: The Soviet Union expelled Finns and Germans from newly annexed 
territories. They exchanged natives of areas annexed from Poland for Russians 
still remaining in Poland. 
</P>
<P>
 * Refugees who had fled their country to escape Axis troops returned home, 
although their houses were not always left standing.  
</P>
<P>
 * Some people captured during the war chose to remain in Germany rather than 
return to homelands that had been acquired by the Soviet Union. East Germans 
were forced to leave ancestral homelands when Hitler lost the war.

THE WEEK AHEAD: WASHINGTON; KEY VISIT FOR RABIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin originally planned as a routine visit to 
Washington next week could prove to be pivotal in the Middle East peace process 
as Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization attempt to bring their 
negotiations on Palestinian self-government to a conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the Hebron massacre, Rabin trimmed what was to have been a 
visit of 10 days to just four.However, his advisers suggested Monday that, 
during the visit, he might be able to sign an agreement with PLO Chairman 
Yasser Arafat on implementing the accord reached in Washington six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without a new agreement to sign with the PLO, Rabin's visit has become a 
deadline for resolving issues in domestic politics. Among these issues are 
broadening his minority government before he leaves, and in economic policy, 
how to spend the funds raised under U.S.-guaranteed loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Under present plans, Rabin leaves Jerusalem next Monday and returns Friday.

CULTURE; FLORENTINES AWAIT UNVEILING OF SKYLINE'S DOMED JEWEL; AFTER 15 YEARS 
OF WORK AND CONTROVERSY, 4,000 SQUARE METERS OF 16TH-CENTURY FRESCOES WILL BE 
BACK ON DISPLAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM D. MONTALBANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A long and expensive courtship between art and science has finally paid off 
for Florence, bringing peace at last to one of the world's favorite skylines. 
</P>
<P>
 The giant eight-sided cathedral dome that is Florence's civic signature is 
emerging from a 15-year, $7-million structural checkup and artistic overhaul 
with a fresh face and a clean bill of health. 
</P>
<P>
 That should delight visitors, and it may even mollify critics who have long 
insisted that restoring mediocre art was not worth the risk of damaging a dome 
that is a priceless architectural marvel. 
</P>
<P>
 A soaring, mesh-shrouded scaffold that has obscured the interior of the dome 
since 1980 will be removed in June to reveal 4,000 square meters of restored 
16th-Century frescoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Spotted among them is a network of sophisticated monitoring instruments 
designed to safeguard the future of the 15th-Century dome whose construction by 
Filippo Brunelleschi wrote a bold new chapter in the history of architecture. 
</P>
<P>
 Controversy that has so long raged around the dome of Santa Maria del Fiore 
cathedral is symptomatic of the difficult decisions conservationists must make 
-- and the passions they inevitably arouse -- in a country whose artistic 
legacy is unsurpassed. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the good news that the 500-year-old cathedral dome will continue to 
grace Florence has been matched this winter by word from Pisa that another 
illustrious monument is on the mend. Reacting to 600 tons of lead ingots 
stacked around the raised north side of its foundation, Pisa's 800-year-old 
tower has stopped leaning. The weights have actually eased the tower one 
centimeter back toward the perpendicular. 
</P>
<P>
 The work goes on in Pisa, but here respite awaits the dome that Florentines 
have scrutinized with affection and alarm ever since it was finished. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the scaffolding comes down, we fully intend that it should stay down for 
many generations," said architect Riccardo Dalla Negra, an arts ministry 
official who has overseen the work inside the cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
 The cupola was controversial even before it was built. When Brunelleschi won a 
civic competition in 1418, many Florentines said it would be impossible to 
cover the vast vaulted altar area of the church without extensive buttressing 
-- construction of support pillars to prevent the dome from collapsing under 
its own weight. 
</P>
<P>
 Brunelleschi built it without supports nonetheless, borrowing herringbone 
techniques of brick-and-stone-beam construction from the ancient Romans. Hardly 
had the completed red brick dome been consecrated in 1436, though, when it 
began to develop cracks -- some of them big enough to stick an arm through. 
</P>
<P>
 How to preserve the dome instantly became a civic preoccupation in Florence. 
Amid growing cracks and unsuccessful attempts to stanch them, it has remained 
high on the municipal agenda -- subject of endless learned debate -- for more 
than 500 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, the decoration chosen to illuminate the interior of the dome, a 
gigantic fresco of the "Last Judgment," has been the subject of timeless and 
disputatious discussion among the habitues of Florentine coffee bars for 
generations. 
</P>
<P>
 Giorgio Vasari began the work in 1572, but it was finished by Federigo 
Zuccaro. Vasari was a prolific decorator but a so-so painter. His greatest 
contribution to the Renaissance was as a biographer and an architect: He 
designed the Uffizi Gallery, another Florence landmark, and in 1550 published 
"Lives of the Artists," biographical profiles of geniuses like Michelangelo and 
Leonardo da Vinci that college students still read today. 
</P>
<P>
 As a painter, Vasari was a mannerist. His work on the cupola, begun near the 
top, is a static exercise of precise formality. Zuccaro took over after 
Vasari's death in 1574. He was a younger man and an artist of a very different 
stripe, a precursor of the Baroque era that would dominate Italian art 
following the Renaissance. His work has an almost impressionistic aura. Seen 
from up close on the platform, some of it looks almost freestyle in contrast to 
the careful figures of Vasari. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line: The sum of the vast painting may be impressive as it sprawls 
across the vast domed surface, but it is more a document of its times than 
great art. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is of course no way we can compare this 'Last Judgment' to 
Michelangelo's in the Sistine Chapel," says Cristina Danti of the National Arts 
Ministry, who helped oversee the restoration of the painting. (After 14 years 
of restoration of its own, the Sistine Chapel "Last Judgment," by the way, 
makes its own return to public viewing after Easter.) 
</P>
<P>
 "The Sistine Chapel was commissioned by a Pope. This is a work commissioned by 
civil rulers -- the Medici," Danti observed. "It is an important document of 
Renaissance art and history. It is not to traditional, classical Florentine 
tastes. There are even portraits of the painter, his family, the master 
builders and their crew." 
</P>
<P>
 Important, perhaps, but hardly a favorite among the people of a city that 
houses some of the world's best art. Hard to see at the best of times from the 
cathedral floor, nearly the length of a football field below, the painting 
became darkened and obscured by centuries of candle smoke. Even as the costly 
scaffolding went up in 1980, Florentine critics -- in some cases echoing their 
great-grandfathers -- argued that the cheapest and most merciful restoration 
for the inside of the dome would have been spackle under a coat of whitewash. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was proposed in the 19th Century, and even today there are people who 
ask why we've bothered to restore this painting. But it has a certain strength. 
I like it," said Danti as she walked along the upper reaches of the narrow, 
dangling scaffold. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the merits of the frescoes, their restoration has allowed architects 
and engineers to undertake a painstaking study of the dome itself, inventing 
along the way a series of highly sophisticated instruments to monitor stress on 
the dome. 
</P>
<P>
 A vocal minority of Florentine notables, including architect Lando Bartoli, 
81, warned of dire consequences when erection of the current scaffold began in 
the late '80s. They particularly objected to the filling with cement of 48 
Brunelleschi-designed holes that held the Renaissance scaffold and also the new 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 The openings, Bartoli insists, are essential "breathing holes" for a dome that 
expands and contracts with heat and cold. He believes that even temporary 
closure must aggravate the cracks and weaken the dome over the long haul. 
</P>
<P>
 The holes will be reopened this summer as the scaffold comes down. But the 
high-tech instruments arrayed around the cupola circumference will remain as an 
investment in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite critics' concerns, their readings so far have been reassuring, 
according to project director Dalla Negra. Florence's marvelous cupola is aging 
quite gracefully, thank you. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we've found in fact is that the dome is healthier than we thought it 
was," says Dalla Negra.

NATIONAL AGENDA; A CULTURE OF VIOLENCE; MURDEROUS 'SOCIAL CLEANSING' DOES NOT 
EVEN SPARE CHILDREN IN COLOMBIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The first time Calvo escaped death, he ducked to avoid bursts of machine gun 
fired by a passing motorist. The second time, shrapnel from a grenade hurled at 
him nicked his chest. 
</P>
<P>
 Death is nothing mysterious or distant for Calvo, who is 15, nor for millions 
of Colombians living in what may well be the most violent country in the 
Americas. 
</P>
<P>
 When Colombia's war with cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar ended last December, 
the most savage "narco-terrorism" -- in which bombs wiped out entire shopping 
malls and downed jetliners -- also ended. But the violence that is an 
inexorable part of Colombian culture and history only seems to worsen. And with 
elections approaching in March and May, many Colombians fear that murders and 
kidnapings will continue to soar. 
</P>
<P>
 In just a single week's time in January, the finance minister narrowly escaped 
an assassination attempt; two American missionaries were kidnaped, and 35 
peasants sympathetic to a leftist political party were slaughtered in a 
regional power struggle.  
</P>
<P>
 Guerrillas continue to wage the longest war in South America, and the murders 
of street urchins by police, vigilantes and others in Colombia last year 
exceeded that of Brazil, which has nearly four times the population. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is happening in Colombia is that there are many forms of violence, all 
mixed up, crossed over and feeding on each other," political scientist 
Alejandro Reyes said. "Violence has metastasized, like a cancer, leaving its 
original organism and invading all of society." 
</P>
<P>
 It is into the category of slain street children that Calvo may one day fall. 
He belongs to one of the many gangs of children and teen-agers who roam 
Bogota's roughest downtown streets. They mug and pick pockets, turn tricks as 
prostitutes and consume drugs, primarily glue sniffed from plastic bags. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, vigilante death squads roam the same streets, picking off young 
thugs and other street people in a campaign of "social cleansing." 
</P>
<P>
 Police often form part of the death squads, according to human rights 
organizations, which estimate that one person is killed every two days through 
"social cleansing." The real number is believed to be higher because many of 
these deaths are not reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvo says he has survived two attempts to kill him by what he believes was a 
death squad. In both the machine gun and grenade attacks, a car passed the 
corner where many of the young gangsters hang out, slowed down and then opened 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "I threw myself on the ground," Calvo said, describing the attacks as he 
sucked on a glue-filled plastic bag. 
</P>
<P>
 A few feet away, two uniformed police officers gave chase to a girl who had 
apparently robbed a passer-by. One of the officers took off his helmet and 
began beating the girl as they ran. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl escaped, and, the chase over, the officers approached a reporter and 
launched into a vivid description of the street horrors they feel they confront 
every day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seven muggings in the 10 minutes it took me to walk around the block!" one 
policeman complained. "The only thing you can do with these people . . ." He 
completed the sentence by slicing a finger across his neck. 
</P>
<P>
 "La limpieza social, " his partner said. "Social cleansing." 
</P>
<P>
 "These people . . . " the first officer began. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are a lost cause," his partner finished. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The vigilante killings by police, civilians and paramilitary hired guns, both 
in the cities and in the vast countryside, make up a large part of Colombia's 
murder and mayhem -- but only a part. Violence is also traced to leftist 
guerrillas, to drug traffickers, to army anti-insurgency campaigns, to large 
landholders trying to get rid of peasants. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, in a country where the judicial system is perceived as weak and 
ineffective, the violent resolution of conflicts has become a way of life, 
experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a certain historical continuum to Colombia's fratricide.  
</P>
<P>
 During the 1940s and 1950s, Colombia lived through a period known as "La 
Violencia," where its two dominant political parties, the Liberals and the 
Conservatives, battled over land and political power. More than 200,000 people 
were killed.  
</P>
<P>
 A power-sharing pact, imposed by the military, ended the fighting in 1958 but 
excluded the Left. Remnants of the warring factions continued to operate in the 
countryside, joined in the 1960s by disaffected leftists who formed guerrilla 
armies. 
</P>
<P>
 Wealthy ranchers and farmers responded by organizing paramilitary bands to 
fight the rebels and to protect their properties, often by eliminating peasants 
who may or may not have sympathized with the guerrillas. The violence swelled 
as cocaine traffickers entered the picture in the 1970s, reaching its most 
pitched savagery with drug lord Escobar's declaration of war on the Colombian 
state in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The henchmen employed by Escobar and his Medellin cartel assassinated hundreds 
of judges and police, three presidential candidates in the 1989 elections, and 
a justice minister; an Escobar bomb destroyed a commercial airliner in midair, 
killing all 107 passengers aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Escobar was killed last Dec. 2 in a shootout with police, after 16 months on 
the run. Most of Colombia was relieved, but the relief was short-lived as the 
reality of Colombian violence quickly re-emerged. 
</P>
<P>
 While drug-related violence captures the headlines, it accounts for a fraction 
of the total bloodshed, experts say. And political murder accounts for an 
estimated 10% of all homicides. Common crime, private score-settling, social 
cleansing and every other imaginable reason-to-kill make up the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of murders in Colombia in the last several years has routinely 
surpassed that of the United States, which has about eight times the 
population. In 1992, 10 people were killed per 100,000 in the United States; it 
was 82 per 100,000 in Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
 In the capital city of Bogota, a person is killed, on the average, every hour, 
every day. Bogota has just under twice the population of Los Angeles, and more 
than eight times the number of homicides. 
</P>
<P>
 In a particularly dizzying week in January, Finance Minister Rudolf Hommes 
barely avoided a bomb blast detonated by remote control. His bodyguard was 
injured. Days before, a 65-pound dynamite bomb meant for the national prisons 
chief was found and deactivated. Two American missionaries were kidnaped by 
leftist guerrillas in apparent protest of the presence of U.S. troops in 
Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
 And then came the deadliest single massacre in Colombia in more than five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Masked gunmen thought to be Marxist guerrillas opened fire on supporters of a 
political party formed by former rebels who accepted a government amnesty three 
years ago. A total of 35 supporters of the Hope, Peace and Freedom Party were 
killed in the Jan. 23 slaughter in the tropical banana-growing region of Uraba. 
</P>
<P>
 In a deadly, ongoing power struggle, the armed guerrillas of the Revolutionary 
Armed Forces of Colombia have declared war on the Hope, Peace and Freedom Party 
in hopes of intimidating its supporters and controlling the region. At least 
300 former rebels have been killed since laying down their weapons in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Colombians will vote for congress and the president this month and in May, 
respectively. The guerrillas have vowed to disrupt the elections, and the Uraba 
killings sent a chill over an already tempestuous campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Colombia's experts in violence -- the legion of sociologists and political 
scientists called "violentologists" -- say the weakness of state institutions 
and the judiciary, both of which have been corrupted by drug money, has 
encouraged many Colombians to take justice into their own hands. And that in 
turn further generalizes violence. 
</P>
<P>
 While the government improved its intelligence-gathering operations and has 
deployed military campaigns to go after guerrillas, the basic ability to 
investigate and prosecute crimes remains ineffective, the experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Eduardo Pizarro of the National University, of about 17,000 
homicides in 1987, only 3% were punished; of an estimated 27,000 homicides last 
year, only 3% to 5% are likely to be solved. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rampant impunity makes it very cheap to commit a crime," said Juan 
Gabriel Tokatlian, director of International Studies at the University of the 
Andes. 
</P>
<P>
 "People begin to take justice into their own hands (and) to resolve their own 
problems with violence. . . . There are car wrecks where both parties draw 
guns. The most mundane incident is a spark, a fuse that detonates the bomb." 
</P>
<P>
 The phenomenon stretches from upstanding citizens who bullet-proof their cars 
and arm themselves -- as many as a quarter of Colombia's adults may be armed -- 
to the cocaine barons who set up paramilitary squads to protect their vast and 
expanding properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Reyes, in a study, estimated that 375 paramilitary squads were active at one 
point. In recent years, drug traffickers are believed to have bought up to 3 
million hectares of land, including a substantial portion of Colombia's best 
farmland. As they build these empires, they organize the paramilitary groups to 
remove peasants, intimidate workers or fight off guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps no violence encapsulates the desperation, frustration and sense of 
lost justice as does the social cleansing, which began in the late 1980s in the 
Colombian cities of Cali and Barranquilla and now claims hundreds of lives 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Designed originally to eradicate male and female prostitutes, social cleansing 
now targets all types of destitute street people, including muggers, beggars 
and junkies -- people referred to in Bogota as the "throwaways" of society.  
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly, business owners in major cities, frustrated by a shortage of 
police and lack of law and order, condone "social cleansing" to restore safety 
to the streets, human rights activists say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Social cleansing is not accidental," social worker Carlos Rojas said in a 
human rights report prepared by the Latin American Institute of Alternative 
Legal Services. "There are prior threats, the victims are chosen, and there is 
an M.O. that is repeated. . . . The idea that these people might die in a 
violent way is now accepted as something normal in Colombia."  
</P>
<P>
 Frankie is another of the street people for whom a violent death seems 
inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeless for 14 of his 22 years, Frankie ended up on the streets after his 
mother died during an illegal abortion. His father, a bodyguard for a major 
cocaine trafficker, was already dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankie sleeps on a piece of cardboard in Independence Park in central Bogota, 
where he is recovering from his latest wound, a bullet to the throat. A 
convicted killer who served time in jail, Frankie says he has been shot two or 
three times by the vigilantes. He has somehow survived, like a cat, he says, 
with many lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem with la limpieza ," Frankie said, "is the innocent fall with the 
sinners."

LIN'S CASE ATTRACTS CONSPIRACY THEORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONE TEMPEST, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Military hero, commander of the People's Liberation Army, compiler of Mao's 
"Little Red Book" of quotations, Lin Piao was China's second most powerful man 
when, according to the official Chinese government version, he fled China on a 
British-built Trident jet on Sept. 12, 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 The official version, released months after Lin Piao's disappearance, was that 
the Chinese leader and his powerful wife, Ye Qun -- who was also a Politburo 
member -- and their playboy son, Lin Liguo, were killed in the crash after 
their plane ran out of fuel over the Mongolian steppe. In the haste to depart 
from the airport near the beach resort town of Beidaihe, there had not been 
time to refuel the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 According to other accounts, however, Lin was never on the plane that fateful 
night. This theory was supported by reports in the Soviet press that none of 
the nine charred bodies found in the wreckage was more than 50 years old; Lin 
was 64. 
</P>
<P>
 Some conspiracy theorists claimed Lin had already been assassinated by Mao 
Tse-tung loyalists in an ambush and never made it on the plane. The most 
prominent of these accounts is the 1983 book "The Conspiracy and Murder of 
Mao's Heir," supposedly written by a Chinese official under the pseudonym Yao 
Ming-le and published first in the United States by Alfred A. Knopf Co. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Yao Ming-le version, after uncovering an assassination plot 
against him by Lin and his family, Mao invited Lin Piao and his wife to a 
sumptuous dinner on Sept. 12, 1971, at Mao's Jade Tower Mountain villa outside 
Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with Chinese Premier Chou En-lai and Mao's wife, Jiang Qing, Lin and 
wife reportedly feasted on meat from freshly killed Manchurian tigers and 
sipped 482-year-old wine from a Ming porcelain vessel. Afterward, Mao had the 
couple's car blasted with ground-to-ground missiles on the road leaving the 
villa. 
</P>
<P>
 Some even claim that Lin survived the air crash, only to die years later in a 
Soviet safehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 A fictionalized account featuring the Lin Piao case, "Chinese Assassin," by 
British novelist Anthony Grey, is what Peter Hannam said first inspired him to 
investigate Lin's death after a year struggling to survive as a free-lance 
journalist in Ulan Bator, Mongolia's bleak capital city.

MARKET SCENE; ANANOV PUTS THE SPARKLE BACK IN RUSSIAN JEWELRY; IS HE THE NEW 
FABERGE? SOME SAY SO. HIS HIGH-RISK STYLE WINS OVER CUSTOMERS AT HOME AND 
ABROAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Even if you are not about to shell out $4,000 for a gem-encrusted Easter egg, 
it can do your heart good to enter the deep-carpeted hush of Andrei Ananov's 
sanctuary here. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, the crumbling palaces and shabby, potholed streets of this former 
czarist capital can elicit despair that it will ever recapture its old glory. 
</P>
<P>
 But inside, among his candelabra and baroque gilt furniture, Russia's premier 
jeweler shows that, if only in tiny and exorbitant ways, it can be done. 
</P>
<P>
 In his five-year rise from clandestine craftsman risking a prison sentence for 
illegal work with precious metals, Ananov has been acclaimed at least pretender 
to the title of Russia's new Peter Carl Faberge, the legendary jeweler to the 
czars. 
</P>
<P>
 "This demonstrates what Russians are capable of," Ananov said of his luxurious 
shop in the Hotel Europe. "It's all real, although it's not easy. You just have 
to really want to make it happen." 
</P>
<P>
 A practiced raconteur, Ananov, 48, makes a riveting tale out of just how he 
made it happen -- how he went from concealing his creations to displaying them 
in Paris and overseeing a workshop of 80 craftspeople. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the KGB he used to have to worry about most, back in the old Soviet 
days when the government had a legal monopoly on jewelry making, as it did on 
most everything else. Ananov, a longtime theater director and actor, made 
jewelry as a lucrative hobby, keeping his sideline secret. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, however, someone squealed, and a squad of KGB agents arrived at 
his house for a search. 
</P>
<P>
 The jeweler knew that if they found the bag of diamonds in his desk and bits 
of gold about the house, he would spend several years in prison. So he tricked 
the agents into believing that the jewels were hidden in the tank of a toilet, 
which could be opened only with a screwdriver. 
</P>
<P>
 And the screwdriver just happened to be kept in the desk where Ananov had 
secreted his bag of diamonds. So when the KGB man requested the tool, Ananov 
had a chance to shift the diamonds to his already searched pockets. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, in the presence of the KGB men, he asked his wife to make him soup so 
that he would not go to his interrogation hungry, and then he slipped into the 
soup some gold that he had hidden in his mouth. When the jeweler was led out of 
the house, he was clean as a whistle. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, Ananov decided to take the risk of showing a collection of his 
illegal jewelry to state officials in order to get permission to go above-board 
-- a gambit that worked. 
</P>
<P>
 As he describes it, he laid out the pieces before a top bureaucrat and 
appealed to his national pride, declaring that the country could be producing 
such gorgeous work instead of typically clunky Soviet jewelry. If the gambit 
had failed, he was prepared for trial. But that was not necessary, and with the 
blessing of the government, he jumped early onto the wave of private firms 
created in the perestroika years. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1991, he was exhibiting abroad and signed a deal with Faberge, the French 
cosmetics company, now owned by Unilever, that had bought the family name from 
Peter Carl Faberge's descendants. Ananov agreed to sell some of his output 
through the French company under the label "Faberge par Ananov." 
</P>
<P>
 But apparent success does not necessarily mean stability. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Ananov said, he still feels "like a tightrope walker without a 
balancing pole," most recently because the Moscow government has hit him with a 
bill for more than $50,000 in taxes owed on employee wages for 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 He must also worry, like most of Russia's new entrepreneurs, about falling 
victim to the greedy clutches of organized crime. He claims racketeers have 
left him alone so far, perhaps because he has steered clear of underworld 
dealers who offer him contraband "handfuls of emeralds." 
</P>
<P>
 Ananov has no guarantees. He sometimes fears that he could end up reliving the 
tragedy of Peter Carl Faberge, who reportedly was given just 10 minutes to 
clear out by the Bolsheviks who nationalized his workshop in 1918. Faberge 
ended his days in exile. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite his worries, Ananov revels in what he does, in his self-defined 
role as the man who is bringing the spirit of Faberge back to Russia. His works 
are not copies of Faberge pieces, but many of the methods are the same, using a 
style and daring that Ananov sees as uniquely Russian. 
</P>
<P>
 "Russians are into scale and risk," said Ananov, who once was a race-car 
driver. "In Paris, they used to say that if a Russian came into the Ritz 
restaurant, he'd spend so much they wouldn't have to work for a week 
afterward." 
</P>
<P>
 Russian risk-taking, he said, leads to special beauty when, for example, a 
jeweler fires enamel at a higher-than-normal temperature, one that could ruin 
the piece or, perhaps, produce the most lovely enamels. 
</P>
<P>
 Faberge's enamels were considered the finest in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one else can do this," said jeweler Andrei Shevchenko, toiling in Ananov's 
workshop over a golden egg that flips open into three pieces. "Only we can." 
</P>
<P>
 In its heyday between 1881 and 1917, about 700 craftsmen worked for the House 
of Faberge in its St. Petersburg, Moscow, Odessa, London and Paris branches. 
</P>
<P>
 The jeweler was most famous for the signature Easter eggs he created each 
spring for the last two czars. Each imperial egg contained a surprise, from a 
tiny swan to a miniature model of a train. 
</P>
<P>
 Faberge also made thousands of more ordinary eggs, which Russian men would 
give to the women in their family for special Easter necklaces worn to the 
seasonal rites of the Orthodox church. 
</P>
<P>
 An international foundation is now working -- separately from Ananov -- to 
restore the House of Faberge as a museum-workshop in central St. Petersburg, 
and an exhibit of Faberge treasures has drawn near-record crowds in St. 
Petersburg, London and Paris in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 Ananov makes many of the lesser eggs today; his Hotel Europe shop also offers 
lighters, picture frames, ornaments and more, from a $25,000 quartz parrot to 
$3,800 earrings. These days, he said, his workers are focusing on a spectacular 
rose that he plans to give to Princess Caroline of Monaco at a ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, at first, Ananov said, only foreigners bought his creations.  
</P>
<P>
 But now, "with every day, more and more Russians appear," he said. "Russians 
who have their starting capital, who have already bought a bed, a TV, a car and 
a house. Then they pass over to culture. Some go to the theater, some go to the 
Canary Islands, and some buy jewelry from Ananov."

PHOTO ESSAY; PILGRIMS DRAWN TO SHIVA RITES IN NEPAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the mountain kingdom of Nepal, pilgrims are gathering for Thursday's annual 
celebration of Shivaratri -- the Night of Lord Shiva -- a festival of devotion 
to one of the most complex and perplexing of Hindu gods. It is the most famous 
religious event in Nepal, where 90% of the 18 million people are Hindu. 
</P>
<P>
 The focus is the temple of Pashupatinath, which sits on the sacred Bagmati 
river outside Katmandu, the Nepalese capital. Hundreds of thousands of pilgrims 
will gather at the temple, whose two-tiered golden roof and silver doors make 
it one of the country's most spectacular examples of sacred architecture. They 
offer flowers, fruit and coins to Shiva and chant Hindu prayers. Among them 
will be a large number of ascetics -- ash-smeared sadhus , wandering holy men. 
On Thursday, the celebration will move from pious devotion to a modern aspect, 
when the Royal Nepalese Army, in the presence of King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah 
Dev, the 10th monarch of the present dynasty, puts on a military review, 
including cannon fire. 
</P>
<P>
 The revered and feared three-eyed Shiva, who Hindus believe created the world 
and is said to dwell with his consort Parvati on a mountaintop in the 
Himalayas, combines a number of contradictory qualities. He is both the 
destroyer and the restorer, an epicure and an ascetic. Fittingly, he is 
sometimes represented as the androgynous union of himself and his consort in 
one body, half male and half female. JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG, Times staff writer

MARKETING / BRUCE HOROVITZ: LOOKING FOR A BREAK; ANNUAL GATHERING OF COLLEGE 
KIDS IS HARD TO PINPOINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Spring break is back, and many of America's top marketers are once again 
attempting to cash in on college kids at play. But sponsors share one problem: 
They don't know where to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Marketing consultants say that no longer can any single American city anoint 
itself the nation's spring break capital. That makes the 1994 version of spring 
break perhaps the most scattered -- if not baffling -- that corporate sponsors 
have experienced. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who think spring break headquarters is Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., or Palm 
Springs are a decade behind the times. Those cities aren't even contenders 
anymore. Daytona Beach, Fla., is fast losing its spring break luster, marketers 
say. And while Panama City Beach, Fla., may attract the most student visitors, 
it is hardly a household name. MTV, meanwhile, is about to try to persuade 
students that San Diego is the new home to spring break madness. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, MTV plans to begin taping its spring break TV specials in San Diego's 
Mission Beach area. Joining MTV are 10 marketers -- from MCI to MasterCard -- 
that paid millions to get their products in the camera's eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, hundreds of companies will spend about $10 million over the next 
four weeks handing out freebies -- from shampoo to T-shirts -- at half a dozen 
spring break locations, from Panama City Beach to South Padre Island, Tex. But 
none of them seem to know for certain if they're in the right place. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't listen to what the newspapers or TV shows say," said Richard 
Tarzian, president of Leonia, N.J.-based Intercollegiate Communications, which 
links up marketers such as Pepsi, Sprint and Geo with spring break venues. 
"You've got to go where the students go." 
</P>
<P>
 Tarzian estimates that about 530,000 students will flock to Panama City Beach 
over spring break and 250,000 will migrate to South Padre Island. Those are the 
spots he's recommending to marketers. 
</P>
<P>
 For eight consecutive years, MTV went to Daytona Beach to film spring break 
activities, which it broadcasts nationwide. So why switch to San Diego -- a 
city few associate with spring break? MTV officials say they wanted a change of 
scenery to add some zing to the broadcast. But Daytona Beach city officials say 
they yanked the welcome mat because the city's image has suffered while MTV 
aired year-round programming that depicted it as a party capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the vast majority of college students don't even go to these spring 
break gatherings, a growing number of companies prefer instead to reach 
students with specific event marketing right on their campuses, said Eric Weil, 
editor of Ridgewood, N.J.-based Collegiate Trends newsletter. That's why the 
amount spent on corporate marketing at spring break has begun to slow in recent 
years from double-digit to single-digit growth, Weil said. 
</P>
<P>
 And some consultants say that the heavy drinking associated with so many 
spring break activities has always made it the wrong time and place to reach 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell my clients to stay away from spring break activities," said Marian 
Salzman, founder of New York-based consulting firm BKG Youth. "Why shove your 
latest razor in front of someone if they're too drunk to even see it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps spring break is more image than reality anyway. San Diego's 
universities won't even be on spring break while MTV is filming. But MTV 
executives say that doesn't concern them. "All we need is enough of a crowd to 
make the backdrop look exciting and enthusiastic," said John Shea, senior vice 
president at MTV. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief executive at Steel Jeans, a City of Commerce-based women's jeans 
maker and a sponsor of the MTV broadcast, said he is disappointed by MTV's 
selection of San Diego as its featured site. "You can't compete with Daytona 
Beach," said Danny Lee, whose company created a giant ad balloon that will sit 
on the side of the stage. "This is a great leap of faith for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Intercollegiate's Tarzian agrees that San Diego is not the place for sponsors 
to be at spring break. "San Diego is no threat to anybody," Tarzian said. "It's 
too far west." That's why Tarzian is directing his sponsors to Panama City 
Beach, South Padre Island and Lake Havasu City, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the sponsors that Intercollegiate has linked up with the spring break 
hot spots is General Motors' Geo economy car line, which is expected to spend 
nearly $1 million on spring break promotions. Last year, Geo amassed a sizable 
database of prospective college customers when 30,000 students filled out forms 
requesting information on car financing, Tarzian said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not found a better way to get our name in front of college students 
than to show up at spring break," said Fred Sutherland, assistant manager of 
strategic marketing at Geo, which this year will oversee student tree -planting 
events at three spring break sites. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. Gear, another MTV spring break sponsor, will make certain that its name 
gets plenty of time on camera. Moments before one televised event that it will 
sponsor, the company will pass out T-shirts bearing slogans promoting its 
shoes. "We want viewers to see a sea of students wearing L.A. Gear shirts," 
said Robert S. Apatoff, senior vice president of marketing services at the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 Some marketers have also learned what not to do at spring break. Show 
feature-length movies, for instance. Several years ago, TriStar pictures handed 
out free tickets to a new film, hoping to influence student opinion leaders. 
The promotion was not a hit, however, so this year, TriStar will show only 
previews on video screens at bars in the spring break cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We discovered that you're infringing on the objectives of most students by 
screening a movie at spring break," said Michael Hogan, whose Burbank firm, 
Hogan Communications, has arranged for previews of TriStar films in three 
spring break cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only time a movie works at spring break," Hogan said, "is if it's 
raining." Briefly . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Just two years after it was embroiled in a lawsuit with former client C&R 
Clothiers, the Century City ad agency Admarketing has again picked up the 
creative portion of the $8-million account, which will be handled by former 
agency Asher/Gould until August. . . . L.A. Gear is not actively seeking a new 
agency, but before fall it may look for a new one to handle back-to-school ads, 
said Apatoff. L.A. Gear's former agency was the New York office of Ogilvy & 
Mather, not the Los Angeles office, as previously reported. . . . The Los 
Angeles agency Robert Elen & Associates has picked up the ad account for 
Southern California Mitsubishi Dealers, estimated to be worth $3 million. . . . 
Los Angeles-based Colby Agency has closed its doors, but founder Rick Colby has 
been hired as chairman of the recently opened Lois, Colby/Los Angeles, the 
first West Coast venture of New York-based Lois/USA. . . . Herb Cohen, author 
of "You Can Negotiate Anything," will speak Friday at a breakfast meeting of 
the Western States Advertising Agencies Assn. that will take place at Ma Maison 
Sofitel in Los Angeles. SPRING BREAK SHUFFLE 
</P>
<P>
 Of the estimated $10 million expected to be spent by corporate sponsors on 
spring break activities over the next few weeks -- from volleyball tournaments 
to rock concerts -- auto makers will be the biggest single spender. The cities 
that are expected to be top draws during spring break this year vary from the 
most popular single gathering spot, Panama City Beach, Fla., to a surprising 
bid this year by the city of San Diego to turn itself into a new spring break 
mecca by permitting MTV to film its spring break TV specials there over the 
next two weeks.

TRIO OF MEASURES SEEK TO LAY THE GROUNDWORK FOR INFO HIGHWAY; CONGRESS: BILLS 
WOULD ALLOW THE BABY BELLS TO PROVIDE CABLE AND LONG-DISTANCE SERVICE. BUT HUGE 
OBSTACLES REMAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUBE SHIVER Jr., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Congress is poised this week to begin voting on measures aimed at boosting 
construction of the information superhighway. But if Congress is ready, the 
hard hats are not. 
</P>
<P>
 There are still huge technical and financial obstacles to modernizing and 
integrating wireless, telephone and cable networks into the kind of ubiquitous 
information web Congress seems to have in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea is a universally accessible network that would provide access to 
government, industry and educational databanks, as well as features such as 
interactive TV, home shopping and electronic home security surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
 But engineers haven't yet figured out how to cheaply and easily modify cable 
TV networks to carry two-way conversations or to accurately bill for phone 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, telephone companies have been installing fiber-optic cable mostly 
to lower maintenance costs, not to provide fancy new services. And the prospect 
of a cable version of the info highway at every doorstep was clouded a bit by 
cable behemoth Tele-Communications Inc.'s decision in January to delay for 
about nine months a huge order for a device that would provide hundreds more 
cable channels. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, cable TV is probably best suited for television viewing and the 
delivery of large amounts of data," said Walter Bear, a deputy vice president 
at Rand Corp. and former director of advanced technology at Times Mirror Co., 
parent of the Los Angeles Times. "It's going to be awhile" before you can make 
a phone call through your TV set, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the consensus is that the problems can be resolved over time, they 
loom large as the House and Senate are expected to take up three bills that 
would throw the $300-billion telecommunications business wide open to 
competition by sweeping away many of the restrictions preventing cable firms, 
phone companies and long-distance carriers from invading each others' markets. 
</P>
<P>
 In the most comprehensive of the three measures, Sens. Ernest F. Hollings 
(D-S.C.), Daniel K. Inouye (D-Ha.) and John C. Danforth (R-Mo.) have proposed 
nearly an entire rewrite of federal communications laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill would require telecommunications carriers to subsidize universal 
telecommunications service. Once universal service was established, phone 
companies and cable operators could enter each others' markets. The bill would 
also allow the seven regional Bell phone companies to manufacture telephone 
equipment, offer long-distance phone service under certain conditions and, 
after six years, provide electronic home security services. 
</P>
<P>
 A second measure, sponsored by Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), chairman of 
the House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee, would also repeal 
federal laws that now prohibit the Bell companies from competing with cable 
operators. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bill would require them to open up their networks for use by 
competitors, provide public service video channels for nonprofit groups to 
broadcast programs and establish a government board to recommend ways to 
provide universal telecommunications services. The bill is scheduled to be 
voted on today. 
</P>
<P>
 The third bill, by Commerce Committee Chairman John D. Dingell (D-Mich.) and 
Jack Brooks (D-Tex.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, would permit 
the seven regional Bell phone companies to manufacture equipment and enter the 
lucrative long-distance market after five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The bills' objectives, however, have been overshadowed somewhat in recent days 
by politics. Broadcasters, for example, have been lobbying for permission to 
use proposed high-definition TV service to provide up to six additional video 
channels to compete against cable and provide other profit-making 
communications services. And U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor has warned 
that two of the bills, aimed at regulating local content in the manufacture of 
phone equipment, may violate U.S. trade agreements. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress is likely to adopt this legislation in one form or another, but it 
may be awhile before the legislative vision becomes reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Many blueprints for the superhighway, for example, call for the costly 
installation of intelligent switching capacity in telephone and cable networks 
and the replacement of copper wire with fiber-optic cable -- strands of glass 
that use pulses of light to carry data at nearly the speed of light. But after 
two years of robust growth, most analysts expect the deployment of fiber-optic 
cable to level off this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, with one recent study estimating that it would take cable TV or 
wireless operators 11 to 15 years to earn a profit from offering telephone 
service, few telecommunications companies are gearing up. 
</P>
<P>
 Such ventures are "subject to a significant degree of risk," concluded the 
study by the Boulder, Colo.-based consulting firm Hatfield Associates. 
</P>
<P>
 The collapse of the Bell Atlantic Corp. and Tele-Communications Inc. merger 
was just one indication of the new financial caution. What the Bills Seek 
</P>
<P>
 The three information highway bills Congress is tackling aim to remove federal 
barriers to telecommunications competition and encourage companies to make 
their services broadly available at affordable rates. Their key provisions: 
</P>
<P>
 * Dingell Bill (House): Would allow the seven regional Bell telephone 
companies to offer long-distance service and make telecommunications equipment. 
A federal court decree has barred the Baby Bells from those markets since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 * Markey Bill (House): Would let telephone companies and cable operators enter 
each others' markets, but would require phone companies carrying video services 
to reserve up to 75% of their channels for the use of other video programmers. 
Also promotes an "open and accessible" interactive communications system. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hollings Bill (Senate): Would require telecommunications carriers to 
subsidize universal service. Would also allow the seven regional Bell phone

BRITISH AIRWAYS SUSPENDS PLANS TO PURCHASE MORE OF USAIR; TRANSPORTATION: THE 
MOVE COMES AFTER THE STRUGGLING U.S. CARRIER SAID ITS LOSSES MIGHT TOP LAST 
YEAR'S $350 MILLION. 
</P>

 Alarmed by its partner's mounting financial problems, British Airways on 
Monday suspended plans for any further investment in USAir after the U.S. 
carrier said its pretax losses this year might top the $350 million reported in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 British Airways, which has already invested $400 million in USAir, said it 
will put its investment plans on hold until the Arlington, Va.-based airline 
cuts costs and improves its financial performance. The British carrier's 
decision will lead other foreign carriers to more carefully scrutinize any 
future investments in U.S. carriers, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is that USAir is losing its shirt . . . and its long-term future 
of feeding British Airways passengers is in doubt," said airline industry 
analyst David Hoppin. 
</P>
<P>
 USAir blamed the expansion of low-fare, low-cost carriers as well as 
weather-related disruptions for a projected $200-million pretax loss during the 
first three months of this year. The nation's sixth-largest carrier said pretax 
losses for the year could exceed $350 million if it fails to make dramatic 
changes in the way it operates. 
</P>
<P>
 After releasing the grim financial forecasts, USAir executives on Monday 
approached union leaders about beginning negotiations to cut the pay and raise 
the productivity of workers. Airline and union officials were not available to 
discuss the outcome of Monday's meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 USAir, which has the industry's highest operating costs, said such changes are 
needed for it to compete against low-cost carriers such as Southwest and 
Continental airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 "The principal cause of our unacceptable loss is the requirement to sharply 
lower fares in response to the steady expansion of low-cost carriers into many 
of our East Coast markets," USAir Chairman and President Seth E. Schofield said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, USAir has cut fares 60% on routes from Baltimore to Chicago and 
Cleveland since Southwest began offering competing service last fall, travel 
agents said. "It has butchered its pricing," Charles Roumas, vice president of 
marketing for Travel One, said of USAir. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, British Airways paid $400 million for a 24% stake in USAir as part 
of its strategy of tapping into large domestic markets to feed its extensive 
network of international routes. The London-based carrier said it had 
originally planned to invest an additional $450 million over five years and 
increase its stake in USAir to 44% if efforts succeed to get Congress to allow 
greater foreign ownership of U.S. carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspension of British Airways' investment in USAir comes less than two 
weeks before the U.S. government will decide whether to renew approval of a key 
element of the airlines' alliance: code sharing. 
</P>
<P>
 Code sharing allows flights flown by two separate carriers to appear in 
airline computer reservation systems as being operating by a single airline. 
The arrangement gives a code-share flight preferential treatment over competing 
connecting service and allows two carriers to more easily feed each other 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 While British Airways has put its investment plans on hold, it wants to 
continue expanding its code-sharing relationship with USAir -- if the U.S. 
government agrees. Both airlines serve 34 U.S. cities under code-sharing 
agreements and want to expand that number to 63 by the end of June. 
</P>
<P>
 Some industry observers speculated that British Airways' announcement may have 
been timed to influence the U.S. government's decision. But executives for the 
airline denied such comments, saying it was only reacting to USAir's 
deteriorating financial picture. 
</P>
<P>
 British Airways has not been the only foreign carrier to have financial 
problems with a U.S. partner. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines last year had to write 
off more than $400 million invested in Minneapolis-based Northwest Airlines, 
which is emerging from deep financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Many foreign carriers have underestimated the dramatic changes that 
conventional U.S. carriers -- such as USAir -- must make to survive in an era 
of low fares on low-cost airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Those pressures might lead larger, established airlines to concentrate on 
long-distance routes while ceding the shorter routes to low-fare carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will make (foreign carriers) look more carefully at what type of carrier 
that they want to be allied with," said Clifford Winston, who studies the 
industry as a senior Brookings Institution fellow. 
</P>
<P>
 On the New York Stock Exchange Monday, USAir's stock fell $1.25 a share to $9. 
British Airways' American depository receipts fell 75 cents to $63.50.

DISNEY TO BUILD TIME-SHARES NEAR LAGUNA; RESORTS: ORANGE COUNTY PLAN IS PART OF 
A COMPANY STRATEGY TO CONSTRUCT TOWNHOMES CLOSE TO ITS AMUSEMENT PARKS.

 Walt Disney Co. said Monday that it will buy 70 acres overlooking the Pacific 
for its first California resort: a Mediterranean-themed village of 650 
time-share condominiums, shops and restaurants  
</P>
<P>
 The plan for Newport Coast is part of the entertainment giant's strategy to 
build time-share townhomes near its amusement parks around the world. Disney 
already has a successful time-share project near Walt Disney World in Florida 
and recently announced plans to build resorts in Vero Beach, Fla., about 95 
miles south of Walt Disney World, and on Hilton Head Island in South Carolina.  
</P>
<P>
 "This coastal site fits what Disney is trying to do with its vacation 
villages. It doesn't have to be right next-door to Disneyland," said Ray 
Watson, a member of Disney's board and a vice chairman of Irvine Co., which 
sold 35 acres of the Newport Coast tract to Disney Vacation Development Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 While terms of the deal were not disclosed, local real estate brokers 
estimated the price for the first 35 acres at about $25 million.  
</P>
<P>
 Disney has yet to finalize purchase of the rest of the parcel. 
</P>
<P>
 The huge Newport Coast project is on one of the last stretches of undeveloped 
ocean-view land in Southern California, in the area between Corona Del Mar and 
Laguna Beach. Disney's plans must clear federal, state and county regulatory 
hurdles. But executives said they expect no delays and that construction is 
scheduled to begin next year. The resort could open as early as 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing, with the huge California coastline, how few opportunities there 
are for people to vacation with their families at beach resorts," said Beth 
Heller, director of development for the project.  
</P>
<P>
 Exactly how interests in the Newport Coast resort will be sold has not yet 
been determined, Disney executives said. 
</P>
<P>
 The condominiums -- studios, one-, two- and three-bedroom units -- may be 
marketed as part of the Disney Vacation Club, which allow members to buy time 
at the company's resort near Disney World, as well as other planned resorts. 
The properties include 24-hour front-desk service and recreational amenities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Burbank-based company said it has sold more than 9,000 memberships in its 
time-share projects since establishing the club in December, 1991. Memberships 
begin at $12,390. 
</P>
<P>
 The time-share business has drawn widespread criticism of hard-sell tactics 
used to market shoddy developments in undesirable vacation locations. But 
Disney relies on a soft sell and builds high-quality resort projects that could 
compete with any luxury hotel, said David Matheson, a spokesman for the 
American Resort and Residential Development Assn., a trade group in Washington. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "Almost everyone in the industry is looking at what Disney is doing and trying 
to do it themselves," Matheson said. "They are bringing a level of 
respectability to the time-share industry." 
</P>
<P>
 The land purchased by Disney originally was earmarked for a Marriott hotel. 
But Marriott failed to obtain financing, according to Irvine Co. executives. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is in lieu of the hotel, so I don't think it will be that much 
different," said Jean Watt, a Newport Beach City Council member. "I hope Disney 
will do a good job. I hope as a developer they will do something that fits into 
the environment. It's such a sensitive area in terms of views. Most of the 
wildlife has already been evicted from that area."

U.S. TO ALLOW HUGHES SATELLITE DEAL FOR CHINA ; TECHNOLOGY: COMPANY REMOVED 
ENCRYPTION ABILITY, EASING ADMINISTRATION FEARS. THE SALE MEANS JOBS IN 
CALIFORNIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Clinton Administration indicated Monday that it is preparing to clear the 
way for Hughes Aircraft Co. to export a communications satellite to Australia 
for eventual launch in China, withdrawing its longstanding opposition to the 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past seven months, the State Department had opposed the export of the 
satellite on grounds that it would violate economic sanctions barring the 
transfer of high-technology equipment from the United States to China. But 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher, shifting ground, said Monday that the 
Administration will now process Hughes' license "promptly and briskly." 
</P>
<P>
 "Just recently, the Hughes company has been reconfiguring that satellite, and 
we believe that makes it now eligible for a Commerce Department license, which 
means that it would no longer be subject to sanctions," Assistant Secretary of 
State Winston Lord told reporters. "So it looks like that particular problem 
between us and Australia will now disappear." 
</P>
<P>
 The decision will be of considerable economic importance to Los Angeles-based 
Hughes, whose chairman, C. Michael Armstrong, last fall intervened personally 
with President Clinton to warn that the sanctions against China could cause 
serious damage to his company and lead customers to buy European satellites. 
</P>
<P>
 "It escapes me what effect our laying off 4,000 to 5,000 more people in 
California and shifting the export business to Europe has on the Chinese," he 
said at the time. The figure Armstrong used for the layoffs covered two Hughes 
satellites -- the one for Australia and another that was already approved by 
the Administration in January.  
</P>
<P>
 Dave Shea, a Hughes spokesman in Washington, said Monday that the company 
would have no immediate comment on the State Department's new willingness to go 
along with the sale, whose dollar value has not been made public. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. reversal amounts to a goodwill gesture to the Australian government, 
which had complained that the sanctions, while directed against China, were 
unintentionally harming Australia. The disclosure was made shortly before 
Christopher landed in Canberra for meetings with Prime Minister Paul J. Keating 
and other top Australian officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. action also helps China, which will profit by launching the satellite 
for an undisclosed fee. The announcement comes four days before Christopher is 
scheduled to land in Beijing for meetings with top Chinese officials. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Christopher maintained Monday that the Administrations's decision to 
permit the sale of the satellite "was not a particular favor we are doing for 
China. It was simply something that was consistent with our law and served our 
commercial purposes." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if helping China was not the intent of the Administration's action, the 
effect is to further undercut the impact of the sanctions against Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 Those sanctions were imposed in August after U.S. intelligence agencies 
concluded there was hard evidence that China had been supplying Pakistan with 
parts and technology for its new, highly accurate, solid-fuel M-11 missiles. 
Pakistan is believed to have the ability to make nuclear warheads, which arms 
control specialists believe might be delivered with these missiles. 
</P>
<P>
 A 4-year-old U.S. law requires the imposition of sanctions against any country 
that violates the international regime restricting the sale of missile 
technology. When the United States imposed the sanctions, the action held up 
the export of seven satellites, all of which had been planned for launch in 
China. 
</P>
<P>
 Officially, those sanctions remain in effect. But in January, after 
considerable internal skirmishing, the Clinton Administration decided that two 
of the satellites were not covered by the sanctions and could be launched in 
China because those satellites did not give China access to any advanced or 
sensitive technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's announcement about Hughes now opens the way for the third of the 
seven U.S.-built satellites China is planning to launch. 
</P>
<P>
 Australia's Optus satellite -- owned by a consortium of seven private 
Australian firms, BellSouth Corp. and Cable and Wireless of Hong Kong -- will 
provide commercial service for the Australian Broadcasting Co., civil aviation 
and pay TV in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 The satellite is supposed to replace one that blew up in an aborted launch in 
China's Sichuan Province in 1992. As originally planned, there were also 
apparently some military uses for the Australian satellite, which contained 
encryption technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Top State Department officials contended that the decision to clear the way 
for the satellites had been made only after Hughes itself agreed to remove 
valuable encryption technology embedded in the satellite.  
</P>
<P>
 It was this change in approach by Hughes, they said, that permitted the State 
Department to go along with the sale. U.S. officials had wanted to ensure that 
China did not gain access to the encryption technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not as if the U.S. is relaxing any sanctions," Lord said. "This has been 
in the works for some time. . . . It's got absolutely no policy significance." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the decision surprised the Australian government. Only last Thursday, 
an Australian diplomat in Washington told The Times he detected no change in 
the State Department's longstanding opposition to the satellite sale and 
expected that the issue would come up during Christopher's visit to Canberra. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said Hughes resubmitted a new license application for the 
satellite to the Commerce Department late last week, only a day before 
Christopher departed on a trip that will take him to both Australia and China. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand they have dropped the encryption aspects of it, so it will now 
be processed," Christopher said in Australia.  
</P>
<P>
 Under existing procedures, the Commerce Department must still give final 
approval to Hughes' application. But the Commerce Department has strongly 
supported the deal, and it is the State Department's objections that have held 
up the sale of the satellite.

 McDonald's Mulls Home-Style Restaurants: McDonald's Corp. said it is studying 
the concept of a chain of sit-down restaurants that offer dinner fare such as 
roast chicken, meatloaf and mashed potatoes. The new chain would be called 
Hearth Express, according to the weekly Crain's Chicago Business. The concept 
is similar to that of Boston Chicken, a fast-growing chain based in Naperville, 
Ill., that specializes in rotisserie-broiled chicken and home-style side 
dishes, said Sharon Olson, president of the Olson Group Inc., a food service 
consulting firm in Chicago.

 MetLife Fine Could Reach $20 Million: Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. agreed 
to pay up to $20 million to settle charges that its agents misled life 
insurance customers.The company, known for its ads featuring Snoopy, was 
accused by Florida officials of fraudulently selling policies to nurses who 
thought they were buying retirement savings plans. The fine would be divided 
among the states according to the number of affected policyholders. Florida 
would get the most, at $4.3 million. MetLife has already agreed to reimburse 
customers who were misled, which the company expects will cost about $30 
million.

 PUC Judge Proposes Phone Rate Changes: The state Public Utilities Commission 
official proposed changes in the formula used to determine Pacific Bell's phone 
rates through 1996.The shifts are expected to save ratepayers money. Pacific 
Bell said one key change would mean cumulative rate reductions of $400 million 
in 1994, $800 million in 1995 and $1.2 billion in 1996. Under the old formula, 
the reductions would have been $300 million in 1994, $600 million in 1995 and 
$900 million in 1996. A PacBell vice president said any revenue reduction could 
impair the company's ability to develop new products and services and invest in 
the state's telecommunications infrastructure.

 Foley Elected Chairman of Carl Karcher Enterprises: William P. Foley II, who 
late last year acquired a controlling interest in Carl Karcher Enterprises, has 
been elected chairman of the Carl's Jr. fast-food chain. He replaces interim 
Chairman Elizabeth A. Sanders, who will remain on the board.Late last year, 
Foley, chairman and chief executive of Irvine-based Fidelity National Financial 
Inc., led an investor group that took control of 22% of Karcher Enterprises 
stock in return for helping Carl N. Karcher restructure nearly $30 million in 
personal debt. In a related announcement, Karcher Enterprises said it is 
seeking Securities and Exchange Commission approval to sell up to $75 million 
in securities to help pay for construction of Boston Chicken restaurants. The 
company also seeks approval from shareholders for a corporate restructuring 
that would form a new holding company, CKE Restaurants Inc.

 Postal Service Board Votes on Rate Increase Proposal: The U.S. Postal Service 
Board of Governors met to vote on a proposal to increase overall mailing rates 
by what is believed to be more than 10%.The vote is expected to include raising 
the price of a first-class stamp to 32 cents from 29 cents. A spokesman said 
the result of the vote on the first-class stamp will be made public today. The 
proposal then will go to the independent Postal Rate Commission, which must 
have hearings and rule on the request within 10 months. Postal authorities want 
the new rate -- the last was in 1991 -- to take effect early next year.

 Fed Governor Sees Stable Short-Term Rates: U.S. short-term interest rates will 
probably remain near 3% this year, Federal Reserve Board Gov. Lawrence Lindsey 
said.His remarks implied that the Fed may not push short-term interest rates 
sharply higher this year. On Feb. 4, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan announced the 
board was boosting short-term rates on loans among banks to head off inflation. 
The so-called federal funds rate rose to 3.75% from 3%. Lindsey told a 
Baltimore meeting of the Commercial Finance Assn. that he concurs with 
forecasts that the U.S. output of goods and services, retail price hikes and 
short-term rates will all be about 3% this year.

INTEL ROLLS OUT POWERFUL NEW PENTIUM CHIPS; TECHNOLOGY: SEVERAL MAJOR COMPUTER 
MAKERS IMMEDIATELY ANNOUNCE PLANS TO INCORPORATE THE CHIPS IN NEW MACHINES. 
</P>

<P>
 Intel Corp., racing against Apple Computer Inc. to deliver the most powerful 
personal computers, Monday rolled out its new family of high-speed Pentium 
microprocessors. Several major PC makers immediately said they plan to offer 
new machines using the chips. 
</P>
<P>
 The rapid growth of the home PC market -- driven by new home-office computing, 
multimedia applications and a boom in subscriptions to on-line services -- 
makes the race for the most high-powered chip all the more critical. 
</P>
<P>
 Intel's new chips are designed to steal market share from the PowerPC 
microprocessor, developed jointly by Apple, Motorola Inc. and IBM Corp. and 
introduced last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Intel move comes a day before IBM is expected to roll out a new high-end 
notebook computer that runs on the PowerPC chip. And Motorola is expected to 
ship a new version of the PowerPC chip, called the 604, late this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the new Pentium PCs and their competitors based on the PowerPC chip are 
expected to range in price from about $2,400 to $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Intel, the world's largest computer chip maker, Monday introduced two faster 
versions of the Pentium chip, which was unveiled last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The new versions run at speeds of 90 or 100 megahertz -- compared to the 66 
megahertz of existing Pentium chips. The processing speed of chips is measured 
in megahertz, or millions of cycles per second. 
</P>
<P>
 The 100-megahertz Pentium processors cost $580 each in lots of 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Intel estimated Pentium-based computers will account for about 15% of PC 
shipments this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Higher-performance processors are entering the mainstream of the marketplace 
faster as the PC becomes a mass-market, interactive home appliance," said Paul 
Otellini, senior vice president of Intel's Microprocessor Products Group. "The 
home PC spans entertainment, education, family business and home office uses -- 
all requiring the increasing levels of performance provided by the Pentium 
processor family." 
</P>
<P>
 The new Pentium chip raises the quality and performance of multimedia 
education and entertainment programs, Intel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Intel also introduced a new version of its popular 486 chip, the DX4, which is 
about twice as fast as existing 486 chips. 
</P>
<P>
 Several computer makers announced their support for both Intel chips. Among 
them, Digital Equipment Corp., based in Maynard, Mass., said it will 
incorporate Intel's new DX4 and Pentium chips in its new personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
 The first line of Digital computers to use the chips will be its premium line 
of DECpc XL systems, Digital said. It did not say when it will begin shipping 
the machines. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston-based Compaq Computer Corp. has introduced a new notebook computer 
line built around Intel's DX4 chip. The fully configured machine starts at 
under $2,800, Compaq said. 
</P>
<P>
 AST Research Inc., based in Irvine, said its new Bravo line of personal 
computers, ranging in price from about $1,880 to $2,800, will run on Intel's 
DX4 processor. 
</P>
<P>
 Hewlett-Packard Co. of Palo Alto is expected to introduce a new line of 
Pentium-based PCs priced at about $5,000.

NEW REGULATORY GUIDELINES DUE ON LENDER DISCRIMINATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From American Banker 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After months of heated negotiations, regulators are set to spell out precisely 
what lending behavior they consider discriminatory, providing guidance to banks 
and thrifts on how to avoid government investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 Regulators are expected to release today a joint policy statement on lending 
discrimination.The document will address issues such as how lending data will 
be evaluated, what lending patterns will be referred to the Justice Department 
for investigation and how regulators will respond to industry self-testing. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also expected to address how regulators will scrutinize various bank 
policies -- such as underwriting standards -- in investigating possible 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 The 21-page statement, while not carrying the force of law, will nonetheless 
be recognized by 10 federal agencies as the definition of discrimination in 
their efforts to enforce fair-lending laws. It will provide the most explicit 
notice to date of the practices bankers must employ to avert government 
investigations of illegal lending discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations on the breadth of the plan have continued up to the last minute 
and have worked their way up to the highest levels of the agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier drafts of the statement included much more strenuous requirements, 
which probably would have engendered industry cries of micro-management and 
credit allocation. Much of the harshest language was deleted after strong 
opposition by Federal Reserve Board officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Drafting of the document comes after repeated complaints from bankers that the 
agencies are stepping up enforcement of fair-lending laws without spelling out 
the ground rules. For example, bankers have complained that they do not 
understand what credit decisions, underwriting standards and lending patterns 
constitute illegal discrimination.

GOLDEN WEST PULLS ITS CALFED MERGER OFFER; THRIFTS: THE BANKING FIRMS 'WERE 
NEVER CLOSE ON THIS ONE,' AN ANALYST SAYS. CALFED INSTEAD TRIES TO SHORE UP ITS 
FINANCES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Golden West Financial, parent company of World Savings in Oakland, said Monday 
that it is no longer interested in buying California Federal Bank -- an 
announcement that investors had been expecting. 
</P>
<P>
 "The two parties were never close on this one, and it's no surprise that the 
thing has died," said Prudential Securities thrift analyst Thomas O'Donnell. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West Chairman Herb Sandler declined to comment on the failed bid. In a 
prepared statement Monday, he said that "there seems little point in keeping 
our proposal outstanding" because Los Angeles-based CalFed was not interested 
in the offer. 
</P>
<P>
 After the offer was disclosed in January, shares in Golden West rose to about 
$44 in New York Stock Exchange trading. As its merger offer lost steam, Golden 
West shares dropped, closing Monday at $39.25, down 12.5 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West first proposed the idea of a union between the two banking 
companies in a letter to CalFed's board in December. Combining the two 
companies would have created the nation's second-largest thrift, with $44 
billion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
 CalFed's management was cool to the idea from the start, refusing to hold 
talks or give Golden West permission to inspect its books. CalFed said the 
offer was vague and arbitrary. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West had offered to pay the so-called tangible book value of CalFed's 
assets after problem loans were written down. Although CalFed's tangible book 
value was $616 million as of Sept. 30, Golden West's final bid probably would 
have been much lower after the expected write-offs.  
</P>
<P>
 "Herb Sandler has always searched for bargains, and CalFed shareholders were 
probably right to hold out for a fair price," O'Donnell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West revised its offer to include so-called hope certificates. Those 
would have entitled CalFed shareholders to any money from the sale of problem 
assets that exceeded Golden West's estimates of what they were worth. CalFed 
rejected that offer as well. 
</P>
<P>
 To shore up its financial position, CalFed has embarked on a recapitalization 
plan that included the sale of its Florida branches and the sale of $1.1 
billion in problem loans. CalFed is also seeking to raise more than $300 
million through sales of stock purchase rights and preferred shares. 
</P>
<P>
 CalFed Chairman Edward Harshfield said his shareholders would receive a better 
price for the thrift by waiting for the recapitalization because bidders would 
pay more for a healthy institution.

ACCOUNTING CHANGE SPARKS HEATED DEBATE; STATEMENTS: EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS' 
VALUE WOULD BE DEDUCTED FROM EARNINGS. EXECUTIVES SAY SHARE PRICE WOULD FALL.

<P>
 An accounting rule makers' public hearing on a controversial stock-option 
proposal turned into a fight Monday between executives who oppose the plan as 
confusing and public officials demanding clarity in corporate earnings reports. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're concerned about accounting principles, and I care about creating 
jobs," Bernard Marcus, chairman and co-founder of Home Depot Inc., told the 
Financial Accounting Standards Board. "Your numbers are not creating anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Home Depot will no longer offer its employees stock options if the rule is 
passed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The FASB has proposed requiring companies to estimate the value of stock 
options and deduct that value from its reported earnings. Opponents of the 
proposal say it would amount to bad accounting and bad public policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcus said the FASB was acting because of pressure from Sen. Carl Levin 
(D-Mich.). He charged that Levin is trying to redistribute the nation's wealth. 
</P>
<P>
 Levin scoffed at the idea, espoused by a number of companies, that stock 
options represent a way to share capital with employees. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Calling the current system "stealth compensation," he said companies can 
deduct stock options as a business expense on their tax returns, yet attach no 
value to stock-option grants on their financial statements. 
</P>
<P>
 "With few exceptions, stock options primarily compensate corporate 
executives," Levin said. He cited a study that found that less than 2% of 
companies offer such options to all employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stock options are an executive pay issue, and the argument over accuracy is 
simply a smoke screen from people who don't want to charge earnings at all," 
Levin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcus said Home Depot offers options to about 3,000, or 6%, of its 50,000 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the company would stop granting stock options if the rule passed, that 
he feared the company's stock price would fall because lower earnings would be 
shown on the reports. 
</P>
<P>
 When FASB project manager John Althoff asked the basis of that belief, Marcus 
said: "You're trying to confuse me with logic." 
</P>
<P>
 One analyst said past accounting-rule changes have had little effect on stock 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's relatively little impact of making changes in accounting standards," 
said Peter Knutson of the Assn. for Investment Management & Research.

 Vons Cos. Joins Lawsuit Against Drug Firms: The Arcadia-based company and 
three other major grocery chain operators have filed suit in Cincinnati federal 
court, charging 16 large pharmaceutical firms with discriminatory pricing.The 
suit -- a joint filing that also includes Oakland-based Safeway Inc., Boise, 
Ida.-based Albertson's Inc. and Cincinnati-based Kroger Co. -- said the drug 
manufacturers engage in two-tier discriminatory pricing. It claims the 
companies charge their supermarket pharmacies more for drugs than they charge 
health maintenance organizations, mail-order prescription companies or 
institutional pharmacies.

 Technology: In a move that may broaden its reach and better position it for 
the interactive future, Los Angeles-based Ticketmaster has purchased a 50% 
stake in Pacer/CATS, the London-based company that makes computerized ticketing 
systems for theaters and sports arenas in Britain, the United States and 
Europe. Ticketmaster has also entered into a joint venture with Pacer/CATS 
owner Wembley.The deal will allow Ticketmaster to provide greater access to 
movies and other events through its existing ticketing outlets and phone 
service. Ultimately, the system will also be used in connection with 
Ticketmaster's personal computer on-line service and in support of its 
merchandising efforts, said Chairman and Chief Executive Fred Rosen. 
Ticketmaster, which is the world's leading ticketing agency, was recently 
purchased by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. Allen has declined to discuss his 
plans for the company, but sources said he and Rosen hope to use Ticketmaster's 
technology for a variety of new interactive ventures. There is also talk of a 
Ticketmaster television channel. Under the agreement announced Monday, 
Ticketmaster will pay Wembley $16.4 million for the 50% stake in Pace/CATS. 
Ticketmaster has traditionally been strongest in the area of sports and music 
concerts. JOHN LIPPMAN

EXHIBITORS GATHER IN LAS VEGAS, PAN FILM QUOTAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With Hollywood under threat of increased quotas and levies in Europe, some 
exhibitors on Monday came out in favor of maintaining open access to those film 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
 John Wilkinson, chief executive of Great Britain's Cinema Exhibitor's Assn., 
said theaters everywhere will need open markets if they are to meet the growing 
public demand for entertainment. In England, he said, moviegoing rose 8.8% last 
year alone, a trend that "requires feeding with more and more product." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkinson's comments came during afternoon sessions at the NATO/Showest 
meeting of movie theater owners. The annual convention brings together 
exhibitors and Hollywood executives, who provide a preview of upcoming 
releases. 
</P>
<P>
 The troublesome specter of quotas and fees has grown since last December, when 
U.S. negotiators were unable to overcome stonewalling by their European 
counterparts on including entertainment in the GATT agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the protection of GATT, Hollywood is vulnerable to protectionist 
measures from countries trying to boost their own film industries. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Much of that protectionist sentiment stems from the dominance of U.S. films in 
Europe, even though many Hollywood films are financed with foreign money or 
released by foreign-owned studios. Wilkinson in his talk intentionally called 
American films "international" movies, noting that many of them "just happened 
to be produced in Hollywood by international production companies." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Oneile, managing director of the Greater Union Organization, made the 
case that Australia's film industry has flourished with the lifting of quotas. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1980s, he said, the number of Australian films tripled as quotas 
were lifted. "Quotas do not make a bad film good," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joost Bart, president of Decatron Kinepolis in Belgium, also strongly endorsed 
open film markets, saying the prospect of quotas and levies is scary. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said exhibitors should have made their point of view more widely known 
on the GATT controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Ivany, chief executive of Hoyta Corp. in Australia, said he agrees with 
anti-quota arguments, but he added that local film industries must be 
supported. He said Hollywood should endeavor to produce its films around the 
world, in the same way that a company such as Toyota produces its cars around 
the world.

INJURY BEHIND HIM, NISTA LOOKING AHEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN ARRITT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The discomfort in Brett Nista's right shoulder came to light his sophomore 
year during a stretch in which he was named the starting pitcher the last six 
games of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 It bothered him every time he lifted his right hand above his head, but it was 
nothing a handful of deep freeze medication couldn't numb. 
</P>
<P>
 He continued playing through the summer and into his junior year at Laguna 
Hills High School, where he hid his ailment by switching to first base. 
</P>
<P>
 It was hard to believe Nista was playing hurt. After all, he hit .430 with 11 
home runs, 37 runs scored and 28 runs batted in during the regular season, 
leading the Hawks to their fifth consecutive Pacific Coast League title. 
</P>
<P>
 But after a two-week trip to San Antonio to play in the Olympic Festival with 
the top prospects in the country, Nista passed on a chance to join the national 
team and opted for surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 "They shaved the bone," Nista said. "I had a hook in my shoulder bone and it 
was causing tendinitis." 
</P>
<P>
 The discomfort in his shoulder is gone now, and Nista said his arm has never 
felt better. 
</P>
<P>
 This season he'll move back to shortstop, where he'll anchor one of the best 
infields in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't wait to get started," he said. "This is going to be our best 
season yet. This whole school is into it. Signs are going up. It's never been 
like this before." 
</P>
<P>
 There's no hiding his enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 Nista's impressive junior year is showing in the number of preseason 
publications that have ranked him among the nation's best. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball America rates him No. 43 in the nation, though Nista said that figure 
would be higher if not for his surgery, and he was one of only three 
Californians selected to the Mizuno preseason All-American team. 
</P>
<P>
 But the big story is not what he has done, but what he's about to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Nista began the season needing only 33 hits to surpass Tustin's Shawn Green, 
Orange County's career hit leader with 147. Green, who plays for the Toronto 
Blue Jays' triple-A team, surpassed former Hawk Chris Scheff in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Another county record within sights is the career home run record of 22 shared 
by former Dana Hills player Lance Marks and Andy Ruscitto of Valencia. Nista 
has 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting enough quality pitches to swing at would be a problem in most 
circumstances, but Nista benefits from having two-year all-league designated 
hitter Ron DeVito hitting behind him in the cleanup spot. 
</P>
<P>
 And if a pitcher tries to pitch around Nista and DeVito, all-league second 
baseman Casey Bennett bats fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 An interesting aspect, or terrifying aspect if your team has to play Laguna 
Hills, are Nista's speed and baserunning skills, his best assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Nista admits he could use a steadier glove in the field, but at the same time, 
he says playing defense is his favorite part of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love defense. In fact, I like it more than hitting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Signed, sealed and ready to be delivered to UCLA upon graduation, Nista passed 
on some traditional baseball powerhouses in favor of the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
 Louisiana State, the defending NCAA champion, was a candidate, but Nista was 
worried about the unpredictable weather. 
</P>
<P>
 "They tried to tell me it never rains there, but at the same time it was 
pouring outside," he said. "They even have a slant behind home plate to drain 
off the rainwater." 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach State invited Nista for an informal visit, but Cal State Fullerton 
didn't contact him at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Other visits to Miami, Arizona and USC were intriguing, but college life in 
Westwood appeared too good to pass up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted the experience of a college environment," he said. "If Miami was in 
California, I would have gone there." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the atmosphere, Nista, who has a 3.7 grade-point average, 
thinks highly of UCLA Coach Gary Adams and the number of former Bruins now 
playing in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "They put more players in the majors than any other college," Nista said. 
</P>
<P>
 With his arm troubles behind him, Nista is glad to be thinking ahead. 1992-93

 Highlights 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills was again the toast of the PCL, winning its fifth consecutive 
league title. The Hawks had only two setbacks in league play, including a 4-2 
loss to Century late in the season after Laguna Hills had clinched the 
championship. The Hawks' other loss was their league opener at Laguna Beach, 
when the Artists rallied on a two-out game-winning home run by Ryan Sauers 
following a hit batsman and two errors. Sauers also got the victory on the 
mound. . . . Century had its best season in four years led by Pacific Coast 
League player of the year Tommy Reimers. . . . The race for third place went 
down to the wire, with Trabuco Hills slipping into postseason competition by 
one game. . . . Laguna Beach played the upset role, defeating Laguna Hills and 
Century, while Costa Mesa struggled through a long season. Standings

MIKE PENNER: RAMS HOPE MILLER WON'T FALL DOWN ON THIS JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Say what you will about Chris Miller, the Rams' quarterback for the next three 
years or three months (your guess is as good as mine), but say this much for 
him: 
</P>
<P>
 -- He's no Warren Moon. Moon is 37 years old. Miller doesn't turn 37 until 
August, 2002. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He's no Brett Favre. Favre would have cost the Rams $20 million, plus a 
first-round draft choice, plus a third-round draft choice. Miller is a 
cost-saver -- three years, $9 million, hold on to your draft picks. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He's no Scott Mitchell. Mitchell, to this point, has spent his entire NFL 
career backing up a Pro Bowl quarterback. Miller, in 1991, actually was one. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He's no Jeff George. For that, we should all get down on our knees and give 
thanks. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He's no Bubby Brister, or Chris Chandler, or David Krieg. What Chuck Knox 
was thinking there, I'm afraid to ask. 
</P>
<P>
 On the downside, Miller tends to fall down. Fall down and go boom. Fall down 
and go send for the knee surgeon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pop Goes The Anterior Cruciate" could be this guy's theme song. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams used to have a quarterback who fell down a lot -- What was his name? 
-- but generally those dives were self-induced, taken as precautionary 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
 When Miller falls, it's lights out, season's over, make way for the gurney, 
start warming up Billy Joe. Miller spent seven seasons with the Atlanta 
Falcons, but finished only three of them. Injuries to the ankle, elbow and head 
cut short his 1988 season. A broken collarbone wiped him out in Week 13 of 
1990. A torn-up knee chopped his 1992 season in half. Same knee blows out on 
the second Sunday of last September, Miller misses the last 14 1/2 games of 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller is the Official Ellipses of the National Football League. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was having a great season, and then . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 "He was fourth in the league in passing until . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 "He threw for 15 touchdowns in eight games, but that was before . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 That's the big tease with Miller. If he could ever finish a sentence, he just 
might finish a season in the Super Bowl. Take a look at those years when he was 
able to avoid injured reserve. Passed for 3,400 yards in 1989. Passed for 3,100 
yards and 26 touchdowns in 1991. He was on his way to his finest season in 1992 
-- 15 touchdowns, 1,700 yards in eight games -- when he tried to elude a tackle 
by the Rams' Anthony Newman, caught his foot in a seam in the Georgia Dome's 
artificial turf and turned his knee ligaments into spaghetti. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams remember that moment, but they also remember Miller usually beating 
them. So when Miller became available last month as an unrestricted free agent, 
the Rams tapped their pencils, scratched their heads and said, "What the hell, 
he always looks great against us. Let's fly him in." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Vitt, Ram assistant head coach, has been the point man on the team's 
free-agent search committee. He arranges the visits to Rams Park, choreographs 
the wining and dining, drives the Potential Rams to their physical exams. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's physical was his own personal Super Bowl. Fail and you lose $9 
million. Fail and the Rams take a long, hard look at Chris Chandler. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Robert Kerlan conducted the examination, conducted it for four hours, and 
left Vitt and Rams' Senior Vice President Jay Zygmunt sitting in the waiting 
room, fearing the worst. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finally," Vitt says, "Dr. Kerlan came out and said, 'The knee is stable, the 
knee is fine. Three more months and it will be 100%.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Jay and I just about fell out of our chairs. We were so excited, we all went 
out to dinner that night and Chuck was drawing X's and O's on the tablecloth 
for Chris." 
</P>
<P>
 In a departure from last year, when they spent the free-agent shopping season 
on their heels, always one step behind the competition, the Rams acted swiftly 
to get Miller's name on a contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here's a bona fide quarterback," Vitt says. "He's been to the Pro Bowl, he 
throws for more touchdown passes than interceptions, he's an unrestricted free 
agent and now he's been cleared by Dr. Kerlan, one of the most respected sports 
doctors in the business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once that became public knowledge, they all jumped in. Buddy Ryan's calling 
him on the phone. Everybody wants a piece of him now." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams got all of Miller, with all his pieces currently attached, before the 
Cardinals and the rest of the vultures could swoop in. Give them credit for 
that. Now they have a quarterback who can do more than pitch the ball to Jerome 
Bettis, presuming there is a need for more, which is a valuable lure for a team 
still in dire need of a free-agent wide receiver or two. 
</P>
<P>
 And, say, isn't free agent Michael Haynes a former favored target of Miller's 
down in Atlanta? 
</P>
<P>
 So praise the Rams for taking the initiative, but do not allow them to rest on 
their laurels, now that they have some. Miller The Sound and Miller The 
Bandaged mean two different things to the Rams. One gets you TDs, the other 
gets you T.J. Where's the insurance against another seam in the AstroTurf? The 
names are Trent Dilfer and Heath Shuler, Chuck. If one's still available with 
the fifth pick in the draft, don't go thinking offensive lineman. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's a month from now. Monday, Ram coaches were in a dither, closing 
their eyes and smiling as they pictured Miller in a Ram uniform, dropping back 
in the pocket, staying in the pocket, throwing passes, completing passes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a great day for us," Vitt says. "We're beside ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Until proved otherwise, the Rams want to believe that Chris Miller is just 
what the doctor ordered. 
</P>

EATING AWAY AT PROBLEM; AFTER LOSING NEARLY 60 POUNDS, WILLIAMS IS A HAPPY 
CLIPPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Williams of the Clippers stared at himself in the mirror and smiled. 
</P>
<P>
 He almost didn't recognize himself after having lost nearly 60 pounds in four 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, a 6-foot-9 forward-center, weighed 330 pounds when he entered the 
Duke University Diet and Fitness Center last October. He was put on the 
suspended list by the Clippers before the season opened. 
</P>
<P>
 Activated by the Clippers on Feb. 4, having sat out the first 42 games of the 
season, Williams said he weighed 276 pounds and wanted to shed six more. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel great now," Williams said. "I can look in the mirror and say 'Hey, 
you've done something nice.' I see myself now and see a totally different 
person. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've still got my old clothes and sometimes I'll try them on and just stand 
there dazed when I realize how much weight I've lost. When I first got back and 
tried on a pair of my pants, they were four inches too big." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams' battle of the bulge began when he suffered a season-ending knee 
injury 18 games into the 1989-90 season. Averaging a career-high 18.2 points at 
the time for the Washington Bullets, he suffered two torn ligaments in his 
right knee while chasing a loose ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was ranging from 250 to 260 pounds before I got hurt, but I was in a full 
cast for three months and I wasn't able to do anything," he said. "I just 
started gaining weight. I've always had the problem of going up and down in 
weight, and I just got out of control." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams also had emotional problems. 
</P>
<P>
 He was devastated because two of his closest friends, Melvin Maxwell and Greg 
Braggs, had died suddenly within a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxwell, who had befriended Williams when he attended Louisiana State, was 
killed in a gang-related shooting in Oakland in the summer of 1989. Bragg, who 
had played with Williams at Crenshaw High, drowned while jet skiing at Marina 
Del Rey in the summer of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "Melvin was like a brother to me," Williams said. "He wasn't in a gang, but it 
was a case of mistaken identity. Someone pulled up next to him in a car and 
just shot the whole car up. He was shot five or six times." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams took the deaths hard. 
</P>
<P>
 "John blamed himself for both deaths," said Fayne Pitts, Williams' fiancee. 
"Melvin used to live with John, and then when we got engaged . . . that's when 
Melvin moved out and got into trouble. (Williams) blamed himself for the death 
because he kind of pushed him out. And he blamed himself for Greg's drowning 
because he didn't push Greg to wear a life jacket. John stood on the beach and 
watched him drown." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams turned to junk food and liquor to ease the pain. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was real depressing because we were so tight," Williams said. "Any time 
you would see me, you would see one of them. . . . It was devastating. I 
started drinking, eating and hanging out late at night. I wasn't concentrating 
on getting back out on the court and taking care of my life, and it just got 
the best of me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if I had a drinking problem, but I was drinking a lot. And it 
didn't mix with trying to lose weight. I'd drink a six pack (a day) or 
sometimes more. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was isolated and by myself a lot. I didn't want to be around a lot of 
people and didn't want to talk to anyone. I was real frustrated and depressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I'd just get up and go to the beach and watch the water because it 
was relaxing. I'd take some fried chicken and burgers and go pig out there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt real relaxed when I was eating because it was the only time when I 
could just shut everybody out." 
</P>
<P>
 He also wasn't committed to his rehabilitation program and worked out 
irregularly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just took everything for granted," Williams said. "I figured that things 
would work out with time, but I wasn't putting out the effort to get back." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams returned to the Bullet lineup on Feb. 12, 1991 -- he had been 
sidelined for 112 games -- and averaged 12.5 points, 5.4 rebounds and four 
assists in 33 games. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Bullets suspended him for the entire 1991-92 season because he was 
overweight and out of shape. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had reason to suspend me because I wasn't putting out the effort that 
was expected of me," Williams said. "In a way, I'm glad everything turned out 
like it did. You have to go through problems to get stronger in life." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams got a second chance when Washington traded him to the Clippers for 
the draft rights to former UCLA forward Don MacLean and center William Bedford 
on Oct. 8, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Clipper coach Larry Brown was instrumental in the acquisition of 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's as good as any player I ever coached in his understanding of the game 
and his unselfishness and his ability, and I really mean that," Brown said. 
"I've always thought he was a pretty special player and person." 
</P>
<P>
 Joining the Clippers was a homecoming for Williams, who had averaged 28.7 
points, 14.1 rebounds, 4.7 assists and 3.5 steals in leading Crenshaw High to 
the 1984 State championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, who weighed 300 pounds last season, struggled, averaging a 
career-low 6.6 points, 4.3 rebounds and 1.9 assists in 74 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got traded here I was still way overweight," Williams said. "But I saw 
it as another opportunity for me. I didn't have the best of years last year, 
but I could say that I was in the league and most people can't say that. I was 
in the league at 300 pounds. Not too many people could do that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Man, I don't know how I did it last year, but I got away with it last year. 
There were days where I felt real sluggish. I didn't feel good about myself as 
an individual." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think he's anywhere near as effective as he would be if he were at a 
reasonable weight," Brown said. "And that's something he's trying to deal with. 
</P>
<P>
 "But before anybody can do anything about (losing weight), you have to come to 
grips with it. I thought John tried, but it still wasn't to the point where he 
knew he needed to do it. And I think that happened this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I'm proud of him, because it hasn't been easy for him. Last year when I 
was coaching him, he could see things he knew he was capable of doing and he 
was playing against players he knew he could beat, and the fact that he wasn't 
light enough or physically able frustrated him." 
</P>
<P>
 When Brown left the Clippers to coach the Indiana Pacers, he tried to trade 
for Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried real hard to trade for him and thought we had a trade, but it fell 
through," Brown said. "I continue to try to get John. I'd love to coach him 
again. As long as I'm in basketball, I'm going to do everything I can to get 
reunited with him." 
</P>
<P>
 After Brown departed, the Clippers ordered Williams to lose weight, sending 
him to the Pritikin Center in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 He dropped out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was willing to try anything," Williams said. "I went to Pritikin, but the 
program is real difficult because they give you food that you wouldn't eat 
every day, but at that time I was willing to try anything." 
</P>
<P>
 He also tried a liquid diet, but failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Williams entered the Duke program by mutual consent with the 
Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't in shape to play basketball," Williams said. "I'm not trying to fool 
nobody, trying to go out there and struggle like I did last year because this 
game is supposed to be fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams was put on a low-fat, low-salt diet of 1,500-2,000 calories per day. 
He also worked out twice a day with a personal trainer, running on a treadmill 
and lifting weights. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the beginning, I didn't (lose weight), but they told me that I had to 
stick with it because it wouldn't happen overnight," Williams said. "I stayed 
on the program and I started seeing results. (That) made me feel a lot better. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had some people down there who weighed 700 pounds and I was just one of 
them. A couple of people knew who I was, but I was the only professional 
athlete there." 
</P>
<P>
 But he wasn't particularly athletic. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first got down there I couldn't walk a mile," he said. "I'd get too 
tired and my back and knees would start to hurt. But I kept pushing myself and 
I got to the point where I was running five miles a day and riding (an 
exercise) bike for an hour a day." 
</P>
<P>
 Pitts helped motivate Williams.  
</P>
<P>
 "When he was away at Duke University, the way I used to get him to work out 
when I knew he was getting kind of bummed out was to call him up and tell him, 
'I'm tired of hearing people say that John Williams was a good player. You're 
not a has-been,' " Pitts said. "Or I'd call him up and read him old (newspaper) 
articles from when he was playing with the Bullets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lost 25 pounds myself. I want to do it with him. When he's home, I'll go 
with him to the gym and I'll eat what he has to eat." 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper shooting coach Kiki Vandeweghe and Carl Horne, the team's strength and 
conditioning coach, helped prepare Williams for his return to the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's on a low-fat diet and lifting weights and practicing with the team every 
day, so his weight is continuing to drop," Horne said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knows that he can control his weight now. That was the main thing he had 
to figure out, because he's just been out of control these past few years." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams made an immediate contribution to the struggling Clippers. Starting 
against the Lakers last month, he had his best game as a Clipper, scoring 21 
points.

FALLEN ANGEL SET TO SOAR; INFIELDER J.T. SNOW HAS A NEW OUTLOOK AFTER A 
ROLLER-COASTER 1993 SEASON THAT SAW HIM FLY HIGH, FLAME OUT AND FLY AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 J.T. Snow stopped to grab an apple in the food line when he noticed a sudden 
flurry of movement. Reporters were being shooed away. The clubhouse doors were 
quickly locked. 
</P>
<P>
 This was weird. The entire Angel team had just settled into spring-training 
camp a few days ago, and now Manager Buck Rodgers was calling a team meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Boy, someone must have done something wrong. Snow started feeling sorry for 
that poor soul. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow began replaying the day's events in his mind. Then it hit him. Maybe he 
was the one. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't help when he looked around and saw everyone staring at him. Seconds 
later, he realized he had caused the meeting: 
</P>
<P>
 It was a surprise birthday party in his honor. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so maybe it wasn't the type of bash that you run home and tell your wife 
about, but the event left Snow overwhelmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Apprehensive about being ostracized when he set foot in the Angels' clubhouse 
a year ago, and never quite feeling comfortable, Snow was now being officially 
accepted by his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, he was one of the guys. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anyone even came up to me to wish me happy birthday last year," 
said Snow, 26 last week. "All they knew was that Jim Abbott was gone, and I was 
one of the guys they got in return. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guys were checking me out all spring. They wanted to see what they got in 
return. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just kept my mouth shut and tried to show everybody that I belonged." 
</P>
<P>
 When the regular season began in mid-April, everybody knew about J.T. Snow. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the next five months, they weren't sure just what they knew. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow's season was like the image one gets standing in front of a mirror in a 
fun house. It differed drastically, depending upon the angle from which it was 
viewed. It was exaggerated, complimentary and, sometimes, appalling, but never 
definitive. 
</P>
<P>
 How can you start and end a season by winning the American League's 
player-of-the-week award and spend the time in between trying to figure out 
what's happening? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure if I've ever seen a season quite like it," Rodgers said. "He ran 
through the entire gamut of emotions. The whole season was one long 
roller-coaster ride, and no one knew what time he was getting on or off. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'll tell you this, what J.T. did that first month was the greatest thing 
that could have happened to us. He not only benefited himself, but he benefited 
this entire organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe me, if he didn't get off to that start, we wouldn't be in the 
position (to contend) like we are today." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This was crazy. After battling all spring to make the Angel roster, suddenly 
he was the reincarnation of Wally Joyner. 
</P>
<P>
 It started with a home run in his second at-bat on opening day. He was hitting 
.368 with five runs batted in at the end of the first week of the season. He 
had six homers and 17 RBIs by the second week. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Roger Clemens and the Boston Red Sox came to Anaheim on April 25, 
Snow was batting .407 and featured on TV sportscasts from coast to coast. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when everything started to happen," Snow said. "It hit me all at once. 
The expectations just became unreal. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were telling me I was going to be the rookie of the year after one 
week. Someone even projected me to hit more homers than Roger Maris. People 
were acting crazy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trouble was, I got caught up in it, too. They told me in spring training 
just to relax, and that if I hit .260 with 10 homers and 50 RBIs it would a 
great year. 
</P>
<P>
 "But after the first month, everything changed. My expectations went up, too. 
I figured no problem, I'd hit .280 to .300 with 25 homers." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jack Snow, J.T.'s father: "He told me, 'Honest, Dad, I don't know what 
I'm doing, but everything I do is working.' 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the part that scared the hell out of me. He had nowhere to go but 
down. My son is not Ted Williams." 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone knew it would be impossible for Snow to continue at that pace, and 
the Angels were not going to stay in first place the entire season, but the 
dream continued. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow became one of the biggest things to hit Southern California since the 
surfboard. Everyone wanted a piece of him. He was receiving nearly 200 fan 
letters a day. Classmates from third grade were calling. Stacks of interview 
and promotional requests awaited him every day in the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's where the trouble started," said shortstop Gary DiSarcina, who had a 
locker next to Snow. "He tried to accommodate everyone but himself. Instead of 
coming to the ballpark for early work, he was there doing interviews and 
signing everything. He was carrying the entire ballclub, but he had so much 
thrown onto his shoulders, you knew something was bound to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 It finally did. In that nationally televised game against the Red Sox, 
Clemens, taking it upon himself to provide his own rookie initiation program, 
fired a pitch behind Snow's head that sent him sprawling. Snow struck out, and 
for the first time in a week, failed to get a hit during the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Snow learned all about how umpires carried out their initiation programs 
the next game. He was called out on a third strike and, frustrated, dropped his 
bat and helmet at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 The plate umpire screamed at Snow: "Hey kid, just remember I can bury you in 
this game. I can get you sent back to A-ball just as quickly as you got here." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers intervened, but it soon became a trend that the Angels complained 
about all season. Still, it was no excuse. The pitches that Snow had been 
sending over the fence now were being hit meekly to second base. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went from doing everything right to doing everything possible wrong," Snow 
said. "I tried everything. I looked at videotapes. I took extra batting 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more things I tried, the more nothing worked. It was the toughest, most 
difficult thing I've ever had to go through in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Snow, who was batting .343 as April ended, hit .124 in May, and his season 
average plummeted to .223 before Rodgers summoned him to his office on the 
night of July 26. 
</P>
<P>
 The words came from Rodgers, but Snow was too dazed to hear them. He was being 
sent to Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 He was back in the minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't hit me until I was sitting in the L.A. airport waiting for my 
flight to Vancouver," Snow said. "It was like, 'Man, what happened to me? Am I 
this bad? Was April just a fluke?' 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't even think straight." 
</P>
<P>
 The decision numbed the entire team. It was as if they had suddenly realized 
that their dream season was over. They had lost 10 of their last 11 games and 
were nine games behind the Chicago White Sox and out of contention in the 
American League West. "It was very tough for all of us," second baseman Torey 
Lovullo said. "We all know what J.T. meant to this team. It was incredible what 
he did for this team early on." 
</P>
<P>
 Right fielder Tim Salmon, who later became the unanimous winner of the 
rookie-of-the-year award, benefited perhaps more than anyone from Snow's start. 
While everyone was mesmerized by Snow, few even noticed that Salmon was batting 
.234 in the first month of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thanked him for taking the spotlight off me," Salmon said. "I was able to 
learn from his mistakes. I got a chance to stand back and keep my perspective. 
J.T. never had a chance to do that. You could see his expectations change. They 
became too great. He just put too much pressure on himself." 
</P>
<P>
 It took Snow several days to recover emotionally, but he finally realized that 
this might be for the best. Besides, his friends had told him that Mickey 
Mantle was sent down in his rookie season, and he turned out all right. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hardest part was that in the players' lounge they always had the Angels' 
games on TV," Snow said. "I couldn't watch it. I'd just go back to my locker." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jack Snow: "I came real close to going up to Vancouver myself, but then I 
thought, 'Hey, the kid has to do this on his own. He's got to do it himself.' 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'll tell you, it was hard on all of us. We went to a few (Angel) games, 
but it was difficult to watch Rene Gonzales play first base when you think your 
son should be the one out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Snow, who went 0 for 13 with eight strikeouts in his first four games at 
Vancouver, returned to Anaheim three weeks later. He had raised his batting 
average to .340 with five homers and had driven in 24 runs when Vancouver 
Manager Max Oliveras told the Angels that triple A no longer presented a 
challenge for Snow. 
</P>
<P>
 He returned a more aggressive, confident hitter, attacking the ball instead of 
waiting for the perfect pitch. During the final five weeks of the season, he 
batted .281 with five homers and 14 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I may be wrong," Oliveras said, "but I don't think he'll ever be going back 
there again." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Snow sat on an otherwise empty bench, recalling things he had long tried to 
forget. His teammates had left the practice field nearly an hour earlier, but 
when Snow got up to leave, he was swarmed by fans. 
</P>
<P>
 He stopped, signed autographs and smiled politely, listening to everyone's 
advice. "Go get 'em, J.T. Do it just like you did in April, J.T. You're still 
our favorite, J.T." 
</P>
<P>
 He wondered if the fans would still have been there for him if he hadn't grown 
up in Orange County, in the shadow of Anaheim Stadium. But he also questioned 
whether his struggles would have been so severe if he hadn't been a local hero. 
</P>
<P>
 "Playing in your hometown was a lot tougher than I thought it would be," Snow 
said. "Everybody was always seeing me, whether it's coming to the game at home 
or watching one on TV while we're on the road. It's almost like it gave 
everyone the right to give me advice or make suggestions." 
</P>
<P>
 This year will be different, Snow vowed. It's not as if he'll become a jerk, 
but he's going to quit trying to accommodate the world. If he needs advice, he 
plans to listen to batting coach Rod Carew and Rodgers. If he needs comfort and 
solace, he said he'll turn to Stacie, his wife as of November. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I've shown people I can play this game," he said. "I know I belong. 
There's no doubt in my mind. There's nothing I'd like better than to get off to 
that kind of start again, but if I do, I promise you things will be different. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh yeah, things will be different."

FALCONS' MILLER SIGNS $9-MILLION DEAL WITH RAMS; PRO FOOTBALL: OFT-INJURED 
QUARTERBACK PASSES PHYSICAL EXAMINATION, WORKS OUT. EVERETT IS EXPECTED TO BE 
TRADED SOON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Quarterback Chris Miller, best known for his passing accuracy and a 
susceptibility to injury, signed a three-year, $9-million contract Monday to 
play for the Rams, the team he idolized while growing up in Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I will help the Rams a bunch," said Miller, who will require one to 
three months of further rehabilitation on his surgically repaired left knee 
before being cleared for unlimited work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had some bad luck injury-wise, but my knee feels great. I've been 
running and it's only March and I have the time to get it stronger." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams gave Miller a $900,000 signing bonus with yearly salaries of $2.1 
million, $2.7 million and $3.3 million. The Rams also maintained a first right 
of refusal on Miller, who earned $1.85 million with the Atlanta Falcons last 
year, once his contract expires in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, desperate for a starting quarterback after the performances of Jim 
Everett and T.J. Rubley last season, talked recently about pursuing Green Bay's 
Brett Favre or Miami's Scott Mitchell or trading for Houston's Warren Moon. 
</P>
<P>
 But they went with Miller, a Pro Bowl selection for Atlanta after the 1991 
season who has twice undergone reconstructive surgery on his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
 Team physicians put Miller through a four-hour examination last week and then 
told Coach Chuck Knox that Miller's knee was at no more risk than any other 
player's. Miller also worked out for Knox at Rams Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "He will definitely be ready for our mini-camp (in May)," Knox said. "He's 
almost 100% right now. He's going to move here right away and we will have him 
continue his rehab under the direction of our team doctors and our trainers." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller tripped on the Georgia Dome's artificial turf in the eighth game of the 
1992 season -- against the Rams -- and suffered a torn anterior cruciate 
ligament in his left knee. After undergoing reconstructive knee surgery, he 
out-dueled Bobby Hebert for the Falcons' starting job in 1993, but played 
poorly and was replaced by Hebert in the third game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta Coach Jerry Glanville put Miller into the fourth game of the season 
with the Falcons trailing the Steelers, 45-17, and 13 minutes remaining. On his 
first play, Miller re-injured his knee. 
</P>
<P>
 He has also sat out in the last seven years because of a bruised chest, 
cracked ribs, sprained ankle, sprained knee and a broken collarbone that 
required the insertion of a steel plate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never dreamed he would pass our physical examination," said Joe Vitt, Ram 
assistant coach. "I wasn't even considering him as a likely candidate for that 
reason. But the doctors said he is a month ahead in rehab and we have computer 
reports tracking his progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a great quarterback when he was healthy, and that's it -- that's the 
whole thing. If he stays healthy, we've got a good one." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, although effective in the Falcons' run-and-shoot attack, was also hurt 
by that offensive philosophy, which allows fewer blockers to protect the 
quarterback. The Rams should be able to keep him out of harm's way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't run a play-action pass in four years, which will be a nice change," 
Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a refreshing start, and I like the idea of having a big horse like 
(Jerome) Bettis back there to carry the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to stay on the West Coast." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams decided weeks ago to trade Everett, who started 87 consecutive games 
before losing his job, but have been waiting to sign a replacement before doing 
so. The team has talked to the New Orleans Saints about Everett.

HARDING'S LAWYERS BACK IN COURT; SKATING: THEY TRY TO OBTAIN INJUNCTION THAT 
WOULD ALLOW HER TO BE IN WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Seeking a repeat of their legal victory that enabled figure skater Tonya 
Harding to compete in the Winter Olympics, her lawyers returned to court Monday 
in an attempt to assure her a berth in this month's World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 They filed papers in Oregon's Multnomah County Circuit Court, requesting a 
temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction that would prevent the 
U.S. Figure Skating Assn. from taking action against Harding that would force 
her withdrawal from the March 22-27 competition in Chiba, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 USFSA lawyers countered by having the action transferred to U.S. District 
Court in Portland, Ore. U.S. District Judge Owen Panner scheduled a hearing for 
2 p.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
 The move was made by Harding's lawyers three days before a five-member USFSA 
panel is scheduled to begin a disciplinary hearing in Colorado Springs, Colo., 
regarding Harding's role in the Jan. 6 assault on rival Nancy Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding was asked to appear before the panel to respond to its determination 
after a hearing last month that there were reasonable grounds to believe she 
was involved in plotting the attack. She was given 33 days to organize her 
defense, but her lawyers said in the motion filed Monday that she has not had 
enough time because of the 20 days spent in preparation for the Olympics and 
other legal matters. 
</P>
<P>
 They also said that participating in the hearing would "irreparably 
compromise" her rights to fairness and due process in the ongoing criminal 
investigation. A grand jury is expected to decide by March 21 whether to indict 
Harding. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar tactics by Harding's lawyers last month were successful in assuring 
her entry into the Winter Olympics. After they filed a $25-million lawsuit, the 
U.S. Olympic Committee canceled a hearing to decide whether Harding could 
compete in return for her withdrawal of the legal action. She finished eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 If the USFSA hearing panel is allowed to convene and confirms its earlier 
findings, Harding's USFSA membership, required for her to compete in national 
and international championship events, could be revoked. 
</P>
<P>
 Substituting for her in Chiba would be second-alternate Nicole Bobek, 16, of 
Colorado Springs. The first alternate, Michelle Kwan, 13, of Torrance, will 
replace Kerrigan, who has decided not to compete in Japan. USFSA President 
Claire Ferguson confirmed Monday that Kerrigan, the Olympic silver medalist, 
has withdrawn from the World Championships and also from the Hershey's Kisses 
Pro-Am at the Sports Arena on April 7-8. 
</P>
<P>
 Skating Note 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Boitano, who finished sixth in the Olympics, will announce this week 
that he is withdrawing from the World Championships because of recurring back 
and groin injuries, sources said Monday. His place will be taken by Aren 
Nielsen, the third-place finisher in the U.S. championships.

THERE'S SPRING IN TROJANS' STEP; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: BOLSTERED BY STRONG 
RECRUITING CLASS, USC OPENS WORKOUTS WITH HIGH HOPES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Harboring great expectations for next fall, USC begins spring football 
practice today. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, Coach John Robinson launched his second USC term with an 8-5 
season. His team was a Pacific 10 Conference tri-champion -- with UCLA and 
Arizona -- with a 6-2 mark, and capped the season with a 28-21 victory over 
Utah in the Freedom Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans missed the Rose Bowl bid by perhaps two yards and 50 seconds on 
Nov. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 They trailed UCLA, 27-21, when quarterback Rob Johnson's pass was intercepted. 
UCLA then held onto the ball as time expired, and went to Pasadena. USC went to 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, USC says it has registered one of its best recruiting classes in 
years, one that old Trojans hope will be the core of teams to perhaps rival 
Robinson's juggernauts of the late 1970s and early '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans are coming off a season that had some negative themes: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A running game that was only intermittently successful.  
</P>
<P>
 Robinson started the season with sophomore Dwight McFadden at tailback but 
McFadden broke an ankle in the first quarter of the opening game.  
</P>
<P>
 Late in the season, after McFadden and teammates Ken Grace and Irwin Lincoln 
had been stopped by police in Hollywood, a gun that reportedly belonged to 
McFadden was found in their car. Shortly afterward, Robinson advised McFadden 
to make himself available for the NFL draft. Freshman Shawn Walters, a 
225-pound power back, was effective for most of the second half of the season. 
But he is expected to compete next season with noted prep recruits Rodney 
Sermons and Delon Washington, and with junior college transfer Leonard Green. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A defensive line that was exposed as the team's weakest link, particularly 
in losses to Notre Dame and Arizona.  
</P>
<P>
 Here, too, help has arrived. Junior college transfers Marcus Bonds and Israel 
Ifeanyi could shore up holes, as might highly touted freshman Darrell Russell, 
who arrives in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson has six offensive and four defensive starters returning. 
</P>
<P>
 The positives: 
</P>
<P>
 -- USC should again have a productive, high-percentage passing offense. 
Johnson is back, but All-American Johnnie Morton, who had 88 catches for 1,520 
yards and 14 touchdowns, isn't. Returning wide receivers are Grace and Ed 
Hervey.  
</P>
<P>
 They will be joined by a top junior college transfer, Keyshawn Johnson. Also 
returning are pass blockers Tony Boselli, Kris Pollack and Norberto Garrido.  
</P>
<P>
 -- The Trojans should have solid kicking game, with kicker Cole Ford and 
punter John Stonehouse back. Stonehouse iced USC's victory at Washington with a 
67-yard punt with 55 seconds left. Also, Robinson recruited highly sought prep 
kicker Adam Abrams of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Johnson, 6 feet 4 and 220, leads the returning offensive group. For USC, 
it was an unhappy circumstance that Rose Bowl hopes died on an intercepted pass 
by him. 
</P>
<P>
 He had only six interceptions all season and set Pac-10 and USC single-season 
completion records with his 68.6% mark. He also threw 29 touchdown passes and 
trails only Rodney Peete on the school list. 
</P>
<P>
 Helping protect Johnson will be Boselli, the 6-8, 305-pound offensive tackle 
from Boulder, Colo. Boselli was on his way to a second consecutive All-American 
season last fall when he dislocated a kneecap at Arizona and missed the next 
five games. 
</P>
<P>
 The 15 spring workouts beginning today at Howard Jones Field will continue 
through April 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Trojan Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming repairs to the earthquake-damaged Coliseum are made in time, USC's 
home season opens Sept. 3 against Washington. Other home games include Baylor, 
Sept. 24; Oregon, Oct. 1; Cal, Oct. 22; Arizona, Nov. 12, and Notre Dame, Nov. 
26. 
</P>
<P>
 Until two weeks ago, the Trojans were trying to arrange a game in Tokyo 
against Washington State on Dec. 3. Tokyo promoters were offering $400,000 to 
each school, but changing the original date of the game, Nov. 5 at Pullman, 
proved too troublesome.

ARIZONA STATE PLAYERS DENY POINT-SHAVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill Frieder, Arizona State's basketball coach, said his players denied any 
involvement in point-shaving after the Nevada Gaming Control Board began an 
investigation of $250,000 in bets by two young men on Saturday's Sun 
Devil-Washington game. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona State had been favored to win its three previous games but had lost 
all three -- by 68-56 at home to USC on Feb. 19, by 87-80 at Oregon on Feb. 24 
and by 80-71 at home to Washington State Thursday.The Sun Devils had opened as 
10-point favorites to beat Washington, but some sports books took the game off 
the board because of the heavy wagering on Washington. Arizona State missed its 
first 14 shots but won, 73-55, in Tempe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some group of guys bet a lot of money on Washington, and we covered (the 
point spread)," Frieder said on Monday from Tempe, to which he returned after 
playing blackjack at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on Sunday. "Do you think I'd be 
alive today if we had agreed to throw a game and then ran away with it?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Nevada Gaming Control Board was studying hours of surveillance tape of the 
two unidentified bettors. Cameras detected a third man, about 60, who stayed in 
the background and watched the other two place bets. The Phoenix Gazette quoted 
a Nevada gaming industry source who said bookies alerted the board early 
Saturday because the gamblers weren't regulars. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Muldoon, assistant Pacific 10 Conference commissioner, said no 
investigation had begun but additional information is being sought.

NEW CHAIRMAN TO SERVE CARL'S JR. CHAIN; FOOD: WILLIAM FOLEY II LED INVESTOR 
GROUP THAT ACQUIRED A CONTROLLING INTEREST IN CARL KARCHER ENTERPRISES. 
RESTRUCTURING IS ALSO PLANNED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 William P. Foley II, who led an investor group late last year that acquired a 
controlling interest in Carl Karcher Enterprises, has been elected chairman of 
the Carl's Jr. fast food chain, replacing interim chairman Elizabeth A. 
Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
 The fast food company also is seeking shareholder approval for a corporate 
restructuring that includes the creation of CKE Restaurants Inc., a new 
Delaware- based holding company that would oversee Karcher Enterprises' 
restaurant businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Karcher Enterprises President Donald E. Doyle said the restructuring was 
driven by the company's recent expansion beyond the Carl's Jr. fast food chain 
and into the fast-growing rotisserie chicken restaurant business. Karcher 
Enterprises in January became the exclusive franchisee for Boston Chicken 
restaurants in Southern California and Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related announcement, Karcher Enterprises said it is seeking federal 
Securities and Exchange Commission approval to sell up to $75 million in 
securities, largely to help fund construction of Boston Chicken restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 The emergence of Foley, 48, as chairman apparently signals the end of a bitter 
struggle in which the company's founder, Carl N. Karcher, was forced out of the 
chairman's office during a highly publicized feud over the company's strategic 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been alluded to in the past that (Sanders) was an interim chairman, and 
that the role would pass to someone else," said Laurie Lively Smith, a Los 
Angeles-based analyst with Seidler Amdec Securities Inc. "And it seemed to be a 
given that if (Foley) wanted it, the chairman's role was his." 
</P>
<P>
 Foley, chairman and chief executive of Irvine-based Fidelity National 
Financial Inc., in December led a group that took control of 22% of Karcher 
Enterprises stock in return for helping Carl N. Karcher restructure nearly $30 
million in personal debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Foley earlier said he was a "logical" candidate for the chairman's role and 
that he wanted the company's founder back as chairman emeritus. Sanders, who 
was selected to succeed Karcher in October, will remain on Karcher Enterprises' 
board. 
</P>
<P>
 Foley said Monday that Karcher Enterprises is "taking the first steps now in 
what is going to be a good, long program of development. . . . We're going to 
have the roll-out of the new (Carl's Jr.) value menu, we've got Boston Chicken 
going, and hopefully, earnings and revenue will develop." 
</P>
<P>
 In a related development, Karcher Enterprises and the company's 76-year-old 
company founder have hammered out an employment agreement that board members 
are expected to approve during a Wednesday meeting. "It's my belief that 
everything will be finalized Wednesday," said Andrew Puzder, Karcher's 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Karcher, who founded the Carl's Jr. chain in 1941, will return to a company 
that has changed considerably since he was forced out in late 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, Karcher Enterprises acquired the right to open as many as 300 
Boston Chicken restaurants in Southern California. The holding company and the 
name change "reflect the fact that we're more than Carl's Jr. restaurants," 
Doyle said. "We've now got two businesses going." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed restructuring also is likely to change the makeup of Karcher 
Enterprises' board of directors, though Foley would be chairman of the board 
for the holding company. 
</P>
<P>
 The company on Monday said it wants shareholders to approve a retirement 
policy that would force board members to retire at age 70. The age restriction 
won't apply to Karcher, 76, whose family still holds 18% of Karcher 
Enterprises' outstanding shares. 
</P>
<P>
 But the age policy would force longtime board member Kenneth Olson, 74, to 
retire. Olson, a retired president of the Vons Companies Inc. grocery store 
chain, has been on Karcher Enterprises' board since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Shareholders are scheduled to vote on the restructuring during an annual 
meeting in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the restructuring evidently marks the end of a lengthy and 
highly public boardroom tiff that resulted in Karcher's dismissal and Foley's 
December election to the board. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't say that I was surprised by any of it," Smith said. "They have 
ambitious plans to roll out the Boston Chicken stores, and they needed outside 
capital at some point to do that. 
</P>
<P>
 "As for the corporate name change, I honestly don't think it was meant to 
slight Carl Karcher, the person," Smith said. "It's simply a change that 
reflects the true business of the company. Boston Chicken is going to be a 
bigger and bigger part of Karcher Enterprises." 
</P>
<P>
 Foley on Monday reiterated his support for a planned value menu that is 
designed to reverse a revenue slide that is hurting profitability. Doyle's team 
is developing a menu that's supposed to make the 350-unit chain more 
competitive with large national chains that correctly identified public demand 
for better food values. 
</P>
<P>
 Doyle said it is imperative that the company be better able to compete with 
other chains that earlier introduced value menus. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've made great progress in improving our cost structure," Doyle said. "But 
sales have not turned around. . . . All of our research points to the fact that 
we get great marks for the quality of our products . . . but terrible in terms 
of value for money. And we have to fix that (so it) makes us compelling to 
consumers and is profitable to us on the bottom line." 
</P>
<P>
 Karcher Enterprises closed down 1.25 cents on Monday at $13.25 in Nasdaq 
trading. New Parent for Carl's Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 The creation of a new holding company for Carl Karcher Enterprises will be on 
the agenda at this month's stockholder's meeting: 
</P>
<P>
 * Name: CKE Restaurants Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 * Holdings: Carl Karcher Enterprises Inc., operator of Carl's Jr. restaurants, 
and Boston Pacific Inc., operator of planned Boston Chicken stores

BOSTON CHICKEN LEADERS MORE RETAIL THAN RESTAURANT; FAST FOOD: INVESTORS, LURED 
BY COMPANY EXECUTIVES' PROVEN BUSINESS ACUMEN, SNAPPED UP STOCK. KARCHER 
ENTERPRISES GRABBED THE LOCAL FRANCHISE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
 He ain't the Colonel. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott A. Beck, chairman of Boston Chicken Inc., is 35, small, wiry and curt, 
with piercing hazel eyes. He talks of product, not poultry. He calls his 
restaurants stores.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're in the multiunit retail business," Beck said. "We consider it far more 
specialty retail than we do restaurant." 
</P>
<P>
 Boston Chicken's plump, rotisserie-roasted birds and home-style side dishes 
may be the most comforting fast food around. But in an industry long on warm, 
fuzzy characters like KFC's bearded gentleman and Wendy's Dave Thomas, Beck is 
a fowl of another feather: a businessman in the purest, prickliest sense. 
</P>
<P>
 That's fine with the investors who snapped up Boston Chicken stock in a wildly 
successful initial public offering in November. They weren't buying folksy 
charm. 
</P>
<P>
 They were betting on Beck and his two main partners, vice chairmen Saad J. 
Nadhir and Jeffry J. Shearer, to repeat the spectacular success they had as 
franchisees and later executives of Blockbuster Entertainment Inc., the 
ubiquitous video store chain. 
</P>
<P>
 "In all my years in the business, I've never seen any (initial public 
offering) that came close to the frenzy created by this one," said Merrill 
Lynch & Co. investment banker Charles Lewis, who set up the stock offering and 
invested in the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Its appeal, he said, "was a combination of a very strong concept that was easy 
to understand . . . and the unbelievably strong pedigree of the management." 
</P>
<P>
 On the day it went public, Boston Chicken's over-the-counter stock, initially 
offered at $20 a share, rocketed to more than $50. It has since ranged from 
about $37 to $45. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock price reflects investors' faith in Beck, his partners and their 
Midas touch. Boston Chicken had just 175 franchised and company-owned stores 
when it went public, concentrated mainly in Boston, New York, Chicago and 
Detroit. It had yet to earn an annual profit. 
</P>
<P>
 That lack of a track record didn't bother Carl Karcher Enterprises, which in 
January paid an undisclosed price to acquire the franchise to build as many as 
300 Boston Chicken stores in Southern California and Sacramento. Boston Chicken 
said it was attracted to Karcher Enterprises by the Anaheim-based company's 
prime real estate. 
</P>
<P>
 Karcher Enterprises on Monday said it would create a holding company to house 
its Boston Chicken and Carl's Jr. restaurant locations. Karcher Enterprises 
previously said it would convert some of its 649 Carl's Jr. restaurants to the 
Boston Chicken concept. 
</P>
<P>
 The chain has since grown to about 250 stores. It sold $154 million worth of 
food last year and earned $1.6 million, compared with a loss of $8.3 million in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 It envisions 450 outlets by the end of this year and at least 1,500 by the 
year 2000. Executives ultimately foresee a chain of 3,000 U.S. stores reaching 
for the same broad market as Blockbuster. 
</P>
<P>
 KFC, formerly known as Kentucky Fried Chicken, a Pepsico Inc. subsidiary with 
5,000 U.S. outlets, has responded to the Boston Chicken threat by adding and 
heavily promoting its own rotisserie chicken and home-style side dishes like 
corn bread, baked beans, and macaroni and cheese. 
</P>
<P>
 Rotisserie chicken's appeal is obvious: It tastes good, it's relatively cheap 
and it's perceived to be lower in fat than other fast foods, although 
nutritionists warn that if you eat the skin, a half-chicken meal at Boston 
Chicken is as fatty as a Big Mac, large fries and a chocolate shake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chicken is in a growth mode as a primary protein," Beck said in an interview 
at Boston Chicken's leased headquarters in the Chicago suburb of Naperville. 
The company will move its offices this summer to Denver, closer to Beck's home 
in Boulder, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 He sees the same potential for roasted chicken that he saw in video rental in 
1985, when he and his father, Lawrence, made a large investment in Blockbuster 
Entertainment, then called Blockbuster Video, shortly after it opened its first 
store. Lawrence Beck had grown wealthy as a co-founder of the large 
waste-handling firm WMX Technologies Inc., formerly Waste Management Inc., 
based in suburban Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Beck and Shearer, a 14-year veteran of the restaurant industry, established 
the first Blockbuster franchise in 1986. Nadhir, a lawyer, joined the group in 
1988 when the franchise bought his family's Detroit video chain, MovieMax 
Video. 
</P>
<P>
 All became corporate officers of Miami-based Blockbuster Entertainment when it 
bought their $100-million business in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Nadhir encountered Boston Chicken in 1991 when his brother was considering 
buying a franchise in what was then a chain of fewer than 20 stores based in 
Newton, Mass. Nadhir was asked to evaluate the company and was struck by the 
number of customers buying large orders to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we asked customers, 'What would you have done if you hadn't come here?' 
we found a lot of them telling us they would have cooked at home -- much more 
so than you would typically have found in the food service industry," Nadhir 
said. "That indicated that possibly there was a new category here, a new market 
segment that was untapped." 
</P>
<P>
 He realized Boston Chicken attracted dollars that would otherwise be spent at 
grocery stores, a much bigger pie than the fast-food market alone. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the idea Arthur Cores and Steven Kolow had when they co-founded 
Boston Chicken in 1985. They still own the original store in Newton and are 
investors in Boston Chicken Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the beginning, people would come to our store, purchase the food, take it 
home, put it on their china, and wouldn't even tell their guests," Cores said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beck said he initially didn't share Nadhir's enthusiasm for Boston Chicken 
because the chain lacked a uniform approach to store operations. "I'm very 
systems-oriented," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shearer recoiled from the thought of re-entering the restaurant business: "The 
2 a.m. closings, the throwing drunks out the front door." He reconsidered when 
he saw Boston Chicken's deli-like stores. 
</P>
<P>
 So they and some associates formed a partnership that acquired control of 
Boston Chicken in the spring of 1992 through a series of investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Beck, Nadhir, Shearer and other managers have put $38 million to $40 million 
of their own money into Boston Chicken. Together they own more than 30% of its 
stock, with Beck holding the most at 16.2%. 
</P>
<P>
 Associates say Beck, with his financial acumen and talent for analyzing and 
refining business systems, is the group's natural leader. But Beck insists 
they're a team, constantly trading duties to meet changing needs. 
</P>
<P>
 His nickname for the disarming Nadhir, a skillful negotiator, is Stealth. 
"He's able to zoom in below the radar," Beck said. "He's just so darned 
effective and he makes such a little fuss coming and going." 
</P>
<P>
 Shearer, tall and garrulous, brings a deep knowledge of restaurant operations. 
He recruited several of the early franchisees, whom he knew from his years with 
S&A Restaurant Corp., builder of the Bennigan's and Steak & Ale chains. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston Chicken has done everything right so far but it will be tested by the 
increasing competition from other chains and supermarkets offering rotisserie 
chicken, said Ron Paul, president of Technomic Inc., a Chicago-based food 
service consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see where they've made any fundamental error at this point in time," 
he said. "I think they're well-positioned to succeed."

OWNERS OF UPSCALE DANA POINT CONDOS SUE DEVELOPER; SAFETY: THEY CLAIM SHODDY 
CONSTRUCTION RESULTED IN HAZARDS AND ARE SEEKING PAYMENT OF $10 MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents of an upscale condominium complex in Dana Point filed a $10-million 
lawsuit Monday against a South County developer, accusing the company of 
violating building safety codes when it constructed the 7-year-old condos. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, filed in Orange County Superior Court, accuses Stein-Brief 
Development Co. in Dana Point of cutting corners during construction, thus 
creating safety hazards at the Tennis Villas at Monarch Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have to re-engineer the entire complex," said Kenneth Kasdan, a partner 
with the Irvine law firm Kasdan, Simonds, Peterson, McInture, Epstein & Martin. 
"There's a hidden danger that lurks within the condos." 
</P>
<P>
 Stein-Brief lawyer Jane Kacer said she had not seen the lawsuit and could not 
comment on it. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit is the second legal challenge that Stein-Brief has faced over the 88 
units in the first and second phases of the sprawling, gated community, which 
overlooks the Monarch Beach golf course near Pacific Coast Highway and offers 
breathtaking ocean and bay views. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year the company paid $750,000 to the villas' homeowners association to 
settle allegations that Stein-Brief built shoddy second-floor drains that 
caused water to leak into first-floor units, ruining the ceilings. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest accusations came after Kasdan's firm was hired to represent 
residents of the complex's third and fourth phases, who had filed a separate 
lawsuit in 1992. Those latter phases were developed by D.T. Smith Enterprises 
Inc., which bought the property from Stein-Brief. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1992 suit, which is still pending, accuses D.T. Smith of not properly 
installing fireproof insulation, using plasterboard instead of plywood on walls 
designed to take the brunt of earthquake tremors, using inferior outside doors 
and a long list of other construction defects. 
</P>
<P>
 An inspection of the first two phases found many of the same shoddy 
construction practices that were allegedly used by Stein-Brief before it sold 
the property to D.T. Smith, Kasdan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kasdan said that the cost of retrofitting the 88 units of the first two phases 
would be more than $7 million. He said that Stein-Brief has refused to take 
responsibility for the alleged problems, leaving him with no alternative but to 
file the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 "They knew about these issues and allowed them to remain," Kasdan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kasdan settled a similar suit in late 1992 involving a Lake Forest condominium 
complex. Residents there sued Newport Beach home builder William Lyon Co., 
alleging that the company failed to build in safety measures. Lyon Co. paid 
$8.7 million as part of that settlement.

 Those of you afraid to open your mouth for fear of revealing what is left of 
your lunch between your teeth, fear no more. 
</P>
<P>
 Se Ki Won says he's got a new product that will make smiling a little safer. 
</P>
<P>
 The 51-year-old, Korean-born handyman has invented what he calls the Handy 
Floss, a dental floss holder that can slip into a shirt pocket or purse and be 
used with a quick flip of the wrist. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very good," Won says enthusiastically. "I think everybody needs this." 
</P>
<P>
 Though the Handy Floss is not the first dental floss holder to be sold, Won 
took the concept a step further by adding a roll of the thin, waxy thread to 
the handle -- about 22 yards' worth. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is a 2 1/2-inch-long, fork-shaped device that holds three patents, 
which Won acquired last year. He said he figures his invention should sell at 
about $1.50 in retail stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Won's next challenge is to make sales to the public. Though he has produced 
about 100,000 units, virtually all of them are sitting unsold in his 
Westminster garage. 
</P>
<P>
 He is searching for investors and a medical products distributor to take the 
Handy Floss to the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need some help," he said. "This could be a big business."

 Drug Testing: A viable treatment for the debilitating effects of stroke and 
head trauma is a step closer to becoming reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Acea Pharmaceuticals Inc., an Irvine-based drug development firm, recently 
announced that it has put together a pair of advisory groups to help the 
company prepare for testing on patients a compound designed to help people 
recover from head injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Selection of the panels -- one to study the effectiveness of the company's 
Acea 1021 compound on head trauma victims and the other to study its 
effectiveness on stroke victims -- is a necessary step before the company can 
begin testing on humans and preparing an application to the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The panels are made up of experts in the field who will guide the company's 
scientific research as it develops the new product. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-member head trauma panel consists of scientists, researchers and 
physicians from the Medical College of Virginia, Duke University, UC San 
Francisco and the University of Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
 The eight-member stroke panel includes representatives from Stanford 
University, Cornell University, the New England Medical Center, Oregon Health 
Sciences University, UC San Diego, the University of Cincinnati and the 
University of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 We're "pleased to have clinical investigators from the nation's leading 
neurological treatment centers," said Acea Chairman Robert G. McNeil. "Their 
expertise and leadership will prove invaluable." 
</P>
<P>
 If all goes well, Acea will soon become part of CoCensys Inc., another medical 
development company in Irvine, which is trying to develop a treatment for 
epilepsy and high anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
 CoCensys last year signed an option to purchase privately held Acea for 4 
million shares of CoCensys stock, valued at $20 million. That option must be 
exercised by June, said Joseph Fojtasek, chief financial officer for CoCensys. 
</P>
<P>
 CoCensys, which is in the midst of human clinical trials for its own product, 
wanted a year to watch the development of Acea's compound before committing 
itself to the acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel selection appears to be a good sign. 
</P>
<P>
 "They appear to be complementary to us," Fojtasek said of Acea. "Their panels 
add a lot of credibility to the program."

 Loral Aeronutronic: The Rancho Santa Margarita-based company said Monday that 
it has been awarded a contract worth $24.7 million from McDonnell Douglas 
Aerospace to make an additional 17 Nite Hawk targeting systems for the U.S Navy 
and the government of Switzerland.The contract increases Loral Aeronutronic's 
orders for Nite Hawks in fiscal 1994 to 57 systems, valued at as much as $137 
million. The company said deliveries will begin in October, 1995, and run 
through September of the following year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nite Hawk is a radar system that helps pilots find and track targets at 
night. A subsidiary of Loral Corp., a high-tech company in New York City, Loral

 Fluor Daniel: The unit of Irvine-based Fluor Corp. has entered into a 
definitive agreement to buy a 35% stake in a Polish engineering and 
construction firm.Fluor Daniel's investment in the company, Prochem S.A. of 
Warsaw, totals about $3 million, spokeswoman Debra Land said Monday. "This 
allows us to have a local partner in Central Europe, where we are hoping to do 
more work," Land said. "We believe it will be a strong market." The two 
companies will work together to provide engineering and construction services 
to clients in Poland and other Central European countries, Fluor Daniel said.

 AST Research Inc.: The Irvine-based company faces a class-action lawsuit by 
shareholders claiming the computer company misled them about its acquisition of 
Tandy Corp.'s personal computer manufacturing operations last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit was filed Thursday in U.S. Central District Court on behalf of 
shareholders who bought AST stock between Aug. 5, 1993, and March 1, 
1994.Defendants include AST Chairman Safi Qureshey, Chief Financial Officer 
Bruce Edwards and directors Wai Szeto, Richard Ottaviano and James Schraith. 
</P>
<P>
 An AST spokesman declined comment on the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 AST stock soared to a high of $33 after the company acquired the Tandy 
business for $175 million in July. But the stock began to drop March 1 amid 
rumors that AST has plans to cut prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock closed at $24 on the Nasdaq system Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the suit, AST executives misled stockholders by saying the 
acquisition was consistent with the company's objectives when, in fact, it was 
a "high-risk gamble."

 Care Enterprises Inc.: The Tustin nursing home operator said it will incur a 
charge of about $1.1 million, or 8 cents a share, after taxes, in its 1993 
fourth quarter related to the cost of its share appreciation rights plan. In a 
press release, the company said the charge is the result of an increase in the 
market price of its common stock from $4 a share on Sept. 30, 1993, to $9.63 on 
Dec. 31. The company said it expects to release fourth-quarter and year-end 
results later this month.

SOME APARTMENT OWNERS ON SHAKY FINANCIAL GROUND; FACING STEEP QUAKE REPAIRS IN 
ADDITION TO HEFTY MORTGAGE PAYMENTS, SOME LANDLORDS COULD BE THREATENED WITH 
FORECLOSURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Jack and Sally Nissenbaum have spent many sleepless nights since the Jan. 17 
earthquake jolted the San Fernando Valley, worried about the aftershock if 
their lender decides to foreclose on the $1.3-million mortgage on their 50 
apartment units. 
</P>
<P>
 The apartments, located in five buildings on Alabama Avenue, Valerio Street 
and Variel Avenue in Canoga Park, were heavily damaged in the quake, causing 
about three-fourths of the tenants to move. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have very minimal income from the properties, not enough to pay the 
mortgage or the utilities," said Sally Nissenbaum. To make matters worse, the 
properties were assessed at $750,000 shortly before the quake -- or $550,000 
less than what the Nissenbaums owe the lender, Home Savings of America. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Nissenbaum, who has owned the apartments with his wife since 1979, blamed 
the buildings' depreciation on the weak economy of the past years, which forced 
landlords to lower rents and reduced the value of apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, the Nissenbaums received a two-month moratorium from Home Savings 
on their $12,000 monthly mortgage payments. But they also face the difficult 
challenge of repairing the apartments and filling them with tenants again so 
they will not lose the properties. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Home Savings has agreed not to foreclose. But the Nissenbaums will 
have to start paying back the mortgage in a few weeks, before the apartment 
units can be repaired and rented out. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to unpaid utility bills and mortgage payments, the Nissenbaums 
also worry about an estimated $8,700 property tax bill due next month. "I don't 
know what's going to happen. You can drive yourself crazy thinking about 
different possibilities, and some of those possibilities are horrendous," said 
Jack Nissenbaum. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike many homeowners who were given an opportunity by their lenders to delay 
mortgage payments on their damaged homes for a few months, not all small 
apartment owners received similar consideration from their lenders. Some 
apartment owners are being told to continue making mortgage payments on damaged 
and vacant buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Nissenbaums' apartments were tagged habitable by building 
inspectors, they require extensive repairs, including broken windows, separated 
walls, and a collapsed ceiling in at least one unit. The couple will not know 
how much the repairs will cost until they get a damage estimate from their 
insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
 Home Savings, knowing of the problems that can arise whenever a property is 
worth less than what is owed on it, gave the Nissenbaums a moratorium on the 
mortgage payments until April 1. The couple, who have earthquake insurance, 
hope to receive a settlement from their carrier by the end of March and start 
rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 A few miles away in Reseda, veterinarian Morton La Pittus is not so lucky. He 
owns 28 apartment units in two buildings located on the 6400 block of Shirley 
Avenue, about a mile from the epicenter of January's quake. La Pittus, who also 
owns a home in Rancho Santa Fe in San Diego County, lives in one of the 
apartment units during the week. 
</P>
<P>
 The buildings sustained about $100,000 in damage, La Pittus said, and he asked 
the lender, First Nationwide Bank in San Francisco, for a three-month 
moratorium on the $5,600 monthly mortgage payments so he could use the money 
for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the Nissenbaums, La Pittus had no earthquake insurance, and his lender, 
First Nationwide, did not give him a grace period for paying his mortgage. "I 
wasn't looking for anything free. I asked for a three-month moratorium, but I 
wanted them to tack the three months to the end of the loan," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 La Pittus and the Nissenbaums both requested the mortgage moratoriums after 
seeing Home Savings and First Nationwide's newspaper ads offering deferred 
payments to customers to help them recover from the deadly quake. However, most 
of those programs were intended for residential mortgage holders whose homes 
were damaged or destroyed in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 How much a commercial lender is willing to bend with a borrower may have 
something to do with the type of mortgage they hold. For instance, under 
California law, original mortgage loans are typically non-recourse loans, 
meaning that a lender cannot sue the borrower to make up the difference if a 
repossessed property is worth less than the debt on it. But most refinanced 
mortgages are recourse loans, meaning that if a lender forecloses on a property 
that is worth less than what is owed on the mortgage, the borrower can be sued 
to make up the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The mortgages on both of La Pittus' apartment complexes are recourse loans 
because he refinanced in 1985. He has owned the units since 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, the Nissenbaums are still paying on the original mortgage loans 
on their five apartment complexes. 
</P>
<P>
 La Pittus said he was told by Keith Cousans, First Nationwide vice president 
of commercial loans, that the lender cannot offer a moratorium on a refinanced 
loan. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, La Pittus said First Nationwide threatened to put the properties 
in foreclosure if he stops paying on the $800,000 mortgage loan. If the bank 
repossesses the buildings and is forced to sell them for less than the 
outstanding loan, "they said they'd turn around and sue me for the difference," 
La Pittus said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cousans declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 According to La Pittus, even with the damage to the buildings -- which he said 
suffered mostly cosmetic damage -- the properties are still valued at about 
$1.2 million, more than enough equity to cover the mortgage held by First 
Nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherry Rosen, of the Apartment Assn. of the San Fernando Valley, said that 
generally, "banks are being good about extending loans" made to apartment 
owners. "But the problems are with lenders who sold the (mortgages) to other 
parties, and, in some cases, refinanced loans." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Indermill, of Hallmark Property Management in Van Nuys, agreed that 
"most lenders are being cooperative," but, he said, many lenders are still 
studying landlords' requests for moratoriums on loan payments. Hallmark manages 
45 residential income properties, all apartments, throughout the Valley and 
elsewhere throughout Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are still assessing what's going on and how the repairs are going to be 
paid. We're (Hallmark) the information conduit for the owners, so they can fill 
out the FEMA and SBA applications," said Indermill, referring to loans sought 
from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Small Business 
Administration. "We're doing the legwork for them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Nissenbaums are counting on a settlement from their insurance company to 
pay for the damage to their five buildings. La Pittus, who had no earthquake 
insurance, has applied for an SBA loan to pay for the $100,000 damage to his 
two buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, La Pittus also petitioned Los Angeles County officials to waive 
the $3,456 property tax bill due next month. "I've used the $14,000 extra cash 
I had in the account to pay for some repairs, and I've also used the money that 
was set aside to pay for property taxes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sally Nissenbaum, while thankful for the two-month moratorium extended by Home 
Savings, said getting the extension was a trying experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "They paper you to death. The bank keeps demanding all kinds of documents 
already in their files. I don't know what we're going to do if we don't hear 
from the insurance company before April 1, when we have to start making 
payments again. We're scared to death the bank will call the loan," she said.

FUTURE LOOKING UP FOR BANKS AND S & LS DESPITE A WEAK '93; ECONOMY: MOST OF THE 
REGION'S FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS POSTED LOSSES OR LOWER PROFITS IN 4TH QUARTER. 
BUT THEIR RESTRUCTURING MAY MAKE FOR A BETTER YEAR AHEAD. 
</P>

<P>
 Still burdened by sour real estate loans, most major banks and savings and 
loans headquartered in the San Fernando Valley and Ventura County posted losses 
or lower profits in the fourth quarter, closing the third straight year of 
lackluster performance. But there was one saving grace. 
</P>
<P>
 The local banking industry restructured last year. Under the watchful eye of 
regulators, financial institutions dumped assets by the millions, overhauled 
management and cut employment. Some secured new capital and made acquisitions, 
and all turned back to their core businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, their financial outlook is brighter for 1994. But that picture 
has been clouded somewhat by the recent Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 For the October-December period, six of the area's eight largest institutions, 
as ranked by assets, reported losses or smaller profits compared with a year 
earlier. The biggest losses were at Glendale Federal Bank and Great Western 
Financial Corp. of Chatsworth, two of the nation's largest savings and loans. 
Both blamed their troubles on bad real estate loans. 
</P>
<P>
 A smaller S & L, Citadel Holding, the Glendale-based parent of Fidelity 
Federal Bank, has not released its fourth-quarter results. But Citadel -- which 
remains up for sale -- previously said it expects to show a loss of $37 million 
for the fourth quarter because of large write-offs in its loan portfolio. In 
the fourth quarter of 1992, Citadel had a profit of $6.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 For all of 1993, four of the region's eight institutions had losses and three 
others posted smaller earnings than in 1992. The sole exception was CU Bancorp, 
which staged a stunning turnaround last year. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the Encino-based parent of California United Bank lost $8.1 million, 
and federal regulators were breathing down its neck. But after revamping 
management and selling off non-core assets such as its mortgage-banking 
business, the bank made a profit of $2.1 million in 1993. That included a 
profit of $591,000 in the latest quarter, contrasted to a $5-million loss a 
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 CU Bancorp's assets were down 21% from the end of 1992, to $279.7 million as 
of Dec. 31. But Stephen G. Carpenter, president and chief executive officer, 
said the bank can now focus on its main customers -- medium-size businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a pivotal year for California United Bank," Carpenter said, noting 
that the bank has been freed from a formal operating agreement with regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 But while one local bank was released, another was shackled. Ventura County 
National Bancorp, the Oxnard-based parent of Ventura County National Bank and 
Frontier Bank, last March signed consent agreements with the Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency, regulator of national banks. The agreement was 
amended last month and now includes a Sept. 30 deadline for Ventura County 
National Bank to shore up its capital levels. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest quarter, Ventura County National Bancorp reported a loss of $3.5 
million, compared with a profit of $422,000 a year earlier. The company's total 
loss in 1993 was $12.1 million, versus a profit of $685,000 for 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard S. Cupp has been moving quickly to reorganize the bank since he became 
chief executive officer of Ventura County National Bancorp last July. In a 
recent interview, Cupp said he expects to meet the regulatory requirements by 
fall and return to profitability this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The same goal has been set by Stephen J. Trafton, chief executive of Glendale 
Federal Bank, the nation's fifth-largest S&L. Last September, Trafton 
engineered a $451-million recapitalization of the thrift, saving it from 
government seizure. Glendale Federal, which operates on a fiscal year that ends 
June 30, cut its losses by half to $39.8 million for the quarter ended Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Trafton said the latest quarterly loss was due partly to a sharp decline in 
net interest income. Partly that is due to a high volume of refinancing of 
loans at lower rates, which narrows the lender's net interest margin, or the 
difference between what banks pay on deposits and what they charge on loans. 
</P>
<P>
 While Glendale Federal has dumped a lot of bad loans, Trafton said 
delinquencies in apartment and commercial real estate loans increased in the 
fourth quarter. Trafton said he was concerned the recent quake could result in 
more delinquencies, especially if homeowners walk away from their mortgages. 
Glendale Federal has an estimated $1.5 billion in real estate loans in 
quake-affected areas.

 The Northridge earthquake has already hit American Pacific State Bank, whose 
latest quarterly profit sank 54% to $198,000, from $431,000 a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 In part that drop was the result of heavy reserves to cover losses from 
quake-damaged borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank J. Ures, president and chief executive officer, said he does not expect 
big losses from the earthquake, but he said the increased reserves were a 
precautionary measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the Sherman Oaks-based bank is one of the nation's largest Small 
Business Administration lenders. So it could also see additional volume from 
business owners wanting SBA loans to rebuild.. 
</P>
<P>
 Great Western, the nation's second-largest S & L, said it does not expect a 
"material loss" from the earthquake, although some of the buildings at its 
Chatsworth headquarters sustained severe damage. Great Western lost $18.2 
million in the fourth quarter, compared with a loss of $97.3 million a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest loss resulted from loan-loss provisions of $149 million and a 
restructuring charge of $30 million for expenses to cut employment by 1,000, 
half of which are expected through layoffs. For all of 1993, Great Western made 
a profit of $62 million, but that was down 27% from 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 TransWorld Bancorp, the Sherman Oaks-based parent of TransWorld Bank, posted a 
5% increase in profit for the fourth quarter to $490,000, from $467,000 a year 
earlier. But for all of 1993, its profit declined 27% to $1.4 million, from 
$1.9 million in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura, Levy Bancorp, parent of Bank of A. Levy, continued to struggle 
with its problem loans, posting a loss of $981,000 for the fourth quarter, 
triple the losses of a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest results brought Levy's 1993 losses to $5.7 million, compared with a 
loss of $921,000 in 1992.

DATAMETRICS POSTS LOSS OF $242,000 IN 1ST QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Datametrics Corp., a Chatsworth maker of printers and other computer products, 
said it lost $242,000 in its fiscal first quarter that ended Jan. 30 because of 
problems related to the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Sidney E. Wing, Datametrics' president and chief executive, said the company's 
results suffered because it lost potential sales after the earthquake disrupted 
its operations. 
</P>
<P>
 A year earlier, the company earned $1.19 million, which included a onetime tax 
benefit of $938,000.

HOUSE AND CONDO SALES CONTINUE TO REBOUND IN FEBRUARY DESPITE QUAKE; REAL 
ESTATE: SINGLE-FAMILY HOUSE SALES JUMPED 19% LAST MONTH. BUT SALE PRICES KEEP 
FALLING, AND DROP 10%. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Sales of existing single-family houses and condominiums in the Valley 
continued to rebound in February from last year's slow pace, despite fears that 
the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake would stanch buying activity. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as has been the pattern for the past several months, the year-to-year 
sales gain was accompanied by a continuing slide in prices paid for houses and 
condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 596 houses and condos changed hands in the Valley last month, up 
16% from the 512 residences sold in February, 1993, according to the San 
Fernando Valley Assn. of Realtors. Last month's sales total was 20% below the 
748 units sold in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Single-family house sales jumped 19% last month, to 513 from 432 houses sold 
in February, 1993. But the number of properties sold were down 19% from the 634 
houses sold in January. 
</P>
<P>
 The average price of a single-family house sold in February was $231,600, 10% 
below the $256,500 average price a year before, and down slightly from 
January's average price of $234,200. The median price of a single-family house 
fell 10%, to $180,000 last month from $199,000 in February, 1993. The median 
price means that half the units sold for more than $180,000, and half sold for 
less. February's median price was 3% below the January median price of 
$185,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The realty association said the impact of the earthquake was evident in a 40% 
drop in sales in the region that includes Northridge and Granada Hills, two 
communities hit hard by the quake. Also, it blamed the earthquake for a 25% 
plunge in the number of active listings of homes for sale, to 8,814 in February 
from 11,768 in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "The earthquake-induced drop in inventory isn't enough to halt the slide in 
prices caused by the recession," said Jim Link, the association's executive 
vice president. "If, over time, the inventory fails to grow, it could stabilize 
and eventually turn the tide on prices." 
</P>
<P>
 After months of generally negative numbers, condominium sales showed a 
year-to-year gain in February, rising 4%, to 83 units sold from 80 a year 
earlier. However, February's condo sales plunged 27% from January's total of 
114. 
</P>
<P>
 Condo prices also continued to fall. The average price of a condo sold last 
month was $121,700, a 16% decline from the $144,500 average in February, 1993, 
and 6% lower than the January average price of $129,300. The median condo price 
in February was $119,000, down 7% from $128,000 a year earlier, and 5% below 
January's $125,000 median price.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: SUPERIOR INDUSTRIES GETS $4.3 MILLION IN NEW ORDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Superior Industries International Inc., the Van Nuys-based maker of cast 
aluminum wheels for auto makers, announced two new orders, from Ford and 
Chrysler, with a total value of about $4.3 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chrysler order, which is valued at about $2 million annually, initially 
calls for Superior to produce wheels for a Chrysler car built in Mexico for the 
Mexican market. Superior said this was the first order for the new Chihuahua, 
Mexico, plant that Superior is currently constructing. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior said it has also been awarded a contract to produce a low-pressure 
mini spare wheel for the Ford Escort and Mercury Tracer. Shipments are expected 
to begin in June with annual revenues estimated at $2.3 million.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: HEALTH NET SUED IN BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Health Net of Woodland Hills has been sued by a woman who says the health 
maintenance organization wrongly refused to pay for a bone marrow transplant to 
treat her breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit contends Health Net interfered with the doctor-patient relationship 
by pressuring physicians at UCLA Medical School to withdraw their support for 
the operation.The suit seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Health Net lost a similar case last December when a jury in state court in 
Riverside awarded $89.3 million to the family of Nelene Fox of Riverside, who 
died of breast cancer. Health Net is appealing the award. The latest suit was 
filed last Tuesday in the same court and involves Christine deMeurers, a 
schoolteacher in Murietta. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is managed care at its worst," said Mark O. Hiepler, DeMeurers' lawyer, 
who is based in Oxnard. Health Net lawyer Lyle Swallow denied that the company 
pressured the woman's doctors. An advisory panel of medical experts had 
determined the bone marrow transplant to be an experimental treatment not 
covered by Health Net, Swallow said.

PROPERTY VALUES: 15-YEAR LOANS CAN SAVE INTEREST WHILE BUILDING EQUITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ron Galperin 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robin and Marilyn Caires liked the idea of being forced to save for 
retirement. That's one of the reasons they recently refinanced their Burbank 
home with a 15-year mortgage, said Robin Caires, a 58-year-old computer 
analyst. "We wanted to have more of our mortgage out of the way by the time we 
retire," he said. "We view it as enforced savings." 
</P>
<P>
 Although monthly payments are higher on 15-year loans, the Caires can afford 
to pay off their mortgage in 15 years versus the usual 30 years because they 
borrowed only about $192,000 on their $400,000 home. By doing that, the Caires 
get to pay off their home more quickly, and they also benefit because interest 
rates on 15-year mortgages generally run half a percentage point less than 
longer-term loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the fact that 15-year mortgages are a way to save a great deal of 
money in interest payments, the Caires aren't exactly at the vanguard of a 
major trend. If anything, the uncertain economy has made many borrowers less 
likely to commit themselves to a higher mortgage payment. But, for those left 
with extra money every month, a 15-year loan can mean early freedom from 
mortgage payments. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a fairly simple decision. If you have the income to afford the 15-year 
payment, it's worth it because you save a ton of interest," said Earl Peattie, 
president of Mortgage News Co. in Santa Ana. A $200,000, 30-year loan at 7% 
would cost a borrower $1,361 a month in principal and interest payments. A 
comparable 15-year loan at 6.5% would be $1,742 a month. For borrowers with the 
extra $381 a month, Peattie said, the 15-year loan can make lots of sense. 
</P>
<P>
 Borrowers have another option too, Peattie said. Instead of committing to a 
15-year loan, they can instead get a more typical 30-year loan and just commit 
themselves to accelerating principal payments voluntarily. The advantage is 
that the borrower isn't locked into the higher monthly payment obligation. 
</P>
<P>
 There are some drawbacks, however, Peattie said. First, the 30-year borrower 
won't be able to get as low an interest rate as the 15-year borrower. And, when 
borrowers voluntarily add to their monthly payment, the lender doesn't always 
properly account for the additional funds. "The computer software most lenders 
are using is not always as accurate as you'd like it to be, so you need to keep 
track of the extra payments yourself in order to audit the lender's 
calculations," Peattie said. "You must also save every bill and every check 
that you write. It's critical if you need to go back and audit the loan." 
</P>
<P>
 New Freedom Financial Inc. in Simi Valley offers 15-year mortgages, and what 
it calls an equity builder loan, where a borrower may voluntarily make 
additional principal payments each month to accelerate the mortgage. "People 
don't want to lock themselves into a higher payment for 15 years," said William 
J. Tessar, president of New Freedom Financial. That's made his voluntary equity 
builder more popular, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 What many borrowers don't realize, Tessar said, is that when they write a 
bigger than usual check to their lender, the money may not be eliminating any 
future payments or advancing the loan's amortization schedule. Many lenders 
simply put the extra money into an escrow account, a so-called unapplied 
account or a reserve account, usually bearing no interest at all. 
</P>
<P>
 When making an extra payment on a 30-year loan, for example, Tessar said it's 
essential for the borrower to send a notice to the lender explaining exactly 
how the extra payment is to be applied to the mortgage. New Freedom Financial 
provides borrowers with just such a form, Tessar said, but the borrower is 
required to make an exact payment of each extra month's principal. This, Tessar 
said, helps avoid future accounting nightmares. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people don't have the luxury of considering 15-year loans," said John 
Lucas, vice president and branch manager at ARCS Mortgage Inc. in Van Nuys. "It 
comes down to whether the borrower is comfortable with the higher payment." The 
savings can be startling. With the same $200,000 loan example above, a borrower 
in the first year of a loan will pay off about $2,000 in principal on the 
30-year loan versus about $8,000 on the 15-year equivalent. 
</P>
<P>
 While many borrowers will refinance, or not stay in the homes for the full 
term of any loan, the accelerated payments of a 15-year loan are a good way to 
build equity. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are some very legitimate reasons for not choosing a 15-year loan. 
Interest rates remain close to a 20-year low and many borrowers want to lock 
into the longest possible fixed-rate loan. Also, 15-year loans are generally 
not available with an adjustable interest rate. Most people who opt for an 
adjustable rate want to start with low payments, so a 15-year adjustable would 
be something of a contradiction. Finally, there are many borrowers who want 
higher mortgage interest payments, because all the interest is tax-deductible. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most financial planners and CPAs don't recommend 15-year loans because 
there's less of a tax write-off and because most people prefer investing their 
discretionary income in something other than their mortgage," said Suzanne 
Shirley, district sales manager for California Federal Bank in Reseda. That 
helps explain why more than 85% of borrowers opt for the usual 30-year loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Most 15-year borrowers are in their 40s or 50s and they are secure in their 
careers, Shirley said. These days, she said, not too many people are feeling 
very secure. "In this economy, folks are looking for more immediate ways to 
maximize their discretionary income," she said.

DEEP POCKETS; WEYERHAEUSER HELPS PARDEE CONSTRUCTION CO. KEEP BUILDING IN TOUGH 
TIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SEARLES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you're a resident of Reseda, Van Nuys or even Ventura, the name Pardee may 
not ring a loud bell. But if you live in Mission Oaks, a sprawling, 
master-planned community in Ventura County that constitutes most of the east 
side of Camarillo, you're in Pardee country for sure. 
</P>
<P>
 Pardee Construction Co.'s land is next to the Santa Monica Mountains at the 
bottom, or northern end, of the steep Conejo Grade of the Ventura Freeway. To 
get into the community you'll probably use the Pleasant Valley Road-Santa Rosa 
Road exit, part of a freeway-access complex completed last year at a cost of 
$7.2 million. The project was paid for entirely by Pardee. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our proposals were being held up because people were afraid they'd create 
traffic problems," explains Bill Teller, Pardee's Ventura County project 
manager. "We could have waited for state funding, but that might have taken 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when many developers are holding back, Pardee is throttling ahead 
with residential, office and various commercial developments. The fact that 
Pardee bought more than 1,000 acres in Camarillo in 1969 at low prices helps it 
weather the ups and downs of the building cycles. That, and the fact Pardee is 
a unit of Weyerhaeuser Co., the $9-billion, giant lumber concern that helps 
finance Pardee's projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Expanding Operation 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1975, Pardee has built all 3,000 homes in the handsome, mostly 
earth-toned Mission Oaks community. In fact, Pardee is the biggest home builder 
in Ventura County. Now the company is also developing a large industrial park 
adjoining the Ventura Freeway and has built several retail and commercial 
centers in the area. To date, practically every structure in Mission Oaks 
(population about 8,500, or nearly one-sixth of Camarillo) was either built, 
designed or financed by Pardee, which in 1990 added another 300 acres to 1,150 
acres it acquired originally. 
</P>
<P>
 Local real estate people believe Pardee bought its larger holding on the 
largely undeveloped Camarillo Ranch at about $2,000 an acre, less than a third 
of what it would be worth today. This gives Pardee a pricing advantage in the 
marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're expected to show a profit, but we can be more flexible than most other 
builders about that," notes Teller. "Since we don't have the cash-flow problems 
others may have, we can afford to take a longer view of things." 
</P>
<P>
 Pardee has yet another built-in advantage. A sister concern, Weyerhaeuser 
Mortgage Co., provides the mortgages for about one-third of Pardee's home 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Teller and his 60 employees are busy, with more than 150 Pardee units either 
under construction or planned in the near future. While other builders are 
still taking their lumps, Pardee's Ventura County operation is adapting by 
watching its inventories closely and concentrating on the lower end of the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 "Business was very soft right after the earthquake," Teller says. "There was 
something psychological about it. But then it picked up and we sold 10 houses 
in a single week. I'd say we're getting our fair share of the market." 
</P>
<P>
 Teller, 47, a pleasant, quiet-spoken executive, is seated in a conference room 
in Pardee Center, a three-story office building in Pardee Plaza, and shows a 
visitor the firm's latest housing sales brochures. 
</P>
<P>
 Pardee now owns 425 acres in Mission Oaks, the rest having been contributed to 
the infrastructure or sold off to home buyers and others. The firm plans to 
build 1,900 more homes and an assortment of industrial buildings on the 
remaining land. "I expect us to be built out in about 10 years," Teller says. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the market would support a faster pace, it wouldn't be permitted. A 
city-imposed ceiling limits residential construction permits in Camarillo to a 
total of 400 annually, with no single builder allowed more than 240 units. 
</P>
<P>
 Pardee, by far the city's largest home builder, got 233 allotments this year, 
but probably won't use them all because of Ventura County's slow economy. For 
several years, the firm has been building fewer units than it's been allotted 
by city planners, holding onto some allotments for use when the housing market 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Weyerhaeuser Ties 
</P>
<P>
 Pardee's Camarillo housing developments range from tracts where a paired unit 
(half a duplex, with a private yard) can be purchased for as little as 
$174,000, to houses as large as 2,700 square feet that can cost in the low 
$300,000s. 
</P>
<P>
 Teller says the lower-priced end of the market is going well, that at one 
development there were 14 sales made on the tract's first weekend. At the 
higher-priced market, however, "it's been kind of slow. The upper market hasn't 
been on fire." 
</P>
<P>
 Houses in the Camarillo development are "beyond the grade," that is at the 
base of the steep Conejo Grade portion of the Ventura Freeway, and so are 
thousands of dollars less expensive than those closer to Los Angeles and the 
San Fernando Valley, according to Teller. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost all Pardee sales literature emphasizes the company's ties to 
Weyerhaeuser, but Teller often builds his houses with non-Weyerhaeuser lumber. 
"We go for the best price. The company has a guy in L. A. who buys it by the 
trainload. If he can get a better deal from another supplier, he goes for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Other Ventura County builders say they know little of how Pardee operates. "I 
don't know anything about their inner organization and I've never bought one of 
their houses. But I know they've been very successful with a variety of 
projects," says Russ Goodman, regional president of the Sares Regis Group, a 
large commercial and industrial developer. 
</P>
<P>
 Pardee's Ventura County unit is one of several operations that report to 
Pardee Construction Co., headquartered in Westwood. In a classic corporate 
chain of command, Pardee Construction is a subsidiary of Weyerhaeuser Real 
Estate Co., which in turn is a subsidiary of Weyerhaeuser Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County operation, which also has housing developments in Oxnard 
and Agoura, is one of several major Pardee Construction units. The others are 
in San Diego and Las Vegas. A fourth unit is building houses in Valencia and 
Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 In The Times' 1993 survey of Southern California home builders, Pardee's sales 
for last year were projected at $250 million, which ranked ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Teller, nor other company officials, will divulge Pardee's financial 
figures, but the builder appears to be selling about 200 homes a year in 
Ventura County. At an average price of $225,000, that would amount to annual 
sales of about $45 million, not including additional revenue from rents and the 
sale of non-residential property. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pardee influence seems to be everywhere as one heads into the gently 
rolling countryside of the Mission Oaks development in Camarillo. There is a 
Jack-in-the-Box, a McDonald's and a Marriott hotel in one center, called Pardee 
Plaza. Pardee sold Marriott the land on which the hotel stands, but Pardee 
retained ownership of most land in the plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the street, in another Pardee center, is a Bank of A. Levy branch. In a 
Pardee business complex nearby, there are major employers such as Unisys, GTE 
California and the headquarters of Adminstrative Services Center for the 
Ventura County Superintendent of Schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Controversial Complex 
</P>
<P>
 Like practically everything else in Mission Oaks, the 15 or so buildings that 
have gone up so far in the business complex are well-maintained. They're also 
graffiti-free, thanks to a Pardee policy of steaming off or painting over such 
signs of urban blight as soon as they're reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon to go up is a $7-million, 11-screen movie complex. Residents of a Pardee 
housing tract have protested that the United Artists multiplex, which the 
theater chain expects to build in partnership with Pardee, will bring crime, 
noise and traffic problems to the area. Despite the opposition, the 
controversial project has received city approval. Some residents, however, have 
threatened to go to court in a final effort to block the theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's their right," Teller says. "Honestly, though, I don't see why those 
people are so upset." He notes that there is an apartment building between the 
theater site and the housing development. "The theater will be at least 450 
feet from the nearest homes." The apartment complex is also owned by Pardee. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the attention that its theater project has received recently, Pardee 
is primarily a home builder. About 90% of the land in the Mission Oaks master 
plan has been set aside for residential development. 
</P>
<P>
 Uphill on a pleasantly winding road into the residential center of the 
community, behind Pardee-built walls, you catch glimpses of the thousands of 
houses and condominiums that the firm has built in the last two decades. Close 
to the freeway, the houses all have early-California style tile roofs. That's 
mandated by an ordinance honoring the area's link to the Adolfo Camarillo 
family, which once owned the land on which the city of Camarillo was developed. 
</P>
<P>
 Who lives in these tracts? 
</P>
<P>
 "Our buyers tend to be young, between 30 and 35," Teller says. "They have 
established families with lots of kids. Mostly, they work for local employers. 
Only 15% of our buyers commute to the (San Fernando) Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 Resales of Pardee-built homes suffered along with the rest of the Southern 
California market in the last few years, but the market here has started to 
stabilize, real estate agents report. "I've been quite busy for the past 
several months," says Teresa Toomey, a broker with Coldwell Banker Town & 
Country. She has specialized in Mission Oaks houses for the past 10 years. 
Toomey says prospective buyers often ask whether a house is Pardee-built. "If 
they're from outside the area, they're also impressed with the open feeling 
they get here." 
</P>
<P>
 Teller joined Pardee in 1989, having previously been in the land development 
business in the Denver area. His official title, assistant vice president, is 
hardly imposing, but he's in charge of a large, mostly independent real estate 
enterprise. "Once we decide on our annual goals, I'm left pretty much to 
myself," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Teller still spends most of his time working on his various housing projects, 
but lately he's been pushing his staff to complete 16 small industrial 
buildings in Pardee's business park. "We've been getting calls about those 
buildings ever since the earthquake. I don't think we'll have much trouble 
selling them."

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: SURVEY SHOWS SOFTER COUNTY JOB MARKET FOR 2ND QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Searles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County's job market will be softer in the second quarter than it was 
in the first, according to a survey of the county's major employers by Manpower 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 The quarterly study says 17% of the county's larger companies are planning to 
increase their payrolls this spring, but that an even larger number -- 27% -- 
plan layoffs.Of the remainder, 46% expect no change and 10% are undecided. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey was mostly conducted before the earthquake, a Manpower spokesman 
said. But most employers who were re-surveyed after the quake said their plans 
had not changed, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Hank Hinse, the temporary help firm's spokesman, said numerous people have 
been hired to repair quake damage in Ventura and Los Angeles counties, but that 
many of the jobs are expected to be "very temporary in nature." 
</P>
<P>
 The latest outlook is somewhat darker than three months ago, when 13% of 
Ventura County employers said they expected to increase their hiring in the 
first quarter while an equal percentage predicted layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, fully 50% of those questioned were bullish and only 7% expected 
reduced work forces.

Sacramento Municipal Utility District. 
</P>
<P>
 The district is seeking clean, renewable power sources that will minimize the 
so-called greenhouse effect. 
</P>
<P>
 The project uses Siemens M55 solar panels that generate a total of 400 
kilowatts of electricity. Each home in the project is equipped with solar 
panels that will generate power throughout the grid. 
</P>
<P>
 Siemens, the world's largest supplier of solar products, hopes to install 
similar systems worldwide.

WOMEN WRITERS: AN ANTHOLOGY OF THEIR OWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH GETLIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Elinor Nauen strikes a blow this season for literary and gender equality in 
the national pastime. While men continue to dominate baseball writing, women 
authors have also taken a swing at it. Their finest efforts are collected in 
"Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend" (Faber and Faber). 
</P>
<P>
 Nauen believes it's long overdue. Most women don't agonize over the 
realization that they'll never play shortstop for the Dodgers, she says, and 
this frees them to write more purely about the game. Instead of fighting 
personal baseball demons, they're open to real literary insight. 
</P>
<P>
 Her anthology draws on well-known writers ranging from Doris Kearns Goodwin, 
Annie Dillard, Barbara Grizzuti Harrison, Anna Quindlen and Bette Bao Lord to 
poet Marianne Moore. Their entries touch on the game's psychological links 
between generations, the impact of Jackie Robinson, baseball's first African 
American player, and they also include profiles of legendary characters such as 
former Dodgers' broadcaster Red Barber. 
</P>
<P>
 The real discoveries, however, come from lesser-known writers such as social 
psychologist Carol Tavris: "To evaluate baseball on the strength of one or two 
games is like deciding about sex on the basis of one act of love-making. The 
first time doesn't tell you anything. Now eventually you may decide you love 
baseball or hate it, just as you may love sex or hate it, but it takes 
experience to make a smart decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Mary Cecile Leary observes: "Baseball is where boys practice being 
boys and men practice being boys, and they get real good at it." In "Dodger 
Stadium," Eve Babitz dwells on the intersection of sex, machismo and mythology 
at a Los Angeles game. And in "No Particular Place to Go," Linda Gebroe exults 
in the quiet peace of Candlestick Park after a Giants contest. 
</P>
<P>
 Nauen, a writer and poet who lives in New York City, says her women's 
anthology reveals a different perspective -- a sense that there's more to the 
old ballgame than runs, hits and life errors: 
</P>
<P>
 "Women are not told what to look for in a ballgame, so they learn to look for 
themselves," she say. "Baseball lets people be more sentimental than other 
kinds of writing, but while men draw the line, women don't have to. They can 
get the pure hit of a feeling. It's a mixture of fantasy and reality." JOSH

MOST SAY IN THE FIELD OF DREAMS, READERS AND WRITERS CAN FIND TRUTHS ABOUT THE 
WAY WE LIVE.

 It had been a punishing winter, and as he walked with his 5-year-old son 
through a muddy field, Bill Meissner considered it an omen when they spotted an 
old baseball, its cover rotting from snow and rain. 
</P>
<P>
 They had found balls before, but this one seemed different: Dark, gummy yarn 
burst out of the wrinkled horsehide, inviting a closer look. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could unroll this string and find out what's inside," said Meissner's son, 
Nathan, tossing the first ball of spring into the air. "Can I try it?" 
</P>
<P>
 The boy put it on the ground and ran ahead, tugging the unwinding string like 
a kite over his shoulder. Suddenly, it snapped and Meissner tried to tell him. 
But the wind muffled his voice and all the father could do was watch his son 
disappear -- the broken string and an unanswered question trailing behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love baseball and this is one real-life story that didn't need editing," 
says Meissner, the Minnesota author of "Hitting Into the Wind," a new 
collection of short stories about the national pastime. "There was a sense of 
mystery, knowledge and loss all wrapped up into this one incident. And that's 
what American baseball writing does when it succeeds -- it can take you beyond 
the game into much larger questions." 
</P>
<P>
 The answers may be elusive, but baseball poses more questions than any other 
sport. Each year, scores of new baseball-related titles flood the market -- 
more than football, basketball, golf and hockey books combined. Although there 
are no exact figures showing how well these titles sell from one season to the 
next, that publishers keep producing them is significant. 
</P>
<P>
 They come in all varieties, from fiction and "tell-all" accounts by 
superstars, to essays by writers like Roger Angell, Thomas Boswell and Jim 
Murray. In recent years, encyclopedias and statistical compilations have become 
hugely popular, as have examinations of lesser-known subjects like the history 
of the Negro Leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have more baseball books because the game itself is so conducive to 
thought and creative reflection," says Steve Lehman, publisher of Elysian 
Fields Quarterly, a premier national baseball magazine. "Baseball is more 
leisurely, and it almost encourages the telling of great stories, which is what 
literature has always been about. The game is filled with real life, so that 
attracts writers as well as readers." 
</P>

 Baseball, writing and life. That's the top of the order in your local 
bookstore this season, and a perfect cure for winter blahs. If you've got the 
shakes in Los Angeles or the shivers back East, some newer books will remind 
you what's really important. 
</P>
<P>
 Human psychology, for instance. You don't know depression until you read 
"Chasing the Pennant" by David Plaut (Diamond Communications), a history of the 
1962 race in which the Los Angeles Dodgers lost the National League flag to the 
San Francisco Giants on the last day of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking for a revelation? Check out "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend," 
edited by Elinor Nauen, (Faber and Faber) the first anthology of baseball 
writing by women. (See accompanying story.) 
</P>
<P>
 For cynics who think none of this impacts the real world, grab a copy of 
"Hardball" by Daniel Coyle (Putnam), the story of a Little League team from 
Chicago's Cabrini Green housing project.  
</P>
<P>
 "We've got an interesting mix of baseball books this spring," says Debra 
Powell, general manager of Sports Books in Los Angeles, the nation's largest 
all-sports bookstore. "I'm not just talking about books by superstars that will 
get lots of attention. We've got some real gems out there this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Powell has her eye on several new titles, such as "The Catcher Was a Spy" by 
Nicholas Dawidoff (Pantheon), the latest biography of fabled catcher Moe Berg, 
who was also a U.S. counterintelligence agent. Booksellers are also touting 
Bill James' "The Politics of Glory" (Macmillan), a probing look at the Hall of 
Fame selection process. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, picking winners in the baseball book market is like evaluating rookies 
in spring training. Although early promise is great, veterans are a much better 
bet to make the best-selling team. Especially if they're named Mickey Mantle -- 
his autobiography "All My Octobers" is due from HarperCollins -- or Tom Seaver, 
whose "The Art of Pitching," has just been published by Morrow. 
</P>
<P>
 Publishers will be sending these and other big-ticket authors on national 
publicity tours, hoping to strike it rich with baseball fans. Yet, the real 
literary stars of 1994 won't be pulling down millions in contracts and 
royalties. They're unknown and they're itching for a chance at the big time. 
You'd be wise to give them a shot . . . like any other hot prospect. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Take Meissner. He doesn't just write baseball, he lives the damn game, playing 
with a bunch of guys in Minnesota called The Dead Ball Players Society. Pushing 
45 and risking a bad back, Meissner pays the bills with a day job teaching 
creative writing at St. Cloud State University. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hitting Into the Wind" (Random House) is his first collection of short 
stories, and Meissner says he began collecting ideas for a baseball book 
several years ago. Some stories sprang from experience, like "The Unwinding," 
the story of his son and the mysterious insides of a baseball. Others are more 
conventional fiction, like "Lights: Joe and Marilyn, an American Love Story," 
about Joe DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe. 
</P>
<P>
 Meissner's decision to write about baseball followed his painful admission 
that he would never be good enough to play in the major leagues -- a discovery 
made by millions of other Americans in their teens or early 20s. 
</P>
<P>
 "I reached a stopping point when I realized that, because it was a clear 
difference between my reality and my dreams," he says. "But then I came back to 
baseball in my 30s, after the Vietnam War. And when I came back, I came back 
full force. For me, baseball brings back the excitement of childhood and 
boyhood . . . and it was easy to connect that with writing." 
</P>
<P>
 His short stories blend the ironic edge of Raymond Carver and the poetic 
rhythms of Richard Hugo, using baseball as a touch point for life experiences: 
the frustrations of youth, faltering marriages, aging. And the crushing 
recognition that one's life will be ordinary, not star-crossed. Meissner also 
celebrates his boy's awakening love for baseball, and the rich spiritual bonds 
it can forge between generations. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing you won't see in my book is Rocky hitting a home run with two outs 
in the ninth inning to win the game," he says. "It deals more with subtle 
changes in people's lives. Real people. Men and women. And sometimes those 
truths can hit you right between the eyes." 
</P>

 Like its name, Daniel Coyle's "Hardball" rockets in high and tight. It's an 
unforgettable glimpse of American inner-city life and makes a case for baseball 
as the great racial equalizer. 
</P>
<P>
 Coyle, an editor at the Chicago-based Outside Magazine, was among a handful of 
young white professionals who agreed in 1991 to help coach a baseball team of 
9- to 12-year-old kids from the tough Cabrini Green housing project. At the 
time, the Near North Little League/African-American Youth League was the only 
group of its kind based in an American housing project. 
</P>
<P>
 The growing pains were severe: Black coaches connected with the Kikuyus, named 
after an African tribe, were openly skeptical that the white coaches would lose 
interest and drift away. The young players were wary of Coyle and others, 
wondering why they had gotten involved. 
</P>
<P>
 At times, the violence that engulfs Cabrini Green hit home with a vengeance. 
Coyle remembers once fleeing gunfire dozens of yards away, and the book is 
filled with tragedies that kids in the projects see every day. Toward the end 
of "Hardball," for example, the chronic absence of one player is finally 
explained: He had to be with a father dying of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, the ragtag team winds up in the championship game by the end of the 
book, and Coyle's narrative ends on an upbeat note: The league will continue to 
grow. This season, he and other sponsors have arranged for the Kikuyus to train 
in the Michigan countryside. Coyle can hardly wait. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the beginning, you had coaches from one end of society and then these kids 
from the other end of society," he says. "They had to relate across this chasm, 
and they managed to do it, because they had baseball in common. 
</P>
<P>
 "So ultimately, this was a book that used baseball to look at America's social 
problems. I used a quote in the book which sums it up, for better or worse. 
It's by Jacques Barzun, the writer, and he said: 'Whoever wants to know the 
heart and mind of America had better learn baseball.' " 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 They could also check out the Dodgers-Giants rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
 On the last day of the 1993 season, the Los Angeles Dodgers trounced the San 
Francisco Giants, killing their pennant hopes. In the locker room after the 
game, LA manager Tommy Lasorda was raving about payback . . . and the past. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1951, he told listeners, the New York Giants stunned the Brooklyn Dodgers 
by stealing the pennant from them on the last day of the season. In 1982, the 
Giants' Joe Morgan hit an epic home run and knocked the Dodgers out of the 
race. In 1991, the Giants, in a season-ending series, again dashed the Dodgers' 
chances of winning the flag. 
</P>
<P>
 But the worst insult was 1962. In a bitter race, Los Angeles led San Francisco 
by four games with only seven to go till the end of the season. Suddenly, the 
Dodgers ran out of gas and ended up in a tie with their hated rivals. They lost 
the deciding playoff game after leading the Giants 4-2 at Dodger Stadium in the 
top of the ninth. There was no joy in smogville. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're a Dodger fan, it's a memory to forget. But that's going to be tough 
with the publication of David Plaut's "Chasing October: The Dodgers-Giants 
Pennant Race of 1962." For Los Angeles die-hards, reading Plaut's vivid history 
is the literary equivalent of drinking hemlock. 
</P>
<P>
 It's all there in gory detail: The doomed Dodger team with stars like Sandy 
Koufax, Don Drysdale, Maury Wills and Tommy Davis. The murderous San Francisco 
offense, led by Willie Mays, Orlando Cepeda, Felipe Alou and Willie McCovey. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Plaut has written more than a conventional baseball recap. He's tried to 
capture the times, showing how America was enjoying its last pennant race in a 
bubble of innocence, one year before the murder of John F. Kennedy. In Los 
Angeles, Hollywood celebrities descended on Dodger Stadium and more team 
members made TV appearances than in any other season. It was the year of Danny 
Kaye's immortal "Dodgers Song" and the beginning of Koufax-mania. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Bay Area writers tormented Angelenos with glee. The San Francisco 
Chronicle's Art Rosenbaum referred to LA as "The Smodgers" and derided La-La 
Land as "a city whose women would attend the opera in leopard shirts and 
toreador pants, if indeed they attended the opera at all." 
</P>
<P>
 This acrimony has endured, but Los Angeles and San Francisco fans worked 
themselves into a lather over the 1962 contest that has never been equaled, 
Plaut contends. There have been other historic baseball rivalries -- such as 
New York and Boston -- but none quite compare for vitriol. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can talk all you want about Brooklyn and New York, Minneapolis and St. 
Paul, Dallas and Fort Worth," says Hall-of-Famer Joe Cronin, in Plaut's book. 
"But there are no two cities in America where the people want to beat each 
other's brains out more than San Francisco and Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Plaut, who reviews books for USA Today's Baseball Weekly, says the remarkable 
1962 race reminds us decades later how baseball can stir our deepest passions. 
Win or lose, these feelings linger long after the season ends. 
</P>
<P>
 "For those who were there, 1962 was a race you never forget," Plaut says. "So 
hopefully, this book will stick with you. Like baseball itself."

WOMEN CAUGHT IN MIDDLE OF BREAST-IMPLANT DEBATE; HEALTH: RESEARCH INDICATING 
THAT THE SILICONE-GEL DEVICES ARE MOSTLY SAFE COMES OUT AT SAME TIME AS A 
TENTATIVE SETTLEMENT FOR THOSE WHO SAY THEY WERE HARMED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARI ROAN, TIMES HEALTH WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While lawyers were busy over the past year hammering out a billion-dollar 
legal settlement for women with health problems possibly due to silicone-gel 
breast implants, doctors were gathering evidence indicating the implants may be 
safe for most women.  
</P>
<P>
 Left in the gap between the two warring professions are women who have, or 
want to get, the implants but are unsure whom to believe. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement comes at a time when most doctors are vehement that the 
implants are generally safe. In the past year, more than a dozen studies have 
appeared, seeming to absolve the implants of the most serious charge: silicone 
leaching from the implant can migrate throughout a woman's body and cause a 
wide range of autoimmune disorders, such as lupus, scleroderma or rheumatoid 
arthritis. 
</P>
<P>
 In the studies, comparing women with implants to similar-age women without 
implants, the rate of autoimmune illnesses was equal. 
</P>
<P>
 The evidence is impressive because it was gathered from large independent 
studies, says Dr. Jack C. Fisher, president of the California Society of 
Plastic Surgeons. 
</P>
<P>
 And in a heavy-handed statement published in December, leaders of the American 
Medical Assn. said the group strongly supports continued use of the implants. 
</P>
<P>
 The public anxiety over the safety of the implants "is not warranted based on 
current scientific evidence," wrote the AMA's Council on Scientific Affairs in 
the Journal of the American Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 But others contend that the recent tentative agreement on a nationwide 
class-action lawsuit -- which creates a $4.75-billion fund to compensate 
thousands of women who claim they were harmed by the implants -- gives the 
impression that the manufacturers are admitting liability. Manufacturers say 
the settlement is not an admission of guilt but simply puts a divisive issue to 
rest. 
</P>
<P>
 "A woman would have to be a fool to get silicone breast implants knowing that 
the manufacturers have agreed to put together this pot of money to pay sick 
women," says Marie Walsh of the Breast Implant Information Foundation, Laguna 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 While the most recent scientific studies indicate that the implants are safe 
for most women, the settlement may carry a stronger message -- "a message of 
guilt to the public," says Fisher. "The average person will conclude that 
silicone is bad for your health." 
</P>
<P>
 The mixed bag of news has left confused a great many of the 1 million to 2 
million U.S. women with the implants, which were removed from the market except 
as part of clinical studies in a 1992 moratorium issued by the Food and Drug 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Breast-cancer survivors who desire breast reconstruction are typically baffled 
by the issue, says Sharon Green, executive director of the national nonprofit 
breast cancer support group Y-ME. 
</P>
<P>
 "We originally took a stance to keep them on the market," Green says. "We felt 
there were problems, but we felt each individual had to determine what their 
risks were. But these studies, both international and national, are coming in 
and they are not showing definite (problems). Now that there is a settlement on 
the table what does that mean? I don't know what to tell anyone anymore." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Silicone-gel breast implants have been implicated in several problems, 
including breakage, painful hardening of the breast and -- the most grave 
charge -- causing a range of autoimmune disorders. 
</P>
<P>
 While manufacturers acknowledge the problems of hardening and rupture, the 
link to autoimmune diseases is unproven, although hundreds of women with the 
implants now claim to have developed one or more of the disorders. But the new 
studies tend to refute any link. 
</P>
<P>
 A Mayo Clinic study found no higher incidence of the disorders among 824 women 
with silicone implants compared to 1,634 women who did not have implants. 
</P>
<P>
 In another study at Houston's M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, the incidence of 
autoimmune disease among 250 breast cancer patients who received implants was 
compared with 353 cancer patients who had breast reconstruction using their own 
tissue. There was no difference in disease rates between the two groups. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in another strong study, a range of laboratory tests, such as blood 
tests, were performed on 200 women with implants and 100 women of the same age 
who did not have implants. University of Toronto researchers concluded that 
there was no evidence that silicone-gel implants were related to autoimmune 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The studies have been trumpeted by implant manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a growing body of valid scientific evidence that shows no link 
between implants and connective tissue or autoimmune disease," says Dr. Ralph 
Cook, Dow Corning's director of epidemiology. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook notes that none of these studies was funded by Dow Corning, the largest 
implant manufacturer. But Walsh isn't convinced because the studies haven't 
been conducted over a long enough time period. 
</P>
<P>
 Autoimmune disease may not develop until many years after a woman has received 
implants, Walsh says. But Fisher, of the California Society of Plastic 
Surgeons, notes that the epidemiological studies will continue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The very best epidemiological inquiry is the Mayo study. It shows absolutely 
no difference. But it has to be followed for awhile. It's going to take a lot 
more time -- 10 or 15 years," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Studies showing no evidence of autoimmune disorders may have come too late to 
save silicone implants from the medical devices graveyard. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuits and the FDA's moratorium on implants, for example, were motivated 
as much by the other problems, such as breakage and hardening, as by the 
possible link to autoimmune disease, says Jeffrey Steinberger, a Beverly Hills 
attorney representing 2,300 women with implants. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone has had seven surgeries, who cares if (the link to autoimmune 
disease) has been proven?" he says. "Autoimmune disease isn't the whole issue. 
There are a myriad of other problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, some observers suggest that women will never have all the answers 
regarding safety. 
</P>
<P>
 When the FDA announced its moratorium, the agency said it would allow women to 
get the implants as part of studies to prove safety. But, it was left up to 
manufacturers to undertake the studies and submit data to the FDA. 
</P>
<P>
 "The FDA's decision was to allow the manufacturers to do the studies to prove 
their safety and effectiveness -- as long as there are manufacturers that want 
to do that," says FDA spokeswoman Susan Cruzan. 
</P>
<P>
 Silicone-gel implants are now manufactured by only one company, Mentor Corp. 
of Santa Barbara, which has agreed to stop making the implants as of April, 
1995, as part of its own legal settlement. Mentor's implants are only available 
to mastectomy patients as part of the safety studies. Company officials said 
that enough women will have received the implants by next year's deadline in 
order to produce a valid study. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, saline-filled implants are still available to women for 
breast augmentation and reconstruction after mastectomy. And, researchers are 
actively testing peanut-oil-filled implants as a possible safe alternative.  
</P>
<P>
 But while silicone-gel implants may slink out of existence with little 
fanfare, safety studies will continue to be of great interest to women with 
implants, particularly those who are having no problems but wonder whether they 
should have the implants removed to prevent trouble from developing. 
</P>
<P>
 Each new report of a potential problem sends shivers through many women. In 
one of the most alarming studies yet regarding implants, researchers from 
Schneider Children's Hospital in New Hyde Park, N.Y., suggested that women with 
silicone-gel implants who breast feed may pass autoimmune problems to their 
offspring. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversial paper, published in January in the Journal of the American 
Medical Assn., examined 11 children born to women with silicone breast 
implants. Of the eight who were breast fed, six developed a rare disorder in 
the lower esophagus that usually only arises from scleroderma, an illness that 
some women with implants have reported to suffer. 
</P>
<P>
 While there have been numerous anecdotal reports of children of women with 
implants also having autoimmune disorders, the study was blasted by many 
doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important question it raises is why the editorial board of that 
journal would publish a study about 11 children," says Fisher. "We don't know 
if there was any silicone in the breast milk itself. At least you have to start 
out with evidence that the children were exposed to silicone." Breast Implants:

FITNESS / KATHLEEN DOHENY: PERSONAL HEALTH; UNDERGO PHYSICAL THERAPY BEFORE 
INJURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Sports stars discovered it first: The more you use physical therapy as 
preventive maintenance, the less time you'll rack up in rehab. 
</P>
<P>
 This new approach to physical therapy has such a common-sense premise -- 
identify weak muscles and build them up before they rip or strain -- that 
everyone wonders what took so long. 
</P>
<P>
 Preventive physical therapy is gaining favor with professional and amateur 
athletes as well as adults who switch or start exercise routines. The cost of 
an evaluation to pinpoint weaknesses can be a good investment in reducing 
injury and downtime, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Mix: By far, repair and rehabilitation still occupy most of a physical 
therapist's day, says Robert Forster, a physical therapist in Santa Monica who 
specializes in sports and spinal care and treats many well-known athletes. 
About 20% of his practice is geared toward prevention, the other 80% toward 
more traditional physical therapy. "But preventive PT was nonexistent 10 or 15 
years ago," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Athlete Screen: Growing numbers of sports teams are sending high school 
athletes for preseason physical-therapy exams, says Michael G. Fortanasce, a 
physical therapist and director of Fortanasce & Associates Physical 
Therapy/Sports Medicine Center in Arcadia, which provides mass screenings for 
high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The exam is brief but telling. Within about 30 minutes, a physical therapist 
evaluates the shoulders, spine, hips, knees and ankles. "We are looking for a 
lack of flexibility, a lack of joint movement or too much movement," Fortanasce 
says. "We're looking also for muscle strength." 
</P>
<P>
 The main problems found are muscle weakness and lack of joint mobility. The 
latter usually stems from prior injury, but could be the result of insufficient 
flexibility, he says. Adolescent boys, in particular, have tight hamstring 
muscles, and can reduce injury risk simply by stretching them regularly. 
</P>
<P>
 At the conclusion, recommendations are given to the school's athletic trainer, 
who takes over from there. For instance, an athlete with a knee-tracking 
problem would be given specific instructions on increasing quadriceps muscle 
strength, which is crucial to proper knee extension. 
</P>
<P>
 "About one-third of athletes get through without problems," Fortanasce says, 
"while two-thirds show minor to major weaknesses or injuries." 
</P>
<P>
 Even athletes without obvious problems can target certain muscles for 
strengthening to minimize injury risk. A baseball player, for instance, should 
concentrate on strengthening and stretching the muscles of the rotator cuff in 
the shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Adult Screen: Adults entering a fitness program or those switching 
activities can ward off injuries with a similar evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
 Suppose a burned-out middle-age runner decides to take up tennis. "He'd be 
likely to have weak rotator-cuff muscles and weak upper-back extensor muscles," 
Fortanasce says, citing runners' tendency to be better developed in their lower 
body than upper. "They also tend to carry their upper body flexed forward, 
while tennis players need to open up their shoulders to execute a proper 
serve." The prescription in this case would involve at-home exercises to 
strengthen the back and rotator-cuff muscles. 
</P>
<P>
 Adults who exercise faithfully but have repeated injuries can also benefit 
from a physical-therapy evaluation, helping to determine whether weak muscles 
or improper form puts them on the injured list. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Costs: Fees for physical-therapy evaluations vary, with mass screenings 
less expensive than individual consultations. Around Los Angeles, the range for 
a prevention-oriented screening is $15 to $100. Besides providing the 
evaluation, most physical therapists will give printed or verbal instructions. 
The more comprehensive exams also include demonstrations of specific exercises 
and observation of the client for proper form. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 The Payoff: Thanks to preventive PT, athletic injuries were down by 29% during 
the 1992 sports season at Maranatha High School in Sierra Madre, says athletic 
trainer Cheryl Herlacher, who had her athletes evaluated before they played. 
The severity of injuries in athletes who followed strengthening and stretching 
recommendations was reduced by more than half. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Bob Kersee swears by preventive PT, convinced it contributes to the 
success of his wife, Jackie Joyner-Kersee, who won the Olympic gold for the 
heptathlon in 1988 and often undergoes physical therapy twice a week. "The 
combination of strength work, weight work and stretching in physical therapy 
can help prevent the muscles from breaking down," he says. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Finding a Good PT: Physical therapists are licensed by the state in which they 
practice. Their education includes at least four to six years of study after 
high school, says the American Physical Therapy Assn. Courses include basic and 
applied science, research and hands-on practical experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Therapists may also be certified by the American Board of Physical Therapy 
Specialties in seven areas: sports, orthopedics, geriatrics, pediatrics, 
cardiopulmonary, neurology and clinical electrophysiology.

MARTIN LAWRENCE: DR. DIRT OR MR. CLEAN?; BARRED BY NBC, HE'S GENERALLY BLUE ON 
STAGE BUT NOT ON TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Call it raunchy, filthy, vulgar and indecent if you must. Comedian Martin 
Lawrence says that his outrageous humor seeks simply to entertain, not offend. 
He also believes that a dirty mind can be a healthier mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I don't know anything else, I know what it takes to make a person laugh," 
the 28-year-old star of Fox-TV's "Martin" explains. "People have to have the 
right to laugh, or else you're going to have a lot more of us going crazy. If 
you can get past the language and have fun with what I'm talking about, I'm 
going to help keep you mentally healthy." 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, some have found it difficult to get past Lawrence's language. He's 
been barred from NBC programming for the time being because of the salacious 
monologue he delivered as host of "Saturday Night Live" two weeks ago. He's 
lost an appeal to the Motion Picture Assn. of America, which has deemed his 
concert film, "You So Crazy," raunchy enough to require an NC-17 rating. His 
concert album, "Talkin' S---," has been stamped with a Parental Advisory 
sticker. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lawrence doesn't appear to be angry or embittered over the attempts to 
quiet him down. Taking a break in his office near the set of "Martin," he is 
relaxed, friendly and quite happy with his career. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel good. I'm getting all this publicity, and I didn't even hurt anybody," 
he laughs. "I haven't done anything wrong, so I don't need to apologize to 
anybody. I'm a comedian, and I make people laugh. My fans know me, and they're 
not surprised by anything I say. And right now, a lot more people are asking 
'Who is Martin Lawrence?' " 
</P>
<P>
 There are at least two answers to that question. As a stand-up working the 
concert circuit, and as the host of HBO's "Def Comedy Jam," Lawrence has taken 
the stage as a quintessential blue comic -- earning laughs as a lively relayer 
of the bawdiest observations. On his sitcom -- where innuendo must replace 
graphic vulgarity -- Lawrence has scored tremendous success by tempering his 
stage persona for prime-time consumption and working relatively cleanly. 
Lawrence says he didn't think "Saturday Night Live" wanted the clean Martin 
hosting the show. 
</P>
<P>
 "People know I can be clean every Sunday at 8. On 'Saturday Night Live,' it's 
11:30, and things get a little more risque. In my monologue, I made sure to ask 
if people had their kids in bed yet. Maybe I misjudged my material, but the 
people at the show said, 'You're the host. Do what you do and have a good 
time.' That's what I did." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence's freewheeling monologue made light of oral sex and also offered 
women some very specific hygiene tips. He claims he used the same observations 
at a run-through of the show and heard no complaints. The network says he 
drifted into unscripted and unapproved material. 
</P>
<P>
 His monologue was broadcast live on the East Coast, but was heavily edited 
when it aired in the West. NBC quickly received almost 200 complaints from 
irate Eastern viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 The comic says that he understands some people being upset by his material, 
but doesn't think it was any stronger than what's been on the show previously. 
"I saw Alec Baldwin playing a camp counselor and licking a little boy's 
fingers. That seems worse to me than what I had to say. Let's be clear about 
what's in bad taste. What I said wasn't any harsher than what you'd hear on a 
douche commercial. But I'm not mad at NBC. I laugh and take my lumps. They made 
the decision they thought they had to, and I'll live with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Following the program, executive producer Lorne Michaels released a statement 
that "sometimes live television is full of surprises." NBC's reaction was more 
pointed, and Lawrence's planned appearance on Wednesday's "Tonight Show" was 
immediately canceled, over the objections of host Jay Leno. Before the trouble 
on "Saturday Night Live," Lawrence had worked the late-night talk-show circuit, 
appearing on the "Tonight Show," Letterman, Arsenio and "Late Night With Conan 
O'Brien" without incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's funny, and people want to see him again," says Leno. "He's one of the 
people on the list of guests you really want to get. I'm annoyed that I'm not 
getting the chance to let him talk about this on 'The Tonight Show.' If we can 
edit out Ross Perot giving a phone number, we can certainly bleep out anything 
inappropriate Martin might say." 
</P>
<P>
 Leno adds that the network response to an act like Lawrence's may change as 
his popularity increases. "There's a certain hypocrisy in this business, in 
that it all has to do with ratings. If someone is offensive and the ratings are 
just OK, there's moral indignation and outrage. If someone's offensive and the 
ratings go through the roof, suddenly it's a triumph of free speech." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Maher, the host of Comedy Central's "Politically Incorrect," has been 
appearing on the "Tonight Show" recently as a remote correspondent who brings a 
touch of naughty humor to the program. He says there's a temporary chill on any 
comic outrageousness in the wake of Lawrence's "SNL" appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked Jay if I should tone my material down and he said it would be a good 
idea. Things are a little tense right now, and it's better to go for the subtle 
joke rather than the graphic one." Maher limited himself to one slightly lewd 
Michael Jackson joke when he reported from the Grammy show last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Comedian Thea Vidale has a split comedy career similar to Lawrence's. As a 
stand-up comic in the midst of a "Down and Dirty" tour, she specializes in 
raucous, sexually explicit material, but as the star of ABC's "Thea," she has 
proven that she can work network-clean. "I take pride in my blue act," she 
says, "and I love Martin and support him as a blue act, even though I don't 
necessarily agree with everything he says. In that monologue, he did what any 
comic would do -- he went with material he knew would work."  
</P>
<P>
 Although Lawrence's stand-up material is strictly adult, with the success of 
"Martin" he's become a popular figure with children. Lawrence believes his 
expanding fan base may have something to do with his film's NC-17 rating. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess the board figures that through my language the kids will get a bad 
impression. They need to rethink that, because I'm not inciting violence or 
racism or anything negative. I'm just making you laugh." 
</P>
<P>
 Stand-up Andrew Dice Clay, no stranger to controversy, feels that Lawrence is 
going to have to get used to the criticism that comes his way. "He's a great 
stand-up, he's got a hit show, and he doesn't need this aggravation. But you 
create controversy when you're an edgy comic, and you have to roll with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Leno says that the people who don't find Lawrence funny are simply watching 
the wrong comic. "Every comic gives the audience what they want to hear. 
Martin's audience isn't offended by what he does because they know what he 
does. If you wander into a place with a big 'X' outside, and you're offended, 
you're the one who's in the wrong place." 
</P>
<P>
 Maher says that even with the actions taken against Lawrence, his "SNL" 
monologue will shift the standards of what is acceptable on television. "I've 
heard that I was the first guy on TV to say that something 'sucks.' It was a 
shock for a moment and then people got used to the word. The next guy who goes 
on 'Saturday Night Live' and uses slightly raunchy material is going to look 
tame compared to Martin. What he said did go out over the air, and despite the 
controversy, the nation didn't fall." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence says he isn't particularly concerned with setting new parameters for 
comedy, and doesn't see himself as an avenging combatant in the battle for 
freedom of speech. But he will continue to speak freely: "I was put here to be 
a comedian and to entertain people across the spectrum. But I'm not taking any 
political stands. I'm here to make people laugh, and I'll make them laugh by 
any means necessary."

L.A. CRITICS ARE CRAZY FOR 'CRAZY,' 'TAVERN'; STAGE: THE PLAYS SHARE THE TOP 
PRIZE OF THE LOS ANGELES DRAMA CRITICS CIRCLE. OF THE THEATERS, ORANGE COUNTY'S 
SOUTH COAST REPERTORY WINS THE MOST AWARDS.

 South Coast Repertory and "Sunset Boulevard" will take home the most awards -- 
although not the most prominent ones -- from the Los Angeles Drama Critics 
Circle awards ceremony next month, it was announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 South Coast captured seven of the competitive awards -- more than any other 
single producer. The five for "Sunset Boulevard," including one for star Glenn 
Close, surpasses the number of awards for any other single production. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet neither "Sunset Boulevard" nor any South Coast show received even a 
nomination for the top competitive honor for outstanding production. That award 
will go to "Crazy for You" and "The Tavern" this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crazy for You," which was seen at the Shubert Theatre last summer before the 
onslaught of "Sunset Boulevard," won four awards, while the Matrix Theatre 
revival of "The Tavern" received three. 
</P>
<P>
 South Coast's production of "Great Day in the Morning" also garnered three 
awards, while three shows -- the West Coast Ensemble revival of "Equus," the 
Pacific Resident Theatre Ensemble revival of "Ondine" and South Coast's 
production of "Shadowlands" -- won two apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Center Theatre Group, last year's big Critics Circle winner, this year won 
only three awards -- spread over three productions. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine of the 30 awards were won by productions in sub-100-seat venues -- the 
same number that went to shows at the single most awarded venue, the Shubert 
Theatre, home of both "Crazy For You" and "Sunset Boulevard." 
</P>

CASSAVETES, A MAN OF MANY ROLES; WITH 'TWOGETHER,' 'THE GODS OF SKID ROW' AND 
'MRS. PARKER' TO HIS CREDIT, THE ACTOR FINDS HIS CAREER FLOURISHING. AND THE 
ONLY SON OF ONE OF CINEMA'S CLASSIEST COUPLES ALSO HAS THREE SCREENPLAYS IN 
DEVELOPMENT. 
</P>

<P>
 Virginia Cassavetes, 8-year-old granddaughter of Gena Rowlands and the late 
director John Cassavetes, is doing splits in the middle of her living room. 
</P>
<P>
 "Honey," says her father, Nick Cassavetes, the only son of one of cinema's 
classiest couples, "this man saw you in 'Twogether.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Little Virginia looks perplexed. "The movie?" she asks in a disembodied tone 
as her brunette pigtails jerk up spastically without warning. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, Virginia. The TV series," he cracks sarcastically. Then he laughs. " Yes. 
Virginia. The movie ." 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia smiles gleefully and grabs daddy's pant legs. She knew all along. 
</P>
<P>
 The strikingly handsome, 35-year-old star of "Twogether" (currently at the 
Laemmle Monica in Santa Monica) is a man of many roles, including actor, 
writer, director, husband and daddy to both Virginia and 6-year-old Sasha, who 
is presently beet red from crying because mommy didn't buy her the shoes she 
was desperate for at the mall. Could this possibly be the house of a privileged 
celebrity offspring? Where is the Lalique and the bad attitude? 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for his family, one role Cassavetes refuses to play is embittered 
celebrity progeny. No tell-all books or habitual rehab for him. In fact, 
Cassavetes appears to be downright, well, normal. He lives with his family in a 
three-bedroom house in Woodland Hills and prefers weekend barbecues to 
name-dropping. 
</P>
<P>
 "I spent a lot of time with both my mother and father growing up," he recalls. 
"I hear people complain about their parents. Mine were nirvana," he says 
unequivocally, lounging in an oversized chair, dressed in a beige T-shirt, 
shrink-to-stick Levi's and distractingly long, bare feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in New York and raised there and in Los Angeles, Cassavetes grew up in a 
loving family whose life was literally a walking improvisation. Lots of 
celebrity children spent their youth on movie sets. But few had their homes 
actually become the sets. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad shot in our house a lot," he remembers. "In my room, there were film 
canisters hanging. My dad would come in in the middle of the night to see 
filmstrips hanging on the wall. He'd wake me up and say: 'Find me that piece of 
film,' and I'd say: 'Which one?' 'The one where your mother is scratching her 
nose in that take. . . .' So I'd take a flashlight and find it." 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Cassavetes was an ugly duckling. "I was a fat and brainy kid," he 
remembers. "I had nothing going for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Except a good jump shot. He landed a scholarship at Syracuse University in 
1977 but tore an Achilles' tendon, ending his college basketball career, only a 
few months later. He then turned to acting. "It forced me to use other aspects 
of my personality than my physical abilities. And that helped me in the long 
run." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, director Peter Bogdanovich saw the young actor onstage in Los Angeles 
and cast him in his first feature role, in "Mask." He paid his dues in 
forgettable films like "The Doors," "Blind Fury," "The Wraith," "Black Moon 
Rising" and "Backstreet Dreams." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Cassavetes has absolutely no embarrassment about any work he's done. 
"People will say to me: 'How could you do that movie?' How about: 'I love to 
work, and I wasn't doing anything that week'?" he retorts. "Look at my dad, who 
is considered an artist, right? He did more bad movies than I'll ever do! If 
you need the dough, get the dough." 
</P>
<P>
 He took the death of his father five years ago hard. "Yesterday, I visited the 
grave," he says solemnly. "I couldn't explain in a million words the kind of 
love he gave our family. The brilliance he showed as a director was nothing 
compared to what he was as a dad." 
</P>
<P>
 Papa would no doubt be proud as Cassavetes' career is decidedly on the rise. 
In "Twogether," he plays an unsympathetic, self-absorbed artist whose hobby is 
womanizing. While he is proud of the film, he allows: "It's a very strange 
movie. I watch it and sometimes I'm furious, but then sometimes I think: 'Oh, 
that's good. But never do I think, 'Oh, what a nice movie.' And I thank God for 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a complexity about Nick that I wanted for the role," says 
"Twogether's" writer-producer-director Andrew Chiaramonte. "He's not simple." 
</P>
<P>
 The unrated movie features some steamy love scenes. "Basically, I'm not really 
a shy person. But it was like 38,000 people looking right up my bum . . . that 
was uncomfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 The 200-pound, 6-foot-4 actor will show his obvious penchant for comedy in 
"The Gods of Skid Row," another independent film that he recently wrapped 
filming on in Greece. "It's a very broad comedy in a Mel Brooks/Monty Python 
sort of style," he says. Cassavetes plays two different roles: the Greek God 
Theseus and his descendant 5,000 years later. 
</P>
<P>
 He recently wrapped filming on "Mrs. Parker," under the direction of Alan 
Rudolph, with Robert Altman producing. In the film, to be released this fall, 
Jennifer Jason Leigh stars as Dorothy Parker, and Cassavetes portrays author 
Robert Sherwood. "He was probably the smartest man of this century," he says, 
awe-struck.  
</P>
<P>
 "The thrust of the movie is that all these literary geniuses of the '20s would 
get together and just get drunk," he says. "They'd talk a bunch of nonsense 
about everybody when they really should have been home banging on the 
typewriter." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only is his acting career flourishing but three of his screenplays are 
being developed as well. He will make his feature directorial debut working 
with his mother in a vehicle he wrote for her titled "Unhook the Stars."  
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, she's my mom," he says. "She is, in my opinion, the finest, most 
committed person I've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
 Cassavetes maintains strong views on how he intends to lead his life. "The 
thing that I never want to have happen is for me to be wearing a lot of fancy 
jewelry, driving a super money car, living in a house with antique furniture, 
being one of those antiseptic bastards that you see," he says. He leans back in 
his chair mulling over his prospects. "I don't know. Maybe it's coming." He 
suddenly looks mortified. "Maybe there's wicker in my future."

ART / CATHY CURTIS: LONG IN LATITUDE; GIVEN AMPLE ELBOW ROOM, CURATOR PAUL 
SCHIMMEL PUT NEWPORT HARBOR ON THE MAP IN THE '80S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 During the mid-1980s, while director Kevin Consey concentrated on raising 
money and enthusiasm for a new, $20-million home for Newport Harbor on South 
Coast Highway, chief curator Paul Schimmel immersed himself in the museum's 
main reason for being: producing informative and provocative exhibitions of 
modern and contemporary art. 
</P>
<P>
 "My involvement with the building plan, the choices of the architect and 
design of the building was very, very little," Schimmel said recently. "I was 
working on the exhibitions, and Kevin wanted it to be that way. The building 
was his passion. In some respects, I was very fortunate because he was so 
involved with the building that I was able to concentrate my full energies on 
the exhibition program." 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning with "Action/Precision: The New Direction in New York 1955-60" in 
1984 and continuing at two-year intervals, Schimmel's trio of exhibitions about 
key issues relating to Abstract Expressionist painting involved significant 
original research into historical topics. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that he neglected contemporary art. One of his major achievements at 
Newport Harbor was "Chris Burden: A Twenty-Year Survey" from 1988. With its 
assembly of objects used in Burden's performances, its inclusion of two massive 
installations and its authoritative catalogue, the show offered a probing 
analysis and overview of the work of a seminal performance artist. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Burden had received his master of fine arts degree from UC Irvine -- 
and even had a work-study job at Newport Harbor during his student years -- the 
Orange County connection was not the impetus for the retrospective. Schimmel 
never was one to champion artists simply for geographic reasons, which provoked 
much grumbling in local studios. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other landmarks in Schimmel's Newport Harbor career included the first Newport 
Biennial, "Los Angeles Today," in 1984, a survey of California artists of two 
generations, including Mike Kelley, Jill Giegerich, Charles Garabedian and Ed 
Moses. Like virtually all exhibitions at the museum, it was documented by a 
thorough catalogue, supporting the museum's growing reputation for serious 
scholarship.  
</P>
<P>
 Schimmel also founded the "New California Artists" series, which spotlighted 
Los Angeles up-and-comers. The program initially was run by Schimmel and 
associate curator Tom Heller (best remembered for his California Culture 
Series, a blend of alternative and avant-garde classical music programming). 
</P>
<P>
 After Heller left, "New California Artists" really took off under Anne Ayres, 
associate curator of exhibitions and collections from 1986 to 1988, when she 
became director of the Art Gallery at the Otis College of Art and Design in Los 
Angeles. Ayres, whose background was in university teaching, complemented 
Schimmel's more freewheeling personality with a series of meticulous and 
sensitive brochure essays expressing a keenly intellectual outlook on 
contemporary art. 
</P>
<P>
 During the '80s, Newport Harbor became a player in the national art scene as 
shows were picked up by such major institutions as the Whitney Museum of 
American Art in New York, the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis and the 
Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Attention paid by the major East Coast art press was another sign of major 
league status. "Chris Burden," for example, made the pages of Artforum, Flash 
Art, Arts, Art in America and ArtNews magazines, as well as the Wall Street 
Journal and the New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
 New additions during Schimmel's curatorship, which more than doubled the 
collection, encompassed a roll call of such major California postwar artists as 
John Baldessari, Ed Kienholtz, David Park, Ed Ruscha, John Altoon, Vija 
Celmins, Robert Irwin, Charles Ray, Allen Ruppersberg, Chris Burden and James 
Turrell. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Schimmel's taste and knowledge helped guide the Acquisition 
Committee, which raised money to buy works for the museum. When members visited 
the private collection of Aggie Gund, then president of the board of the Museum 
of Modern Art in New York, "they would know what they were looking at," 
Schimmel says. "That was very impressive for a small institution. It also 
helped me in terms of getting loans. It gave the museum credibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Schimmel and Consey were not always in accord. Their differences came to a 
boil over the declining amount of exhibition space in the new building when its 
size was decreased to save money. Schimmel says he was adamant that actual 
gallery space not be confused with other public spaces "where the art is in 
fact decorating the architecture." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Schimmel -- who left his Newport Beach post in 1990 to become chief 
curator of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles -- is quick to credit 
Consey with providing a conducive atmosphere for research and acquisitions. 
"Kevin did not hesitate to get behind something that he believed would be in 
the interest of the institution, whether de-accessioning art to go out and 
acquire new pieces or embracing a single exhibition that would cost us as much 
as the total budget several years earlier." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, "The Interpretive Link: Abstract Surrealism Into Abstract 
Expressionism, Works on Paper 1938-1948," mounted in 1986, cost "in excess of 
$200,000 -- more than the entire 1980 exhibition budget," according to 
Schimmel. 
</P>
<P>
 Selling art from a museum collection often raises alarm among donors and 
others who fear an erosion of institutional value, but in this case it was 
entirely logical. After the board decided to collect only contemporary 
California art, works by artists with other geographic affiliations were sold 
at auction to raise money for acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
 (Consey recalls that the board voted at least four times in six years on 
whether the museum should have a broader focus or remain dedicated to 
contemporary art, but the great majority of trustees always favored the status 
quo.) 
</P>
<P>
 In defense of the high costs of shows during his tenure, Consey points out 
that he was hired "to increase the scope and importance of (the museum's) 
scholarly activities." With the cooperation of the board and the help of "an 
extraordinarily talented (development) staff and a great economy," he said, he 
was able to increase the museum's budget fourfold. It was $1.7 million when he 
left, with a surplus of about $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Hmm. Then how to account for the $552,707 operating deficit that appears on 
the museum's September, 1990, financial statement? Consey responds that the 
museum operated without a director for nearly a year and a half after he became 
director of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, a period when "money was 
spent on exhibitions and salaries, and money wasn't being raised." 
</P>
<P>
 Just before he left for Chicago in 1989, Consey was asked what he felt he'd 
achieved during his tenure at Newport Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that, to a certain extent, we made it socially acceptable to like 
contemporary art in Orange County," he replied. "And if there's anything I'll 
take credit for, it's being able to do that without for a single beat 
compromising the cutting edge or the abrasiveness or the controversial aspects 
of our exhibition program. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the long run, you never make a mistake by having excellence as your 
measuring stick. You may take it on the chin in the short term. You may be 
charged with being elitist and incomprehensible and not giving the community 
what it wants, but I don't think a public educational institution is in the 
business of giving the public what it wants."

BIG HEAD START MAY NOT BE SWIFT, BUT IT'S STEADY; POP MUSIC: THE ALTERNATIVE 
BLUES-BASED BAND, WHICH WILL PLAY THE COACH HOUSE ON MONDAY NIGHT, CAN LAUGH AT 
PAST REJECTIONS. A HIT DEBUT ALBUM CAN DO THAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 "The letter said forget it, Big Head Tom, we don't want you," chuckled Todd 
Park Mohr, recalling a rejection years ago from MCA Records that didn't even 
get the band's name right. 
</P>
<P>
 It's Big Head Todd & the Monsters, featuring lead singer-guitarist Mohr, 
bassist Rob Squires and drummer Brian Nevin. They'll be at the Coach House in 
San Juan Capistrano Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 They can laugh at all those rejections now that they have a hit album. About 
450,000 copies of "Sister Sweetly" (on Giant Records) already have been sold, 
and another 5,000 are being bought each week -- quite a feat for a band playing 
music that hardly any company thought was commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 "The record companies didn't hate the music -- they just didn't think they 
could market it," Mohr said. His own tag for it: alternative blues-based rock 
'n' roll. "That kind of music is really big on the charts," he cracked. 
</P>
<P>
 This trio from Colorado often is lumped with such groups as the Grateful Dead 
and Blues Traveler, known for lengthy jams that weave unpredictably through the 
musical spectrum, blending all sorts of elements. The Monsters also are big on 
roots rock, Hendrix and Sly Stone tunes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's alternative because we explore music with the sensibilities of the 
current rock groups," Mohr said. "It's not structured like mainstream music, 
even though the roots are in mainstream." 
</P>
<P>
 What really sets the Monsters apart from other alternative groups is their 
passion for the blues, an integral part of their sound. Mohr has been a blues 
fanatic, idolizing the likes of Albert Collins, since junior high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a weird kid," he said. "I rebelled by listening to the blues. I always 
felt at home with the blues. It's really the music of my heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Starting out as a sax player, he switched to guitar after high school. In 
college, in 1986, he and Nevin and Squires, who'd first worked together in a 
high school band, started playing together again. Mohr, majoring in English 
literature and Oriental history and planning a career as an academic, 
transferred from Colorado State to the University of Colorado to be with his 
buddies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went our separate ways after high school," Mohr recalls, "but ended up 
living together and going to school together. We were playing parties and then 
bars in the Boulder area. We liked playing together so much that we dropped out 
of school and started playing full time." 
</P>
<P>
 They built a large following on the club scene and even put out two 
independent albums -- "Another Mayberry" in 1989 and "Midnight Radio" in 1990 
-- that sold a respectable total of 75,000 copies. But to the band, those 
albums were just stepping stones to something bigger. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted a real record contract and we tried for years and couldn't get 
one," Mohr said. What finally made a difference was hiring a manager who was 
able to coax Giant Records owner Irving Azoff to hear the band at a club in 
Aspen. Two years ago, they signed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Sister Sweetly" came out about a year ago and has sold slowly and steadily, 
helped along by the trio's extensive touring both as a headliner and opening 
for such artists as Robert Plant. There is, however, a big discrepancy between 
the band's live and studio sounds, and that still bothers Mohr. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the album there are a lot of ballads and we're fairly restrained and 
mellow," explained Mohr, who writes all the band's music. "I don't like that. 
It's not really us. When we did the album we needed something that was 
radio-friendly. David Z was the only producer available at the time who had any 
radio success. We went along with what he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why we made a slicker radio record. None of us wanted to make an album 
that the critics loved but that sold only 12 copies." 
</P>
<P>
 What about the next album? 
</P>
<P>
 "We paid our dues in terms of making compromises to get on the radio," Mohr 
answered. "We're going to be more involved with the production of this record. 
It will be a harder rock 'n' roll record. We have a strong band sound. You 
don't realize it that much on the current record and but it will be very 
obvious on the next one." 
</P>
<P>
 * Big Head Todd & the Monsters play Monday at 8 p.m. the Coach House, 33157 
Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano, $19.50. (714) 496-8930.

LA JOLLA PLAYHOUSE NAMES MICHAEL GREIF DIRECTOR; THEATER: BOARD PRESIDENT CITES 
THE 'SAVVY BUSINESS ACUMEN' OF DES MCANUFF'S 34-YEAR-OLD REPLACEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Michael Greif will become the second artistic director of La Jolla Playhouse 
since it reopened in 1983, replacing Des McAnuff. 
</P>
<P>
 Greif, 34, currently a free-lance director, will assume the post next fall. He 
is known to local audiences for staging "What the Butler Saw" in the 1992 La 
Jolla season. He also co-directed "The Three Cuckolds" in 1986 and is scheduled 
to direct Neal Bell's new adaptation of Zola's "Therese Raquin," opening July 
10. 
</P>
<P>
 After paying tribute to McAnuff's ability to attract talent to La Jolla, Greif 
(rhymes with life ) said Monday that he will make "slightly different choices 
of who those artists are." But he declined to be specific other than to refer 
to those with whom he has worked in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those are "Angels in America" writer Tony Kushner, whose first produced 
play, "A Bright Room Called Day," was directed by Greif at the New York 
Shakespeare Festival in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Greif was one of three artistic associates picked by the festival's founder, 
Joseph Papp, to program a mini-season of plays at the festival in 1990. Greif 
staged Sophie Treadwell's 1928 drama "Machinal" -- which he had earlier 
directed for the city's Naked Angels company -- Constance Congdon's "Casanova" 
and Jose Rivera's "Marisol." He had earlier staged "Marisol" at Hartford Stage 
Co. as a replacement for George C. Wolfe when Wolfe left to direct "Angels in 
America" on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 After Papp died, Greif remained in the position for two years, directing 
Shakespeare's "Pericles" in 1991. But the artistic associate program was 
disbanded when Wolfe took over the festival last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Greif lived in San Diego from 1982 to 1986 and received an M.F.A. in the 
theater directing program at UCSD, the campus where La Jolla Playhouse is 
located. The proximity proved useful; while a student he assistant-directed 
several Playhouse productions, including "Romeo and Juliet," "As You Like It," 
and "Big River." This last credit enabled him later to direct the Japanese and 
Australian productions and an American tour of "Big River." 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Brooklyn, Greif received an undergraduate degree from Northwestern 
University in Chicago, where he studied with Frank Galati, whose production of 
"The Grapes of Wrath" later played La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
 Greif said that La Jolla will be his "full-time commitment," but he also said 
the board "made it clear they wanted someone to maintain a national identity," 
so outside free-lance jobs will be allowed. For now, though, Greif said he is 
primarily "anxious to find out what those people (in San Diego) want to see." 
</P>
<P>
 A statement from board president Gary L. Wollberg said that Greif not only has 
"directorial excellence, but also savvy business acumen. He's keenly aware of 
the fiscal responsibilities his new position entails." 
</P>
<P>
 Greif said that he's aware of the theater's deficit, though he's not sure how 
big it is. (The deficit now stands at $1.6 million, said a theater spokesman.) 
"I feel secure there are structures in place to eradicate it," Greif said, 
adding that he demonstrated his ability to produce on budget -- or to find 
funds to augment his budgets -- during his stint at the Shakespeare Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Greif said on Monday that he had not yet signed a contract and "the specifics" 
of it "are still a mystery to me," but he "has every intention of signing it."

WHISTLER'S RESTORED 'ARRANGEMENT' AT GETTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 "Arrangement in Black: Pablo de Sarasate," a recently restored painting by 
James Abbott McNeill Whistler, is on view at the J. Paul Getty Museum until the 
end of May. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1884 portrait of the internationally renowned violinist and composer 
belongs to the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh, which loaned the work to 
the museum in Malibu in exchange for conservation services. 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to putting the painting on display, Getty conservators removed a 
confusing array of paint applied by earlier restorers and revealed Whistler's 
subtle variations of light and shade.

'3 STRIKES' LAW GOES INTO EFFECT; CRIME: GOVERNOR SIGNS LEGISLATION THAT AIMS 
TO PUT HABITUAL FELONS BEHIND BARS FOR LIFE. HE CALLS IT ONLY A FIRST STEP 
TOWARD TOUGHER MEASURES AGAINST VIOLENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brushing aside criticisms of its cost and potential flaws, Gov. Pete Wilson on 
Monday signed what he called the toughest and most sweeping criminal sentencing 
law in the state's history, the "three strikes" bill that is aimed at putting 
habitual felons behind bars for life. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, in a ceremony outside the Los Angeles Police Department's Hollywood 
Division, said the bill should send a message to the worst of California's 
criminals: "You'd better start finding a new line of work because we're going 
to start turning career criminals into career inmates." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Republican governor, seeking to build upon the momentum created by 
public outrage over crime, said the "three strikes" measure is only the first 
step in what could be a comprehensive program to toughen the state's crime 
laws. He urged lawmakers to do more. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments after Wilson signed the bill, the man credited with spearheading its 
passage began submitting the last of an estimated 800,000 signatures that are 
expected to place a nearly identical proposal on the state ballot in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Reynolds, a Fresno photographer whose daughter was killed by a repeat 
felon in 1992, said he is following through with his "three strikes and you're 
out" initiative because he does not want the Legislature to tamper with the law 
Wilson signed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are in a position to unravel everything that's been done here," Reynolds 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the law was greeted warmly by Orange County lawmakers, who supported the 
measure during its circuitous trek through the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 "It represents a major improvement of existing law," said Assemblyman Ross 
Johnson (R-Fullerton), who carried a bill similar to the "three strikes" 
measure signed by Wilson. "We can do more, and we ought to do more." 
</P>
<P>
 The new law requires a sentence of 25 years to life for any felon who has 
committed two prior violent or serious felonies -- crimes that range from 
burglary and arson to rape and murder. Those convicted of a second violent or 
serious felony would receive a sentence twice as long as what is now on the 
books. 
</P>
<P>
 The law also limits plea bargaining and requires that convicts be permitted to 
reduce their sentences by no more than 20% with credits for working or 
attending school while in prison. Until now, inmates could cut their sentences 
in half with such credits. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill's sponsors say it gives California the toughest sentencing law in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The emergency measure took effect at 2:45 p.m. Monday when it was received and 
recorded by the secretary of state's office after the bill was shuttled from 
Los Angeles to Sacramento by a top Wilson aide. By day's end, it was all but 
certain that the first of the repeat felons who will be sentenced under the law 
already was in custody. 
</P>
<P>
 The Corrections Department reports that the new law will lead to a massive 
prison building boom -- 20 more penitentiaries by the end of the decade -- and 
eventually increase operating costs by more than $2 billion a year. The state 
spends about $3 billion annually to run 28 prisons that house about 120,000 
inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the measure attracted anticipated criticism from criminal defense 
lawyers and civil libertarians, it also was opposed by some prosecutors, 
including Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking for Garcetti, Assistant Dist. Atty. R. Dan Murphy said his office had 
reservations about the bill and would have preferred another, narrower measure 
proposed in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is now the law," he said. "We fully intend to enforce it." 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy said the major concern of the district attorney's office is that the 
law would further clog an overcrowded court system. With passage of the law, 
Murphy said those charged with serious crimes will be far less likely to plead 
guilty because it would mean being that much closer to a life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "The consequences of pleading guilty are much greater," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said similar fears have been voiced before the passage of other major 
crackdowns on crime, including the "victims bill of rights" in 1982 and the 
"speedy trial" initiative in 1990, and have been unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also said the measure's potential costs have been exaggerated because 
the estimates do not consider savings from a reduction in crime brought about 
by locking up repeat felons for longer terms. Those behind bars cannot commit 
more crimes, Wilson said, and others on the streets might be deterred by fear 
of the longer sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm convinced that if we are sending clear messages to career criminals, we 
will begin to see them reform their conduct," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the costs are huge, Wilson said, he believes the price will be worth 
it. He compared the construction of new prisons to the building of the 
University of California and the State Water Project, two endeavors from an 
earlier era that often are cited as examples of the vision of Wilson's 
predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
 Like those projects, the new prisons will be financed with bonds, similar to a 
mortgage paid off over 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're producing . . . capital improvements for future generations, and they 
rightly can be called upon to help pay for it," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County lawmakers echoed the governor, suggesting that the measure may 
prove far less costly than critics have predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't agree with all the doom- and gloom-sayers about what this will cost 
this state," said Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove). "It's proven that 
repeat offenders cost society much more than it costs to incarcerate them. We 
will not have repeat trials; we will not have to re-convict people who will be 
in prison all the longer." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the law does prove costly, "that is our obligation as lawmakers -- to 
protect the people," Pringle said, adding that he and other conservatives 
remain "very eager to cut down our bloated bureaucracy to pay for this and 
other programs that are necessary." 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) voiced similar sentiments: "We have 
plenty of money for the real purposes of government. It's a matter of 
prioritizing where that money goes." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Assemblywoman Doris Allen (R-Cypress) suggested that the true costs 
of the measure will only come with time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to be able to know until we actually have a little experience 
with it," Allen said. "I'm happy from the standpoint that it's a beginning. It 
begins discussion; it begins thought. It's a recognition of a very serious 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove), who pushed a similar "three-strikes" 
bill, said it is now contingent on the Democrat-dominated Legislature and the 
Republican governor to work together to craft other laws to keep first-time 
offenders from becoming career criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this changes the face of criminal justice here in California," Umberg 
said. "I don't think people will look back and rue the day this was signed 
unless we completely neglect dealing with the overall problem of crime from a 
comprehensive view." 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg said lawmakers have to consider options such as boot camps, stricter 
probation programs, electronic surveillance and halfway houses for nonviolent 
offenders. Without such measures, he said, "the costs are going to be quite, 
quite high." 
</P>
<P>
 For Wilson, Monday was the climax of years spent advocating tougher criminal 
justice laws, which he championed as mayor of San Diego, as a U.S. senator and 
as a candidate for governor. Although his reelection campaign officially opens 
today, the bill signing ceremony had all the trappings of a political event. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson signed the measure on a small table in the parking lot at the Police 
Department's Hollywood division, which he said was chosen because it had the 
city's highest rate of violent crime last year. He sat in front of a police 
wagon, flanked by black-and-white squad cars and ringed by uniformed officers. 
</P>
<P>
 With Wilson were Reynolds and the bill's two legislative sponsors, Assemblymen 
Bill Jones, a Republican, and Jim Costa, a Democrat, both from Fresno. Atty. 
Gen. Dan Lungren also attended, with representatives from several crime victims 
groups and Rep. Michael Huffington, a Santa Barbara Republican who has helped 
pay for the "three strikes" initiative campaign and is a candidate for the U.S. 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing behind Wilson, and watching from a distance, was Don Novey, president 
of the state's prison guards union, which will grow along with any increase in 
the inmate population. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson strategists have said the governor's campaign will focus on crime as 
one of three main issues. The public in recent polls has placed the matter at 
or near the top of the political agenda. The governor said he has no intention 
of letting up on the Legislature simply because the "three strikes" bill is now 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the threat of Reynolds' initiative became real after 12-year-old Polly 
Klaas was slain last year in Northern California, the "three strikes" bill was 
languishing in the Legislature, unable to move past its first committee. 
Reynolds, Wilson said, helped lawmakers see the light, "or at least feel the 
heat."

 Now the governor is calling for the passage of other bills that would put 
first-time rapists and child molesters in prison for life without the 
possibility of parole, expand the death penalty, make it easier to try 
juveniles as adults, and further limit the use of credits to reduce sentences.

 "This is the beginning, not the end," Wilson said. "The Legislature must 
finish the job."

MARTIN MARIETTA TO ACQUIRE GRUMMAN FOR $1.9 BILLION; DEFENSE: BUYER OF 
ONCE-FORMIDABLE AIRCRAFT BUILDER WOULD RISE TO THE TOP RANKS OF THE INDUSTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In a swiftly negotiated deal that would further accelerate the shrinking of 
the aerospace industry, Martin Marietta said Monday that it will pay $1.9 
billion for Grumman Corp., a fading Long Island, N.Y., aircraft builder undone 
by the post-Cold War aerospace bust. 
</P>
<P>
 The acquisition would elevate Martin to the top ranks of the U.S. defense 
industry, with $13 billion in annual sales, bringing it at least even with 
better known rivals, McDonnell Douglas and Lockheed. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have here is a combination that will allow us to become a formidable 
competitor in increasingly difficult times," Martin Chairman Norman Augustine 
said Monday. "We have a team made up of all gold medalists." 
</P>
<P>
 The deal marks the latest chapter of an industry consolidation that is fast 
creating a few monolithic defense suppliers that will dominate the global arms 
market and exert new political clout. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, dozens of plants and tens of thousands more jobs will be 
eliminated around the country. Analysts estimated that the Martin-Grumman 
merger would eliminate 10,000 to 15,000 jobs in states from Colorado to New 
York. Hard-hit California would be spared because neither company has large 
operations there. 
</P>
<P>
 Grumman spokeswoman Susan Vassallo said that the company has 50 employees in 
Irvine and that it was too early to determine whether the buyout would affect 
its operations locally. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this time, I just don't know," Vassallo said. "We just can't say what 
impact this is going to have on our facilities." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin has been among the most aggressive buyers of other firms in the past 
year, acquiring General Electric's defense business concentrated in 
Pennsylvania and agreeing to buy General Dynamics' space booster business in 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a few years ago, Martin was way down the list of major contractors, and 
its emergence at the top demonstrates how rapidly the aerospace industry is 
changing. 
</P>
<P>
 As Martin has increased its clout, Grumman has seen its fortunes wither. Once 
the premier builder of Navy carrier aircraft, the firm's airplane programs have 
died one by one, and last year it formally acknowledged that it was exiting the 
business of building new military airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Grumman will give Martin a strong position in the crucial market 
for aircraft modification and updating, as well as leading technology for 
airborne surveillance systems that Grumman has recently developed. 
</P>
<P>
 Grumman Chairman Renso Caporali said Monday that the company faced a future in 
which it would have increasing difficulty competing against larger firms and 
that it had sufficient size to compete in only a few markets. "What became 
apparent to us was that the world was going to get a lot tougher for people in 
our business and we were going to have to make some changes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Against that backdrop, Caporali said he met a month ago with Augustine, his 
former classmate in aeronautical engineering at Princeton University, at a 
hotel restaurant in Long Island and set in motion the merger that was formally 
approved by the boards of both firms on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of the deal, Grumman shareholders would receive $55 per share, a 
37% premium to the firm's price before the announcement. Grumman shares shot up 
$14.25 to close at $54.125 in trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, 
while Martin shares gained $1.25 to close at $46. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin said it has arranged financing of $2.4 billion, providing a cushion for 
the $1.9-billion deal that is meant to warn off potential rivals that would 
start a bidding war, according to Robert Paulson, an aerospace consultant at 
McKinsey & Co. The two companies also agreed to an accelerated timetable that 
would close the deal in only one month, making it difficult for an outsider to 
mount a competing bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Augustine and Caporali said they have not yet worked out the details about 
which facilities may be closed or even what Caporali's new job will be. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Aseritis, First Boston aerospace analyst, said the acquisition would 
position Martin about even with Lockheed and just behind McDonnell Douglas in 
defense sales. Martin would have $13 billion in total sales, but only $9 
billion of that would be in defense. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonnell has about $10 billion in defense sales, while Lockheed has about 
$8.5 billion in defense sales, Aseritis said. But Gary Reich of Prudential 
Securities ranks Martin as the top defense firm by a wide margin, based on its 
estimated contract awards. Martin has 93,000 employees and Grumman 18,000 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The emergence of Martin as an industry leader marks the first time an 
electronics and software company will outrank the major aircraft manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 For decades, aircraft builders have been undisputed leaders of the business, 
but now companies that can integrate sophisticated battlefield information 
systems are making huge inroads in grabbing defense dollars from so-called 
"metal benders." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Grumman is out of the aircraft business, its technology is highly 
regarded. The firm's biggest program is the Joint STARS, a system that allows 
sophisticated radar images gathered aboard a Boeing aircraft to be broadcast to 
commanders on the battlefield. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Martin, Grumman and the GE unit that Martin acquired were the 
top three recipients of Defense Department research funding, according to First 
Boston's Aseritis. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have a tremendous research capability in that one company now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Martin has been stung by a series of major embarrassments. Three 
satellites built by the former GE unit failed after launch last year. And the 
firm agreed to pay $1 million to NASA following an investigation into 
irregularities at the Johnson Space Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Another trend highlighted by the rise of Martin is the extent to which 
mainstream American corporations have withdrawn from the defense business. 
</P>
<P>
 General Electric, Ford Motor, IBM and Goodyear have all sold their defense 
units in recent years, reflecting frustration with the low profits, bureaucracy 
and vulnerability to federal fraud charges that accompany Pentagon contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Martin deal is certainly likely to act as a catalyst for additional 
acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is going to start a whole other round of deals," McKinsey's Paulson said. 
"They need to be done. There is still too much capacity, and it isn't being 
reduced quickly enough. It is the right time. There is still a lot of cash left 
from the end of the Reagan era contracts."

O.C. CONSUMER UNIT FILES SUIT TO BAR PEN KNIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK I. PINSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is Remington's "Classic Writing Pen Knife" an innocent letter opener or a 
potentially deadly concealed weapon? 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Orange County consumer prosecutors filed suit to answer the 
question, prompting one of the area's largest discount retailers to immediately 
pull the product from store shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to sell something that's not legal," said Matthew A. Ross, 
director of stores for Fedco Inc. "I certainly wouldn't want someone purchasing 
this item until the decision is made on its legality. Fedco's always been a 
good citizen. We've always cooperated with law enforcement authorities." 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County district attorney filed suit against Fedco, Fedco Shaver 
Shops and the pen knife distributor, Remington Products Co. The suit charges 
that the 5-inch item -- with a ballpoint at one end and, beneath a cap, a 2 
1/2-inch blade at the other -- is a "stabbing instrument" banned by state law. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing to consider a temporary restraining order barring the sale of the 
pen knife, which sells for $6.87, has been scheduled for Wednesday in Orange 
County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert C. Gannon Jr., supervising prosecutor in the 
Consumer and Environmental Protection Unit, said that by design, the pen knife 
is "clearly deceptive in appearance. That's part of our concern. People could 
be so easily disarmed by its appearance." 
</P>
<P>
 California law specifically bans any "writing pen knife," defined by the 
statute as "a device that appears to be a writing pen but has concealed within 
it a pointed, metallic shaft that is designed to be a stabbing instrument," the 
lawsuit states. 
</P>
<P>
 Violation of the statute is a felony. The penalty for making, advertising, 
selling, purchasing or possessing such knives is punishable by up to three 
years in prison, Gannon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gannon said his unit first became aware of the product by a caller who saw it 
at the Costa Mesa Fedco. He said there was no indication that the product has 
been used in an illegal fashion, or how many have been sold during the two 
months it has been on the market. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gannon said that one of his chief worries is that the pen knife could be 
taken into schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could bypass a metal detector," he said. "No one would suspect that it was 
a potentially deadly weapon. . . . It does not appear to be anything that could 
be adapted to a key chain. . . . No law enforcement agencies have run across 
this item to date, thank God." 
</P>
<P>
 The blade of the product is pointed and fixed, with a single, sharpened edge, 
Gannon said, adding he believes it was not manufactured in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not had any settlement discussions as yet, but we expect to obtain 
full cooperation with Fedco as far as halting sales of illegal items," Gannon 
said. "I would be shocked if they did not agree to remove these items from 
their stores and to surrender them for destruction." 
</P>
<P>
 Within hours of the suit being filed, Fedco's Ross contacted the 10 Southern 
California stores where the product is sold by a concessionaire and ordered 
them removed from the shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross said that Fedco does not advertise, market or sell the product. 
Nonetheless, since Ross was unable to contact Remington, which operates the 
Shaver Shop concessions at the Fedco stores, he ordered them removed 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 A clerk at Fedco's Costa Mesa store, who declined to give his name, said the 
product is meant to function as a letter opener. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like a letter opener to me," Ross agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care what they call them," Gannon said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's consumer protection unit has taken an aggressive 
stance on a variety of issues since Gannon, who formerly prosecuted 
high-profile homicide cases, joined the unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, prosecutors sued an Anaheim X-ray center, alleging that employees 
performed mammography exams without properly certified equipment, presenting 
potential health risks to hundreds of women. In that case, the company has 
denied wrongdoing and the litigation is pending. 
</P>
<P>
 The unit has also sued and later settled with the operators of a Huntington 
Beach taco stand accused of skimping on the beef in its burritos, and a Garden 
Grove food company accused of manufacturing tofu products under filthy 
conditions.

DISNEY PLANS TIME-SHARE RESORT ON NEWPORT COAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Walt Disney Co. said it will purchase 70 acres overlooking the Pacific Ocean 
at Newport Coast south of Newport Beach to build its first California resort -- 
a Mediterranean-theme village of 650 time-share condominiums, plus shops and 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 The planned resort is part of the entertainment giant's strategy to build 
time-share townhomes near its amusement parks throughout the world. It would be 
built next to the Pelican Hill golf course. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney already has a successful 410-unit time-share project near Walt Disney 
World in Florida and recently announced plans to build resorts in Vero Beach, 
about 95 miles south of Disney World, and on Hilton Head Island in South 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 "This coastal site fits what Disney is trying to do with its vacation 
villages. It doesn't have to be right next door to Disneyland," said Ray 
Watson, a member of Disney's board of directors and a vice chairman of the 
Irvine Co., which sold the first 35 acres to the Burbank-based company's Disney 
Vacation Development Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, this site will be attractive to people from Missouri or Northern 
California who can come down here and enjoy the California coast. And yes, they 
can go to Disneyland, but they don't have to. The idea is vacation," Watson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 While terms of the deal were not disclosed, local real estate brokers 
estimated the cost of the first 35 acres at about $25 million. Disney, in a 
phased purchase, has bought vacant land at Newport Coast already zoned for home 
development and is expected to complete purchase of the remaining 35 acres 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement comes with Disney yet to decide whether to proceed with a 
proposed $3-billion expansion called the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim. The 
company is also in meetings with its European lenders seeking more than $2 
billion in refinancing for its troubled EuroDisney theme park near Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 The project at Newport Coast, located on one of the few remaining stretches of 
undeveloped ocean-view land in Southern California, must still clear federal, 
state and county regulatory hurdles. Officials said that they anticipate no 
delays and that construction is slated to begin next year. The resort could 
open as early as 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 The condominiums -- studio and one-, two- and three-bedroom units -- may be 
marketed as part of Disney Vacation Club packages, which allow members to buy 
time at the company's resort in Orlando and those planned in Vero Beach and 
Hilton Head. 
</P>
<P>
 The resorts will include 24-hour front-desk service and other hotel-like 
recreational amenities, such as tennis courts, golf courses, saunas and 
volleyball facilities. Irvine Co. officials predicted that Disney will work out 
a deal with them to give its time-share members access to the Pelican Hill golf 
course. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney said it has sold more than 9,000 time-share memberships since launching 
its vacation club in December, 1991. Memberships begin at $12,390. 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly how interests in the Newport Coast resort will be sold has not yet 
been determined, Disney officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a beautiful site, only a half-hour from Disneyland," said Beth Heller, 
director of development for the Disney project. "It's amazing with the huge 
California coastline how few opportunities there are for people to vacation 
with their families at beach resorts." 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Co. land purchased by Disney was originally slated for a Marriott 
hotel, but the hotel company could not obtain financing. As a result, local 
officials and residents were not greatly concerned by the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is in lieu of the hotel, so I don't think it will be that much 
different," said Jean Watt, a Newport Beach City Council member. "I hope Disney 
will do a good job. I hope as a developer they will do something that fits into 
the environment. It's such a sensitive area in terms of views. Most of the 
wildlife has already been evicted from that area." 
</P>
<P>
 Other local officials and real estate experts predicted that Disney's resort 
would increase Newport Beach's standing as a tourist destination. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Siemon, who recently bought a custom home lot at nearby Pelican Hill, said 
he was pleased that he would have time-share neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't bother me at all. I knew when I bought the land that they were 
planning a resort, and that's what I want to see happen," said Siemon, who is 
building an $8-million home on his lot. "I paid big money, and I've got the big 
guard gate and fences all around. I'm not bothered a bit." 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Coast is an exclusive development of custom lots, which typically are 
priced at $1 million or more for half an acre. The 9,432-acre residential and 
resort community features the Pelican Hill Golf Club, which is open to the 
public. The Irvine Co. has approval to build up to 2,150 hotel rooms and as 
many as 2,600 homes at Newport Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 "Almost everyone in the industry is looking at what Disney is doing and trying 
to do it themselves," said David Matheson, a spokesman for the American Resort 
and Residential Development Assn., a time-share trade group in Washington. 
"They are bringing a level of respectability to the time-share industry." 
</P>
<P>
 The time-share business has been subject to widespread abuse, with hard-sell 
tactics used to market shoddy developments in undesirable vacation locations. 
But Disney relies on a soft-sell approach and builds high-quality resort 
projects that could compete with any luxury hotel, Matheson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They build first-rate, top-notch projects which are ideal for family 
vacations," he said. Disney Time-Shares 
</P>
<P>
 Disney Vacation Developments plans to build a resort at Newport Coast, one of 
the last stretches of undeveloped ocean-view land in California. Here are 
details on the proposed project: 
</P>
<P>
 Size: 70 acres 
</P>
<P>
 Estimated purchase price: $25 million for the first 35 acres. Disney will 
purchase additional 35 acres.

</P>
<P>
 Construction begins: 1995 
</P>

 Projected opening: Early 1997

EX-FALCON QUARTERBACK MILLER SIGNS WITH RAMS; FOOTBALL: INJURIES HAVE MARRED 
THE CAREER OF THE PRECISION PASSER, WHO SIGNED A 3-YEAR, $9-MILLION PACT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Quarterback Chris Miller, known best for his passing accuracy and penchant for 
getting hurt, signed a three-year, $9-million contract Monday to play 
quarterback for the Rams, his boyhood heroes while growing up in Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I will help the Rams a bunch," said Miller, who will require one to 
three months of further rehabilitation on his surgically repaired left knee 
before being cleared for unlimited work. "I've had some bad luck injury-wise, 
but my knee feels great. I've been running, and it's only March, and I have the 
time to get it stronger." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, desperate for a starting quarterback after Jim Everett's belly-flop 
in 1993 and T.J. Rubley's failure to make a favorable impression, had talked 
about pursuing Green Bay's Brett Favre or Miami's Scott Mitchell or trading for 
Houston's Warren Moon. 
</P>
<P>
 But after inspection, the Rams went with Miller, a Pro Bowl selection for 
Atlanta after the 1991 season but a player who has twice undergone 
reconstructive surgery on his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams gave Miller, 28, a $900,000 signing bonus with yearly salaries of 
$2.1 million, $2.7 million and $3.3 million. They also maintained a first right 
of refusal on Miller, who earned $1.85 million with the Atlanta Falcons last 
year, once his contract expires following the 1996 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Team physicians put Miller through a four-hour examination last week and told 
Coach Chuck Knox that Miller's knee was at no more risk than any other player's 
on the team. Miller also worked out for Knox at Rams Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "He will definitely be ready for our mini-camp (in May)," Knox said. "He's 
almost 100% right now. He's going to move here right away and we will have him 
continue his rehab under the direction of our team doctors and our trainers." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller tripped on the Georgia Dome artificial turf in the eighth game of the 
1992 season -- against the Rams -- and tore the anterior cruciate ligament in 
his left knee. After undergoing reconstructive knee surgery, he out-dueled 
Bobby Hebert for the Falcons' starting job in 1993 but played poorly and was 
replaced by Hebert in the third game. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta Coach Jerry Glanville inserted Miller into the fourth game of the 
season with the Falcons trailing the Steelers, 45-17. There were 13 minutes 
remaining on the clock, and on his first play in the game, Miller re-injured 
his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who played at the University of Oregon and lives in Eugene, Ore., has 
missed playing time in his seven pro seasons because of a bruised chest, 
cracked ribs, sprained ankle, sprained knee and a broken collarbone that 
required the insertion of a steel plate and accompanying screws. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never dreamed he would pass our physical examination; I wasn't even 
considering him as a likely candidate for that reason," said Joe Vitt, Rams 
assistant head coach. "But the doctors said he is a month ahead in rehab and we 
have computer reports tracking his progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "You meet him, and you have to like the guy. This was a great quarterback when 
he was healthy, and that's it -- that's the whole thing. If he stays healthy, 
we've got a good one." 
</P>
<P>
 Only Dan Marino, Fran Tarkenton, Joe Namath and Bernie Kosar reached the 
10,000-yard mark in passing at an earlier age than Miller. In the last three 
seasons he has thrown 42 touchdown passes with only 27 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller was effective in the Falcons' pass-happy, run-and-shoot attack. But he 
was also hurt by an offensive philosophy that used more players to catch the 
ball and fewer to block -- and protect the quarterback. His new assignment with 
the Rams -- focus on getting the ball to running back Jerome Bettis, a 
sensation as a rookie last season, and then fake handoffs to Bettis to throw 
deep -- should keep him out of harm's way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't run a play-action pass in four years, which will be a nice change," 
Miller said. "It's a refreshing start, and I like the idea of having a big 
horse like Bettis back there to carry the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to stay on the West Coast, and I wanted to play on grass, and the 
Rams were my No. 1 choice." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams decided weeks ago to trade Everett, who started 87 consecutive games 
before losing his job, but they have been waiting to hire a replacement before 
doing so. The team has talked to the New Orleans Saints about a trade for 
Everett, who was never the same after dropping to the ground in what became 
known as the phantom sack in the NFC championship game against San Francisco 
following the 1989 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the NFL's new salary cap, Everett's projected earnings of $2.65 million 
in 1994 count against the Rams' total and therefore will undoubtedly motivate 
the team to deal him quickly. Miller will cost the Rams $2.4 million this 
season: $2.1-million base salary and a $900,000 signing bonus prorated over 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller considers himself a long-time Rams fan, although he moved to Eugene at 
age 10. 
</P>
<P>
 "I met Coach Chuck Knox at a Punt, Pass and Kick contest when the Rams played 
the 49ers," Miller said. "I grew up following James Harris, Jack Youngblood, 
and yeah, what's the name of that guy who wore No. 18 -- Roman Gabriel." 
</P>
<P>
 Knox said he recalled the on-field meeting with the 9-year-old Miller and said 
he came into contact with Miller later at a fund-raiser at the University of 
Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played him, too (when Knox coached the Seattle Seahawks), and I got a good 
chance to see the things this guy can do," Knox said. "I think other players 
will relate very well to this guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller will rejoin former Oregon teammate Anthony Newman, who is the Rams' 
starting safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is somebody who is just one of the guys," Newman said. "He's a great guy 
in the locker room, and I've seen what he can do on the field. He's just an 
incredibly accurate passer. I've played with him and against him, and I can 
tell you I'm glad he's on our side." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have insisted that Miller remain in Anaheim during the off-season to 
work on his knee and learn their offensive system. He was criticized in 
Atlanta, after becoming the team's first-round pick in 1987, for showing more 
interest in golf than off-season football workouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a bunch of bull," said Miller, who has shot 75 at Augusta National, 
site of the Masters. "I made all the workouts I was supposed to make the past 
three years. I think there's plenty of time to get your work done and then go 
and tee it up."

MEASURE IS NO GUARANTEE OF CUT IN VIOLENCE 
</P>

 With its new law aimed at repeat felons, California is launching a dramatic 
new system of criminal sentencing, but no one can say with any certainty that 
it will significantly reduce the violent crime that people fear the most. 
</P>
<P>
 In the "three strikes" law, conservative law-and-order advocates have one of 
their fondest wishes -- a statute designed to send habitual criminals to prison 
longer than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is great," Santa Ana Police Chief Paul M. Walters said Monday. "This is 
really great. It should have been done last year. We have people who are just 
cold-blooded killers." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, its critics say, the burden will be on its backers to prove that such a 
law works by documenting a reduction in violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's knee-jerk legislation," said Orange County Public Defender 
Ronald Y. Butler. "The present laws were strict enough. In most cases, people 
with three strikes are pretty well warehoused anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Naneen Karraker, director of the Criminal Justice Consortium, a prisoners 
services group in Oakland, said, "My neighbors are as frustrated with crime as 
the rest of us. They are going to buy into this quick-and-easy fix. Five or six 
years down the road, when it's not working, they will feel even more cynical 
about our leaders' ability to deal with crime." 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, proponents of the law argue that it will reduce crime. "There are 
certain people who wake up every day wondering who they are going to rob and 
pillage next," Garden Grove Police Chief Stanley L. Knee said. "Locking them up 
will do the society good. The end result will be that our streets will be 
safer." 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, proponents of the law argue that it will reduce crime. Whether or 
not it deters criminals, Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren and others say that at a 
minimum it will remove many career criminals from the streets, thus reducing 
crime they may have committed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is impacting the repeat offender -- and that is the key, the guy who 
won't learn to adjust his behavior," said Jeffrey D. Thompson, lobbyist for the 
California prison guards union, one of the strongest proponents of the new law. 
</P>
<P>
 But some critics of the law say it could have the opposite result. James 
Austin, executive vice president of the National Council on Crime and 
Delinquency, predicts that "three strikes" will almost certainly worsen the 
crime rate by forcing cuts to programs that help prevent crime, such as Head 
Start, medical care and job development. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics also raise the grim possibility that felons, realizing they are 
looking at years behind bars, may decide to leave no witnesses to their crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Few academics, judges, prosecutors or defense lawyers interviewed Monday 
believed that the "three strikes" law will deter many of the most violent 
criminals -- youthful offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not going to have the effect on the first-time violent offender," said 
Lungren, a proponent of "three strikes" who also says more must be done to 
divert young people from lives of crime. "That is a part of the puzzle we have 
to solve." 
</P>
<P>
 But if they are not deterred, Lungren added, "young offenders are going to 
reach the third strike pretty quick." 
</P>
<P>
 David Meyers, acting public defender in Los Angeles, said, "It's not going to 
do anything about crime. . . . Folks responsible for crime are youthful. Young 
people get created all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 As California enters the new era of criminal sentencing, perhaps what is most 
surprising is how little is certain about the impact of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very expensive measure for which nobody has done any serious 
analysis," said Peter Greenwood, acting director of RAND's criminal justice 
program. "It's a real big jump and it's not a well-thought-out proposition." 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some of the possible results, based on interviews with proponents, 
critics and criminal justice experts: The courts and local law enforcement: 
</P>
<P>
 On any given day, more than 1,500 people are arrested for felonies in 
California; 564,416 felony arrests were made in 1992, the most recent year for 
which there are complete statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 The new law seeks to limit prosecutors' ability to enter into plea bargains, 
and restricts judges' discretion over sentences. Given that defendants will be 
looking at lengthy prison terms for crimes such as burglary, as well as murder, 
more probably will opt to go to trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of that will be high. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 5,000 criminal trials annually statewide. Prosecutors and some 
judges say the number of felony trials could double under "three strikes," 
forcing judges to stop handling civil cases and devote their time to criminal 
cases. The Judicial Council estimated that the additional recurring cost in 
courts could top $250 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 As it is, 96.5% of felony cases are disposed of by plea bargains. By 
decreasing the number of people who accept plea bargains by a mere 1%, another 
1,000 trials would take place. 
</P>
<P>
 The new costs will come at a time when counties already are strapped. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although we haven't done any detailed analysis, we think there will be a 
broad impact on county justice agencies, such as sheriff, courts, probation and 
public defender," said Eric Webber, assistant administrative officer for Los 
Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, officials are already anticipating how the new guidelines 
will "significantly increase" costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The district attorney is going to need more prosecutors," County 
Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider said. "The public defender is going to 
need more help and the judges are going to need more. All of this is being 
looked at." Legal challenges: 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Richard Couzens of Placer County analyzed the new law for 
the California Judicial Council. The statute is short, running only five pages. 
His analysis is not yet done, but runs 10 pages. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are an awful lot of question marks," Couzens said. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense lawyers' organization, California Attorneys for Criminal Justice, 
already has set up a litigation task force. The court cases could take years to 
decide. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the likely points to be challenged are provisions that say crimes 
committed by juveniles can be counted as strikes. There also will be claims 
that imprisoning someone who has committed three residential burglaries for a 
minimum of 25 years and possibly life behind bars amounts to cruel and unusual 
punishment. Another challenge could focus on the limits to prosecutors' ability 
to negotiate plea bargains. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, an ambiguity in the new law could be read to suggest that the most 
severe punishment under state law is life in prison without parole, not the 
death penalty. As a result, lawyers representing people facing capital 
sentences likely will argue that their clients cannot be sentenced to death. 
State costs: 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Corrections' $3-billion budget consumes 7% of the state's 
$40-billion general fund. State Department of Finance experts expect that 
percentage will rise, primarily at the expense of higher education. 
</P>
<P>
 By the year 2001, the state expects to spend $10.3 billion to construct 20 new 
prisons -- in addition to the 28 existing prisons and the 12 that already are 
on the drawing boards. By 2001, there will be an additional 109,000 people 
behind bars serving life sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Corrections argues, however, that the law may end up saving 
California money because potential criminals will be deterred from lives of 
crime. Reducing crime: 
</P>
<P>
 A detailed U.S. Justice Department study showed in the 1980s that two-thirds 
of felons on parole commit new crimes. Studies also show that the propensity to 
be rearrested is great if the parolees have more than one prior conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents hope that by incarcerating repeat offenders, violent crime will 
decrease significantly. 
</P>
<P>
 But a substantial portion of serious crime is committed by boys and men 
between the ages of 14 and 24, many of whom will not have accumulated strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 People under age 18 account for a fifth of the state's population, but a 
fourth of all arrests and 30% of the arrests for seven of the most serious 
crimes. Statewide, 19% of the homicide arrests in 1992 were of juveniles under 
age 18. Another 16.6% of the homicide arrests were of young adults age 18 or 
19. Arrests of people age 20 to 29 accounted for 38.9%. 
</P>
<P>
 Austin, of the National Council on Crime and Delinquency, said of the 
possibility of deterrence: "It may work for you or me. We have a lot to lose. 
We have a job, home, family. But these young men don't have a lot to lose."

'3 STRIKES' LAW GOES INTO EFFECT; CRIME: GOVERNOR SIGNS LEGISLATION THAT AIMS 
TO PUT HABITUAL FELONS BEHIND BARS FOR LIFE. HE CALLS IT ONLY A FIRST STEP 
TOWARD TOUGHER MEASURES AGAINST CRIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Brushing aside criticisms of its cost and potential flaws, Gov. Pete Wilson on 
Monday signed what he called the toughest and most sweeping criminal sentencing 
law in the state's history, the "three strikes" bill that is aimed at putting 
habitual felons behind bars for life. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, in a ceremony outside the Los Angeles Police Department's Hollywood 
Division, said the bill should send a message to the worst of California's 
criminals: "You'd better start finding a new line of work because we're going 
to start turning career criminals into career inmates." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Republican governor, seeking to build upon the momentum created by 
public outrage over crime, said the "three strikes" measure is only the first 
step in what could be a comprehensive program to toughen the state's crime 
laws. He urged lawmakers to do more. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments after Wilson signed the bill, the man credited with spearheading its 
passage began submitting the last of an estimated 800,000 signatures that are 
expected to place a nearly identical proposal on the state ballot in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Reynolds, a Fresno photographer whose daughter was killed by a repeat 
felon in 1992, said he is following through with his "three strikes and you're 
out" initiative because he does not want the Legislature to tamper with the law 
Wilson signed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are in a position to unravel everything that's been done here," Reynolds 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new law requires a sentence of 25 years to life for any felon who has 
committed two prior violent or serious felonies -- crimes that range from 
burglary and arson to rape and murder. Those convicted of a second violent or 
serious felony would receive a sentence twice as long as what is now on the 
books. 
</P>
<P>
 The law also limits plea bargaining and requires that convicts be permitted to 
reduce their sentences by no more than 20% with credits for working or 
attending school while in prison. Until now, inmates could cut their sentences 
in half with such credits. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill's sponsors say it gives California the toughest sentencing law in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The emergency measure took effect at 2:45 p.m. Monday when it was received and 
recorded by the secretary of state's office after the bill was shuttled from 
Los Angeles to Sacramento by a top Wilson aide. By day's end, it was all but 
certain that the first of the repeat felons who will be sentenced under the law 
already was in custody. 
</P>
<P>
 The Corrections Department reports that the new law will lead to a massive 
prison building boom -- 20 more penitentiaries by the end of the decade -- and 
eventually increase operating costs by more than $2 billion a year. The state 
spends about $3 billion annually to run 28 prisons that house about 120,000 
inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the measure attracted anticipated criticism from criminal defense 
lawyers and civil libertarians, it also was opposed by some prosecutors, 
including Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking for Garcetti, Assistant Dist. Atty. R. Dan Murphy said his office had 
reservations about the bill and would have preferred another, narrower measure 
proposed in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is now the law," he said. "We fully intend to enforce it." 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy said the major concern of the district attorney's office is that the 
law would further clog an overcrowded court system. With passage of the law, 
Murphy said those charged with serious crimes will be far less likely to plead 
guilty because it would mean being that much closer to a life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "The consequences of pleading guilty are much greater," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said similar fears have been voiced before the passage of other major 
crackdowns on crime, including the "victims bill of rights" in 1982 and the 
"speedy trial" initiative in 1990, and have been unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also said the measure's potential costs have been exaggerated because 
the estimates do not consider savings from a reduction in crime brought about 
by locking up repeat felons for longer terms. Those behind bars cannot commit 
more crimes, Wilson said, and others on the streets might be deterred by fear 
of the longer sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm convinced that if we are sending clear messages to career criminals, we 
will begin to see them reform their conduct," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the costs are huge, Wilson said, he believes the price will be worth 
it. He compared the construction of new prisons to the building of the 
University of California and the State Water Project, two endeavors from an 
earlier era that often are cited as examples of the vision of Wilson's 
predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
 Like those projects, the new prisons will be financed with bonds, similar to a 
mortgage paid off over 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're producing . . . capital improvements for future generations, and they 
rightly can be called upon to help pay for it," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Wilson, Monday was the climax of years spent advocating tougher criminal 
justice laws, which he championed as mayor of San Diego, as a U.S. senator and 
as a candidate for governor. Although his reelection campaign officially opens 
today, the bill signing ceremony had all the trappings of a political event. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson signed the measure on a small table in the parking lot at the Police 
Department's Hollywood division, which he said was chosen because it had the 
city's highest rate of violent crime last year. He sat in front of a police 
wagon, flanked by black-and-white squad cars and ringed by uniformed officers. 
</P>
<P>
 With Wilson were Reynolds and the bill's two legislative sponsors, Assemblymen 
Bill Jones, a Republican, and Jim Costa, a Democrat, both from Fresno. Atty. 
Gen. Dan Lungren also attended, with representatives from several crime victims 
groups and Rep. Michael Huffington, a Santa Barbara Republican who has helped 
pay for the "three strikes" initiative campaign and is a candidate for the U.S. 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing behind Wilson, and watching from a distance, was Don Novey, president 
of the state's prison guards union, which will grow along with any increase in 
the inmate population. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson strategists have said the governor's campaign will focus on crime as 
one of three main issues. The public in recent polls has placed the matter at 
or near the top of the political agenda. The governor said he has no intention 
of letting up on the Legislature simply because the "three strikes" bill is now 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the threat of Reynolds' initiative became real after 12-year-old Polly 
Klaas was slain last year in Northern California, the "three strikes" bill was 
languishing in the Legislature, unable to move past its first committee. 
Reynolds, Wilson said, helped lawmakers see the light, "or at least feel the 
heat." 
</P>
<P>
 Now the governor is calling for the passage of other bills that would put 
first-time rapists and child molesters in prison for life without the 
possibility of parole, expand the death penalty, make it easier to try 
juveniles as adults, and further limit the use of credits to reduce sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the beginning, not the end," Wilson said. "The Legislature must 
finish the job." 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer J. Michael Kennedy contributed to this article. Getting 
Tough 
</P>
<P>
 The "three strikes" law signed Monday by Gov. Pete Wilson gives California one 
of the toughest sentencing laws in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 THE LAW'S PROVISIONS 
</P>
<P>
 * 80% rule: Anyone convicted of a violent or serious felony must serve at 
least 80% of the sentence, up from 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 * Second strike: Anyone convicted to second serious or violent felony must be 
sentenced to twice the former prison. 
</P>
<P>
 * Third strike: After two convictions for serious or violent felonies, 
conviction on any third felony requires a minimum term of 25 years to life. 
</P>
<P>
 THE IMPACT OF GOVERNMENT 
</P>
<P>
 * Courts: Prosecutors say the law will further clog courts because those 
charged with serious crimes are less likely to plead guilty in the face of life 
sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 * Prisons: By 2001, state corrections experts predict, more than 20 prisons 
will have to be built to house 100,000 more criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cost: The estimated $21 billion needed to build prisons is likely to be 
financed by state borrowing. The billions in annual operating costs will take 
away from other state government programs, such as higher education.

MAYOR CALLS FOR MAJOR OVERHAUL OF CITY HALL; REFORM: IN STATE OF CITY ADDRESS, 
RIORDAN CITES 'WORST FISCAL CRISIS IN CITY'S MODERN HISTORY.' HE VOWS NO TAX 
HIKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his first State of the City address, Mayor Richard Riordan on Monday called 
for a top-to-bottom overhaul of City Hall, saying residents should be prepared 
for a searing and soul-searching debate on Los Angeles' future as he attempts 
to depart from the policies of old. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the worst fiscal crisis in the city's modern history," Riordan told a 
packed City Council chamber. "We will have tough choices, painful choices, 
choices that will impact our daily lives." 
</P>
<P>
 The speech, delayed because of the Northridge earthquake, did not detail 
specifics of the austerity budget Riordan will propose next month. But the 
mayor reiterated many of his familiar refrains -- privatization, consolidation 
and squeezing more money from city departments. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Riordan sounded an upbeat note and promised not to raise 
taxes or neglect the city's parks, libraries and infrastructure while he 
amasses funds to put more police officers on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Driving his proposals, Riordan said, will be the report released last month by 
his special advisory committee for fiscal reform. The group of business leaders 
concluded that as much as $1 billion in new revenues and cost savings could be 
obtained from city operations over the next five years if officials attack 
waste and inefficiency in City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The State of the City speech, although an annual city tradition, was sometimes 
skipped during former Mayor Tom Bradley's long tenure. Riordan's aides have 
been preparing the text of his speech for months, viewing it as an opportunity 
to set the tone for the rough-and-tumble debates expected once Riordan lays out 
his first budget on April 20. 
</P>
<P>
 'This is the mayor's management philosophy," said David Novak, Riordan's 
communications director. "We've heard a number of these proposals before. Today 
we hear them all in one place." 
</P>
<P>
 So well-scripted was the presentation that the mayor's TelePrompter even told 
him when to sip from his glass of water. Still, Riordan frequently deviated 
from the text that scrolled up before him, inserting his own remarks amid the 
prepared ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking to cut red tape, Riordan called for a survey to gauge whether city 
employees are providing adequate service to residents. He also proposed 
management reviews to better judge the performances of the city's top brass. 
</P>
<P>
 "Give people the power to make decisions, to make mistakes, to correct them 
and they will amaze you with what they accomplish," the former businessman 
said. "We must fix the system." 
</P>
<P>
 Attracting and keeping businesses in the region is another priority, Riordan 
said, proposing that officials issue permits by fax, carry 24-hour beepers and 
streamline regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Without offering specifics, Riordan repeated his desire to tap into funds at 
the semiautonomous departments overseeing the airport, harbor and utilities. He 
also vowed to continue his controversial efforts to reform employee pension 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
 When the remarks were over, members of the City Council, the body that will 
decide the outcome of Riordan's initiatives, offered varying degrees of support 
and skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
 Some members praised Riordan's call for reform in city government, while 
others expressed dissatisfaction with the speech's lack of specifics and 
suggested that the mayor was holding back on the details of his controversial 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the most substantive and meaningful State of the City address in the 
23 years I've been on the City Council," Councilman Joel Wachs said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Richard Alarcon countered: "It didn't go into the nuts and 
bolts. There are a lot of questions that we still must answer." Specifically, 
Alarcon said he wished the mayor had provided more details of his plan to 
privatize city operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The union representing the city's rank-and-file police officers complained 
that the mayor squandered an opportunity to show his commitment to settling 
negotiations over salary and work conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very disappointed that the mayor mentioned nothing about a new 
contract for police officers," said Geoffrey Garfield, a former Riordan aide 
who is a spokesman for the Police Protective League. "This has to be a No. 1 
priority. To talk about crime and not mention the contract is really to ignore 
a major problem the city is facing." 
</P>
<P>
 Contract talks continued Monday and the police union said it was holding off 
temporarily on its threat to send a video to tourism officials that knocks Los 
Angeles as a haven for crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Riordan's initiatives, from his privatization proposals to his call 
for a review of city workers' compensation packages, are liable to rile the 
city's labor unions. 
</P>
<P>
 County Federation of Labor leader Jim Wood listened stone-faced, scribbling 
notes, as Riordan pledged to push ahead on a series of controversial fronts -- 
privatizing some public services, streamlining Civil Service work rules and 
re-examining employee compensation and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood said the debate of the mayor's cost-cutting proposals would soon shift to 
the City Council, where labor has a number of political allies. "That's the 
place this needs to be debated out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the day, Riordan said in a meeting with Times reporters and editors 
that he plans to meet with labor leaders in the coming weeks to ensure that 
they are part of the process. Riordan also said he does not expect to further 
scale back city services, a process that has gone on for years. Instead, he 
said he will seek to make what remains more efficient. 
</P>
<P>
 By more aggressively collecting debts owed to the city and contracting with 
private operators to offer some services, Riordan said government can more 
closely approximate the efficiencies of private business. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Riordan said he expects some of his proposals to be opposed in the 
15-member council, where members protect their parochial concerns, he added in 
his State of the City speech that he hopes "reasonable people can disagree 
without being disagreeable." 
</P>
<P>
 "We will be reasonable and responsible employers as we restructure the city's 
work force," the mayor said. "Our responsibility is to make city dollars work 
as hard as the people who earned them in the first place." 
</P>

 On a rocky hilltop in the Holy Land, a slight, bearded American Jew named Joe 
Bazer has found a place where his family can live a religious life -- and make 
a political statement that reverberates across the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of our most important spots," said Bazer, wearing a 9-millimeter 
pistol on his belt and gazing dreamily from his neighborhood of modern, 
red-roofed homes onto the ruins of ancient Shiloh. 
</P>
<P>
 Shiloh was the capital of Judaism for 369 years, until Philistines destroyed 
it three millennia ago, stole the Ark of the Covenant and drove the Jewish 
people 25 miles south to Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Joe, his wife, Daphne, and their three children are part of a 150-family 
community of fervent settlers, led by another American. They court the ire of 
Palestinians and even other Israelis by clinging to what they contend is a 
3,000-year-old claim. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Americans like the Bazers constitute only about 2% of Israel's 
population, they make up 10% to 15% of the 130,000 people who populate the 140 
controversial Jewish settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza 
Strip. Many of those Americans live in the most committed and immovable 
communities of that juggernaut, which has provoked Palestinian anger and 
severely complicated Mideast peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Some are part of the militant far right, which experts say includes several 
hundred extremists such as settler Baruch Goldstein, the Brooklyn-born 
physician who killed more than 40 Palestinians, then was himself killed, in a 
mosque last month. Goldstein and others like him were inspired by Meir Kahane, 
the radical rabbi who founded the Jewish Defense League in the United States 
and was assassinated in New York four years ago. An Israeli offshoot of the JDL 
known as Kach, of which Goldstein was a member, receives 70% of its funding 
from supporters in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 But many other Americans in the settlements, such as the Bazers, also burn 
with nationalist and religious fervor. They came to Israel not only to practice 
their religion among the faithful but also to make a statement by moving onto 
what they call the "biblical lands of Israel" that lie outside the nation's 
internationally recognized borders. Those territories, where 2 million 
Palestinians live, were captured by Israel in 1967 in the Six-Day War. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans in the occupied territory play an important and largely unheralded 
role in the Jewish settlements, and they are frequently the most outspoken 
leaders in their settler communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Although few of them advocate violence against their Palestinian neighbors, 
nearly all are prepared to defend their land with deadly force, if necessary. 
And they are vowing to strongly resist any attempt by the Israeli government to 
move them as part of current peace talks with the Palestine Liberation 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 These Americans don't condone the massacre carried out by another American in 
Hebron. But they don't condemn it either. 
</P>
<P>
 In Shiloh, some Americans say they can understand how a man like Goldstein, 
who had seen Jews injured and killed by Palestinian terrorists, could have been 
driven to the act he committed. And a few of them suggested recently that 
Goldstein's victims were probably armed with axes that they intended to use on 
Jewish settlers. (There is no evidence to support that contention, though the 
Hebron region is a flash point for Palestinian as well as Jewish radicals.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel bad, sure, to some extent" about what Goldstein did, Bazer said. "But 
I feel more bad for things that have happened to Jews." 
</P>
<P>
 Daphne Bazer, 33, added as she cradled their 2-month-old daughter: "I'm sorry, 
but I can't feel sorry for them (the Palestinians). Let them move to another 
country. Give them money and tell them to go there." 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since the state of Israel was created in 1948, American Jews have been 
coming, helping to swell the country's population to 5.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1960s, many American immigrants were liberal, anti-war activists 
who are now an important part of the left in Israel's broad political spectrum. 
But in the mid-1970s, Israel attracted many modern Orthodox Jews who were 
seeking an opportunity to live the "Torah life" that was sometimes difficult in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of that last group emerged the intensely nationalistic people who created 
Shiloh and other settler communities in the West Bank and Gaza as a way of 
staking a claim on biblical landmarks and cities outside Israel's sovereign 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Era Rapaport, born in Brooklyn, N.Y., was one of the first settlers in Shiloh. 
For more than two years, Rapaport and his Israeli-born wife, Orit, lived 
without telephones, paved streets or electricity. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Shiloh has all that and more in a compound atop one of the Mountains of 
Ephraim, behind a gate guarded by community volunteers with rifles. There is a 
yeshiva, where 150 young men from all over the world study; a school; two 
carpentry shops; a silver shop; a laser printing company; an aluminum factory; 
medical and dental clinics, and grocery stores. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rapaports have seven children. Era is the town's paid administrator, 
working from a cluttered office in a trailer home and taking turns doing guard 
duty and driving the town ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm here on a mission," said Rapaport, 48, a tall, gregarious man with a 
wild, gray-tinged beard. "I feel that I'm part of a chain that goes back 3,300 
years. I'm following the biblical commandment to settle the land of Israel." 
</P>
<P>
 And, he added with a rueful laugh, "It's because of people like me and others 
in this community, who are unwilling to leave, that the Mideast peace 
negotiations are going to be kind of impossible." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the settlements are a problem for negotiators. Many analysts believe 
Israel will eventually be forced to buy peace for its narrow country by turning 
over its occupied territory, which is dotted with Jewish settlements, to the 
Palestinians who live there. But if Israel does that, it will need to move the 
settlers back to Israel or make arrangements for their security. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they come to evict us," Rapaport said, "this government would fall. We 
wouldn't lift a hand against them. But most of the settlers are adamantly 
against being moved. And many Jews would support us." 
</P>
<P>
 There are many attractions in places such as Shiloh for devout Americans. One 
is safety inside the settlement: Their children can play freely in the streets. 
Few residents lock their doors. Rapaport said he lost the keys to his house 
years ago and hasn't needed them since. Residents know their neighbors, and 
they have the comfort of knowing also that their neighbors are like-minded, 
observant Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 Batya and Yisrael Medad were among the earliest settlers here. They met 28 
years ago in New York at a rally supporting Soviet Jews and moved to Israel in 
1970. Yisrael works in Jerusalem for a member of the Knesset, the Israeli 
Parliament, and most days he takes a bus or hitches a ride for the 25-mile 
commute. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think only a certain type of person comes here from America," said Batya, 
who spends her days teaching Hebrew to youngsters at the Shiloh school or 
pursuing pro-settlement causes, including a women's group opposed to the peace 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 That type of person would resemble Batya herself. She believes strongly that 
Jews should try to shape the world as they would like it, in contrast to other 
Jewish immigrants who are happy to live in peace within the current sovereign 
state of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look," Batya said in a still-rich New York accent, "if I was a conformist, 
I'd be living on Long Island." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Medad house the other evening, 10-year-old Aviya and his older brother 
were playing Monopoly on the floor and speaking Hebrew. The Medads' oldest 
daughter looked up from her studies from time to time to ask a question about 
her English homework: "Can you say 'Everybody has their,' or is it 'Everybody 
has his'?" 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he is an American or an Israeli, Aviya said, "I consider myself an 
Israeli." And his mother? "She's an American," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yisrael Medad, arriving home after dinner, said the family tries to live "as 
normal a life as possible," and he doesn't like suggestions by some Israelis 
that the settlers are "some foreign element" of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being Jewish means being as completely Jewish as possible," Medad said. "And, 
for me, that means being here, being defined by my religious beliefs and being 
attached to the land. We couldn't sit in Jerusalem or even Brooklyn and pray 
and think that's being Jewish." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bazers are more recent arrivals. Joe, 49, was a videotape editor at Home 
Box Office and Daphne was an advertising executive in New York when they 
decided to move to Israel three years ago. They hitchhiked around the West Bank 
with their young son looking for a settlement to join. Stranded on the main 
road in the valley below Shiloh, they decided to have a look. 
</P>
<P>
 Even then, the future of Jewish settlements was in doubt. But that didn't 
dissuade them. Attracted by the ideological commitment of the settlers here, 
and by the history of ancient Shiloh, they bought a $45,000 two-bedroom home. 
Now, they have three children and are determined to raise them here. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew what the situation was with the settlements, but we bought anyway," 
Joe said. "We wanted to make a statement. We believe this land is ours because 
we're Jews and the way you show that is by living here." 
</P>
<P>
 He admires the Jews who have moved into even more front-line positions in 
Hebron, south of Jerusalem. There, a small enclave of Jewish settlers is 
surrounded by Palestinians. That proximity has bred radicalism on both sides. 
The Cave of the Patriarchs there, where the mosque slayings occurred, had been 
shared by both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 "Moving to Hebron would have been much more of a statement," Bazer said. "But 
I wasn't ready for that. Hebron settlers are the elite." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all American immigrants would agree with him. In fact, Bazer says, some of 
his relatives in Israel blame him and other settlers for being obstacles to 
peace. "They think we caused the problem, and they refuse to visit us," he said 
with a shrug. 
</P>
<P>
 The uncertain status of the settlements is one drawback to life there. But a 
bigger one is the security situation and, especially, worries about revenge 
attacks by Palestinians angered by the mosque massacre. Bazer always carries 
his gun, and his wife takes one with her when she drives out of town. 
</P>
<P>
 Another challenge for the family has been to make ends meet. Daphne makes silk 
paintings, which she sells in Shiloh and in Jerusalem. Joe does odd jobs; the 
other day he was building some steps for his neighbor. And they both are 
struggling to learn Hebrew, which is the only language that many Shiloh 
residents speak. 
</P>
<P>
 But they have no regrets. Their children are growing up in an environment that 
they believe is much safer and healthier than what they left in the United 
States. They also are free to practice their religion, from observing the 
Sabbath to keeping a kosher kitchen, in a way that would have been more 
difficult in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "And where else can I have a view like this?" Joe Bazer asked as he took in 
the sweeping vista from his back yard. He picked up a shard of pottery from the 
hillside. "Almost anywhere you look, you find something dating back to the time 
of Joshua," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is the future, and not the past, that preoccupies them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope there's a future here," Daphne said, "because I can't think of where 
else I could live."

CLINTON ISSUES STRONG DEFENSE OF WIFE'S INTEGRITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK NELSON and EDWIN CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton, visibly upset that First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton has 
increasingly become a focal point of the Whitewater investigation, issued a 
passionate defense of her Monday, declaring that "her moral compass is as 
strong as anybody's in this country." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never known a person with a stronger sense of right and wrong in my 
life -- ever," the President said. "And I do not believe for a moment that she 
has done anything wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could cite you chapter and verse over 20 years -- plus now -- that I have 
known her when it would have been very easy for her to take a shortcut, to take 
an easy way out, to do something else, when she has unfailingly done the right 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The President's unusual defense of his wife came at a time of rising criticism 
of the Administration's handling of Whitewater and increasingly pointed 
questions about Mrs. Clinton's personal role in the failed Arkansas real estate 
development. The questions are casting shadows over a First Lady whose role in 
the policy and politics of the White House is unprecedented in American 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration has counted on her as a critical asset in the fight for its 
No. 1 legislative goal, health care reform, as well as welfare reform and other 
domestic policy issues. Now, some White House officials and key congressional 
leaders conceded privately, the intensifying controversy threatens to undermine 
her leadership and her credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Washington, if you're perceived as strong, you can get things done," said 
a senior White House official. "But if you're perceived as vulnerable, it's 
hard to get anything done." 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton herself has been "uptight for weeks," sources said, over the 
continuing news reports of cover-up, shredded documents, conflicts of interest 
and other alleged improprieties in connection with the tangled land deal into 
which she and her husband entered in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 She continues to "function OK" at the White House, an official said, adding: 
"I'd say she's showing grace under pressure. She's called a health meeting for 
tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Some Democrats warned flatly that, unless the President and First Lady can get 
Whitewater out of the headlines and off the evening news shows, they will lose 
the already touch-and-go battle for health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, including some leading figures in the congressional debate over health 
care, insisted that Whitewater has not diminished Mrs. Clinton's effectiveness. 
Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce 
health and environment subcommittee, said: "The overwhelming majority of the 
American people side with her on the issue and support her personally." 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton dazzled Congress and the public last fall in her highly 
publicized testimony on behalf of the Administration's health reform proposal. 
The White House, believing that she enjoys greater public credibility than 
anyone else in the Administration, has counted on her to continue in that role. 
</P>
<P>
 But now private White House polls show that Mrs. Clinton's public approval 
rating has fallen below that of the President, although both have ratings 
between 55% and 60%. The consensus at the White House seems to be that recent 
disclosures which resulted in the appointment of special counsel Robert B. 
Fiske Jr. to investigate Whitewater and the forced resignation of White House 
counsel Bernard Nussbaum threaten to undermine the First Lady's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 A week ago, said a senior congressional aide, he would have said that health 
care reform was not in jeopardy. "I now have to admit it does feel as though 
there has been a spillover," he said. "It reached a critical mass toward the 
end of last week and now it's having a strategic impact on other things." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Clinton is right and he and the First Lady have done nothing wrong, 
said the aide, "what's wrong about it is that the White House has allowed 
itself to be overwhelmed by this thing. It doesn't matter what the thing is. . 
. . The White House is not in a governing mode, it is in scandal-defense mode. 
It is not in control of its own work." 
</P>
<P>
 What makes the "Hillary factor" so unpredictable is that no First Lady has 
ever assumed such an active role, both before and after coming to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, conservatives reviled Eleanor Roosevelt in the 1930s and '40s for 
her unstinting campaigns for liberal causes. More recently, Nancy Reagan earned 
considerable enmity for her efforts, sometimes with resort to astrological 
charts, to control President Ronald Reagan's schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 But no First Lady had participated in policy-making sessions at the highest 
levels of the White House. None had served as the leading witness in an 
Administration's advocacy of its policies in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, no presidential wife had had such an active career before 
becoming First Lady. Mrs. Clinton was a lawyer in Little Rock, Ark., while her 
husband served as governor. It is her activities then, when she and her husband 
formed a real estate partnership with James B. McDougal, the owner of Madison 
Guaranty Savings & Loan, that are echoing through Washington now. 
</P>
<P>
 The President and his wife have described themselves as innocent bystanders as 
McDougal drove his S&L into the ground and lost nearly $70,000 of their assets 
on the Ozark Mountain resort project called Whitewater Development Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillary Clinton's role as a former attorney for the savings and loan is at the 
center of the controversy. The White House has acknowledged that, while on a 
$2,000-a-month retainer, she worked with Madison Guaranty on a proposal to sell 
stock, a step that required approval of state financial regulators who had been 
appointed by her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 But it has said that her role was minimal. And although regulators ultimately 
approved the stock sale, the S&L did not carry it out. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus Mrs. Clinton's integrity as well as the President's will be on the line 
as Fiske, the special counsel, seeks to determine whether Whitewater involved 
any wrongdoing by high government officials. The outcome could matter not only 
to Mrs. Clinton personally -- she is said by associates to be concerned that 
legal defense costs could bankrupt the family, whose assets are modest by 
presidential standards -- but also to the Administration policy to which she 
has devoted much of her time. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Blendon, a Harvard University expert on public opinion and health care 
reform, said that the Administration had based the selling of its controversial 
health care reform package on the credibility of the First Lady. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials believe that health reform is such a complicated 
issue that few people grasp its every nuance. Thus, the thinking at the White 
House has been that the public -- and even some members of Congress -- will 
have to "trust Hillary" and make a huge leap of faith. 
</P>
<P>
 To that extent, the continuing distractions do not bode well for the chances 
of congressional enactment of comprehensive reform as proposed by the Clintons.

MARTIN MARIETTA TO ACQUIRE GRUMMAN FOR $1.9 BILLION; DEFENSE: BUYER OF 
ONCE-FORMIDABLE AIRCRAFT BUILDER WOULD RISE TO THE TOP RANKS OF THE INDUSTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a swiftly negotiated deal that would further accelerate the shrinking of 
the aerospace industry, Martin Marietta said Monday that it will pay $1.9 
billion for Grumman Corp., a fading Long Island, N.Y., aircraft builder undone 
by the post-Cold War aerospace bust. 
</P>
<P>
 The acquisition would elevate Martin to the top ranks of the U.S. defense 
industry, with $13 billion in annual sales, bringing it at least even with 
better known rivals, McDonnell Douglas and Lockheed. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have here is a combination that will allow us to become a formidable 
competitor in increasingly difficult times," Martin Chairman Norman Augustine 
said Monday. "We have a team made up of all gold medalists." 
</P>
<P>
 The deal marks the latest chapter of an industry consolidation that is fast 
creating a few monolithic defense suppliers that will dominate the global arms 
market and exert new political clout. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, dozens of plants and tens of thousands more jobs will be 
eliminated around the country. Analysts estimated that the Martin-Grumman 
merger would eliminate 10,000 to 15,000 jobs in states from Colorado to New 
York. Hard-hit California would be spared because neither company has large 
operations there. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin has been among the most aggressive buyers of other firms in the past 
year, acquiring General Electric's defense business concentrated in 
Pennsylvania and agreeing to buy General Dynamics' space booster business in 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a few years ago, Martin was way down the list of major contractors, and 
its emergence at the top demonstrates how rapidly the aerospace industry is 
changing. 
</P>
<P>
 As Martin has increased its clout, Grumman has seen its fortunes wither. Once 
the premier builder of Navy carrier aircraft, the firm's airplane programs have 
died one by one, and last year it formally acknowledged that it was exiting the 
business of building new military airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Grumman will give Martin a strong position in the crucial market 
for aircraft modification and updating, as well as leading technology for 
airborne surveillance systems that Grumman has recently developed. 
</P>
<P>
 Grumman Chairman Renso Caporali said Monday that the company faced a future in 
which it would have increasing difficulty competing against larger firms and 
that it had sufficient size to compete in only a few markets. "What became 
apparent to us was that the world was going to get a lot tougher for people in 
our business and we were going to have to make some changes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Against that backdrop, Caporali said he met a month ago with Augustine, his 
former classmate in aeronautical engineering at Princeton University, at a 
hotel restaurant in Long Island and set in motion the merger that was formally 
approved by the boards of both firms on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of the deal, Grumman shareholders would receive $55 per share, a 
37% premium to the firm's price before the announcement. Grumman shares shot up 
$14.25 to close at $54.125 in trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, 
while Martin shares gained $1.25 to close at $46. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin said it has arranged financing of $2.4 billion, providing a cushion for 
the $1.9-billion deal that is meant to warn off potential rivals that would 
start a bidding war, according to Robert Paulson, an aerospace consultant at 
McKinsey & Co. The two companies also agreed to an accelerated timetable that 
would close the deal in only one month, making it difficult for an outsider to 
mount a competing bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Augustine and Caporali said they have not yet worked out the details about 
which facilities may be closed or even what Caporali's new job will be. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Aseritis, First Boston aerospace analyst, said the acquisition would 
position Martin about even with Lockheed and just behind McDonnell Douglas in 
defense sales. Martin would have $13 billion in total sales, but only $9 
billion of that would be in defense. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonnell has about $10 billion in defense sales, while Lockheed has about 
$8.5 billion in defense sales, Aseritis said. But Gary Reich of Prudential 
Securities ranks Martin as the top defense firm by a wide margin, based on its 
estimated contract awards. Martin has 93,000 employees and Grumman 18,000 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The emergence of Martin as an industry leader marks the first time an 
electronics and software company will outrank the major aircraft manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 For decades, aircraft builders have been undisputed leaders of the business, 
but now companies that can integrate sophisticated battlefield information 
systems are making huge inroads in grabbing defense dollars from so-called 
"metal benders." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Grumman is out of the aircraft business, its technology is highly 
regarded. The firm's biggest program is the Joint STARS, a system that allows 
sophisticated radar images gathered aboard a Boeing aircraft to be broadcast to 
commanders on the battlefield. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Martin, Grumman and the GE unit that Martin acquired were the 
top three recipients of Defense Department research funding, according to First 
Boston's Aseritis. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have a tremendous research capability in that one company now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Martin has been stung by a series of major embarrassments. Three 
satellites built by the former GE unit failed after launch last year. And the 
firm agreed to pay $1 million to NASA following an investigation into 
irregularities at the Johnson Space Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Another trend highlighted by the rise of Martin is the extent to which 
mainstream American corporations have withdrawn from the defense business. 
</P>
<P>
 General Electric, Ford Motor, IBM and Goodyear have all sold their defense 
units in recent years, reflecting frustration with the low profits, bureaucracy 
and vulnerability to federal fraud charges that accompany Pentagon contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Aerospace analyst Jack Modzelewski of Paine Webber said an industry controlled 
by just a handful of pure weapons contractors will raise important new 
political and economic questions for the Pentagon. As the Pentagon has fewer 
suppliers for its weapons, the industry may be in a position to demand higher 
prices, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Martin deal is certainly likely to act as a catalyst for additional 
acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is going to start a whole other round of deals," McKinsey's Paulson said. 
"They need to be done. There is still too much capacity, and it isn't being 
reduced quickly enough. It is the right time. There is still a lot of cash left 
from the end of the Reagan era contracts."

HIGH COURT SANCTIONS RIGHT TO PARODY WORKS OF OTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Supreme Court on Monday gave legal protection to writers, artists and 
actors who parody the works of others, ruling that a song that copies another 
work "for comic effect or ridicule" is generally exempt from copyright suits. 
</P>
<P>
 The 9-0 ruling is a victory for the rap group 2 Live Crew, which five years 
ago recorded a takeoff of the late Roy Orbison's 1964 pop classic, "Oh, Pretty 
Woman." 
</P>
<P>
 More broadly, the decision assures that a work that "mimics an original to 
make its point" cannot easily be blocked by a copyright infringement suit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like less ostensibly humorous forms of criticism, (parody) can provide social 
benefit by shedding light on an earlier work and, in the process, creating a 
new one," wrote Justice David H. Souter for the court. "We thus line up with 
the courts that have held that parody, like other comment or criticism, may 
claim" an exemption under the Copyright Act. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's ruling marked the first time that the high court has spoken directly 
on how a parody is to be treated under the copyright laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue arose in a case that included both a legal dispute and a clash of 
cultures. Where Orbison's ballad spoke of a nighttime meeting with a woman who 
was "lovely as can be" and, he hoped, "lonely just like me," the rap group 
speaks of a grotesque encounter with a "big hairy woman." 
</P>
<P>
 When the song appeared on the album "As Clean As They Wanna Be," the Nashville 
owners of Orbison's copyright sued 2 Live Crew and won a ruling from the U.S. 
Court of Appeals in Cincinnati. Finding little to like and nothing amusing in 
the rap version, the appellate judges declared that a "blatantly commercial" 
rip-off of another work is an act of piracy. 
</P>
<P>
 The lower court judges agreed that the rap version was a parody of Orbison's 
song, but nonetheless said that fact did not protect it from a copyright suit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cincinnati ruling alarmed entertainment lawyers in Los Angeles and New 
York, who predicted that it could "effectively outlaw musical parody." It even 
threatened actors and comedians whose skits rely on mocking the work of others, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a general matter, the Copyright Act of 1976 gives the creators of an 
original work the right to control its use and to profit from re-recordings. 
Those who want to make use of a copyrighted work typically must get permission 
and pay a fee to the owners of the copyright. 
</P>
<P>
 But the law makes an exception for the "fair use" of a copyrighted work "for 
purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship or 
research." For example, a book reviewer or theater critic can quote passages 
from an original work without infringing on a copyright. 
</P>
<P>
 The question in the case before the court (Luther Campbell vs. Acuff-Rose 
Music, 92-1292) was whether a parody can come under the "fair use" exception. 
</P>
<P>
 Souter, in a carefully worded, 25-page opinion, said there is no simple 
formula for deciding when a parody has gone too far and infringed upon a 
copyright. But he made at least four central points that protect parodies. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the "commercial nature" of a song or literary parody is "only one 
element" to consider. He disagreed with the lower court's "rigid" view that a 
parody done for profit violates the copyright law. He noted, however, that 
using a copyrighted work to advertise a product "will be entitled to less 
indulgence." 
</P>
<P>
 Second, copying the "heart of an original work" also does not necessarily 
violate the copyright law, as the lower court suggested. "The parody must be 
able to conjure up at least enough of the original to make the object of its 
critical wit recognizable," Souter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Third, the parody need not be in "good taste" to be shielded. While Orbison's 
song contains the "romantic musings of a man whose fantasy comes true," 2 Live 
Crew offers instead "degrading taunts, a bawdy demand for sex and a sigh of 
relief from paternal responsibility. . . . While we might not assign a high 
rank to the parodic element here, we think it is fair to say that 2 Live Crew's 
song reasonably could be perceived as commenting on the original or criticizing 
it, to some degree," Souter wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth, a parody does not violate the Copyright Act just because it hurts the 
value of the original work, as the appeals court indicated. "A lethal parody, 
like a scathing theater view, kills demand for the original (but) it does not 
produce a harm cognizable under the Copyright Act," Souter said. It is 
important, he said, for judges "to distinguish between biting criticism that 
merely suppresses demand and copyright infringement which usurps it." 
</P>
<P>
 The high court appeared to leave open the question of whether the shield 
extends to those who use familiar songs for comic effects that are largely 
unrelated to the original work. For example, satirist Mark Russell and the 
comedy group Capitol Steps change the words to familiar tunes to poke fun at 
the high and mighty of Washington. Their parodies usually do not mock the 
original songs, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Souter noted that if a takeoff "has no critical bearing on the substance or 
style of the original composition (but) merely uses it to get attention," it is 
generally not protected from claims of copyright infringement. 
</P>
<P>
 In concurring, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy stressed that "a parody must target 
the original . . . in a humorous fashion" to be protected. "Courts should not 
accord fair use protection to profiteers who do no more than add a few silly 
words to someone else's song or place the characters from a familiar work in 
novel or eccentric poses," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In other actions, the court: 
</P>
<P>
 * Shielded judges from most complaints of showing bias or prejudice in the 
courtroom (Liteky vs. US, 92-6921). 
</P>
<P>
 Federal law requires a judge to step aside in a case when "his impartiality 
might reasonably be questioned" but the high court said that a judge's comments 
or rulings from the bench cannot be the basis for a disqualification motion 
unless they "displayed a deep-seated favoritism or antagonism" for one party or 
the other. 
</P>
<P>
 * Agreed to review the question of whether states can tax some income that 
people receive from mutual funds that invest solely in U.S. government 
securities (Nebraska vs. Loewenstein, 93-823). Federal law generally exempts 
U.S. government securities from state taxes but Nebraska says it can impose 
taxes on those who purchase them through other funds.

U.S. EMBRACE OF RUSSIA AS CLOSE PARTNER COOLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOYLE McMANUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration, sobered by the new, more nationalistic tone of 
Russia's foreign policy, is reluctantly cooling its once-warm embrace of Moscow 
as a reliable strategic "partner" for the West. 
</P>
<P>
 In unannounced steps over the last few weeks, the Administration has shifted 
to a markedly tougher policy on international loans to Russia and has warned 
Moscow against military or political intervention in neighboring countries, 
senior officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The actions reflect growing concern that Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin, 
reacting to the unexpected strength of nationalists in Russia's new Parliament, 
may be turning away from economic reform and acting more assertively abroad, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting those worries, President Clinton said Monday that he is concerned 
about events in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it possible that we will re-create the Cold War?" Clinton said in response 
to a reporter's question. "In one respect, it is unlikely for sure, and that is 
the nuclear respect." But "somewhat more likely," he added, is that "the 
Russian people will turn to leaders who will say the best way to go for the 
future is . . . the reimposition of some sort of empire." 
</P>
<P>
 "The United States has worked with and supported President Yeltsin because we 
believe that he followed policies supporting democracy, supporting reform and 
supporting respect for the territorial integrity of Russia's neighbors -- all 
three things," Clinton said pointedly. "That is still our policy. We are 
interested in supporting those things." 
</P>
<P>
 Aides said Clinton still considers aid for Russia one of his top foreign 
priorities and still hopes to work with Yeltsin as an ally rather than a rival 
in post-Cold War battle zones such as Georgia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Moreover, 
a senior official noted, "all the alternatives to Yeltsin are much worse." 
</P>
<P>
 But after a yearlong honeymoon in which Clinton and his aides extolled Yeltsin 
as a peerless democratic reformer, they have begun refocusing their rhetoric -- 
and actions -- on the policies they wish Yeltsin would follow. And they are 
growing resigned to a warier, bumpier relationship in which the United States 
and Russia are partners on some days, rivals on others. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question that . . . we have hit a more difficult patch," a White 
House official said. "Some people had gotten a little romantic about the 
possibilities of this relationship. But it's becoming more mature, and less 
romantic, on both sides." 
</P>
<P>
 What has happened, U.S. and Russian officials said, is that Russia's 
politicians have rediscovered the political power of nationalism -- and have 
concluded that cooperating with America brought them relatively little in 
benefits. Russia's parliamentary election in December, in which radical 
nationalist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky won far more votes than expected, pushed 
Yeltsin and his government abruptly toward tougher assertions of Russia's 
status as a great power. 
</P>
<P>
 But even before the election, Yeltsin was moving in the same direction. He 
warned the West bluntly against admitting Poland and other East European 
countries into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, saying Russia would 
oppose any alliance unless it was also invited in. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin asserted his right to intervene in neighboring countries that were 
part of the former Soviet Union, saying the fate of ethnic Russians there was a 
"domestic affair." And Russia injected itself into efforts to stop the Bosnian 
war without consulting with the United States, raising fears that Moscow's 
efforts could interfere with Western initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 All that, plus the arrest last month of a CIA official accused of spying for 
Russia, prompted some Administration critics to declare the earlier policy 
bankrupt. "We cannot be thinking in terms of a partnership," said Sen. Richard 
G. Lugar (R-Ind.), former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
"We really have a very strenuous rivalry going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton rejected that conclusion, arguing that the United States should 
continue sending economic aid to Moscow because a stable Russia is in America's 
interest. Further, senior officials added, Russia's bark in foreign policy has 
been worse than her bite. On most major issues, the two countries are still 
cooperating nicely. Still, the Administration has quietly taken steps in 
response to Russian moves over the last three months: 
</P>
<P>
 * U.S. officials have toughened warnings against Russian military action in 
former Soviet areas, including a line in Clinton's State of the Union address 
insisting that if Russian troops operate in neighboring states, they do so only 
when those states agree to their presence. 
</P>
<P>
 * Officials privately complained to the Russians about their diplomacy in 
Bosnia. Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev told Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher last week that he would try to consult more fully. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk visited the White House last week and 
Georgian President Eduard A. Shevardnadze visited Monday -- in part, some 
officials said, to signal to Moscow that the United States will support those 
countries' independence against any Russian pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the key issue of economic aid, America, once the leading proponent of 
large-scale loans to Russia from the International Monetary Fund and other 
financial institutions, has joined European countries and Japan in demanding 
concrete reform in Moscow before more such money flows. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States will continue its program of direct aid to support new 
private enterprises and democratic institutions in Russia, officials said. But 
as for major aid to the Russian government, "we're going to wait and see," a 
senior official said. "If there are reforms, we will push. If not, I don't 
think you'll see us pushing." 
</P>
<P>
 The direct U.S. aid program may not be as large as once projected. The 
Administration has sent Congress a request for $900 million for the next fiscal 
year, well below this year's $2.5 billion. Earlier, officials said they might 
well ask for more aid if Russian reforms continued. But now, "we're fairly 
comfortable with the $900 million," said one. 
</P>
<P>
 But those changes are not enough for some critics; they assert the 
Administration is still too blindly attached to both Russia and Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our approach . . . has been characterized by sloganeering, wishful thinking 
and a romantic attachment to Russia," complained Zbigniew Brzezinski, national 
security adviser to former President Jimmy Carter. "I think the Administration 
is beginning to realize that its policy is floundering, is unsound, but is very 
reluctant to face that fact."

MOSTAR'S MUSLIMS, CROATS MEET U.N. ARMS DEADLINE; BALKANS: TANKS, ARTILLERY ARE 
PULLED BACK. EVEN SMALL WEAPONS ARE SILENT. CITIZENS CAN SAFELY STROLL THE 
STREETS. 
</P>

<P>
 Exhausted by a conflict that has shattered both sides, Bosnia's Muslims and 
Croats eagerly capitulated Monday to a U.N. deadline for withdrawing heavy 
weapons from central Bosnian war zones. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials in this ethnically divided, devastated front-line city said 
they were satisfied that the Muslim-led government forces and Croatian fighters 
had pulled back tanks and howitzers from a long, serpentine exclusion zone or 
surrendered them to U.N. containment. 
</P>
<P>
 More surprising to many of the war-weary residents of Mostar has been the 
virtual halt in small-arms fire. This has allowed civilians to creep out of 
their cellars and stroll the debris-strewn streets with a modicum of security 
for the first time in almost a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all hoping this is really peace. It's so much better now that we can go 
outside and take a walk with our children without worrying we'll be killed," 
said Zaklina Juric, drinking up the early spring sunshine with her two 
toddlers. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people here, Croats on the west bank and Muslims expelled to the east, 
remain highly skeptical that the bloodletting is over. They harbor deep 
resentment over the senseless killing and destruction that has ruined so many 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
 But coming on the heels of a cease-fire in the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, that 
has lasted almost four weeks, the sudden calm along this most bitter fault line 
between Bosnia's Croats and Muslims has added momentum to the search for an 
overall settlement of the 2-year-old Bosnian conflict. It has raised the first 
serious hopes among civilians that their suffering may be drawing to an end. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations between Bosnian and Croatian officials on the terms of a new 
confederation agreed to in principle in Washington last week were reported by 
American mediators to be making progress as they got under way in Vienna, a 
further sign the political leaders are genuinely working toward peace. 
</P>
<P>
 And in northern Bosnia, U.N. troops from Sweden and Denmark pushed through to 
Tuzla's airport with tanks and other hardware, said the peacekeepers' spokesman 
in Sarajevo, Maj. Rob Annink. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrival of the 500 Scandinavian troops was a major step on the road to 
reopening the airport for a humanitarian airlift to feed the needy in the 
largest government-held region left in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian government troops have promised to hand the airport over to U.N. 
operation in exchange for assurances from the Serbs who command nearby high 
ground that they will not target incoming planes. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 800,000 people, mostly Muslims and many of them refugees from 
eastern enclaves subjected to "ethnic cleansing," are trapped in the Tuzla area 
and cut off by fighting on all sides from regular supplies of food, fuel and 
medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic agreed under pressure from Russia last 
week to allow U.N. relief workers to fly in survival goods for the region 
besieged by his forces. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar airlift to Sarajevo has been in operation for 21 months and has kept 
alive the capital's 380,000 residents, who remain cut off from the rest of the 
world by encircling Serbian rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials reported relative calm throughout Bosnia on Monday, with the 
exception of the town of Maglaj, where Serbs have been pounding the Muslim 
enclave while international attention has focused elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian Croat army, known as the HVO, began withdrawing its heavy 
artillery a day ahead of Monday's noon deadline, U.N. officials in Mostar said. 
Huge convoys of camouflage-painted troop carriers belonging to the army of 
neighboring Croatia could be seen plying the roads between the central Bosnian 
conflict areas and the Dalmatian coast late Sunday, presumably evacuating the 
troops and equipment Zagreb officials had long denied sending here. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have fully complied with the deadline," said HVO spokesman Veso Vegar. 
</P>
<P>
 Vegar said four tanks and hundreds of other artillery pieces had been moved 
out of the exclusion zone and that weaponry in other hot spots, like Gornji 
Vakuf and Vitez, had been turned over to U.N. control. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he believed the Muslim-led government forces had likewise adhered to 
the truce brokered 10 days ago, Vegar conceded that the Croatian forces "really 
don't have much fear of attack from the Muslims." 
</P>
<P>
 A senior U.N. officer from the Spanish battalion deployed to southwest Bosnia 
said a new atmosphere has enveloped the region, adding that it is imperative 
for the international community to seize the moment. "From the military point 
of view, this is the first time I see both sides with some kind of willingness 
to make peace," the officer said. "They are tired. They've been fighting for 
two years. It's a very delicate moment, which is why we have to move quickly to 
implement the cease-fire as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 The theory here, as well as in Sarajevo, is that the cease-fires are holding 
now because all three populations are equally sickened by the war and that 
heavy artillery should be swept out or rendered inoperable before extremists on 
any side have a chance to upset the tense, breath-catching silence. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarajevo's cease-fire was arranged by U.N. officials against a backdrop of 
threatened allied air strikes, if artillery remained within a 12-mile exclusion 
zone. After the horrifying Feb. 5 bombing of a central Sarajevo marketplace in 
which 68 people were killed, Serbian rebels acted on the advice of allied 
Russia and mostly complied. 
</P>
<P>
 No threats of aerial bombardment were raised against intransigent Muslims or 
Croats here. But a growing sense of disgust with the killings between two 
populations that have lived together for centuries appeared to compel fighters 
to take advantage of the opportunity to quietly call it a draw. 
</P>
<P>
 "There comes a point where people have to change their minds, whether they 
want to or not," said Braco Bracic, a 48-year-old soldier on the HVO side. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the latest peacemaking ventures, more than 200,000 Bosnians had been 
killed and 2 million made homeless in the conflict.

NEW MEASURE TO HELP VALLEY, OFFICIALS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER and THOM MROZEK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 They may not live in the most crime-ridden corner of California, but 
violence-weary residents of the San Fernando Valley will surely benefit from 
the "three strikes, and you're out" legislation signed into law Monday by Gov. 
Pete Wilson, local law enforcement officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police, prosecutors and even judges said they were unfamiliar with the fine 
points of the final version of the bill, approved last week by the state 
Senate, which is still considering four similar measures that were also passed 
by the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 Some have opposed the law as unworkable, too expensive and too Draconian a 
penalty for many repeat, nonviolent offenders. But now that it is law, they 
vowed to immediately begin studying it, and using it, as a tool for keeping the 
Valley's most violent offenders off the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 However the details shake out, most of those interviewed agreed that the 
message the new law sends -- that third-time felony offenders will be put away 
for good -- will have a deterrent effect on criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are convicted of these (three felonies), you are gone. There is no way 
to wiggle out of this, plead out of this, mitigate this. You are removed from 
society," said Los Angeles Police Lt. Kyle Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Will it make it easier for police officers? I think so, I hope so." 
</P>
<P>
 Like other law enforcement officials, Jackson said Valley residents will 
welcome the law now that the violence once found largely in the inner city has 
begun to make its way north of Mulholland Drive and into their tree-lined 
neighborhoods. In notorious crimes during 1993, a West Valley woman was slain 
as she picked up her daughter at a Bible study class, an elderly man was killed 
for his Mercedes at a gas station, a pregnant woman was stabbed to death at an 
ATM, and a serial child molester stalked children en route to local schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, head of detectives at the LAPD's Devonshire Station, which has 
jurisdiction over the area where some of those attacks occurred, said the law 
will help police regain the upper hand on criminals and reassure residents, if 
only symbolically at first. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public has no idea how much violent crime occurs; this will cause the 
pendulum to swing in a different direction," Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure doubles the current terms for a second violent or serious felony 
and mandates a term of 25 years to life for two-time serious or violent 
offenders who commit any third felony. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill went into effect when Wilson signed it Monday; anyone who commits a 
crime and is arrested the moment after he signed it will be facing a new and 
harsher criminal justice system. Prosecutors are now barred from entering into 
plea bargains, and judges will be severely restricted in their discretion to 
limit sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 Some judges predicted that defendants will demand trials when they otherwise 
would have accepted plea bargains. Opponents said defense attorneys risk 
accusations of malpractice if they allow clients to plead guilty to even a 
first offense if the crime could later be counted as a "strike." 
</P>
<P>
 Some defense lawyers already are preparing to attack the law, contending that 
life sentences are cruel and unusual punishment when applied to felons 
convicted of property crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Zine, a veteran Valley police sergeant and former City Council 
candidate, questioned whether the law will survive such attacks after the 
societal outrage that fueled its passage dies down. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether "this is just another window-dressing remedy, or really effective in 
reducing the number of predators on the street, remains to be seen," said Zine, 
now director of the Los Angeles Police Protective League, the officers' union. 
</P>
<P>
 Zine said other supposed deterrents, such as the death penalty and the "use a 
gun, go to prison" law, haven't worked because loopholes, political opposition 
and the judicial process have weakened them. 
</P>
<P>
 Another outspoken former police official from the Valley area, Ed Davis, said 
Monday that he supports the concept of the law, whatever its faults and 
loopholes. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said he spent 23 years fighting for better ways to keep repeat violent 
offenders off the streets, first as police chief in Los Angeles and then as a 
state senator. But he said he was rebuffed time and again by liberals whom he 
described as being soft on crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Davis says, the new law will finally allow police and prosecutors "to 
slow down the revolving door" allowing dangerous career criminals in and out of 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now we lock up 100,000 people at any given time," said Davis, a former 
Chatsworth and Santa Clarita resident. "If we have to double that, it's the 
price we have to pay to safeguard us against those who would rape and murder." 
</P>
<P>
 In signing the bill into law Monday, Wilson called it the toughest and most 
sweeping criminal sentencing law in the state's history, aimed at putting 
habitual felons behind bars for life. But Wilson's own Corrections Department 
estimates that the new law will lead to a $21-billion prison building boom and 
a huge increase in operating costs. And some prosecutors warn that the statute 
is too broad and may produce unintended consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents include Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block and Dist. Atty. Gil 
Garcetti, who described the law Monday as "crazy" but promised to uphold it 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti has said that only violent offenses should be considered in the 
"three strikes." Under the law as written, he said, a juvenile with two 
residential burglary convictions who passes bad checks years later could wind 
up in prison for life. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti's prosecutors are largely undecided -- mostly because few understand 
the law, or have even seen it. 
</P>
<P>
 After the state Senate passed it last Thursday, a handful of Garcetti's top 
aides began distilling the complex, five-page treatise into terms that 
prosecutors can understand. They hope to have an understandable memo on 
prosecutors' desks by this morning. That will fall well within the 48-hour 
period in which those arrested after the bill was signed must be arraigned or 
released, said Assistant Dist. Atty. R. Dan Murphy, one of Garcetti's three top 
aides. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Murphy conceded, confusion reigns among prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're boiling it down for our lawyers and distilling it for them, into plain 
old lawyer talk, which isn't always all that clear either," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been working furiously over the weekend," said Murphy. "We don't want 
to have 900 lawyers wading through this five-page bill and coming to their own 
conclusions as to what the law means." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Mike Carroll, who runs the D. A.'s Van Nuys branch, said he 
supports the law. "We look forward to getting rid of our career violent 
offenders," Carroll said. "I would hope they leave the Valley, leave the 
county, and leave the state. We could even have a ceremony in which we give 
them bus tickets." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert L. Cohen, who files criminal complaints in the Van 
Nuys branch, called it "long overdue -- society coddles these people over and 
over again." 
</P>
<P>
 Most prosecutors appeared to support the law in concept, but were unsure which 
of the four versions in the Legislature was going into effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Some were unclear as to whether the third felony had to be a violent crime. 
Some prosecutors -- including Garcetti -- expressed concern that any third 
felony, even a burglary, would lock up a criminal for life. 
</P>
<P>
 Others questioned whether juvenile offenses would count. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it should apply to juveniles because statistically most of the 
violent offenses are committed by individuals between the ages of 15 and 16 and 
about 22 to 24," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Peter S. Berman, another prosecutor 
based in Van Nuys. "It's those individuals that if you can stop their careers 
early enough, you can prevent a lot of violence being perpetrated upon the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 Berman said he believes that the law would have a deterrent effect, if only to 
show whether criminals are aware enough of such laws that some will flee to 
other states where penalties are not so harsh. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Carol Fisch, prosecutor of career criminals at Van Nuys and 
San Fernando courthouses, said many of the people that she is now prosecuting 
would have fallen under the new law. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a couple right now that have prior murder convictions from the early 
'70s," Fisch said, "and they would all fall into this law because this third 
offense would put them over the line, and that would be the end of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Fisch predicted more of her cases would go to trial "because people aren't 
going to plead guilty as readily." 
</P>
<P>
 But in the long run, she said, it will help take the habitual offenders off 
the streets for good. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, employees at the new state prison in Lancaster could be the ones in 
contact with those inmates. Critics of the law say it will keep three-time 
losers locked up far beyond the point where they are violent or dangerous, and 
that society will end up warehousing harmless, aging convicts. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics also raise the grim possibility that felons, realizing that they are 
looking at years behind bars, may decide to leave no witnesses to their crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Few academics, judges, prosecutors or defense lawyers interviewed Monday 
believed that the "three-strikes" law will deter many of the most violent 
criminals -- youthful offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 David Meyers, acting public defender in Los Angeles, said, "It's not going to 
do anything about crime. . . . Folks responsible for crime are youthful. Young 
people get created all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Several judges refused to comment. San Fernando Superior Court Judge Ronald S. 
Coen, chairman of the Criminal Law and Procedures Committee of the California 
Judges Assn., said his organization voted to take no position on the law. But 
it did ask Wilson "to look at the bill and determine the impact that it would 
have on judicial discretion and the number of trials that it would create in 
the criminal justice system." 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Judith M. Ashmann, who supervises operations in San Fernando Superior 
Court, anticipated that the law would generate more cases, but she said the 
situation was manageable. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to do whatever the Legislature says has to be done," Ashmann 
said. "If more cases go to trial, we'll accommodate and we'll try the cases." 
</P>

staff writers Jerry Weintraub and Dan Morain also contributed to this article.

LUNGREN TO TAP PUBLIC DISCONTENT OVER CRIME IN BID FOR REELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren announced Monday that he will seek reelection as the 
state's top prosecutor, saying his work is not completed and blasting his 
Democratic foes as Johnny-come-latelys to the job of fighting crime. 
</P>
<P>
 With polls showing crime as the No. 1 issue in the state, Lungren vowed to tap 
the growing public discontent and promote crime reforms "stronger than ever 
before" to curb gangs, bolster police and aid victims of all ages. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we pursue even tougher policies aimed at criminals -- and we do so without 
apology -- I will also continue to push our societal response to crime in a 
comprehensive context," Lungren said. "We must lead California away from a 
culture of violence to a culture of hope and civility where the rights of every 
person are respected." 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren is unopposed in the Republican primary, but will face one of two 
Democrats trying to unseat him in November's general election -- Arlo Smith, 
the San Francisco district attorney who lost to Lungren by a scant margin in 
1990, and Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove), a former federal prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith and Umberg have taken shots at Lungren in recent weeks, charging that 
public discontent over crime proves the attorney general has failed in his role 
as the state's chief law enforcement officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren responded Monday by suggesting that his rivals, along with other 
Democrats, are recent converts to taking a tough stance on crime. The criticism 
against him, he said, "is a cheap and easy thing to say," but fails to 
recognize his record during nearly four years as attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been sounding the message of the problem with crime in this state; 
I've been sounding the message that the first duty of government must be public 
safety," Lungren said. "It's ridiculous for some of the Johnny-come-latelys to 
say now that they want to get on the bandwagon and replace the guy who has been 
driving the wagon in the right direction all along." 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren made his announcement in an afternoon news conference in Sacramento 
after spending the morning in Los Angeles at a signing ceremony for the "three 
strikes and you're out" anti-crime bill, a law he took some credit for helping 
craft. Lungren said he aided Mike Reynolds, the Fresno man who launched a 
crusade for the law after his daughter was murdered, by making several 
recommendations that were incorporated into the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the other accomplishments Lungren cited were his efforts to ensure that 
the death penalty was restored in California, noting how his office argued with 
federal judges to overcome last-minute delays that held up the execution of 
Robert Alton Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren also said he has worked hard to produce a "comprehensive plan" that 
combines prevention, education and tough punishment to fight gangs. He also 
highlighted his "safe schools strategy" that calls for the optional use of 
metal detectors and other deterrents to campus crime. 
</P>
<P>
 With the state's becoming "a Wild West shooting gallery for far too many 
children," Lungren said he intends to work hard to change "the priorities and 
policies of California in a fundamental way. We can't stop or turn back now."

STATE IS ABANDONING ITS CHILDREN, ADVOCACY GROUP SAYS; PUBLIC SERVICES: REPORT 
SAYS FUNDS FOR HEALTH, WELFARE AND EDUCATION ARE UNDERGOING 'A SLOW 
STRANGULATION.' IT IS CRITICAL OF WILSON ADMINISTRATION, BUT GOVERNOR DISMISSES 
THE CHARGES AS ELECTION-YEAR POLITICKING.

<P>
 State government, from Gov. Pete Wilson on down, is abdicating its 
responsibility to California's 9 million children, especially the 2.3 million 
poor children who increasingly rely on public services, according to an 
advocacy group. 
</P>
<P>
 In a comprehensive report issued Monday, the nonprofit Children's Advocacy 
Institute maintained that when the state suffers an earthquake or other major 
natural disaster, officials rush to provide billions of dollars in relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Lacking a similar calamity to galvanize the state's political leadership, 
children are experiencing a "slow strangulation" of funds for health, welfare 
and education. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the past four years, adjusted state general fund spending for children 
in California has declined in an amount unprecedented in the nation's history," 
said the authors of the 206-page report at a capital news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Diego-based institute, founded in 1989 and affiliated with the 
University of San Diego School of Law, billed its critique as the first 
children's budget analysis undertaken in the nation. The authors hope to use it 
to rally other children's rights groups, lobby lawmakers and appeal to 
policy-makers to upgrade the importance of children's issues in the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilson challenged the findings and the credibility of one of its chief 
authors, saying that the criticisms of his Administration amounted to no more 
than election-year politics. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is what kind of financial help the state should provide for children, 
especially for those who are hungry and homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 The report paints a bleak picture of declining public spending over the past 
five budget years, including Wilson's proposed spending plan for the fiscal 
year that begins July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The state has established a minimum safety net for children but "we're 
violating that," said Robert C. Fellmeth, executive director of the institute 
and a co-author of the report. To make their case, the authors cited a 9.2% 
drop in per-student education spending, a 35% decrease in per-person welfare 
spending and a 7.5% dip in funds to inspect 64,000 licensed day care centers. 
The study based its analysis on figures adjusted for inflation and population 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
 As a consequence of budget cuts, Fellmeth predicted that the state in the next 
fiscal year will lose at least $2 billion in federal matching funds for a 
variety of children's programs, including nutrition and health. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said he won enactment of a slate of so-called preventive programs for 
children and had asked for greater funding for some of them but had been turned 
down by the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are either abysmally ignorant of what this Administration and this 
Legislature have done in the most trying economic times in our history, or else 
they are seeking to mislead people," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson then singled out Fellmeth, saying he would be delighted to debate the 
law professor, whom he branded as "a strong partisan liberal Democrat." 
</P>
<P>
 Describing himself as a registered Republican, Fellmeth said Wilson's record 
disqualifies him from calling himself "a children's governor." 
</P>
<P>
 Fellmeth said the report was not a partisan attack, adding that he believes 
"the Democrats in the Legislature have been just as bad as Wilson." 
</P>
<P>
 Karin Caves, spokeswoman for Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer 
(D-Hayward), said the Legislature has "made big steps forward" to crack down on 
child molesters, improve child custody laws and boost child support 
collections. 
</P>
<P>
 She acknowledged that more needs to be done. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the clearest problems is that we are in the fourth year of a recession 
in California," she said, "and things are very tough and especially bad for the 
weakest and most vulnerable citizens, who are our children."

FRAUD CHARGES ADD JAIL TIME FOR EX-OFFICIAL; CRIME: FEDERAL SENTENCING ADDS TO 
THE PRISON STAY OF STEPHEN WAGNER. HE HAD EARLIER PLEADED GUILTY TO STATE 
CHARGES OF EMBEZZLING $3.7 MILLION FROM AN ORANGE COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge sentenced former school finance officer Stephen A. Wagner on 
Monday to 57 months in prison on federal mail and wire fraud charges, 
effectively adding about 13 months to the time he is expected to spend behind 
bars on state charges of embezzling $3.7 million from the Newport-Mesa Unified 
School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of a plea bargain that Wagner's attorney struck with 
prosecutors, his federal prison sentence will be served concurrently with the 
six-year prison sentence he received from a state judge. 
</P>
<P>
 But because of credits he can earn under both penal systems for good behavior 
and work in prison, he could be freed in January, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing the magnitude of his theft and the harm it had done to a school 
district that has suffered staffing and course cutbacks, federal prosecutors 
had argued for a nine-year prison term, which would have kept him behind bars 
much longer. 
</P>
<P>
 However, U.S. District Judge Linda H. McLaughlin agreed with a probation 
department recommendation that Wagner be sentenced to 57 months. In doing so, 
she imposed a term harsher than the usual sentence for Wagner's crimes under 
federal guidelines, which call for a sentence in the range of 37 to 46 months 
in federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
 McLaughlin also ordered Wagner to pay restitution of $2.77 million, the 
balance of the embezzled money that the school district has not recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 "The amount of dollar loss does not capture the seriousness of the crimes," 
McLaughlin told Wagner at sentencing. "The embezzlement of $3.7 million 
seriously jeopardized the school district and caused the public to lose 
confidence that the district could protect its money." 
</P>
<P>
 The sentence, she said, was based on Wagner's 6 1/2 years of criminal activity 
at the district and his "failure to restore the money or present a credible 
accounting of where the money went." 
</P>
<P>
 Although she would have liked to have the 57-month sentence start after Wagner 
completes his state prison term, McLaughlin said there was nothing in the law 
that permitted her to require that the federal sentence be served 
consecutively, or after completion of the state sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just ridiculous," said school board member Jim deBoom, who attended 
the hearing. "I can't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since Wagner pleaded guilty to state embezzlement charges and was 
sentenced to what many considered a relatively light six-year prison term, 
federal authorities had contemplated charging Wagner with mail and wire fraud 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
 He was charged with three counts of wire fraud and one count of mail fraud 
that were linked to the embezzlement scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal penalties for white-collar criminals are much more severe than those 
that can be imposed by the state. By filing federal charges, prosecutors 
exposed Wagner to a maximum 20-year prison term and up to $1 million in fines. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside court, Wagner's attorney, Paul S. Meyer, praised McLaughlin's sentence 
and her resistance to being influenced by a recent barrage of letters from 
school district officials, students and others who asked for the toughest 
sentence possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "The judge did a very, very fair job of sentencing, and she was able to stick 
to the facts rather than look at the emotional overlay of the case," Meyer 
said. "I am absolutely satisfied that this was a fair sentence."

NEWPORT BEACH'S RITZ BAR STRIPS NUDES FROM WALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB ELSTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The paintings of naked women that hung for more than a decade in the dimmed 
light of the Ritz restaurant's bar are now stacked haphazardly in a storage 
room, a banished symbol of old sensibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Head chef Claude Koeberle said Monday that the increasing number of 
professional women who conduct business with clients over lunch found the 
"centerfold-like" paintings of buxom women, nude from the waist up, less than 
appetizing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a well-established, traditional restaurant and we want to evolve with 
time," Koeberle said. "But I think the world has lost some of its sense of 
humor and flair." 
</P>
<P>
 After a smattering of complaints, Hans Prager, owner of the restaurant on 
Newport Center Drive, and his wife, Charlene Prager, decided a month ago that 
the dozen paintings, each about three feet by two feet, had to go. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a hard choice, Charlene Prager said, to retire the paintings that had 
been part of the Ritz since the late 1970s, when it was located near the 
Newport Pier and attracted Hells Angels motorcycle riders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those paintings were part of our past and we had a nostalgic feeling for 
them," she said, noting that it took the couple a year to finally move the art. 
"But we were surprised at the reaction of our patrons after we took them down. 
We figured that some people would notice, but not that many." 
</P>
<P>
 The paintings may be gone from the walls, but they have not vanished from 
memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Some customers believe that the exile to the storage room was a bit extreme. 
</P>
<P>
 "We liked them, but then again, we are not young ladies," said Patti Walker, 
71, of Irvine, who spent lunch at the restaurant Monday chatting with two other 
women her age. "I think it is all very silly. I have a nude in my bathroom." 
</P>
<P>
 Another regular, Charles Thompson, sipped a drink and said he has already 
begun to miss the old look. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner "indicated that some of the women resented the nudes," Thompson 
said. "But if you question the men, they enjoyed them. And at my age of 70, 
they were a delight." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, such sentiment is not universal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can understand in these sensitive times why someone would be offended," 
said Newport Beach City Councilwoman Janice A. Debay. "The nudes were always a 
part of the Ritz, but for somebody to go in there in this climate for the first 
time, they might be offended." 
</P>
<P>
 In deference to those women -- and a few men -- who complained, Prager 
purchased a series of lithographs by French artist Guy Buffet depicting 
tuxedo-clad bartenders and waiters mixing various drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Koeberle pointed out, the restaurant is not entirely bare of paintings 
showing the female form. 
</P>
<P>
 A dining area just off the bar is decorated with reproductions of perhaps more 
classic, voluptuous nudes by 17th-Century artist Peter Paul Rubens and 
19th-Century French Impressionist Pierre Auguste Renoir. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not nudeless. We still have a roomful of them," Koeberle said, adding 
that the removed pieces of art may be auctioned off. 
</P>
<P>
 Koeberle said the nude paintings had contributed to creating a bygone 
atmosphere before they were taken down. "It is sad, but I think it was the 
right decision."

SMALL PAPER KICKS UP A BIG OUTCRY; JOURNALISM: DETRACTORS SAY THE CALEXICO 
CHRONICLE'S MUCKRAKING IS IRRESPONSIBLE. BUT THE FEMALE PUBLISHERS SEE SEXISM 
AT THE ROOT OF ESTABLISHMENT CRITICISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It is a story of gender clash, inbred politics and a woebegone little hospital 
on the critical list. 
</P>
<P>
 And standing at the center of the real-life soap opera are Lupe and Hildy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been difficult and time-consuming, but we're having a hell of a good 
time," Lupe says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've become infamous in the last two years," Hildy says. 
</P>
<P>
 Lupe Acuna, 38, and Hildy Carrillo-Rivera, 41, are using the Calexico 
Chronicle, a 1,500-circulation weekly, to kick the Establishment of this 
Imperial Valley border town in the seat of the pants. 
</P>
<P>
 The Establishment is kicking back. 
</P>
<P>
 The administrator of Calexico Hospital is suing Lupe and Hildy for libel, the 
mayor accuses them of harming the good name of Calexico, and the manager of the 
Greyhound depot is fuming over the paper's criticism of his station. 
</P>
<P>
 The school superintendent briefly banned the Calexico Chronicle from Calexico 
High School on the grounds that it was too political. The Chamber of Commerce 
is unhappy that the newspaper made a fuss about a chamber-sponsored map that 
shows caricatures of illegal immigrants climbing over the fence from Mexicali. 
</P>
<P>
 Lupe and Hildy -- who are known to friend and foe alike by their first names, 
in keeping with the informality of the town -- receive occasional poison-pen 
letters, mostly anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
 One letter was addressed to "Hildy, you ignorant and racist slut." Another 
accused the newspaper of printing "sleaze" because it dared to run a story 
about an art exhibit of renditions of the human penis. 
</P>
<P>
 Acuna and Carrillo-Rivera say there would be far less fuss among Calexico's 
mostly male officialdom if the newspaper was being run by two men. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just think we're two hysterical Mexican American women," said 
Carrillo-Rivera, the paper's managing editor, reporter and columnist. 
</P>
<P>
 "To them, we're just Little Lupe and Little Hildy," said Acuna, the owner and 
publisher. "They can't accept the fact we've grown up and we're their equals." 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital administrator Robert Trautman and others say the problem is not 
gender but rather the Chronicle's brand of shoot-from-the-hip journalism that 
blends fact, analysis and occasional insult. 
</P>
<P>
 Acuna and her sister, Dolores Lepe, bought the paper two years ago when its 
longtime editor decided to move to Julian in northern San Diego County. 
Carrillo-Rivera was fresh from a failed bid for the City Council and looking 
for a way to stay active in politics. 
</P>
<P>
 The paper has given her and Acuna a forum to do just that. When a city housing 
authority member was replaced, the Chronicle headline read: "Bertha Rosas 
Replaced On Housing Board. And The Political Bull. . . Continues." 
</P>
<P>
 The paper printed a list of how much money certain contractors with alleged 
political pull were receiving for doing housing authority work. After the story 
ran, Carrillo-Rivera said, one of the contractors angrily told her: "If you 
were a man, I'd slug you." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Pat Hashem, who also runs the Greyhound depot, said the 
rabble-rousing is an innate tendency of Carrillo-Rivera, who played with 
Hashem's sisters when they all were youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hildy has always liked to mix it up," Hashem said. "People have a right to 
know the truth, but do Lupe and Hildy have to hammer on it week after week 
after week?" 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest pique belongs to Trautman, an outsider who was hired in 1992 to 
rescue Calexico Hospital, the only hospital in this low-income, predominantly 
Latino community of 20,000 where many of those involved in political life have 
known one another for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 After initially being hailed as the public hospital's savior, Trautman is 
suing the newspaper for running a steady stream of critical and belittling 
references about him and his female companion, whom he hired as marketing 
director. Trautman has been called a "nincompoop" and "rat" in print. 
</P>
<P>
 To make matters stickier, Acuna and Carrillo-Rivera are on the hospital's 
Board of Directors. Trautman said Acuna and Carrillo-Rivera have used the 
newspaper's clout to protect their friends and cronies on the hospital payroll 
and thwart his efforts to recruit employees with medical specialties and 
greater competency. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason our intensive care unit is not open today is that the newspaper 
makes it impossible to recruit employees," said Trautman, 44, who has 18 years 
of experience in hospital management in Los Angeles, Fresno and Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 In one Viewpoint column, Carrillo-Rivera wrote: "Bobby has managed to rid the 
hospital of many Calexicans who have worked there for years and replaced them 
with white faces of people who do not know anything about this area." 
</P>
<P>
 Trautman denied this and added that new employees he has hired have received 
threatening phone calls at home. Carrillo-Rivera responded that she has been 
stalked by a mysterious man in a pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Trautman is suffering from short-man's syndrome: He has trouble with 
women," Carrillo-Rivera said. Trautman's response: "That's ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 Acuna and Carrillo-Rivera are chronically on the short end of a 3-2 split in 
board votes. Despite that, they managed to persuade the board late last year to 
drop a $96,000-a-year contract with Trautman's management firm, which was run 
by his live-in companion from Diamond Bar, Debbie Martinez Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 If the journalists could get another vote, they said they would fire Trautman 
from his $90,000-a-year job. 
</P>
<P>
 Acuna and Carrillo-Rivera said Trautman and Bell have let romantic disputes 
carry over to shouting arguments at the workplace. Trautman said such reports, 
although not entirely untrue, are overblown. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a tremendous amount of tension between Trautman and Lupe and Hildy," 
said board member Robert Noble, 65, a regional sales manager for Western Auto. 
</P>
<P>
 Noble has tried to play peacemaker between the two muckrakers and the two 
other members of the board: a biologist and a clerk of a pornographic 
bookstore. But even those efforts have run afoul of changing social etiquette 
between men and women. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week the soft-spoken Noble dropped by Norm's Liquor & Deli, which Acuna 
owns and runs with her brothers and sisters. The Chronicle office is a 
windowless storage room at the back of Norm's. 
</P>
<P>
 After giving Acuna and Carrillo-Rivera an update on the prospect of the 
hospital's declaring bankruptcy, Noble turned to leave. He said goodby and gave 
Carrillo-Rivera a gentle pat on the head. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you see that?" Carrillo-Rivera said later. "You don't pat women on the 
head like they're children. The men in Calexico just don't understand." 
</P>
<P>
 Noble, in a telephone interview, said he did not remember patting 
Carrillo-Rivera on the head and was chagrined to learn that the gesture had 
upset her. "If she feels that way, I'll never do it again," he said sheepishly. 
</P>
<P>
 While the board feuds, the 34-bed hospital, which for 40 years has lurched 
from one crisis to another, lingers near death. 
</P>
<P>
 State health inspectors, who have the power to revoke the hospital's license, 
are dismayed over the chaotic management. On Feb. 25 the hospital had only five 
patients; local doctors prefer to send their patients to hospitals in Brawley 
and El Centro. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital board President James Donnelly, an agricultural biologist for 
Imperial County, blames the newspaper. "We've told Lupe and Hildy over and over 
again" to tone down the newspaper, he said. "But all we can do is admonish 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the criticism, do not look for the Chronicle to change. 
</P>
<P>
 "My style is to be very blunt and to the point," Hildy said. "That's just how 
I am."

SYRIA RECEIVES FIRST ISRAELI VISITORS EVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of Israeli Arabs arrived Monday on the first official visit by 
Israelis to Syria, but the government played it down, and ordinary citizens 
were largely unaware of the groundbreaking trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Syria, Israel's most hard-line foe, traditionally has shunned any contact with 
Israelis and barred Israeli passport-holders from visiting the country. 
</P>
<P>
 President Hafez Assad insisted the delegation could not enter Syria with 
Israeli passports, saying this would imply recognition of the Jewish state. 
Egypt, the only Arab country that has a peace treaty with Israel, provided 
travel papers for the 58 Israeli Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
 The visit of the Israeli Arab delegation suggests that despite the lack of 
progress in Mideast peace talks, the Syrians do not want to put an end to the 
negotiations.

ARAFAT IN FIRST TALKS WITH ISRAEL ENVOY SINCE MASSACRE; MIDEAST: SECRET MEETING 
IS BID TO RESTART PEACE PROCESS. PLO WANTS NEW CONTROLS ON SETTLERS IN OCCUPIED 
AREAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat held his first direct talks Monday with an Israeli 
envoy since last month's Hebron massacre, seeking in a secret meeting here to 
produce a breakthrough to allow peace talks to resume on Palestinian self-rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestine Liberation Organization officials said they hope that Israel will 
agree to new controls on Jewish settlers in occupied lands and a force of 
international observers to ensure Palestinian security -- guarantees that would 
persuade the PLO to return to the peace table. 
</P>
<P>
 After two days of Egyptian and American mediation, the two sides are 
discussing a package that would include a stepped-up timetable for negotiating 
the future of Jewish settlements in the occupied territories, armed 
international observers in Palestinian areas and further controls on the arms 
carried by Israeli settlers, sources close to the negotiations said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If these measures are approved by the Israelis, it will relieve the 
situation," a senior PLO official said. "It will help a lot. And I think, yes, 
it will bring us back to the peace talks." 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat met with Jacques Neriah, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's 
political adviser, and David Sultan, Israel's ambassador to Egypt. Their 
discussions were the first since the Feb. 25 attack that killed more than 40 
Palestinians in a Hebron mosque. 
</P>
<P>
 Any breakthrough in the impasse is likely to be delayed until Israel makes a 
final decision on the issue of further controls on Jewish settlers and the U.N. 
Security Council acts on a resolution condemning the massacre, officials here 
said. PLO sources said Israel indicated it will have a final decision on the 
PLO's demands by today. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Israelis said they will answer these demands and will send the answer 
directly to Tunis," the PLO headquarters, a PLO official said. "The Americans 
and the Egyptians are exerting a very big effort to bridge the gap. But still, 
there is a gap." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Tunisian capital, the Associated Press quoted unidentified officials as 
saying Israel proposed "nothing new" in Monday's meeting. Egypt's Middle East 
News Agency said Israel has proposed a summit between Arafat and Rabin -- a 
plan Arafat is likely to resist until he is assured, in advance, of Israeli 
concessions. 
</P>
<P>
 So sensitive are PLO-Israeli contacts in the wake of the massacre that the PLO 
issued a denial that Monday's meeting even occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 After a marathon meeting Sunday night and early Monday with Egyptian Foreign 
Minister Amir Moussa and a dinner meeting with Egyptian President Hosni 
Mubarak, Arafat said Palestinians "insist that the Security Council condemns 
this ugly massacre (in a resolution) that provides full protection for our 
people and disarms the settlers." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said that the two sides are trying to reach agreement on proposals to 
help meet PLO demands for more security guarantees and controls on settlers but 
that they remain divided on details for implementing them. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, the two sides are discussing a package that would include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Negotiations on the future of Jewish settlements that could begin as early 
as mid-April or early May, after Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank town of 
Jericho and the Gaza Strip. This is much earlier than the two years originally 
envisioned for settlement talks, although the Declaration of Principles already 
calls for discussion of the issue as part of the second phase of negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Security Council in its resolution would call for international 
observers to guarantee Palestinian security. Though the Israelis might agree to 
lightly armed observers, there is still no agreement on whether they would be 
deployed only in Gaza and Jericho or throughout the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
 * Controls on the weapons Jewish settlers can carry in populated Palestinian 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dismantlement of at least some settlements, in particular a Palestinian 
demand to remove 450 Jewish settlers from Hebron. Israeli Tourism Minster Uzi 
Baram said after Sunday's Israeli Cabinet meeting that more than half the 16 
ministers favor removing the Hebron settlers. Rabin blocked a vote on the issue 
and delayed a decision until next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what is on the table, but there is not one single point that has been 
agreed," said one source. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from Egypt, the only Arab country to sign a peace treaty with 
Israel, have emphasized the need for Israel to move on more security 
guarantees. "Security is not an issue important for the Israelis only," Moussa 
said. "From now on, we cannot discuss Israeli security without discussing 
Palestinian security as well." 
</P>
<P>
 PLO officials have lobbied for more international support for their demands, 
sending chief negotiator Nabil Shaath to Washington, London and Oslo for talks 
with American and European officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaath, returning to Cairo on Sunday night, said U.S., British and Norwegian 
officials have all "agreed in principle on the necessity of reining in the 
terroristic settlement groups and preventing the Israelis from carrying weapons 
in Palestinian cities and villages." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaath said British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and Norwegian Foreign 
Minister Bjorn Tore Godal all signaled "full agreement on . . . and 
participation in (the) presence" of an international force in the occupied 
territories. He said American officials "expressed their agreement in 
principle, but they need some time to study the arrangements and the form." 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat is under pressure to obtain Israeli concessions soon to provide a cover 
for returning to the talks at a time when outrage over the massacre has 
prompted widespread Palestinian calls for pulling out of the peace process.

11 DEAD IN MIDEAST VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Soldiers shot dead two Palestinians in the West Bank and guerrillas killed 
nine people in Israeli-held southern Lebanon as violence erupted anew Monday 
amid efforts to revive stalled Middle East peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Muslim extremists warned that they will unleash suicide attacks on Jewish 
settlements in the occupied territories, saying Israelis will "cry in blood" 
for the Feb. 25 mosque massacre in Hebron. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palestinians were shot to death in Hebron, where the massacre took place, 
after an army jeep was stoned near the town's Israeli headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Four other Arabs were wounded in clashes after the Israelis lifted a 
10-day-old curfew to allow townspeople to buy food. 
</P>
<P>
 The killings, the first since Friday, raised to 29 the toll in the aftermath 
of the mosque slaughter, in which more than 40 Muslims were gunned down by a 
Jewish settler as they prayed. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Gaza Strip, Associated Press photographer John Gaps III, a 35-year-old 
American, was shot in the leg by an Israeli army sniper. 
</P>
<P>
 The army said a soldier and a police officer were wounded in Gaza by a gunman 
in a car who opened up on them after crashing a roadblock. 
</P>
<P>
 In southern Lebanon, Muslim guerrillas killed seven militiamen of the 
Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army when three bombs exploded in Israel's 
self-designated "security zone," security sources said.

MOM-AND-POP BOWLING ALLEYS ARE RELEGATED TO THE SLOW LANE; FOR THE HOLLER HOUSE 
IN MILWAUKEE, THE CLOCK HAS STOOD STILL FOR 86 YEARS. ELSEWHERE UPSCALE CHANGES 
ARE TRANSFORMING THE SPORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Across the nation the lights are going out on the little mom-and-pop bowling 
alleys that once were the center of neighborhood life, but not so at Marcy 
Skowronski's place, where the clock has stood still for 86 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Skowronski is a feisty 68 years old and as the proprietor of one of the 
country's oldest bowling alleys -- and one of only 65 two-lane alleys left in 
the United States -- she has a certain disdain for the upscale changes that 
have transformed the sport of bowling over the last two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "These days you get bowlers coming into those fancy new centers wearing so 
much equipment that they look like they just got out of an orthopedic 
hospital," she said. "And the centers, they're so big you half expect to find a 
washer and dryer in them. Of course, there's none of that in the Holler House." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed not. The Holler House tavern on West Lincoln Avenue -- Skowronski lives 
upstairs, the cozy bar where former Milwaukee Brewers Manager Harvey Kuenn was 
a regular is on the ground floor and the two alleys are tucked in the 
low-ceiling basement -- hasn't really changed at all since her husband's 
father, "Iron Mike," started the place in 1908. 
</P>
<P>
 Skowronski's two grandchildren and a couple of neighborhood kids are the pin 
boys -- a job that disappeared in the rest of the United States about 40 years 
ago -- and the glistening lanes are made of the original pine. Scores are kept 
by hand on sheets tacked to two red bulletin boards. The wooden walls are 
starting to buckle a bit with age, but the facility looks as perfect as an 
exhibition at the Smithsonian, and business is as brisk as the wind that blows 
across Lake Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did we ever think of modernizing?" Skowronski said. "Nah, not really. Why 
would we do it? Oh, there were years when Gene (her late husband) and I were 
younger and we were going to do this or do that, but as we got older, we kind 
of fell in love with the place just the way it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Skowronski knows that the Holler House, located in an old downtown Polish 
neighborhood, is the last of a breed. Like mom-and-pop grocery stores, the 
small family owned bowling alleys are closing down faster than afternoon 
newspapers, the victim of changing lifestyles, deteriorating neighborhoods and 
high real estate prices. Twenty years ago there were 10,839 bowling alleys in 
the United States; today there are 7,250. Manhattan has only one, Newark, N.J., 
has none. 
</P>
<P>
 In their place are multilane, high-tech, family oriented centers that have 
followed the urban exodus into the suburbs. Some, including land, cost $5 
million to build. Scores are kept automatically on video screens; food and 
drink orders are placed on digital devices by each lane and instant replays 
offer coaching tips and the ability to track the speed and angle of the ball. 
To these new, sometimes-corporate operators conscious of image, alley has 
become the unspoken "A-word"; center is now the term of choice, and gutters are 
channels . 
</P>
<P>
 The sport, industry experts say, was hurt by overbuilding during the '60s, 
increased competition for the recreation dollar and the return of women to the 
work force, which cut into women's morning bowling leagues. Membership in the 
American Bowling Congress is 2.6 million, down from 4.8 million in 1980. The 
industry is lobbying to have bowling included in the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta 
-- it was an exhibition sport at the Seoul games in 1988 -- as a means of 
increasing its visibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did bowling go away?" asked Arnold Fogel, president of Brunswick Recreation 
Centers, the owner of 126 bowling centers in North America and Europe. "In 
part, yes, measured against the boom of the late '50s and early '60s when, it 
turned out, a lot of centers were undercapitalized, poorly managed or badly 
located. But it was never knocked out, just stunned a bit." 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1981, Brunswick has closed or sold more than 150 geographically remote 
or unprofitable centers and opened 28 new centers in rapidly growing population 
areas. A well-managed facility, Fogel said, can be extremely profitable: It is 
a cash business with virtually no accounts receivables and no inventory. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of that, the National Sporting Goods Assn. said there are 42 million 
occasional bowlers in the country -- twice the number of runners and joggers -- 
and manufacturers and operators like Brunswick are finding a fertile new market 
in Asia where a love affair with bowling is just beginning.

ROSTENKOWSKI FACES VOTERS AS INQUIRY ENTERS 'FINAL STAGES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. EATON and RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For more than a year, federal prosecutors have been investigating one of the 
most powerful and senior members of the House: Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), 
chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Atty. Eric Holder Jr. says that the investigation is now in its "final 
stages," with an indictment considered a distinct possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators are looking into allegations that Rostenkowski was involved in 
schemes to misuse public funds. Specifically, prosecutors seek to determine 
whether the House post office converted massive amounts of stamps, purchased 
with office funds, into cash for Rostenkowski's personal use. 
</P>
<P>
 They also are investigating allegations that public money was spent on goods 
from the House stationery store that were for Rostenkowski's personal or 
campaign use, and that his office payroll included improper transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 Largely because of the reports, the bull-like Rostenkowski is running scared 
for the first time in nearly a half century of political life as he faces four 
opponents in the Democratic primary next week. Grand jury action is not 
anticipated before the primary election. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Rostenkowski has denied any wrongdoing, invoked his 5th 
Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and hired one of Washington's 
best criminal lawyers, Robert S. Bennett, to mount a defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Rostenkowski's obvious political and legal distress, many Republicans 
and a few Democrats have wondered aloud why the case is taking so long, 
demanding that the House Ethics Committee open a parallel probe. And their 
suspicions were fueled recently when President Clinton literally embraced 
Rostenkowski in a Chicago campaign appearance despite the ongoing inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President put his arm around the prime suspect in the investigation and 
endorsed him in a primary," complained Rep. Randy (Duke) Cunningham (R-San 
Diego). "What message does that send" to prosecutors? 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton defended his actions, recalling that Rostenkowski is entitled to the 
presumption of innocence. And Atty. Gen. Janet Reno said that she has reminded 
the White House to do all it can not to give even the appearance of political 
favoritism in such cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the investigation of the House post office was started during a 
Republican Administration, it has continued with the same prosecutors even with 
the Democrats in power. Rostenkowski's alleged involvement in skimming cash 
from the House post office was implied in a guilty plea last July by former 
House Postmaster Robert V. Rota. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Ernest Istook Jr. (R-Okla.) said that Rota's plea agreement should 
trigger a House inquiry to determine which members of Congress improperly 
received cash for stamps. The plea agreement implicated someone identified in 
the documents only as "Congressman A," but whose stamp purchases matched those 
made by Rostenkowski. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a smoking gun -- it cannot be ignored," Istook said. The House, 
however, voting mainly along party lines, rejected Istook's call and instead 
authorized its ethics panel to proceed only when it would not interfere with 
the Justice Department investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources close to the inquiry speculated that the U.S. attorney may be taking 
more time than usual to strengthen the case rather than letting Rostenkowski 
off the hook, largely because of Rota's potential vulnerability as a government 
witness. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Rota admitted that he lied to Justice Department attorneys and 
congressional investigators on separate occasions to cover up direct cash 
payments to members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors' concerns about Rota's credibility on the witness stand may have 
led them to broaden the investigation to cover Rostenkowski's transactions with 
the House Finance Office and the House stationery store. 
</P>
<P>
 In that connection, Rostenkowski recently sent checks totaling $82,095 in 
repayment for purchases from the stationery store that were "for personal use" 
rather than official business, an action viewed as belated acknowledgment of 
possible misconduct in the past. This could bolster anticipated defense 
contentions that any misuse of funds was inadvertent rather than deliberate.

MANY IN SOUTHERN MEXICO VILLAGES WARY OF PEACE PLAN; REVOLT: REBEL BACKERS FEAR 
PROMISES WON'T BE KEPT. PROPOSAL'S LEGALESE IS A PROBLEM FOR THEM TOO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The government peace proposal to southern Mexico guerrillas, received with 
great fanfare last week in the colonial town of San Cristobal de las Casas, may 
prove a tougher sell in the rebels' jungle strongholds. 
</P>
<P>
 After their first look at the proposal, supporters of the Zapatista National 
Liberation Army here and in neighboring Santa Helena were skeptical. In weekend 
interviews shortly after the 32-point document was announced, they said the 
government promises are vague, with few guarantees that commitments will be 
kept. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks to me as if they are trying to get us to halt the armed struggle and 
go back to voting and naming delegates," said Oralia, an outspoken rebel 
supporter. "Well, we tried that and didn't get anywhere. Arms are the only 
way." 
</P>
<P>
 Zapatista spokesman Subcommander Marcos said delegates to the peace talks are 
visiting communities this week to consult with grass-roots rebels on whether to 
accept the government proposal. The delegates had not yet arrived in either 
Ibarra or Santa Helena -- both villages at the edge of the Montes Azules 
Biosphere Reserve, a four-hour hike from the nearest dirt road -- so the 
guerrilla supporters here had not formally decided their positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Villagers qualified their opinions by pointing out that most of them do not 
read well and normally speak Tzeltal, an Indian language. As a result, they 
found the legalistic, Spanish-language copies of the proposal that reporters 
gave them difficult to fathom. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in a circle of benches outside their palm-roofed safehouse, a score of 
rebel supporters -- including four rifle-toting men in the Zapatista uniform of 
brown shirts, green pants and red bandannas -- listened intently as Oralia read 
aloud the government proposal. Two pages into the document, she paused and 
looked up at puzzled faces. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't understand a word of this," she said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 The laughter grew when reporters noted that they had the same initial reaction 
to part of the reply, which deals with demands for clean elections and 
representative government. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebel delegates said they have translated both their demands and the 
government's answer into the four Indian languages spoken in Zapatista 
communities. But language may prove less a barrier than basic distrust of a 
government that has reneged on commitments for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government has treated us like dogs," said Horacio, a community-level 
rebel leader. "We are tired of begging. All we get is tricked." 
</P>
<P>
 The government is offering democratic reforms, limited autonomy for Indian 
communities, the country's first anti-discrimination law and major investments 
in social services. The proposal resulted from nine days of talks aimed at 
ending a rebellion that began on Jan. 1 and left at least 145 people dead. 
</P>
<P>
 By calling attention to the corruption and desperate poverty in Mexico's most 
southern state, the uprising embarrassed an administration that has polished a 
modernizing image internationally. 
</P>
<P>
 While some rebel demands were for political reforms, most involved basic 
services, such as education, water, health care and roads. 
</P>
<P>
 One point in the rebel demands and the government reply deals with women's 
issues, promising community mills to make the cornmeal that women now grind by 
hand every day, as well as bakeries and child care centers. "We won't have any 
more work to do," Oralia joked. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal includes timetables and transition periods that range from one 
month to three years. Zapatistas here said that while they like the sound of 
many government offers, they want specific details before giving an opinion. 
"Let's wait 90 days and see how much they actually do," said one rebel 
supporter in Santa Helena. 
</P>
<P>
 While Zapatistas were skeptical, villagers who did not join the rebellion -- 
59 of the 82 families here -- were worried. "What does the agreement say about 
turning in their guns?" asked schoolteacher Pedro Perez. He shook his head when 
told that arms are not mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
 Guns and uniforms are far more evident among the village Zapatistas now than 
they were three weeks ago. Tensions between rebels and pacifists are growing as 
supplies run short because guerrilla roadblocks prevent goods from entering the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 Non-rebel villagers here seem far more worried about guns than do government 
officials, who refuse to comment on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was difficult enough to convince people who were prepared for a prolonged, 
armed struggle to start thinking about peace so quickly," said one source close 
to the talks. "The arms will come in time." 
</P>
<P>
 The Zapatistas are adamant about keeping their weapons. "If the government 
wants us to have faith in it, it should have faith in us," said a young woman 
who identified herself as Cecilia. "Our guns are our only defense in case the 
government tricks us and sends in the army." 
</P>
<P>
 Horacio added: "We are never giving up our arms. Even if Subcommander Marcos 
orders us to, we are not turning them in."

MOLDOVAN VOTERS REJECT REUNIFICATION WITH ROMANIA 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Moldovans have voted overwhelmingly to remain independent, dealing a setback 
to ethnic Romanians seeking reunification with Romania. 
</P>
<P>
 Reacting to Sunday's referendum, the Romanian government said Monday that the 
ballot box should not decide the future of Moldova, a small former Soviet 
republic between Ukraine and Romania.The Soviet Union forced Romania to give up 
the region in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 90% of the votes said yes to Moldova remaining independent. Voters 
also approved pursuing "mutually beneficial relations with all countries," a 
reference to other former Soviet states. 
</P>
<P>
 In parliamentary elections a week earlier, Moldovans -- two-thirds of whom are 
ethnic Romanians -- voted for parties seeking closer ties to Russia and shunned 
nationalists favoring reunification. 
</P>
<P>
 Romania feels strong ties to Moldova, whose citizens, a nation of 4.3 million 
people. They speak Romanian with a Russian accent, share Romania's national 
anthem, fly its flag and have a currency named after the Romanian leu. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only history can decide the fate of Moldova, and Romania will take action to 
integrate these two Romanian states," Romania's Foreign Ministry said in a 
statement. It did not elaborate.

NIXON TAKES TEA WITH FORMER RUSSIAN VICE PRESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Former President Richard Nixon had tea with Russia's dismissed former vice 
president, Alexander V. Rutskoi, on Monday and urged the leader of last 
October's bloody rebellion in Moscow on to better things. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good luck to you and good luck to your boys," Nixon told Rutskoi, who was 
jailed for inciting a crowd to attack a Moscow television station in October, 
triggering fighting that killed at least 147 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Rutskoi and other leaders of the rebellion were released from prison nine days 
ago after Russia's new conservative Parliament granted them an amnesty. 
President Boris N. Yeltsin tried -- but failed -- to keep them from being set 
free. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin is expected to see Nixon later this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon, who arrived in Moscow this week on his 10th visit here, is seeking a 
meeting with Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, the Russian ultranationalist leader. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Nixon said the former President spoke with President Clinton 
last week about his intention to arrange a meeting with Zhirinovsky, whose 
party placed first in Russia's parliamentary elections in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton refused to meet with Zhirinovsky during his visit here in January, and 
senior U.S. officials have been instructed to stay clear of the extremist, who 
has espoused aggressively nationalistic views. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon and Rutskoi posed for photographs in Rutskoi's home, and Nixon said 
afterward that they had discussed relations between their countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, Nixon met with lawmaker Grigory Yavlinsky at the Russian Parliament. 
No details of their meeting were available.

 Gov. Christie Todd Whitman signed New Jersey's first income tax cut, a 5% 
across-the board reduction retroactive to Jan. 1."This tax cut is a down 
payment on my promise to cut income taxes by 30% for most New Jerseyans," 
Whitman said during a ceremony in Trenton. The reduction will be funded by 
taking $150 million from a budget surplus account and reducing allocations for 
Medicaid, state employee health benefits and other items by $135 million. Under 
the cut, a married couple earning $50,000 in taxable income will pay $57 a year 
less in taxes, while a couple earning $150,000 will pay $345 less.

 The United States has declared the Mohegan Indians a sovereign nation,

Mohegan lands are about 40 miles southeast of Hartford -- covering about 2,400 
acres -- and are in an area steeped in Colonial American history.

 Former First Ladies Betty Ford and Rosalynn Carter urged that mental health

health care reform."Fifteen percent of our population suffers from alcohol and

years before lawmakers take up the issue of mental health and substance abuse 
treatment again if they fail to include it in health reform legislation. The

 The United Nations marks the annual observance of International Women's Day 
today, at a time when women and girls worldwide face limited access to 
education, employment, health care and even food. Several human rights reports 
said: Women continue to be slaves, spoils of war, victims of mutilation and 
targets of rape by soldiers and outlaws. And many governments either turn their 
heads or tacitly condone the abuses while laws and cultures promote lower 
stature for women.

ASTRONAUTS ERECT SCAFFOLD, PUT IT TO A STRESS TEST

<P>
 Towering over the loftiest ironworkers on Earth, Columbia's astronauts erected 
a scaffold and then jolted it Monday for the benefit of space station 
architects. 
</P>
<P>
 Crewman Charles (Sam) Gemar snapped the thin rods and cylindrical joints 
together on day four of the 14-day shuttle research mission.He subjected the 
rectangular structure -- a miniature version of a space station truss -- to 
electronic vibrations so engineers could gauge its sturdiness. 
</P>
<P>
 After about four hours, Gemar said he was going to "punch the clock" and take 
the rest of the day off. Pierre Thuot took over for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the length of the mission -- it will be the second-longest shuttle 
flight if all goes as planned -- NASA has scheduled time off for the five 
astronauts. Each gets two four-hour breaks in orbit. 
</P>
<P>
 Before going to sleep, Gemar and Allen tested two faulty electrical plugs. 
They didn't mind the repair work -- Allen said it's "a great thing to do on 
your day off. That's what you'd be doing at home anyhow." 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're up here, it's like every day is a holiday and every meal is a 
feast," Allen added. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Control continued to closely watch Columbia's auxiliary power units, 
one of which had unusually high pressure readings earlier in the flight.

RECORDS OF 18 PLUTONIUM TESTS RELEASED; MEDICINE: ALL INDIVIDUALS RECEIVED 
INJECTIONS UNKNOWINGLY. THE DOCUMENTS ARE THE FIRST OF THE SECRET 
U.S.-SPONSORED EXPERIMENTS TO BE DISCLOSED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Department of Energy on Monday released the medical records of 18 patients 
unknowingly injected with plutonium between 1945 and 1947 in one of the secret 
radiation experiments sponsored by the government during and after World War 
II. 
</P>
<P>
 The documents were the first to be released in the department's effort to open 
its files on the series of experiments that were part of the government's 
clandestine Cold War activities to gain nuclear superiority over the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary announced in December that the government had 
not publicly disclosed nuclear research tests on more than 600 people. 
Government agencies are now digging into records to determine the purpose of 
the research, the level of consent and how the subjects were chosen. 
</P>
<P>
 The 18 people whose records were released Monday were all hospital patients 
who have since died. They were part of a study designed to determine how long 
plutonium stayed in the body and how it was distributed. The research was 
conducted by the Manhattan District Corps of Engineers Project -- a code name 
for the government's effort to develop the atomic bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 The study was to have been conducted on individuals with limited life 
expectancy but the documents show that this was not always the case. 
</P>
<P>
 One subject, for example, a 53-year-old man, was the victim of a car accident 
and was hospitalized on March 25, 1945, at the U.S. Army Medical Corps' Oak 
Ridge Hospital for treatment of multiple fractures. He received a plutonium 
injection on April 15 of that year. 
</P>
<P>
 Another subject was a 4-year-old Australian boy who had been brought to the 
United States for cancer treatment. His parents apparently thought that the 
injection was part of his cancer therapy. The child died soon after his return 
home to Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 Other patients included a man suffering from hemophilia, another with 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis -- Lou Gehrig's disease -- and several 
teen-agers, among them a 16-year-old boy and an 18-year-old girl, both of whom 
had serious illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Many documents show that Argonne National Laboratory, a Department of Energy 
facility that is part of the University of Chicago, attempted to trace many of 
the patients for a follow-up evaluation during the 1970s and 1980s and was not 
often successful. 
</P>
<P>
 In a series of letters to the parents of the Australian boy, for example, the 
lab urged them to provide additional information about the fate of their son 
and asked for details about his treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I must apologize for writing to you about your son . . . after so many 
years," said one letter sent in 1987, more than 40 years after the child had 
been treated. "You or your family members may be the only persons alive, 
however, who remember certain things that happened immediately after the war 
and those events have become rather important in some official circles here." 
</P>
<P>
 It went on: "Which family members accompanied the child? Was a family member 
in the room with (him) most of the time? Were you aware of any special 
treatments, injections or special tests? If so, what information was given to 
you and did you give approval verbally or in writing . . . ? Were you given any 
details as to precisely what substances were involved, or what was done?" 
</P>
<P>
 Several responses from officials in Australia stated that the child had 
subsequently died and that no autopsy was performed. 
</P>
<P>
 Some records indicated that many of the patients were not told of the nature 
of the injections until nearly three decades after they had taken place. 
</P>
<P>
 The documents include statements, signed by some of the patients in 1974, 
acknowledging that they were the subjects of a biological experiment. 
</P>
<P>
 The statements included the date each patient was injected and the hospital 
location.

FREEH UNVEILS TOUGH FBI CONDUCT RULES; LAW ENFORCEMENT: GUIDELINES MIGHT HAVE 
RESULTED IN DISMISSAL OF PREVIOUS DIRECTOR. AGENT APPLICANTS TO TAKE DRUG USE 
LIE-DETECTOR TESTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT L. JACKSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 FBI Director Louis J. Freeh announced tough new guidelines Monday governing 
the conduct of all FBI employees and job applicants, emphasizing higher 
standards of ethical behavior and allowing inquiries about sexual activity. 
</P>
<P>
 The guidelines suggest that ethical infractions similar to those of Freeh's 
predecessor, William S. Sessions, might be cause for dismissal. In addition, 
all applicants will have to submit to lie-detector tests on drug use. 
</P>
<P>
 In a directive to all FBI executives, Freeh said that the guidelines are among 
policies he has sought to institute since becoming director six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have determined that we have been too tolerant of certain types of 
behavior," Freeh said, adding that he wants to "draw a bright line which should 
serve to put all employees on notice of my expectations." 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding sexual activity, Freeh stressed that "homosexual conduct is not per 
se misconduct." The guidelines, however, say that any sexual conduct might be 
investigated and evaluated in connection with granting top-secret security 
clearances. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, "an extramarital affair that is concealed from a spouse may 
create a vulnerability" to blackmail or coercion even though the conduct itself 
may not be grounds for dismissal, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new guidelines, officials said, "the FBI will draw adverse 
conclusions if there is an attempt to conceal activities that might make the 
employee or applicant vulnerable to coercion, espionage or theft" of documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeh told his executives that he does not wish to establish "an elaborate 
table of offenses and penalties." Rather, he said, "we must acknowledge, uphold 
-- indeed revere -- core values, such as integrity, reliability and 
trustworthiness." 
</P>
<P>
 To this end, "lying, cheating or stealing is wholly inconsistent with 
everything the FBI stands for and cannot be tolerated," according to the 
guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 The rules seem to suggest the Sessions case in stating that agency employees 
or officials could be dismissed for such infractions as "failure to cooperate 
during an administrative inquiry" or "the unauthorized taking, using or 
diversion of government funds or property." 
</P>
<P>
 Sessions, who had refused to resign as FBI director, was fired last July by 
President Clinton based on official findings that he had abused his office. 
Among the infractions cited were expending official funds on business trips to 
places where he could meet with family members, billing the government for a 
security fence at his home that provided no security and failing to cooperate 
with authorities during their inquiry into the financing of his home. 
</P>
<P>
 The guidelines also provide for suspension or dismissal for the unauthorized 
disclosure of classified or sensitive FBI information. Last December, before 
formulation of the guidelines, Freeh suspended James Fox, head of the FBI's New 
York field office, on grounds that he had commented about the World Trade 
Center bombing case on television in violation of a federal judge's gag order. 
</P>
<P>
 On drug use, Freeh reversed an FBI policy that banned hiring any person who 
had ever used an illegal drug. Under the new guidelines, the FBI will institute 
a polygraph test on all drug questions and will continue to discharge persons 
currently using such drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Freeh said, a new provision would allow some candidates to be hired 
who have stopped using illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The FBI does not condone any prior unlawful drug use by applicants," 
according to the guidelines. "The FBI realizes, however, some otherwise 
qualified applicants may have used drugs at some point in their past."

PENTAGON WILL BAN SMOKING IN WORKPLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The military, which for years has done all it could to keep American GIs 
well-stocked with cigarettes, is about to join the ranks of thousands of 
civilian employers: It is banning smoking in the workplace, the Pentagon 
announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The regulations, to take effect April 8, will eliminate designated smoking 
areas near thousands of offices, hallways and other facilities in Defense 
Department buildings around the world, including the Pentagon, where 25,000 
persons work. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, about 4 million people -- 1.6 million of them in uniform and 2.4 
million civil service workers in the Defense Department -- will be affected, 
making this one of the most sweeping such orders that the federal government 
has imposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials said the regulation, to be signed today by Undersecretary 
of Defense John Deutch, comes in recognition of dozens of studies showing that 
smoking is harmful to health. 
</P>
<P>
 But the ban will not affect barracks and other living quarters, officers' and 
enlisted clubs and restaurants on military installations. "Smoking still will 
be allowed in some areas, but the number of them will be cut back," a Defense 
Department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials said the move is only the latest in a series of steps it 
has taken over the last decade to curtail smoking, drinking and the use of 
illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, for example, the Army and Navy imposed stringent restrictions on 
smoking in the military workplace, including ships, aircraft and offices.

 Still, for years the services bent over backward to provide cigarettes to 
troops overseas. Navy ships routinely announced that "the smoking lamp" was 
lighted. It was out mainly during battle and the loading of fuel or ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
 And until relatively recently, the truly macho soldier was depicted as one who 
chain-smoked. World War II cartoons routinely showed GIs with cigarettes 
dangling from their mouths. The military shipped cartons of cigarettes to the 
front. 
</P>
<P>
 The crackdown in 1986 came after surveys showed that about half the personnel 
in the Army and the Navy smoked, compared to about 30% of the U.S. public as a 
whole. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the Food and Drug Administration suggested that there is "mounting 
evidence" that cigarette manufacturers have been lacing their products with 
nicotine to make them more addictive and threatened to seek to regulate the 
industry if it found the charges to be true.

AVOID HEARINGS, WHITEWATER COUNSEL SAYS; ETHICS: FISKE URGES CONGRESS NOT TO 
CALL WITNESSES BECAUSE OF THE RISK TO HIS INQUIRY. THE CANDIDATE LIST TO 
REPLACE NUSSBAUM NARROWS. 
</P>

<P>
 With pressure mounting for congressional hearings into the Whitewater 
controversy, special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. on Monday implored the 
legislative leadership to avoid such sessions because they would "pose a severe 
risk to the integrity" of his inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske argued that Congress would want to interview the same witnesses, running 
the risk of "premature disclosures" and "tailored testimony." He also said that 
congressional grants of immunity to witnesses would seriously undermine his 
efforts to conduct a full and impartial inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats immediately cited the Fiske plea to ward off the rising tide of 
Republican calls for open-ended congressional hearings into the legal and 
financial dealings of President Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton 
when they lived in Arkansas and the behavior of the Administration during the 
current investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 As Congress sparred over the Whitewater investigation, officials at the White 
House narrowed their list of candidates for White House counsel, with Lloyd N. 
Cutler, former counsel to President Jimmy Carter, and Harry C. McPherson Jr., 
who served as counsel to President Lyndon B. Johnson, viewed as the leading 
contenders. A final decision is expected as early as today. 
</P>
<P>
 The appointee would replace Bernard Nussbaum, who submitted his resignation 
Saturday after a series of missteps on Whitewater and other matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton acknowledged at a press conference Monday that he was told "sometime 
in October" that federal savings and loan regulators from the Resolution Trust 
Corp. were investigating the possibility that his 1984 Arkansas gubernatorial 
campaign had received illegal contributions from a Little Rock savings and loan 
owned by a business partner, James B. McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
 The RTC was investigating possible criminal conduct in the failure of 
McDougal's Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan, which collapsed in 1989 at a cost 
to taxpayers of more than $47 million. The Clintons and McDougal were partners 
in the Whitewater Development Corp., an unsuccessful Arkansas real estate 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 At an East Room appearance with Georgian leader Eduard A. Shevardnadze that 
was dominated by questions about Whitewater, Clinton insisted that he and Mrs. 
Clinton had done no wrong and repeatedly stressed his intention to cooperate 
fully with the special counsel's investigation. Clinton said that he could not 
remember who told him about the RTC inquiry or when he learned of it. Both 
memory lapses could be significant. 
</P>
<P>
 If he was informed that he was named in an RTC referral by an official of the 
Treasury Department, it could represent an improper tip-off from a federal 
regulator to the possible target of a criminal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The timing of the disclosure to Clinton raises another important question. The 
Madison Guaranty case was referred to the Justice Department for possible 
criminal prosecution in late October. If Clinton was informed before the 
referral date, he would have been granted highly unusual and favorable 
treatment not accorded ordinary citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said that he took no action as a result of the information and could 
not be accused of any wrongdoing or breach of ethics. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not covering up or anything; we are opening up. We are disclosing," 
Clinton said. "No one has accused me of any abuse of authority in office. . . . 
There is no credible evidence and no credible charge that I violated any 
criminal or civil federal law." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that comparisons to the Watergate scandal that drove Richard Nixon 
from office are "hysteria" promulgated by partisan Republicans. And he pleaded 
with reporters to reduce the intensity of coverage of the spreading scandal. "I 
am fully cooperating with the special counsel," Clinton said. "They (Fiske's 
investigators) will find the truth . . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 In another day of furious fallout from the spiraling Whitewater controversy, 
aides throughout the White House complex combed through overflowing trash 
receptacles and computer files in search of material that might be covered 
under subpoenas of the special counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last week Fiske subpoenaed nine current and one former Administration 
official to produce testimony and records related to several meetings between 
White House and Treasury officials about Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, in a move that at least indirectly benefits the White House, Fiske 
expressed in a letter to congressional leaders his "strong concern" about the 
possibility of hearings on the Whitewater scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 On Capitol Hill, Democratic leaders used the Fiske letter to rebuff 
increasingly strident Republican calls for congressional hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.), chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing 
and Urban Affairs Committee, quickly responded to Fiske's letter, saying that 
his committee would "defer to your investigation" and hear no testimony on 
Whitewater while the controversy is under criminal investigation. House 
Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.) gave a 
similar response. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican lawmakers expressed outrage at what they called Democratic efforts 
to stonewall their attempts to conduct their own investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) threatened that Republicans would 
hold up the confirmation of Ricki Tigert, Clinton's nominee to head the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Commission, until Riegle's committee agrees to hearings on 
Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Jim Leach (R-Iowa), ranking minority member of the House Banking 
Committee, said in an interview that, while Fiske's letter "looks thoroughly 
reasonable, its implications are chilling for the constitutionally mandated 
oversight responsibility of Congress and for free speech." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, in a scathing speech on the House floor, Leach questioned Clinton's 
ethical fitness. "Whitewater is about the arrogance of power, political 
conflicts of interest that are self-evidently unseemly," Leach said. 
</P>
<P>
 Leach said that the subpoenas issued by Fiske last Friday showed that the 
focus of the investigation has shifted "from possible illegal acts committed by 
a President prior to taking office to possible illegal actions committed in 
office" and that "obstruction of justice is now clearly at issue." 
</P>
<P>
 The White House search for a new counsel to replace Nussbaum included not only 
Cutler and McPherson but also former Watergate prosecutor Charles F.C. Ruff, 
and Charles B. Renfrew, a former federal district judge and deputy U.S. 
attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
 Cutler, 76, is known as a consummate Washington insider and a pillar of 
Democratic politics. He earned a reputation as a skilled White House counsel 
after he was summoned by Carter in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Cutler impressed White House officials with his energy last year when he led 
the forces championing the attorney general candidacy of Zoe Baird. Baird 
withdrew when it was disclosed that she had employed two illegal aliens as 
domestic help and had paid no Social Security taxes for them. 
</P>
<P>
 One Administration official said it would be "painfully ironic" if Cutler 
replaced Nussbaum in the White House counsel's post, since Cutler was the chief 
force behind the Baird selection -- though Nussbaum was often blamed for it.

 City police said Sunday that they were hunting for a quartet of "little tykes" 
after four gun-toting robbers, 9 to 12 years old, shot a man. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Mike Molinari, 29, told authorities he was accosted by the 
children as he left his house Saturday night. The four demanded money and when 
he hesitated, the smallest boy pulled out a pistol and shot him, police said.

<P>
 A Peacekeeper missile was successfully test-launched Monday night on a journey 
that lit up the sky for hundreds of miles. 
</P>
<P>
 The missile, carrying eight dummy warheads, was launched at 7:39 p.m. by the 
Air Force Space Command, said Staff Sgt. John B. Dendy, an Air Force spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The payload was delivered about 30 minutes later to the Kwajalein Missile 
Range in the South Pacific after a 4,200-mile trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "It went without a hitch," Dendy said of the launch. "The stages separated 
beautifully on the video that we saw here. The range out in the Marshall 
Islands reports that the eight test re-entry vehicles blazed in perfectly." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the 13th test launch of a Peacekeeper missile.

RELATIONSHIPS: RISK MANAGEMENT; A THRILL-SEEKER AND A TAMER MATE CAN KEEP 
EXCITEMENT WITHOUT ENDANGERING LOVE, ORANGE COUNTY THERAPISTS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The day after Marc Whisan and Rita Keck had their first date, Whisan went 
hang-gliding. Despite being an experienced glider pilot with more than 17 
years' experience, Whisan crashed and was hospitalized for a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'Maybe this guy's a masochist,' " Keck says. "I couldn't 
understand why anyone would get involved in a sport that could kill them." 
</P>
<P>
 She also didn't understand how Whisan had the nerve to get back in the air 
after he recovered, but she accepted it. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years later, the Long Beach couple are living together and plan to 
marry. 
</P>
<P>
 But no, they won't be taking a hang-gliding honeymoon into the sunset. Keck 
accepts her fiance's love of hang-gliding, but she won't try it. "I can't 
imagine doing it; I'd be too scared." 
</P>
<P>
 Keck and Whisan are just one of many couples who have faced a sometimes 
difficult conflict in their relationship: When one partner is involved in a 
risky, thrill-seeking sport and the other has an aversion to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hang-gliders say that 'air-induced divorce' is common," says Betty Pfeiffer 
of High Energy Sports in Santa Ana, which sells hang-gliding equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 One way to combat that, Pfeiffer says, is to get your partner involved. "The 
non-flying partner might be a driver, trying to track down the other person so 
they'll be around when they land," she says. "But some people get tired of that 
very quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Keck: "I really enjoy driving for Marc. I got my ham radio license so I 
can communicate with him, and it's kind of adventurous being in a remote place 
and getting directions from the air, like a treasure hunt." 
</P>
<P>
 Whisan says he enjoys hang-gliding more now that his fiancee is involved, even 
if she isn't in the air with him. "She won't even ride tandem with me, but 
that's OK. She's just not comfortable with it, and I accept that." 
</P>
<P>
 Related conflicts can also be difficult to resolve. 
</P>
<P>
 "The partner who's involved in the activity has to be reasonable about the 
time and expense of the sport," says Theresa Lavenau, a marriage, family and 
child counselor in Huntington Beach. "They need to nurture and make special 
time for the relationship; you don't want the other partner to feel abandoned." 
</P>
<P>
 "In that kind of situation, it's important for each person to respect the 
other's position," says Teri Wright, a psychologist based in Orange. "You need 
to meet in the middle." 
</P>
<P>
 Bonnie Keith didn't understand husband David's love of sky-diving. "I wanted 
to see why he loved it, so I jumped with him. I'm glad I did it, but I'll never 
do it again." 
</P>
<P>
 The Laguna Hills couple took a tandem jump, where the two were connected to 
one large parachute. "My biggest fear was leaving the plane, but I don't 
remember doing that," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, who is also an aerial photographer, has a picture of their only 
sky-dive as a couple. "I'm glad she went with me to see what it was like; it 
gave her an idea of why I do it." 
</P>
<P>
 For David Keith, sky-diving is "like a drug. Anytime you do something 
exhilarating, you can feel the adrenaline pumping through your body; it's like 
an addiction. If I haven't jumped for a few weeks, and I get in a bad mood 
around the house, Bonnie will tell me go take a jump. When I come back, I'm a 
different person." 
</P>
<P>
 Married for seven years, the Keiths made a pact before they took their vows 
regarding David's sky-diving. "She agreed not to interfere with this. I said 
that I love her, and I love the sky, but it's not the same kind of love." 
</P>
<P>
 For couples in an unhealthy relationship, being torn between these two loves 
isn't good news. "In some cases, the sport can become a mistress," Lavenau 
says. "One partner becomes consumed by an activity to avoid the relationship 
and keep from getting too close." 
</P>
<P>
 When Doreen Kay of Anaheim learned to scuba dive 10 years ago, she found a 
fascinating world to explore -- one that didn't include her then-husband. 
</P>
<P>
 "He hated swimming, and he laughed when I'd go off scuba diving; that may be 
why I took to it so well. It felt so free to have a skill that he couldn't 
grasp, to be able to explore someplace he couldn't get to. After about a year 
of this, I realized scuba was ending my marriage, but I didn't care." 
</P>
<P>
 The school administrator met her present husband, Robert, on a diving trip to 
Mexico. He doesn't dive either. "It would scare the daylights out of me," 
Robert Kay says. "When I think of diving, all I can imagine is 'Sea Hunt,' and 
people were always dying underwater on that show." 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't bother me at all that Robert doesn't dive," Doreen Kay says. "I 
dive with a group of people, and we have fun in the water, and Robert joins us 
afterward. I know he worries about me, but he also knows that I don't take 
chances when I dive." 
</P>
<P>
 The fear that comes from having a loved one participate in a potentially fatal 
activity isn't easy to shake and can become a critical issue in the 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being concerned about a loved one's safety is good; that's something 
positive," Wright says. "It's up to the partner involved in the sport to show 
that all safety precautions are being taken." 
</P>
<P>
 However, no matter how careful someone may be, accidents happen. After their 
relationship started getting serious and Keck began learning about 
hang-gliding, Whisan had another bad accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was the only person around when he crashed, so I had to call in the rescue 
team. It was a horrible experience," Keck says. "At that point I told him, 'You 
stop hang-gliding, or we split up.' 
</P>
<P>
 "As we both recovered from the accident, we got our sensibilities back. Marc 
resolved that he would continue hang-gliding, but he would be even more careful 
than he was before," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Keck rationalizes that it's not necessarily the activity that creates 
accidents, it's the person involved. "So much depends on the pilot. If he or 
she is skilled, conscientious and takes care of their equipment, they're not as 
likely to get hurt as someone who is careless. After Marc was determined to fly 
again after his second accident, it was clear to me that he wasn't going to 
give it up, and if I wanted to be with him, I'd have to accept his 
hang-gliding." 
</P>
<P>
 Bonnie Keith also witnessed an accident involving her husband. A plane David 
was taking for a jump crashed on takeoff, and the divers had to run through a 
wall of fire to safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a nightmare, but everything turned out OK. There's always a certain 
fear and anxiety I feel when he jumps. My last words to him before he goes are 
'Be careful,' " she says. "That's kind of a ritual for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds David: "If she forgets after I leave the house, she always calls to tell 
me to be careful."  
</P>
<P>
 For many couples, the fear of injury or the monopolization of time and money 
tears the thrill-seeking partner away from the sport, or the relationship. "I 
have brothers who got involved in sky-diving and liked it; then they got 
married and they quit," David says. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a sky-diver gets into a relationship with someone who doesn't jump, 
you'll usually see that person jump less and less until they stop altogether, 
or they keep on jumping and you see the relationship break up," he says. "It 
takes something special between two people to make a situation like this work." 
</P>
<P>
 Bonnie Keith helps cope with her husband's sky-diving by getting involved in 
her own activities. "I love to do country line dancing, which is something he 
has no interest in. So he'll do his thing and I'll do mine, and neither of us 
feels like we've been abandoned." 
</P>
<P>
 For Keck and Robert Kay, learning about their partner's sport has helped them 
live with the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm involved in our hang-gliding club, and I'm as active in the sport as I 
can without getting in the air," Keck says. "I learn about the equipment and 
procedures, which makes me feel better about his safety, and the excitement he 
feels rubs off on me, so I feel a part of the sport." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Robert Kay: "I've gone to classes with Doreen to learn about diving, and 
I've talked to a lot of teachers. Now I know that diving is a lot safer than I 
thought it was." 
</P>
<P>
 However, he still doesn't think he'll try going under. "The closest I'll get 
to scuba diving with Doreen is watching 'Jacques Cousteau' together on TV. You 
see the same things, and there are no sharks behind the couch."

VINTAGE CLASSICS; WINERIES POUR THEIR BEST TO HELP THE PHILHARMONIC SOCIETY 
CULTIVATE A GOOD YEAR

 More than 400 guests indulged in a trio of epicurean delights -- wine, food 
and heavenly music -- at the "Symphony of Wines" staged by the Town & Country 
Committee of the Orange County Philharmonic Society. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee joined with Hi-Time Cellars to enlist 67 wineries to pour their 
best vintages for the wine-tasting that took place The $400-per-person benefit 
was expected to net about $12,000 for the OCPS's youth programs. Day of Wine 
and Noses 
</P>
<P>
 The 14th annual "Symphony of Wines" attracted serious wine connoisseurs who 
like the wine-tasting because they can try many different vintages under one 
roof. 
</P>
<P>
 They sniffed, they sipped, they swallowed and, sometimes, they discreetly 
spit. How else to sample, say, 50 different wines in one afternoon without, as 
wine connoisseur Dave Baccitich said, "crawling out of here." 
</P>
<P>
 Baccitich shared a dictionary of terms used frequently by wine aficionados to 
describe certain vintages. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the words they use are 'oaky' to describe Chardonnay and 'glassy' or 
'herbal' for the Sauvignons and fumes. For the reds you start talking about 
your 'cherries' and your 'raspberries,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wine lover Chuck Roby, who attended with his wife, Mimi, a Town and Country 
member, had his wine-tasting m.o. already planned. Sample the whites first, he 
advised, then on to the heavier reds. 
</P>
<P>
 "You put together a strategy," he said. "I always start with the Chardonnays." 
</P>
<P>
 He took only a small sip of each wine, holding it on the tongue to take in the 
flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't chug it," Roby said. "This is really about tasting the wine." Wined 
and Dined 
</P>
<P>
 In between sips of wine, guests indulged in buffets stocked with gourmet 
specialties prepared by local restaurants. One popular table was covered with 
strawberries that looked like they were wearing tuxedos made of white and dark 
chocolate -- the handiwork of Rockwell Bakery of Villa Park. Issay of Newport 
Beach offered tiramisu; Sfuzzi of Costa Mesa served penne with a roasted 
vegetable Bolognese sauce and Trees Restaurant of Corona del Mar served a 
marinated sliced pork. 
</P>
<P>
 Philharmonic supporters love music as well as wine, so they were serenaded by 
musicians who performed classical works. Town & Country members Barbara 
Chahbazian, violinist, and Joan Djang, pianist, were accompanied on piano by 
Fritz Lin, husband of member Helen Lin, who performed on cello. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from the event support the philharmonic society's musical outreach 
program, which presents concerts for Orange County youths at schools and at the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 "This brings music to children who otherwise would not have" the exposure, 
said Eleanor Beatty, event chairwoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Town & Country is one of 32 committees that support the OCPS; it has 37 
members based in Tustin Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those attending were Lana Hileman, event co-chairwoman; Judith Jelinek, 
president of the OCPS, with her husband, Howard; Nancy Morrow, Town & Country 
president, and her husband, Ralph; Dean Corey, OCPS director, and his wife, 
Gayle; Monica McDade, wine coordinator with Hi-Time Cellars; Ron and Francine 
Morrison; Barry and Sue Von Hemert, and Marta Zilonko. KATHRYN BOLD

 After the two-month trial in Orange County Superior Court, it took a jury six 
days to decide that Cessna Aircraft Co. and its parts distributor, U.S. 
Propeller Service of Connecticut, owed the two men loss of profits. The jury 
also found that Cessna owes punitive damages, and will decide that amount 
within the next few days, according to the men's attorney, Robert F. Scoular of 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Rich, 61, said he and his partner, Robert Craner, 58, of Long Beach, worked as 
a team in 1986 to develop the first three-bladed propeller for a 4-cylinder, 
single-engine airplane. At the time, most smaller planes used a two-bladed 
propeller that is lighter but less powerful. 
</P>
<P>
 With Rich's money and Craner's ability to design propellers, they built a 
prototype, got it licensed and approached Cessna with their product in 1986. 
According to Rich and Craner, Cessna was interested and agreed to manufacturer 
the propeller, while the two men would have the exclusive rights to sell it.  
</P>
<P>
 But by 1988, according to the lawsuit, the two men thought that Cessna had 
lost interest in the deal, and they gave up their venture. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, according to the suit, Cessna took the idea and used another company 
to sell the propeller, essentially cutting them out of the deal.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Rich, who owns an airplane, said he received a flyer in the mail, 
advertising a three-bladed propeller. He called Craner immediately, and the two 
discovered the design was exactly like theirs, the suit alleges. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Wichita, Kan.-based Cessna declined to comment, saying his 
company "is proceeding in the courts." An attorney for U.S. Propeller Service 
of Connecticut, Donald Beck of Santa Ana, said the award was "excessive" and 
that the company will appeal the jury's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Scoular said a Price Waterhouse accountant testified that Rich and Craner were 
entitled to between $4 million and $8 million, based on the profits Cessna 
received. 
</P>
<P>
 Auto mechanic Craner said he was inspired, in part, to build the three-bladed 
propeller from his days as a torpedo man on a Navy submarine off Alaska in the 
late 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw how they used many different blade styles and designs to make a torpedo 
move without wake underwater. I applied some of the things I learned from 
that," Craner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Craner, who has worked on Cadillacs for the past 33 years, said of his 
newfound wealth that he "hasn't the foggiest idea of what to do with that kind 
of money." For now, he said, he plans to continue working at his $17-an-hour 
job fixing brakes and steering on cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's what I like doing, and the people I work for treat me well," Craner 
said, although he added his wife would probably quit her office job. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Rich said he was excited and happy, he was not ready on Monday to 
celebrate, even after learning about the multimillion-dollar award. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't be happy until I have the cash in my hands," Rich said. He said he 
will add the money to his "kitty" of savings and the pension that he receives 
from his 27 years at McDonnell Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've lived in Cypress for the past 28 years," Rich said, "and we'll just 
continue to live the way we always have."

U.S. JUDGE GIVES WAGNER ADDED TIME IN PRISON; COURTS: HOWEVER, SOME THINK THE 
EX-SCHOOL OFFICIAL WHO EMBEZZLED $3.7 MILLION SHOULD STAY BEHIND BARS LONGER 
STILL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge Monday sentenced former school finance officer Stephen A. 
Wagner to 57 months in prison on federal mail and wire fraud charges. 
</P>
<P>
 That effectively adds about 13 months to the time Wagner is expected to spend 
behind bars on state charges of embezzling $3.7 million from the Newport-Mesa 
Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of a plea bargain that Wagner's attorney struck with prosecutors, 
his federal prison sentence will be served concurrently with the six-year 
prison sentence he received from a state judge. 
</P>
<P>
 But because of credits he can earn under both penal systems for good behavior 
and work in prison, he could complete both prison terms and be free in January, 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing the magnitude of his theft and the harm it had done to a school 
district that has suffered staffing and course cutbacks, federal prosecutors 
had argued for a nine-year prison term, which would have kept him behind bars 
much longer. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Court Judge Linda H. McLaughlin agreed, however, with a 
probation department recommendation that Wagner be sentenced to 57 months. In 
doing so, she imposed a term harsher than the normal 37- to 46-month prison 
sentence that federal guidelines prescribe for Wagner's crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 McLaughlin also ordered Wagner to pay restitution of $2.77 million, the 
balance of the embezzled money that the school district still has not 
recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 "The amount of dollar loss does not capture the seriousness of the crimes," 
McLaughlin told Wagner at sentencing. "The embezzlement of $3.7 million 
seriously jeopardized the school district and caused the public to lose 
confidence that the district could protect its money." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The sentence, she said, was based on Wagner's 6.5 years of criminal activity 
at the district and his "failure to restore the money or present a credible 
accounting of where the money went." 
</P>
<P>
 Although she would have liked to have the 57-month sentence start only after 
Wagner completes his state prison term, McLaughlin said there was nothing in 
the law that permitted her to require that the federal sentence be served 
consecutively, or after completion of the state sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just ridiculous," said school board member Jim deBoom, who attended 
the hearing and shook his head after the sentencing. "I can't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since Wagner pleaded guilty to state embezzlement charges and was 
sentenced to what many considered a relatively light six-year prison term, 
federal authorities had contemplated charging Wagner with mail and wire fraud 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
 He was ultimately charged with three counts of wire fraud and one count of 
mail fraud that were linked to the embezzlement scheme. The wire fraud charges 
cover three transfers of school district funds into out-of-state bank accounts 
that Wagner maintained to cover his investments. The mail fraud count involved 
Wagner's use of $35,503 in district funds to pay his American Express bill in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal penalties for white-collar criminals are much more severe than those 
that can be imposed by the state. By filing federal charges, prosecutors 
exposed Wagner to a maximum 20-year prison term and up to $1 million in fines. 
</P>
<P>
 In federal court on Monday, Wagner's attorney, Paul S. Meyer, asked that 
Wagner be sentenced to no more than 47 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside court, Meyer praised McLaughlin's sentence and her resistance to being 
influenced by a recent barrage of letters from school district officials, 
students and others who asked for the toughest sentence possible. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The judge did a very, very fair job of sentencing and she was able to stick 
to the facts rather than look at the emotional overlay of the case," Meyer 
said. "I am absolutely satisfied that this was a fair sentence." 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. David A. Hoffer said he was gratified that McLaughlin had 
increased the sentence slightly over the normal guidelines but did not comment 
further. 
</P>
<P>
 In court, Hoffer had urged that the severity of Wagner's sentence be based on 
the impact that the embezzlement had on the district's educational system, its 
health insurance plan, the loss of district jobs and the overall negative 
impression the public now has on the district. 
</P>
<P>
 "It caused a dramatic loss of public confidence in an institution which lives 
on that confidence to function," Hoffer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district superintendent, Cloyde McKinley (Mac) Bernd, said Monday that it 
may be impossible for any sentence to make amends for Wagner's crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I look at the pain he has caused and the residual pain that is still 
here, I don't know what you could do to redress it," he said. "If there's 
anything healthy about what has happened it is that this is the final chapter, 
and it does begin to close the book on this situation. There is a strong 
feeling that it is time for us to move on and beyond Stephen Wagner." 
</P>
<P>
 Seven students from Costa Mesa High School, accompanied by their parents, 
attended the sentencing as part of a class assignment after several freshman 
classes were encouraged to write letters to the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the letters implored McLaughlin to impose the strictest sentence 
possible. Susan Allenbaugh, the teacher who came up with the assignment, added 
her own cover letter. "What this man did, and some administrators seem to 
condone, has slapped me and my students in the face," she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 After the sentencing, her students returned to school and relayed the judge's 
ruling to Allenbaugh. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked them, 'What did you learn from this?" Allenbaugh said Monday. "They 
said, 'If you want to commit a crime, be white and male and don't use 
violence.' What a lesson!"

MISSING MAN FOUND DEAD; CRIME: THE BODY OF GARDEN GROVE RESIDENT WHO 
DISAPPEARED LAST WEEK IS DISCOVERED IN THE TRUNK OF HIS CAR IN A SANTA ANA LOT. 
HE HAD BEEN SHOT TO DEATH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A 44-year-old Garden Grove man who disappeared last week while inspecting 
property he managed was found shot to death Monday in the trunk of his car, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police found Philip George Cousins' car in a parking lot in the 2400 block of 
West 3rd Street, said Santa Ana Police Lt. Robert Helton. The victim was 
identified through photographs, Helton said. No identification was found on the 
body. 
</P>
<P>
 Helton said a preliminary investigation revealed that the victim had two 
gunshot wounds -- one in the back of the head and the other in the chest. 
Investigators had not pinpointed a motive in the case, he said. Cousins' Honda 
Accord did not appear to have been ransacked, Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of our options are open right now," Helton said. "Why he was killed in 
the way he was we're still investigating." 
</P>
<P>
 Robbery is just one of several possible motives, Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Helton said investigators did not know how long the car may have been parked 
there or how long the victim had been dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth Cousins, the missing man's wife, was in seclusion. She had reported her 
husband missing Friday morning, after he did not return home Thursday night. 
She also hired a private investigator to try to find her husband, who she had 
said "always keeps his business appointments and always comes home." 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold Goldman, a friend of Cousins who lives in the San Fernando Valley, 
said: "We're extremely sad. You hear about crime all the time, but when it hits 
close, it really hurts." 
</P>
<P>
 Cousins, who worked for Preferred Real Estate Management, was last seen 
Thursday about 12:15 p.m. inspecting an apartment complex at 1330 Bush St. in 
Santa Ana. His wife said he collected rent and sometimes handled cash. 
</P>
<P>
 His car was found in a parking lot surrounded by single-story warehouses that 
fill up a city block. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner of one of the warehouses called police shortly before 10 a.m. Monday 
to report an unfamiliar car that had been parked next to the business for 
several days. When police ran a check on the license plate, they found that the 
car had been reported missing in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove police investigators, who had a key to Cousins' car, then opened 
the trunk and found the body. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers said the industrial area is plagued by shootings. One man who runs a 
nearby warehouse said he has collected ammunition shells found around his 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the kind of place you don't want to be after the sun goes down," the 
man said, declining to give his name for fear of retribution. 
</P>
<P>
 Lenesse Rasmussen, 26, who works just around the corner, said that gunfire is 
not uncommon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We call it 'Shooter's Alley' around here because we get all those drive-bys 
and weirdos," she said. "Whenever we hear anything that sounds loud, like 
gunfire, we hit the floor." 
</P>
<P>
 Helton said that many of the warehouses are closed over the weekend, perhaps 
explaining why no one reported the abandoned car until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The grim discovery came just two weeks after Cal State Fullerton honor student 
Cathy Torrez was found stabbed to death in the trunk of her car Feb. 19. Helton 
said police do not believe the two cases are connected. 
</P>
<P>
 Family and friends of Cousins had spent Sunday posting about 2,000 flyers in 
Santa Ana, Anaheim and Garden Grove asking for any information on his 
whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Schaaf, Cousins' boss at Preferred Real Estate Management, had called 
the Northridge native "dependable" and "one of the hardest workers we have."

GIRL MAY BILL DISTRICT FOR PRIVATE SCHOOL TUITION; EDUCATION: STATE OFFICIAL 
FINDS THAT NEWPORT-MESA OFFICIALS DID NOT MEET THE SPECIAL NEEDS OF THE 
9-YEAR-OLD STUDENT, WHO IS DYSLEXIC, AND WERE UNABLE TO TEACH THE THIRD-GRADER 
TO READ ABOVE FIRST-GRADE LEVEL. 
</P>

<P>
 A 9-year-old girl with a learning disability whose special needs were not met 
by the Newport-Mesa Unified School District may bill the district for the cost 
of tuition at a private school, under a state ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl, who is dyslexic and has suffered emotional problems, won an unusual 
judgment in January from a state hearing officer who found that officials at 
College Park Elementary School were unable to teach the third-grade student to 
read above a first-grade level. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl's mother, Cyndee Montgomery, contended in a complaint to the state 
that as a result of the school's inability to teach her daughter, the child 
developed emotional problems that included fits of crying during class. 
</P>
<P>
 She was also unable to make friends and complained of "blurred vision," 
Montgomery contended. The child's name is not being published to protect her 
privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had emotional problems because she is a very intelligent kid who could 
not read," Montgomery said.  
</P>
<P>
 In January, F. Richard Ruderman of the State Special Education Hearing Office 
ordered the school district to pay the girl's $900-per-month tuition for the 
1993-94 school year at the private Prentice Day School in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruderman found that the district failed in its obligation to provide a "free 
and appropriate" education for the child and cited it for violations which 
"seriously infringed" upon the mother's ability to participate and make 
decisions about her daughter's academic placement. 
</P>
<P>
 But the district has so far refused to pay the girl's private school tuition 
and instead will appeal the decision to federal court, said Sharon Watt, a 
Ventura attorney who represents the school district.  
</P>
<P>
 "I am still quite shocked by this case," Watt said. "Without question, the 
school district does have a program that could (remedy) this child's 
disability. They have helped numerous other students. I don't see why they 
cannot help" this girl. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Orange County Department of Education statistics for the current 
school year, 249 children are attending private schools at public school 
expense. But only a tiny minority are there as a result of the kind of hearing 
that Montgomery pursued. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 128 students currently enrolled at the Prentice Day School, 10 are 
being funded by public school districts. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, there are more than 36,200 students in the public schools' 
special education classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport-Mesa Unified School District Supt. Mac Bernd declined to comment on 
the situation, citing the student's right to confidentiality. Montgomery said 
she went public because she fears that the district will not pay her daughter's 
tuition. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery's daughter attended the Costa Mesa elementary school from the 
1990-91 school year until June of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, the girl's first-grade teacher wrote that "(The student) 
appears to feel lonely and frustrated at times during school," according to 
Ruderman's report. "In class, (she) appears to be unable to read by sight or 
decoding skills." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the second half of her first-grade year, the child was placed in a special 
program, spending more than half her school day in the "mainstream" class at 
College Park and the rest with a special education teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Ruderman's report, the results of an independent test of the 
girl's ability indicated that near the end of third grade, she read at a 
first-grade level. As a result, she was frustrated and cried often in class, 
Montgomery said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's attorney disputes that description. "There is nobody who can 
verify that she has had any emotional problems in class," Watt said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, district officials believe that the girl showed good academic 
progress on standardized tests.  
</P>
<P>
 But believing that the district had failed, Montgomery began to search for a 
private school for her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, Montgomery and her daughter visited the National Dyslexic 
Research Foundation in Costa Mesa, where they learned that the 9-year-old is a 
"classic dyslexic" and were advised that she be placed at the nonprofit 
Prentice Day School or receive private tutoring. Montgomery enrolled her 
daughter in the special school. 
</P>
<P>
 The district was unable to persuade Montgomery to place her daughter back in 
public education system. Montgomery was unable to force the district to pay for 
the private school.  
</P>
<P>
 At that point, both parties agreed to a hearing before Ruderman. 
</P>
<P>
 In his decision, Ruderman said the district did not show that its program 
would address the child's special needs. In addition, he ruled, the district 
"committed a multitude of procedural violations that seriously infringed on Ms. 
Montgomery's ability to participate" in planning her daughter's special 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Watt, however, said the district did everything it could to accommodate 
Montgomery and her daughter, holding special meetings during the summer when 
school was out of session. She said the district will file "a timely appeal" 
and the case may appear before a federal court judge in about a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have done many, many hearings and in few hearings have I had such exemplary 
a program as this program not approved by a hearing officer," Watt said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; COMMUNITY CENTER TOPS COUNCIL AGENDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY SPENCER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council will hear proposals today on a planned downtown community 
center and the repairs needed for earthquake-damaged Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is also scheduled to: 
</P>
<P>
 * Decide which groups will receive shares of a $3.7-million federal block 
grant and whether to adopt an ordinance that will allow only one company to 
place bus benches in the city. Both votes were postponed last week. 
</P>
<P>
 * Approve a settlement with the owners of a long-established restaurant near 
Disneyland that will save it from closure when the amusement park expands. 
</P>
<P>
 * Discuss in closed session the impasse between the Rams football team and the 
Magnolia School District over the Rams' practice facility. Both sides have made 
final offers to resolve a lease dispute and the city must decide whether to 
cover the financial gap between them. 
</P>
<P>
 The community center -- tentatively scheduled for construction in 1996 -- 
would include a gymnasium, senior center and art gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been meeting with some community groups and we are going to unveil for 
the council what we have come up with," said Christopher Jarvi, the city's 
parks, recreation and community services director. 
</P>
<P>
 To repair the stadium, the 17-ton Sony Jumbotron scoreboard, which collapsed 
during the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, will have to be temporarily moved to 
another spot in the stadium, city spokesman Bret Colson said. During the quake, 
it fell from the roof above the left-field stands, crushing hundreds of seats 
in the upper deck. 
</P>
<P>
 Other scheduled council topics include: 
</P>
<P>
 * A list of 19 city departments and community groups that have been selected 
by a citizens committee to receive block grants from the federal Housing and 
Urban Development Department. The council can amend the list. City departments 
set to receive some of the largest grants are the downtown community center, 
$974,000; code enforcement, $718,000; and the police anti-gang unit, $211,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * A proposal that would require bus bench companies to bid for the right to 
place 500 of their advertising benches in the city. The company that agrees to 
pay the city the most money and keep their benches the cleanest would be 
awarded the contract. Other companies would have to remove their benches. 
</P>
<P>
 * A settlement with Tiffy's Family Restaurant, at the corner of West Street 
and Katella Avenue, which will allow it to remain open if Disneyland expands 
later this decade. The restaurant would have been torn down to expand the 
area's streets, but the streets have been redesigned. 
</P>
<P>
 The discussions on the community center and the stadium damage will be held 
during a study session scheduled to begin at 3 p.m. at City Hall, 200 S. 
Anaheim Blvd. The council is scheduled to convene its regular meeting at 5 p.m. 
to vote on the block grant, bus bench, Rams and restaurant settlements. TERRY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; MARINE DRILL TEAM, BAND STRUT STUFF

<TEXT>
<P>
 About 80 men in red jackets, white pants and black boots marched in unison 
before a crowd of both children and adults in Tustin on Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not a high school marching band or a pre-St. Patrick's Day parade but 
the United States Marine Drum and Bugle Corps. The nationally known, 
Washington-based marching band was making its annual stop at the El Toro Marine 
Corps Air Station to perform for Marines as well as children from area day-care 
centers and schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Somber-faced band members, with drum sets attached to their chests, cymbals 
strapped to their hands and tubas flung over their shoulders, displayed 
intricate combinations of precise steps and crisp turns as they played half a 
dozen well-rehearsed tunes. 
</P>
<P>
 Young children sat mesmerized as the performers, who sported crew cuts, walked 
backward and sideways, changing their formations from straight lines to columns 
to semicircles without ever falling out of line, hitting a flat note or 
jostling their neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 When the musical part of the show concluded, the Silent Drill Platoon lined 
up. Members of the 24-man group, dressed in black jackets and white pants, 
slung 10-pound, fully operational M-1 rifles over their shoulders and executed 
a series of drills for about 20 minutes without any verbal cues. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd watched in awe as two men on the team performed a pantomime, tapping 
their guns against the ground, tossing them into the air and back and forth 
through several synchronized rotations.

 The drill team and musicians are touring Southern California and parts of 
Texas and Arizona through Monday, with stops at schools and military 
facilities. They travel in military planes and stay on bases at every stop. 
Most performances are open to the public, though the two at Tustin on Monday 
were not. The next show is at Sorensen Field in Barstow at 10:30 this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the tour's goals is to raise public awareness about the Marines, said 
spokeswoman Sgt. Cynthia Atwood. The intent is to get people interested in 
enlisting and to raise the morale of those already in the service, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The band was formed in 1934 as a touring group. Before that, music helped in 
battlefield communications and to rally troops. 
</P>
<P>
 "The different bugle calls could be heard over a wide area and let Marines 
know if they should attack or retire for the evening. It just continued as an 
evolution," with the musicians becoming performers during times of peace, 
Atwood said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now both the musical and drill teams make about 400 appearances a year, 
covering 50,000 miles annually, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 They are not the only ones to travel, though. 
</P>
<P>
 Recruiters also scour the country to find performers who want to be Marines. 
But during their coast-to-coast travels, Atwood said, few women musicians have 
auditioned, and so the current band is all men. 
</P>
<P>
 Those selected are initially treated like ordinary Marines: "They go through 
basic training before they can start. They have to be fully qualified," said 
Atwood. 
</P>
<P>
 And even with their talents, the performers do not get special compensation. 
"They earn standard military pay," Atwood said, and for someone straight out of 
boot camp, that equals $933 a month, plus room and board. 
</P>
<P>
 When this tour is complete, the performers will return to Washington and 
prepare for a series of annual parades there, which begin April 29. ELAINE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; SCHOOL BOARD READY TO ADOPT DRESS CODE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY SPENCER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Anaheim City School District board is set to adopt a dress code tonight 
that will prohibit students from wearing baggy pants, T-shirts with obscene or 
offensive messages, hats and clothing that is "unsafe, dangerous or a health 
hazard." 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Meliton Lopez said Monday that some of the downtown elementary school 
district's students wear "inappropriate" clothing and that the district needs a 
policy to deal with the matter. The district has more than 16,000 students in 
kindergarten through sixth grade at 21 schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the inappropriate clothing worn by the students mimics that worn by 
older children who are gang members, Lopez said. That could lead to the 
elementary students' being confronted and possibly harmed by gang members who 
may confuse the younger children with rivals, Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed code specifically bans any item of clothing that "contains 
offensive or obscene symbols, signs or slogans degrading any culture, religious 
or ethnic values." 
</P>
<P>
 It also prohibits clothing that contains references to sex, drugs, alcohol or 
tobacco, communicates gang affiliations or depicts violence or destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal prohibits hats, overalls that are not properly strapped over the 
shoulders and pants that "are not an appropriate size." Gang members frequently 
wear baseball caps of certain teams, don't strap up their overalls and wear 
large, baggy pants. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have some children with size 24 waists who are showing up to school in 
size 35 or 36 pants," Lopez said. "The pants' crotch is hanging down to the 
students' knees. A student can't do (physical education) in those and it is 
just not appropriate attire." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez said two of the district's schools -- Paul Revere and Thomas Jefferson 
-- have adopted school uniforms that are worn voluntarily and he is encouraging 
others to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's board meeting is scheduled for 7:30 at district headquarters, 890 S.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA; RESTAURANT OWNER ENDS FIGHT FOR MUSIC 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After a yearlong battle to reopen his restaurant and operate it with live 
entertainment, Jose Carillo gave up last week, withdrawing his request to be 
allowed to have mariachis perform there. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last month, the City Council had denied Carillo an entertainment permit, 
which he sought so that he could have bands play dance music at the La Habra 
Boulevard restaurant, which has been closed for a year.But Carillo returned 
last week with a more modest request, asking for permission to have the 
unamplified music of mariachis. 
</P>
<P>
 When the council indicated it was still opposed, Carillo dropped the request 
and said he would reopen the restaurant anyway.  
</P>
<P>
 Council members said residents led them to their decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents two years ago had complained about noise, loitering, littering, 
public urination, graffiti and inadequate parking at the restaurant, Casa 
Carillo. This year they renewed their opposition, presenting the council with a 
petition signed by 143 neighbors, urging the city to deny Carillo the 
entertainment permit. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant, which had an entertainment permit two years ago, lost it last 
year because of residents' complaints that the music there was too loud. 
Carillo shut the restaurant when he lost the permit, saying that without the 
music the eatery would not make money. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting in January, council members told Carillo that they would not 
hesitate to grant an entertainment permit if he would hire musicians that do 
not require amplification, such as mariachis. 
</P>
<P>
 But last Thursday, Councilman William D. Mahoney told Carillo that a 
restaurant did not need music to be successful. "If you want to run a 
restaurant, run a restaurant," he said. Besides, "I don't like (mariachi) 
music." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Carillo said he will only play recorded, background music and will hire 
two security guards. MIMI KO

 Parks commissioners recently declared they want to build high-quality 
basketball courts in the city, partly in reaction to the dozens of people who 
came to a January meeting to protest the closing of basketball courts at 
Tanager Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before we suggest any other sort of improvements, we should address the 
basketball situation," said commissioner Richard Mehren at the Parks, 
Recreation Facilities and Parkways Commission meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 In a city survey last winter, residents named basketball as their favorite 
recreational sport. 
</P>
<P>
 The commissioners closed down the two basketball courts at Tanager Park last 
year after residents complained that ballplayers there were rude, loud and 
littered the park. But two members of the girls' basketball team at Estancia 
High School petitioned the City Council to restore the hoops. The council asked 
the parks commissioners to reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, commissioners heard more than three hours of conflicting public 
testimony and decided to study the park situation before reinstalling the 
basketball hoops. 
</P>
<P>
 The commissioners recommended at their February meeting that the council spend 
more than $900,000 on field and playground equipment improvements. Mehren 
suggested spending $100,000 to $200,000 to build four high-quality courts in 
the city. The council will have to approve all expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
 There is only $566,945 budgeted for park improvements in fiscal year 1993-94, 
and the major source of that money -- park in-lieu fees paid by developers -- 
has recently fallen sharply. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Marcus D. Davis, assistant finance director, developers paid the 
city more than $240,000 in fiscal years 1991-92 and 1992-93. But in the first 
five months of fiscal year 1993-94, only $28,744 has been received because of 
little commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
 The parks commissioners voted to present the council with requests for more 
than $3.8 million in park improvements, but decided to rank their 
requests.WILLSON CUMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; PLANTING RESPECT FOR THE ENVIRONMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU PICKEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Greta Folsom knelt in the mud in Twin Lakes Park, gleefully patting a mound of 
soil around the base of a newly planted jacaranda tree. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a work of art," the 12-year-old said proudly, beaming at the slender 
tree. Her classmates swirled around her, dumping buckets of water on nearby 
saplings and stomping on freshly shoveled soil. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 70 sixth-graders from Earl Warren Elementary School marched to the park 
Monday morning to shovel dirt, plant 12 trees and pick up trash in honor of 
Arbor Day. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual tree-planting celebration is observed in California on March 7 to 
honor the birthday of the late California horticulturist Luther Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 The city invited the children to plant the trees to foster a greater respect 
for the environment and commitment to public parks, said Jim Yasutake, field 
services supervisor for the Garden Grove Public Services Department.  
</P>
<P>
 "We want to get the kids involved and make them aware of the value of trees," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 With a little help from parents and park maintenance workers, the children dug 
holes and planted Canary Island pines, liquidambars and jacarandas on the east 
and west sides of the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, they roamed the banks of the park, picking up bottles, cigarette 
butts, shredded Styrofoam, snack food wrappers and even an old pillow. Others 
shoveled mud from the asphalt walkways and then swept them clean.  
</P>
<P>
 The elementary school "adopted " the park two years ago and sends a new group 
of students every month to pick up trash, sixth-grade teacher Fred Fox said. 
But this was the first cleanup outing for this group, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Most of the kids live near the park and said they were both sad and angry 
about the litter on the ground and the rank-smelling pond.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's sad that it's so messed up," said 12-year-old Robert Miner.  
</P>
<P>
 "You used to be able to go fishing here, but now when you get a fish, it's 
nasty and moldy," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Classmate Michael Martinez agreed but was more hopeful.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's dirty, but we're just trying to clean it up," he said. "Sooner or later, 
it will get clean." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the kids use the park to walk, ride their bikes or roller-blade after 
school. Some said they usually encourage people not to litter, while others 
said the field trip made them more aware of the need to prevent littering.  
</P>
<P>
 "When I came to this park, I never really noticed the trash," said 11-year-old 
Xochitl Gonzalez. "But when I come the next time, I'm going to try to clean it 
up."  
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the field trip, the students gathered for punch and cookies and 
most agreed that the best part of the day was planting the trees. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fun. It was cool," said Tim Sherman.MARY LOU PICKEL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS; COUNCIL OKS HIRING OF PATROL OFFICER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has approved hiring a police officer who will be assigned a 
foot or bicycle patrol to enhance the Police Department's community policing 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted unanimously last week to fund the position with money from 
Proposition 172, the half-cent sales tax increase for public safety programs 
that voters approved in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Michael J. Skogh said the police officer will work 10 hours a 
day, four days a week, and will patrol schools, parks, and business and 
residential areas. In addition, the officer will work with the Neighborhood 
Preservation officer in carrying out community programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The police officer will receive about $5,200 a month in salary and benefits, 
Skogh said in a report to the council. He said the city's share of Proposition 
172 money would be enough to fund the position through the 1994-95 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Department is authorized to have 25 full-time police officers, but 
one position has long been vacant because of budget problems, Skogh said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS; POLICE ANGRY OVER 4 JOB ELIMINATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Officers here are angry over a recent City Council decision to eliminate four 
management jobs in the police department in order to balance the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members "are crippling our department," said Officer Matt 
Robinson, president of the Cypress Public Safety Employees Assn. "We are very 
upset at these cuts being made at a time when violent crime is on the increase 
in Cypress." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past year, the city has reported more than a dozen drive-by 
shootings, he said. Before 1993, there was one drive-by shooting every four 
years, Robinson said. He said homicides also are up. There were three homicides 
in 1993 and none in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Partin said eliminating the police jobs helps the city 
reorganize the department. He said the city is "top heavy with management." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's too much management, too few workers," Partin said. "I'm sure the 
police association is very unhappy because (the elimination of four jobs) takes 
out promotional opportunities. But we have to make our budget work or else 
there are going to be more employees let go." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials discovered last month that the city is facing an additional 
$238,000 shortfall in this fiscal year's budget and a $1-million deficit in the 
1994-95 budget. The cuts in the police department, which will be made through 
attrition, will help balance the budget by saving the city $340,000, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A captain, lieutenant, sergeant and a dispatch supervisor's positions are the 
jobs that will be eliminated. The lieutenant and sergeant have already retired 
and the dispatch supervisor will be granted early retirement, which she applied 
for last year. 
</P>
<P>
 All the jobs will be eliminated by April 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Bob Bandurraga, who oversees the patrol division, received a memo from 
City Manager Darrell Essex last week informing him that his job would be 
eliminated by April 1, he said. Bandurraga said he will retire but "not 
voluntarily." 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, there are two captains, three lieutenants, nine sergeants and 53 
sworn officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson said police, who have been at odds with the city over contract and 
salary disputes for two years, have not ruled out waging a recall campaign 
against the council. The union also is working on raising money to back a 
police supporter to run for a seat on the City Council in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will back anyone who will truly listen to police and the community because 
it's obvious that this council either doesn't care or is just not listening," 
Robinson said. "We have support in the community and (the council's) response 
is to cut police." 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council is "destroying the police department," he added. "Morale here 
is already beyond zero and a large number of officers are already looking for 
jobs elsewhere. That's a shame. . . . This is the beginning of the end of the 
department, big time." 
</P>
<P>
 Officers, their families and residents have staged two protests in the past 
five months urging council members to give police a 5% to 7% pay raise, hire at 
least eight more patrol officers and sign a contract. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials plan to announce the police cuts and other job cuts that may 
include the positions of the assistant city manager, the assistant city 
engineer, the assistant planning director and two maintenance workers at the 
March 14 council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Joyce C. Nicholson said she was sorry about the cuts but that 
they are necessary because of the city's financial crisis.MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; FATE OF WESTPARK BRIDGE TO BE DECIDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council tonight is set to decide the fate of a proposed pedestrian 
and bicycle bridge that would link two retail centers in the Westpark village. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Co. agreed to build the bridge over San Diego Creek in 1990 when it 
received the city's permission to construct the Westpark Plaza shopping 
center.Now, the company has asked the city to delete the bridge requirement 
from its development agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have raised safety concerns about the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The bridge, which would cost about $500,000, would enhance non-vehicle traffic 
in the area and create a passageway for shoppers to walk from Westpark Plaza to 
the Crossroads Center, according to a city report. 
</P>
<P>
 However, city officials have also said they fear children might try to climb 
down from the bridge to the creek bed.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; CITY TO REPAIR WELLS DAMAGED IN QUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three of the city's water wells are in dire need of repair -- two were damaged 
in the recent Northridge earthquake -- to protect life and property, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The loss of these facilities seriously limits fire-flow capacities," said 
Wayne S. Osborne, director of public works. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the need to quickly repair the wells, the City Council last week 
voted unanimously to spend about $90,000 to get the wells operating. 
</P>
<P>
 The council took the money from water fund reserves and waived the bidding 
process to speed the project and have the wells fixed within six to eight 
weeks. The city's standard procedure for making such repairs includes preparing 
plans, gaining council approval and advertising for bids, which takes about 4 
1/2 months, Osborne said. 
</P>
<P>
 Osborne said General Pump Co. Inc. of San Dimas will perform the repair work. 
The company was the lowest bidder for repairs made last year to one of the 
city's seven wells, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven wells provide the community with 75% of its water supply. The city 
buys the remaining 25% of its water from the Metropolitan Water District of 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Osborne said the three wells that are out of operation provide 50% of 
the water supply pumped from the seven wells. 
</P>
<P>
 Osborne said the city's existing water-flow capacities are sufficient to fight 
a standard fire. But if a major fire, similar to last fall's Laguna Beach fire, 
developed in the city, the pumping capacity of the water facilities could not 
be sustained for more than 12 hours, Osborne said.  
</P>
<P>
 The city faces no shortage of water for domestic use. 
</P>
<P>
 Osborne said the city removed one well from service for repairs just before 
the Jan. 17 Northridge quake. He said another was damaged in the quake and left 
inoperable. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has reviewed the damage and 
will reimburse the city 75% of the cost of repairing that well. 
</P>
<P>
 A third well suffered electrical failure resulting from power outages during 
the quake, Osborne said. FEMA will also pay 75% of those repair costs, he said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; EX-CITY MANAGER REHIRED TEMPORARILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert H. Huntley, who was city manager here from 1967 to 1977, has been hired 
as the temporary city manager. He started work Monday, replacing Jerry Kenny, 
who retired Friday 
</P>
<P>
 Huntley, 70, a consultant with the city's Redevelopment Agency for the last 
three years, is expected to stay until a permanent city manager is hired in the 
next three to four months, according to Assistant City Manager Don Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson said that David M. Griffith & Associates, a consulting firm hired by 
the City Council last month, is coordinating the search for a city manager. 
</P>
<P>

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; RESTRAINING ORDER TO STOP HAULING DENIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Declaring that no emergency existed, a Superior Court judge Monday denied the 
city of Santa Ana and its franchise trash hauler a restraining order that would 
have stopped a family-run company from picking up garbage at the city's 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be no temporary restraining order. . . . The waste is presently 
being picked up and it will remain so," said Judge Thomas N. Thrasher. 
</P>
<P>
 The city and Great Western Reclamation, a subsidiary of Waste Management Inc., 
filed a complaint last week against 5 Star Rubbish Service, claiming it is 
breaking a city law that grants all trash hauling rights within city boundaries 
to the city-contracted hauler. 
</P>
<P>
 By picking up trash from the district's 50 school sites, Dolores Otting's 
Newport Beach-based company is also making it "expensive and burdensome, if not 
impossible" for the city to meet state-mandated recycling goals, the complaint 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Thrasher set the matter for hearing on March 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Otting was awarded the school contract in January after submitting a five-year 
bid that was $700,000 cheaper than Great Western's bid, school officials said.

SUDDEN STORM TRIGGERS MUDSLIDES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A sudden storm swept the region Monday afternoon, clogging the Ortega Highway 
with mudslides, causing fender-benders throughout the county and knocking out 
some traffic signals but otherwise causing little damage. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The black clouds that suddenly darkened county skies dumped as much as .43 
inch of rain in 12 minutes shortly after 4 p.m. and prompted a flash flood 
watch for Orange County that was canceled several hours later, according to 
WeatherData. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the Ortega Highway, the late-afternoon deluge swept mud and rocks onto 
the roadway for miles, closing the entire Orange County stretch to traffic at 
about 4:30 p.m., a CHP spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans crews worked into the night to reopen the highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Police departments throughout the county reported fender benders but no major 
accidents, and in Costa Mesa and Newport Beach, brief power outages knocked out 
traffic signals. By 6:30 p.m., however, traffic was moving smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just had everybody and their mother out on those (traffic) calls," a Costa 
Mesa Police Department spokeswoman said. "But they were just little crashes." 
</P>
<P>
 But in Los Angeles County, rescue workers continued searching into the night 
Monday for a father and son swept away by a flash flood near their home on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 John Henderson, 34, and his son Matthew, 9, were missing and feared dead after 
water swept them down Bailey Canyon, apparently burying them in the muddy 
depths of a catch basin.  
</P>
<P>
 Officials said Henderson and his son had been hiking with several dozen other 
people Sunday afternoon when thunderstorms began raking the fire-denuded 
highlands above them. 
</P>
<P>
 The hikers said they heard a terrible rumbling as the flash flood approached. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no stream at all, maybe a half inch of water, and then this wall of 
water came down that you would not believe," said Neill Southwick, 52, a 
retired mail carrier.  
</P>
<P>
 Eight of the hikers found themselves stranded on ledges and had to be rescued 
by helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 For a while it seemed that everyone had made it to safety. It wasn't until the 
rest of the hikers had left that rescuers noticed a lone car sitting empty in 
the park's lot. 
</P>
<P>
 The search was scaled back at nightfall, but workers brought in backhoes and 
bulldozers to continue sifting through the muck in the catch basin after dark. 
</P>
<P>
 The thunderstorms that raked Southern California on Monday evening were 
largely unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtiss Brack, a meteorologist with WeatherData, which provides forecasts for 
The Times, said the problem was a storm system that was supposed to tiptoe out 
of the state during the day without causing much fuss. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead, the storm system just slowed down and decided to sit still for a 
while," he said. "It was a very active system." 
</P>
<P>
 The forecast for today and Wednesday calls for patchy early-morning coastal 
fog, but otherwise mostly sunny skies, with highs in mid-60s to mid-70s, 
according to WeatherData. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary rainfall figures from the Orange County Environmental Management 
Agency show the storm hit particularly hard in South County, dropping .39 inch 
on Saddleback Peak, and .55 inch at one San Clemente site. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana logged .28 inch of rain, .35 inch fell at the Villa Park Dam, and 
Laguna Beach got .12 inch. Brea and Seal Beach, however, logged less than .04 
inch of rain, an EMA spokesman said.

POLICE SEEK HIT-AND-RUN DRIVER; MOTORCYCLIST MAY LOSE LEG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police were seeking help Monday in finding a hit-and-run driver who fled an 
accident that may cost a motorcyclist his left leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim resident Victor Lee Tucker, 34, was riding his motorcycle through the 
intersection of Euclid Street and Medical Center Drive at 2:15 a.m. Saturday 
when he was struck from behind by a small gray pickup truck, perhaps a Mazda, 
officers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker was thrown to the pavement and suffered a compound fracture of his left 
leg, which may have to be amputated below the knee, officers said. He was 
listed in stable condition at UCI Medical Center in Orange on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the pickup never stopped after hitting Tucker, officers said. He 
was described as a Latino in his 20s with short dark hair and wearing a gray 
shirt, officers said. Witnesses or anyone with information is asked to call 
Anaheim police investigators at (714) 254-1861 or (714) 254-1835.

LOOKOUTS NET 4 LOBSTER POACHING SUSPECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK. I PINSKY, TIMES STAF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A nighttime stakeout by lobster fishermen from the bluffs overlooking the 
harbor led to the arrests of four people suspected of lobster poaching, 
authorities said Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 Dan Sforza, a warden with the State Fish and Game Department, said that 
members of the Dana Cove Commercial Fishermen's Assn. had complained for months 
that their lobster traps outside the breakwater had been poached. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their complaints have been heard often," Sforza said, "but, of course, we 
can't mind their traps around the clock, so the fishermen are beginning to take 
it upon themselves to protect traps from robbers." 
</P>
<P>
 Association members staked out the harbor from the bluffs on Feb. 20, watching 
as boats left the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 When association observers noticed an 18-foot skiff switch off its running 
lights at 2 a.m., in the area of their traps, they notified the Orange County 
Sheriff's Harbor Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 However, operators of the skiff refused to allow the deputies to inspect the 
boat without a search warrant. Sforza was called, and invoked a Fish and Game 
Code section that allows wardens to inspect boats under certain circumstances 
without a warrant. 
</P>
<P>
 Sforza said he found 53 lobsters, 44 of them undersized, on board, along with 
a crude pulley device. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no other lobster fishing gear on board," he said, "only a fishing 
pole with which one might snag a lobster," which would also be illegal. "But 
there were no snag marks on any of the lobsters." 
</P>
<P>
 The night's big winners were the seized lobsters, which were freed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way of telling which (traps) they came from," Sforza said. 
</P>
<P>
 The four suspects, who face a variety of misdemeanor counts, were identified 
as: Cao Van Le, 19, Mot Van Le, 70, and Be Thi Le, 69, all of Westminster; and 
Van Le Thanh, 22, of Garden Grove. It is unknown if the four are related.

MAN WOUNDED BY GUNSHOT; AUTO SHOP OWNER ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 25-year-old man was shot and wounded in the chest just before 11 a.m. 
Monday, police said, and the 26-year-old owner of an auto repair shop was 
arrested in connection with the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph Marlin Cox was found wounded outside the shop in the 16400 block of 
Gothard Street and taken to UCI Medical Center in Orange for surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested Shawn McCarthy at the scene, in a light industrial area. 
</P>
<P>
 A woman who owns a nearby store, who did not want to be identified, said: "We 
heard 10 or 12 moans and groans. . . . This has been a very nice area. 
Nothing's ever happened like this before. We're stunned."

17-YEAR-OLD IS SHOT, FRIEND BEATEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 17-year-old Cypress youth was shot and wounded and his friend was beaten 
after a group of suspected gang members asked them their gang affiliation 
outside a video arcade late Sunday evening, police said.  
</P>
<P>
 The attack occurred outside the Western Arcade about 11 p.m., said Cypress 
Police Lt. Jim Weuve. 
</P>
<P>
 Police did not release the victims' names because they are minors. Weuve said 
police are searching for three to 10 males, ages 17 to 18, in connection with 
the attack.  
</P>
<P>
 The Cypress youth was shot in the left side, and his friend, a 17-year-old of 
Anaheim, was beaten with empty beer and soda bottles, Weuve said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Sgt. Larry Bandy said the Cypress youth suffered a superficial wound. 
</P>
<P>
 The bullet "passed through his clothes and grazed him," Bandy said. "He was 
very lucky." 
</P>
<P>
 Bandy said the teen-ager was treated and released. His friend was 
hospitalized, but his condition was not immediately known.

INJURY BEHIND HIM, NISTA LOOKING AHEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN ARRITT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The discomfort in Brett Nista's right shoulder came to light his sophomore 
year during a stretch in which he was named the starting pitcher the last six 
games of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 It bothered him every time he lifted his right hand above his head, but it was 
nothing a handful of deep freeze medication couldn't numb. 
</P>
<P>
 He continued playing through the summer and into his junior year at Laguna 
Hills High School, where he hid his ailment by switching to first base. 
</P>
<P>
 It was hard to believe Nista was playing hurt. After all, he hit .430 with 11 
home runs, 37 runs scored and 28 runs batted in during the regular season, 
leading the Hawks to their fifth consecutive Pacific Coast League title. 
</P>
<P>
 But after a two-week trip to San Antonio to play in the Olympic Festival with 
the top prospects in the country, Nista passed on a chance to join the national 
team and opted for surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 "They shaved the bone," Nista said. "I had a hook in my shoulder bone and it 
was causing tendinitis." 
</P>
<P>
 The discomfort in his shoulder is gone now, and Nista said his arm has never 
felt better. 
</P>
<P>
 This season he'll move back to shortstop, where he'll anchor one of the best 
infields in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't wait to get started," he said. "This is going to be our best 
season yet. This whole school is into it. Signs are going up. It's never been 
like this before." 
</P>
<P>
 There's no hiding his enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 Nista's impressive junior year is showing in the number of preseason 
publications that have ranked him among the nation's best. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball America rates him No. 43 in the nation, though Nista said that figure 
would be higher if not for his surgery, and he was one of only three 
Californians selected to the Mizuno preseason All-American team. 
</P>
<P>
 But the big story is not what he has done, but what he's about to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Nista began the season needing only 33 hits to surpass Tustin's Shawn Green, 
Orange County's career hit leader with 147. Green, who plays for the Toronto 
Blue Jays' triple-A team, surpassed former Hawk Chris Scheff in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Another county record within sights is the career home run record of 22 shared 
by former Dana Hills player Lance Marks and Andy Ruscitto of Valencia. Nista 
has 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting enough quality pitches to swing at would be a problem in most 
circumstances, but Nista benefits from having two-year all-league designated 
hitter Ron DeVito hitting behind him in the cleanup spot. 
</P>
<P>
 And if a pitcher tries to pitch around Nista and DeVito, all-league second 
baseman Casey Bennett bats fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 An interesting aspect, or terrifying aspect if your team has to play Laguna 
Hills, are Nista's speed and baserunning skills, his best assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Nista admits he could use a steadier glove in the field, but at the same time, 
he says playing defense is his favorite part of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love defense. In fact, I like it more than hitting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Signed, sealed and ready to be delivered to UCLA upon graduation, Nista passed 
on some traditional baseball powerhouses in favor of the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
 Louisiana State, the defending NCAA champion, was a candidate, but Nista was 
worried about the unpredictable weather. 
</P>
<P>
 "They tried to tell me it never rains there, but at the same time it was 
pouring outside," he said. "They even have a slant behind home plate to drain 
off the rainwater." 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach State invited Nista for an informal visit, but Cal State Fullerton 
didn't contact him at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Other visits to Miami, Arizona and USC were intriguing, but college life in 
Westwood appeared too good to pass up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted the experience of a college environment," he said. "If Miami was in 
California, I would have gone there." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the atmosphere, Nista, who has a 3.7 grade-point average, 
thinks highly of UCLA Coach Gary Adams and the number of former Bruins now 
playing in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "They put more players in the majors than any other college," Nista said. 
</P>
<P>
 With his arm troubles behind him, Nista is glad to be thinking ahead. 1992-93

 Laguna Hills was again the toast of the PCL, winning its fifth consecutive 
league title. The Hawks had only two setbacks in league play, including a 4-2 
loss to Century late in the season after Laguna Hills had clinched the 
championship. The Hawks' other loss was their league opener at Laguna Beach, 
when the Artists rallied on a two-out game-winning home run by Ryan Sauers 
following a hit batsman and two errors. Sauers also got the victory on the 
mound. . . . Century had its best season in four years led by Pacific Coast 
League player of the year Tommy Reimers. . . . The race for third place went 
down to the wire, with Trabuco Hills slipping into postseason competition by 
one game. . . . Laguna Beach played the upset role, defeating Laguna Hills and 
Century, while Costa Mesa struggled through a long season. Standings
