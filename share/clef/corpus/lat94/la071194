 ISLAND NATIVES: Scientists and environmentalists are battling to save native 
species in danger of vanishing from Channel Islands National Park (B1). . . . 
The island chain off the Ventura County coast is home to more than 30 
threatened species of plants and animals. . . . "The Channel Islands have a 
number of endemic species found no place else in California or in the world," 
said Mark Skinner, staff botanist for the California Native Plant Society. 
"From a biological standpoint, they're priceless." 
</P>
<P>
 ROAD TO RECOVERY: Seven years after being crippled by an earthquake, 
Whittier's historic business district is still being rebuilt (Voices, B10). . . 
. Folks in Fillmore hope that their road to recovery won't be so long. That 
city's commercial core was badly damaged by the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. 
. . . "We think that downtown is the heart and soul of Fillmore," City Manager 
Roy Payne said. "It's important to the overall long-term viability of this 
community to rebuild downtown as quickly as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 LION QUEEN: Interior designer Sara Alviani is the new president of the Ventura 
Downtown Lions Club, the first woman to hold the post in the club's 71-year 
history. . . . But she's not making a big deal about her historic appointment: 
She's more interested in continuing the club's history of community service. . 
. . "I don't like to make it an issue that I'm a woman; it's just kind of hard 
to avoid sometimes," Alviani said. "I just want to give something back to our 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 TRUSTY TRUSTEE: Life outside public office for Elaine K. Garber? The stars say 
fat chance. . . . Appointed to the Hueneme school board in 1959, Garber is now 
the longest-serving trustee in Ventura County and one of the most senior in the 
state. The civic activist, who runs an astrology business out of her home, is 
considering a run this fall for a ninth term on the school board. . . . Garber 
is also a well-known history buff and was the first woman president of the 
county's Historical Society. . . . "I don't like to just talk about 'Someone 
should do this,' " Garber said. "If I'm able to do it, I do it."

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: SECOND OPINION; 
COMMENT FROM OTHER MEDIA; BLACK ORANGE; BY KNOWING HISTORY WE FOCUS OURSELVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a commentary by Jack Crawford, publisher of Black Orange, a monthly 
publication listing activities of interest to African Americans in Orange 
County. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I find it most unfortunate that so many of our people have no idea of what 
happened to bring about their existence beyond the fact that they had parents. 
I'm really getting tired of people telling me that our history as a people in 
this world is not important to our day-to-day struggles ("History is 
irrelevant! What's past, is past!"). I'm also really tired of black people who 
reject their African ancestry ("I'm no African, I'm American!"). 
</P>
<P>
 While many of our people reject Jewish people as friends of our race, we can 
learn from them. Nearly any Jew picked at random can tell you how the struggles 
of his people inspire perseverance, dedication and higher goal-setting. It is 
this sense of history which is instilled in nearly every Jewish child that 
makes such a difference in their sense of unity and pride. 
</P>
<P>
 This may sound like a very generalized statement but it's true: If we really 
understood the suffering our ancestors endured to survive long enough for the 
next generation to carry on, we would know that our outstanding debt to those 
people does not allow for any of us not doing our best at anything we can 
contribute. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, I saw a movie called "Sankofa." If you ever get a chance to see it, 
please, please do. It will acquaint you with the hardships of slavery through 
the experiences of a 1990s' woman who is magically transported back in time to 
a life in bondage 300 years ago. Most of us today would say that we couldn't be 
a slave. The facts are that some of our ancestors felt the same way. Only one 
day they were captured, placed on a ship and sold into slavery in a very 
strange and very distant place. 
</P>
<P>
 Now we have a few opportunities. Life ain't easy but we have chances we never 
had before. Do your best at every shot. Our ancestors demand it. It is the only 
way you can begin to repay them for their suffering. Remember, suicide might 
have been an easier alternative for a person facing a life of slavery. But -- a 
whole line of people might not have been born, including you.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: TODAY'S TOPIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Among the most visible changes in American life over the last 30 years is the 
decline of that most American of institutions: Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
 In cities throughout the country, streets formerly lined by mom-and-pop retail 
stores, drugstores and soda fountains, clothing shops and movie theaters have 
been transformed into depressing collages of boarded and abandoned buildings, 
or razed altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California, however, there are urban street-shopping centers -- 
Larchmont Village, Leimert Park and Studio City, to name a few -- that are 
vital and drawing customers who otherwise might have flocked to suburban 
shopping malls. 
</P>
<P>
 No where is that revitalization more visible than at the Uptown shopping 
district in Whittier, which was devastated by a 1987 earthquake. In today's 
Favorite Places, Whittier resident Kathryn Sampson talks about the need for and 
benefits of accessible neighborhood shopping. 
</P>
<P>
 The need for accessible neighborhood shopping in urban areas is urgent, but 
economic and safety issues and lack of space create what many retailers fear is 
an unsuitable environment for shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a critical shortage of good shopping for inner-city residents," says 
Richard Peiser, associate professor of urban and regional planning at USC. "I 
believe there's hope but it's an uphill battle." 
</P>
<P>
 Persuading large chain stores to open smaller operations in central cities is 
key to revitalizing neighborhoods, say experts. "Major grocery stores need a 
minimum of five acres to build," says Peiser. "Most city sites are a lot 
smaller and smaller stores are typically less efficient. Yet, the largest chain 
store in Germany operates smaller stores and they are demonstrating that it can 
be done successfully." 
</P>
<P>
 But Linda Griego, director of RLA, formerly Rebuild LA, believes it is 
possible to develop urban shopping areas that create community without 
mall-style anchor and chain stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "Santa Ana has the perfect example of an urban shopping area that works," 
Griego says. "It caters very much to that community. If you walk down those six 
or seven blocks, you won't see any name-brand shops. There will be an ice-cream 
shop but it won't be Baskin Robbins. There will be a print shop but it won't be 
a Kinko's. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real key to making these urban shopping areas work is catering to the 
marketing needs of the consumer who lives there," says Griego. 
</P>
<P>
 High on this list for many store owners is the need to create a sense of 
identity for the community. "Leimert Park is the last all-black business area 
in Los Angeles," says Brian Breye, owner of the store Museum in Black. "We're 
teaching youngsters, other African-Americans, to take pride in what they own." 
</P>
<P>
 The value of his store and others like his, says Breye, was brought home in 
the disturbances after the first Rodney King trial: "Members of the community 
thought my building was going to catch on fire and they removed over 10,000 
items from my store across the street. Nothing was stolen . . . and (the 
neighbors) fed us for five days."

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: SERMON; THE REWARD 
OF COMPASSION IS A FEELING OF RIGHTNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARIKA DHARMA, The Rev. Sarika Dharma is head monk at the International 
Buddhist Meditation Center in Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The other day, a friend's parked car was totaled. Coming back from an errand, 
she saw that the street where she had parked was blocked off by police, a 
police helicopter was circling overhead, and the K-9 corps were sniffing the 
yards and alleys. Talking to the people who were standing around watching the 
action, she discovered that a man had committed two armed robberies, stolen a 
car and, driving it about 60 m.p.h. on this residential street, had smashed 
into her car, pushing it into another car. If she had returned five minutes 
earlier, she would have been in her car when it was hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Just another day in the city; random violence is not an extraordinary 
experience anymore. Needless to say, she felt both lucky that she hadn't been 
there at the time of impact and invaded by the loss of her car, her time and 
her peaceful day. Her anxiety, however, was somewhat alleviated when people she 
had never met before reached out to her. During the three-hour wait until the 
police had finished their search, she was offered the use of a phone, a place 
to sit and wait, a glass of water or a cup of coffee, and, mainly, emotional 
support. Understanding. Compassion. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to be open to each other in these times. We don't feel safe. We 
drive around in our bubbles of glass and metal, keeping ourselves separate from 
the rest of the community. After the earthquake, when the freeways and roads 
were impassable or the drives took three to four times as long as before, 
people car-pooled. But as things have settled down, we're back to one in a car 
going our separate ways. As we walk down the street, we rarely look each other 
in the eye. And if there are homeless people begging, we try not to look at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 Reaching out to help someone in need gives us a feeling of rightness, of the 
way things are meant to be. That better part of our selves, our spiritual 
aspect, deserves expression. It comes out more easily at times of crisis and 
disaster, when we see human beings in need and forget to ask, "Are those people 
like me? Is it safe to reach out to them?" 
</P>
<P>
 During the riots in 1992 , people from the neighborhoods where the violence 
was happening went out to help the victims they saw on the TV reports. 
Afterward, people came from all over the Southern California area to help with 
the cleanup as well as to donate food and clothing. It was the same after this 
year's earthquake. Fires and floods bring us together. But what about everyday 
life? 
</P>
<P>
 By closing ourselves off, we deny our spiritual nature. When we help others, 
we feel good, because that's what spirituality is about: finding our 
connections to our own better nature, to all other beings, to the earth we 
share together. 
</P>
<P>
 In Buddhism, compassion is one of the main characteristics we work to develop. 
It is not the same as pity or sympathy; these latter two feelings separate us 
from the person who is suffering, make us feel somehow better because we can 
afford to feel sorry for someone in trouble.  
</P>
<P>
 Compassion, on the other hand, means feeling with, truly understanding the 
other person's experience of suffering, and then being there for them -- not to 
fix their lives, not to tell them what to do, but to help in whatever way we 
can -- offering the needed glass of water. 
</P>
<P>
 As we develop our spiritual nature, we become more peaceful, happier and 
ultimately enlightened beings. Progressing along the path makes us more able to 
reach out to others. It works the other way, too. The more we can reach out to 
each other, the more our own spirituality grows.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: WHAT I'VE LEARNED; 
'EVERYONE'S LIBERAL UNTIL IT COSTS THEM A QUARTER'

By Interview by Jim Blair for The Times., MORT SAHL; Arguably America's No. 1 
political satirist, he opens on Broadway this fall with his show, Mort Sahl's 
America. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I don't know if life is really a learning experience for most people. I think 
what they want to do is take things selectively that reinforce their prejudices 
-- document all their fears as a rationale for, probably, less than mature 
behavior. It's all tied up with people deluding themselves. What gets in the 
way of learning is basically a set of pet hatreds, fears and prejudices which 
we superimpose onto different people day by day -- we're airtight, so to speak, 
against any new information, any enlightenment. 
</P>
<P>
 The most instructive thing (for me) is to listen to the audience -- it's like 
dialogue -- and they'll tell you what's OK. They'll like anything that makes 
them laugh and hate all the things that scare them to death. So you've got to 
tell them all the things that scare them to death in humorous form. You've got 
to have a point of view and then filter everything through it and the jokes 
will come. 
</P>
<P>
 What else did I learn? I learned that the Republicans believe in God and the 
Democrats believe in Santa Claus -- which is more to the point. I learned that 
everybody's a liberal until it costs them a quarter. The audience won't accept 
Nixon as innocent and they won't accept Reagan as guilty. I learned that 
witnesses in court will look directly at the district attorney and continue to 
lie -- indefinitely. What do they say? Three strikes and you're out. Unless you 
kill your parents. That's the notable exception. 
</P>
<P>
 I learned that the "new" women are just like the old men. I see women 
executives who have their own businesses because they've learned not to depend 
on men -- and they're all chain smokers, taking Inderal for high blood 
pressure, and have incipient ulcers. They turned out to be better men than we 
are.  
</P>
<P>
 It's funny to go to a cocktail party in New York and have all those people in 
show business whose incomes are in the upper 3% saying they can't wait for the 
health plan because it will cover them from the cradle to the grave. And I 
always say to them, "Why don't you join the Army? You'll get your clothes, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
 The (Broadway) show is mostly about politics, women and movies. That really 
kind of boils down America to the essence. When I was in New York I used to 
read 11 papers every day. It's evident the papers are dying, which means that 
people are more and more dependent on television. So it's no wonder they don't 
know anything. 
</P>
<P>
 It's incredible, this fascination with trivia, stuff that not only doesn't 
amount to anything now, but never will. And it's funny to watch. 
</P>
<P>
 America is like a soap opera that (keeps getting renewed) every year. They 
won't change the script; they just keep changing the cast. They keep changing 
Presidents. You know the show needs somebody to go back to the hotel and 
rewrite it and instead they keep firing leading men and bringing in another 
guy. God bless Bill Clinton -- long may he waver.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: SECOND OPINION; 
COMMENT FROM OTHER MEDIA; INDIAN COUNTRY TODAY; THE OLD WAYS HOLD SOLUTIONS FOR 
TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a commentary by Tim Giago, editor of Indian Country Today, a daily 
published in South Dakota and distributed widely in the West. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Loss of respect for self and others is the real downfall for today's tribal 
societies. 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent junior high school graduation I reminded the children about one 
Lakota virtue that was fast disappearing: respect. I told them we were losing 
respect for our elders, for each other and for the property of others. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, these children must grow up and compete in the real world of today. 
They are not like the children in the textbooks. Their world is not one of 
tipis, green hills, ponies, and clear, blue streams. It is one of junked cars, 
broken windows, weeds, dilapidated houses, drunken and oftentimes, abusive 
parents -- and hunger. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of these children are second and third generation welfare kids. They grew 
up with parents who had been abused, mentally and physically, at Indian 
missions and Bureau of Indian Affairs boarding schools. They are the children 
of children who lived through the great experiment in Indian education known as 
"Kill the Indian; Save the Child." The consequences of those ill-advised 
government programs are coming home to roost and the victims are now the 
perpetrators. 
</P>
<P>
 When a race of people has been victim to a system intended to destroy them as 
a people, it is easy to understand why they have had such a hard time finding 
their way in the modern world. 
</P>
<P>
 On one reservation in Arizona nearly one dozen young people have committed 
suicide in the past two years. When this became a trend on the Wind River 
Reservation in Wyoming a few years ago, the elders and the holy men stepped 
forward and took the children back spiritually. It worked. After a while it's 
hard to tell where delusions end and reality begins. But as happened at Wind 
River, a return to the old ways can lead to the solutions so badly needed by 
the young of today.

 Cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, I was told that my type of lymphoma had a high cure rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, after a nonstop arsenal of almost every chemotherapy drug ever 
invented, daily radiation treatments for two months and a month's stay in a 
hospital isolation room completing a bone marrow transplant, I was handed a 
terminal prognosis. I was given the option of receiving more chemotherapy, even 
though all my treatment in the past had failed. 
</P>
<P>
 I lay in bed with a pharmacy of pills and a stockpile of alternative cancer 
literature and pondered my next move. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the hope of a possible cure, it had been difficult enough to face 
the continuous needles and nausea of chemotherapy. Now, they called me 
"terminal" and tried to sell me on the idea of continued chemotherapy as "the 
only thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 My heart told me that, at only 19, I was far from ready to die. My books told 
me there was a cornucopia of alternative treatments to try. My mind told me 
there was only one thing to do: I was going to heal myself or die trying. 
</P>
<P>
 I was immediately attracted to and intrigued with the macrobiotic diet. Both a 
philosophy and nutritional system, macrobiotics theory is that cancer growth 
can be slowed or even stopped when one adheres to an all organic, radically 
low-fat, low-protein, no sugar, high-fiber diet -- basically a whole grain, 
vegetable-based diet. I flew to the Berkshires of New England and for 10 days 
embarked on a new way of eating. Black seaweed. Sticky brown rice. Bitter 
greens. These would become my staple foods. It wasn't an easy transition. Pain 
riddled my cancerous body. A mourning of all the past foods and restaurants I 
loved surfaced. But day by day, meal by meal, I persevered. 
</P>
<P>
 Gradually I was getting stronger and the cancer, while it wasn't vanishing, 
was stabilizing. I also began to enjoy my new diet. I was metamorphosing myself 
from a fast-food junkie into a connoisseur of whole grains and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooking became my passion. I looked at each day as another opportunity to 
create fresh, healthy and beautiful meals. With my new-found energy, I also 
learned yoga and started seeing a therapist to figure out patterns of behavior 
that were limiting me. 
</P>
<P>
 My symptoms of disease, now not constant, would come and go like night and 
day. I'd have a great day and then all of a sudden at 1 o'clock in the morning, 
I'd wake up crying in pain. I was not bedridden nor was I the picture of 
radiant health I worked so hard to achieve. But there was more: Something gave 
way inside of me and I began focusing on getting the most out of my life by 
turning my physical limitations into limitless thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 New, exciting "firsts" happened. My first camping experience. My 
two-and-a-half- year absence from school ended as I began college. For the 
first time in my life, I cultivated meaningful and deep friendships. I resolved 
to live each day to my fullest, taking loving care of myself, and, through 
relaxation and deep breathing,not getting overwhelmed during times of physical 
pain. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months ago I celebrated my two-year survival since the doctor's (not 
mine) issuance of a terminal prognosis. I recently saw my oncologist who humbly 
admitted that I did more for myself than he could have ever dreamed of doing 
for me. 
</P>
<P>
 While the words "cured" or even "remission" are not something he or even I 
would use, we both know that what I've accomplished is pretty special. 
</P>
<P>
 Quite recently, a lump in my groin has been exploding in size. Pain-free 
moments are few and far between. There are still many possible treatments. I 
could try a newly invented chemotherapy regime or one of the many 
non-mainstream alternative treatments. It seems very much like two years ago 
revisited. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside me, beneath the joy of being alive and the pain I endure from being 
alive, is my intuitive spirit. I will let it guide me down the path that is 
right for me. 
</P>
<P>
 My journey continues.

 In most cities you can take a bus without explaining why. In Los Angeles, you 
only take a bus if you don't have a car. Mine was stolen. I took to using a 
bicycle, then a car came out of a driveway and hit me. So, now, with the 
explanation clearly understood, the story can begin. One would not wish to be 
mistaken for a bus rider. Yet, on this particular day there is no other place I 
would rather have been. 
</P>
<P>
 I left the San Fernando Valley on the 212 line and changed buses at La Brea 
and Melrose avenues to go west. I needed to stop at a bookstore, pick up some 
vitamins and see my printer. There was plenty of room on the bus and I got a 
seat across from the driver. 
</P>
<P>
 At the second stop, a crowd was waiting. The driver, a large, 
wholesome-looking man a reassuring voice, intercepted the first young guy in 
the crowd to explain that he needed to pay his fare or give up the top of his 
transfer. It was immediately apparent that the fellow didn't speak English and 
he seemed also not to understand the driver's few words of Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the angel appeared. 
</P>
<P>
 She pushed forward into the bus to explain the transfer business. She 
introduced herself to the driver and told him these were visiting French 
students she was showing around. She had a round-cheeked, smiling face and a 
cap of playful curls. She took the transfer and held it aloft so the others 
waiting to board the bus could see it. She spoke in broken French and, not 
knowing the French word for top, she did as most Americans tend to do: She 
repeated the word in English several times, louder each time. It was instant 
entertainment. It was instantly charming. The driver, whose name was Herman, 
driver No. 427, played right into the wonderful madness as the crowd of young 
Frenchmen clambered on board. Each allowed the angel, whose name was Crystal, 
to remove the transfer's top and give it to Herman. There was much chattering 
in French and Crystal, in English, lamented her limited French. 
</P>
<P>
 Herman asked her why she was chaperoning all these French students if she 
didn't speak much French. With a twirling little gesture, she indicated that 
someone had to do it and herded her charges into seats on the bus. Herman, 
taken by the challenge, began announcing sights along the way. The young men 
knew it was for them. They had no clue as to what he was saying yet they chimed 
together, "OHHHH." Herman laughed and said "Oui" over the microphone. Then he 
said, "Crystal, get up here and announce for them." She scrambled to the front 
of the bus, took the driver's microphone and in her fractured Franglish, 
pointed out Fairfax High. Now something happened that only two people in the 
world witnessed. One was Herman, No. 427, and the other was me. As the bus 
crossed Fairfax, one person at the bus stop suddenly leaned out onto the street 
and bent down. It seemed certain he would be decapitated. Herman skillfully 
avoided the tragedy and did so without upsetting the equilibrium of his 
passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 "What in the world?" I asked, to which Herman replied, "He was picking up a 
cigarette butt." 
</P>
<P>
 Only because of Herman did he survive to enjoy it at a later time. He dropped 
it into a pocket and climbed on board. He took the seat just inside the door, 
sparing the other passengers the abrasive odor of his presence. 
</P>
<P>
 Crystal took up her duties at the microphone and her charges uttered more 
unison "OOOHHs" at appropriate moments. It was like July 4, when the audience 
"OOOHHs" as one for the fireworks. And then something happened that I think 
only I noticed. Crystal struggled with her explanations of passing sites and 
was clearly searching for words. Finally she said, "I wish I knew how to say, 
'I'm proud to show you my city.' " The derelict leaned forward and supplied her 
with the words she needed in French. I don't know if she knew where the words 
came from. The students cheered her again. Herman guided the bus to the curb at 
La Cienega and Crystal told the garcons it was their stop. They surged forward, 
thanking everyone for a fine ride. 
</P>
<P>
 And so Crystal, from Van Nuys, led her students out into the city and Herman, 
No. 427, took his bus west on the last leg of its journey. At the closing 
moments of a miraculous afternoon, my thoughts returned to the derelict, his 
narrow escape, and all of the offhanded generosity of which angels are made.

SHARE YOUR TOYS, PLAY NICE; ANOTHER UNSEEMLY HASSLE OVER YET ANOTHER SET OF 
NIXON TAPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard Nixon wove many a tangled web in his lengthy and controversial career. 
One of his unintended legacies has the National Archives in the uncomfortable 
position of keeping research material secret. It's a federal agency that should 
be dedicated to preserving the nation's history for the public. 
</P>
<P>
 The centerpiece of a dispute between the National Archives and Nixon's alma 
mater, Whittier College, is the availability of audiotapes. 
</P>
<P>
 After Nixon became President in 1969, Whittier was chosen as the site of his 
presidential library. A Whittier professor interviewed relatives, friends and 
neighbors concerning the years 1913 to 1946 (a period ending just before the 
start of his political career) for an oral history. A foundation was 
established to raise funds for the library but found the task impossible after 
Nixon resigned the presidency in disgrace due to the Watergate scandal, in 
which an entirely different set of tapes played a key role. 
</P>
<P>
 As the foundation folded, it deeded the tapes to some future Nixon 
presidential library, and the National Archives took them for safekeeping. They 
now reside in the archives' branch in the Orange County community of Laguna 
Niguel. Much other Nixon material there has been available to the public, but 
not the Whittier tapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace opened in Yorba Linda four 
years ago, the National Archives contended that it was not a real presidential 
library because it did not control the presidential papers and was not 
administered by the archives. Whittier College contends the tapes should be 
made public. 
</P>
<P>
 At the very least, the Nixon library should have copies provided by the 
archives. As Stephen Ambrose's masterful three-volume biography of Nixon 
demonstrated, historians have no dearth of materials on the man, before, during 
and after his presidency. Yet every bit helps. Insights and remembrances from 
those who knew him form parts of the mosaic of history. 
</P>
<P>
 At Nixon's funeral in Yorba Linda last April, President Clinton urged that his 
predecessor be judged on "his entire life and career." The National Archives 
should help historians in furthering that worthy goal.

'SOCIAL STIGMA FOR ABORTION' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to "A Social Stigma for Abortion? Let's Hope So," Column Right, 
July 5: New figures show that church attendance throughout North America and 
Western Europe is at its lowest since the Middle Ages. Several reasons are 
cited for this continued decline, most notably the unwillingness of thoughtful 
people to submit to the dictatorial oppression of religious rulers, including 
popes, pastors and priests. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, the shift away from organized religion has been called a 
declaration of "spiritual independence." Citing the long history of organized 
religion's oppression of women and opposition to science and independent 
thought, millions of Americans are rejecting religious dogma (written and 
enforced by men) in favor of a more personal relationship with God. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, religionists are involved in a last-ditch effort to enforce their 
beliefs through the schools, legislatures and courts. The issues of religion 
and smoking have much in common. They're both matters of individual choice. If 
a person chooses to go to church or smoke, they certainly have that right. But 
they have no right to blow smoke in your face or cram their beliefs down your 
throat.  
</P>

<P>
 I commend Susan Carpenter McMillan for her excellent article drawing an 
analogy between smoking and abortion. I would add only one more fact to her 
discussion. She stated that legalization of abortion through nine months of 
pregnancy came about through the Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade decision. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not completely accurate. There was a second opinion handed down at the 
same time: Doe vs. Bolton. These two cases were considered together as 
companion cases. Unless you know Doe you cannot understand the radical nature 
of Roe. 
</P>
<P>
 While Roe established the legality of abortion, it allowed that abortions 
could be restricted during the last three months of pregnancy unless the life 
or health of the mother were at stake. It is in Doe that we find an 
all-encompassing definition of "health": "all factors -- physical, emotional, 
psychological, familial, and the woman's age -- relevant to the well-being of 
the patient." 
</P>
<P>
 Doe not only defines the exception to the rule allowing restrictions on late 
term abortions -- it is the exception that swallowed the rule. When discussing 
the abortion issue it is essential to understand both judicial decisions which 
have brought us, up to now, 1.6 million abortions per year in the United 
States.

 Justice Antonin Scalia was correct ("Abortion Clinic Buffer Against Protest 
Upheld," July 1). The Supreme Court decision took away free-speech protections 
from those against abortion. The free speech the decision put a cap on was 
between a counselor and a woman considering an abortion. Almost daily women 
change their minds after talking with a "sidewalk" counselor. Many women going 
into an abortion clinic are being pressured by parents, peers, or a 
boyfriend/husband. When someone offers them a real choice, they make a decision 
for life. There are over 3,500 centers nationwide that help a woman through a 
problem pregnancy with genuine help, acceptance and love. 
</P>
<P>
 This decision shuts the door on allowing a desperate woman to hear both sides 
and make an informed decision. It shuts the door on real choice. Let's give 
back the right to free speech to everyone.

DORNAN ON GAYS

<TEXT>
<P>
 The cheap shots from The Times are coming at us again. Your editorial of June 
28 ("How Best to Remember Stonewall") is nothing but a transparent attempt to 
portray as bigots people who refuse to glorify the homosexual lifestyle.But 
they are not bigots. They just recognize that there is a vast difference 
between civil rights for all Americans and special rights for a group that is 
distinguished solely by its sexual conduct. They also recognize that 
homosexuality -- no matter how often it is couched in terms such as 
"alternative lifestyle" and "sexual orientation" -- is inherently immoral.  
</P>
<P>
 Even more egregious is your interpretation of my speech in opposition to 
funding for the National Endowment for the Arts. It was not a speech to "bash 
gays." It was, however, a speech designed to expose the kind of obscene 
projects, often depicting graphic homosexual acts, that are funded by the NEA. 
These projects do not fit even the loosest definition of art and run contrary 
to the standards and principles held by a clear majority of Americans. I fully 
support freedom of expression, including the arts, but using tax dollars to 
support what most Americans find abhorrent is idiotic, not to mention a 
frivolous drain on the federal budget.

THOMAS JEFFERSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to "From a Founding Father, an Imperfect Vision of America," by 
Benjamin Schwarz, Commentary, July 4; 
</P>
<P>
 Of course Thomas Jefferson owned slaves, after all, he was a powerful and 
influential Virginian plantation owner! Regardless, his papers indicate nothing 
but distaste for slavery for moral and economic reasons. Not to mention his 
wife Martha's influence: "I wish with all my soul that the poor Negroes were 
all freed. It grieves my heart when I think that these our fellow creatures 
should be treated so terribly as they are by many of our countrymen" (from a 
letter to her father from Paris, May 3, 1787). 
</P>
<P>
 Jefferson believed in the abolition of slavery as it was contrary to " . . . 
the lasting interests of the American states and to the rights of human nature 
deeply wounded by this infamous practice" (from a Draft of Instructions to the 
Virginia Delegates in the Continental Congress, July, 1774.) Jefferson viewed 
the issue with much importance as he considered it to be one of the " . . . 
great objects I have in view, that is the emancipation of their slaves, and the 
settlement of their constitution on a firmer and more permanent basis" (from a 
letter June 7, 1785.) 
</P>
<P>
 The references are from "The Papers of Thomas Jefferson," volumes 1-25, from 
1760 to 1793, Princeton University Press. The evidence I find indicates 
Jefferson was a protagonist for human rights and a most illustrious citizen. He 
most certainly was not a racist, bigot or hypocrite as Schwarz would have us 
believe. 
</P>
<P>
 DENNIS CUOCCO 
</P>
<P>
 Whittier 
</P>
<P>
 I think your decision to include this negative article on Jefferson on July 4 
is appalling. I cannot comment on the accuracy of Schwarz's comments on 
Jefferson's private life and his views on slavery and blacks. But why bring 
this up on July 4? This day has been set aside to celebrate the approval of the 
Declaration of Independence. It is a day for remembering how this great country 
was formed.

DOMENIGONI RESERVOIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I read with interest Bill Boyarsky's column on the Domenigoni Reservoir, near 
Hemet, which is being built by the Metropolitan Water District (June 22). 
</P>
<P>
 I would like to correct one statement.The majority of the 4,000 acres under 
the reservoir and most of the surrounding hills were not farmed by the 
Domenigoni family. For nearly a century, however, they were farmed for five 
generations by the Searl family and the Garbani (Joe, Fred and Jim) family. 
</P>
<P>
 The Domenigoni family actually contributes a very small percentage of the 
total acreage acquired by Metropolican Water District for the benefit of the 
reservoir. It is unfortunate that the other families who farmed the area for 
100 years seem to be forgotten by the press, and in all honesty, the MWD. 
</P>
<P>
 The MWD is calling the entire area the lake will consume Domenigoni, which 
apparently came from some old map. Most residents and "old-timers" in the Hemet 
area have always referred to the reservoir site as Diamond Valley. The pioneer 
Domenigoni family farmed a large acreage of land west of the reservoir which is 
not a part of the current reservoir site.

HOW TO SPREAD A POLICY DISEASE; WASHINGTON MUST ACT ON HEALTH-CARE REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Washington, take note: While Congress and the White House play political poker 
over how much national health care reform there should be and how soon, the 
nation's most populous state isn't waiting to play its high-stakes hand. 
</P>
<P>
 On the November state ballot is an ambitious but ill-advised initiative called 
the California Health Security Act. More than a million signatures were 
collected in order to bring the Canadian-style health care proposal up for a 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Absent action at the federal level, many Californians won't see any reason not 
to vote for the sweeping measure, which would create the largest government 
entitlement program ever put together by a state. 
</P>
<P>
 To finance a plan that would provide medical care for all lawful residents of 
California, the plan would require payroll taxes of from 4.4% to 8.9% and would 
boost the state's income tax 2.5% to 5%. This is worrisome (it would also add 
$1 a pack to the price of cigarettes, which is not). Doctors and hospitals 
would be paid by a new state agency.  
</P>
<P>
 This plan goes further than the one proposed by President Clinton, and goes 
leagues beyond most other plans being seriously discussed on Capitol Hill. 
Therein lies the political lesson for Congress: Take the lead in health care or 
accept the consequences. Failure to achieve reform at the national level can 
only spur more piecemeal state approaches such as the one now on the California 
ballot.  
</P>
<P>
 Congress has made progress: Two Senate committees and two House committees 
have passed health care reform bills. But the naysayers ("no real need for 
health care reform"), the zealots ("blow up the current system and start over") 
and the great undecided middle have been unable to reach any agreement.  
</P>
<P>
 Democrats and Republicans should come together on the issues that most can 
agree on: attacking insurance fraud, cutting paperwork, outlawing insurance 
discrimination based on pre-existing illnesses. Another reform that should be 
popular: the formation of voluntary employer alliances, like the Health 
Insurance Plan of California, the nation's first working alliance. Through the 
HIPC, workers are banding together in a large purchasing group and negotiating 
insurance rates that are 10% to 15% lower. 
</P>
<P>
 Surely Clinton and Congress can agree in these key areas, as well as on the 
proposition that any true reform bill must move this nation firmly if patiently 
toward insurance coverage for all. Time is running out for the nation's best 
chance at reform. Without it, states will go their own way, and the ultimate 
result could well reduce the momentum for comprehensive national health care 
reform.

WORD WATCH; LOWER THAT PROFILE! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Words, like clothes and food, have their fads. They are called cliches, and 
they drive good words out of the language until the cliches themselves 
ultimately wear out from overuse. Uptight remains, but who still says "it's not 
my bag"? And we can be grateful the power lunch is finally fading. Will get a 
life be next? Let's hope so. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest assault on American English is high profile , which definitely has 
a profile that qualifies as high. High profile daily tumbles thoughtlessly out 
of nearly every newscaster's mouth, every news writer's keyboard. We have 
high-profile cases, prosecutions, hearings, trials, defendants, lawyers, crime 
fighters, movies, even restaurant diners. 
</P>
<P>
 One major newspaper has used high profile 601 times already this year. 
Computer checks of various newspapers show the O. J. Simpson case has really 
opened the floodgates: High profile , to use another current cliche, is out of 
control. 
</P>
<P>
 High profile , which first came into use after about 1965, carries little 
specific meaning. The dictionary defines profile as "the side view of a head." 
Just how it got to mean so much more is obscure, but it's possibly a reverse of 
military advice about keeping one's profile low when bullets are flying. 
</P>
<P>
 The English language is rich with much more specific and informative synonyms 
and cognates. Whatever happened to prominent , famous , infamous , notorious , 
conspicuous , renowned , celebrated ? Whatever happened to good, clear writing? 
</P>
<P>
 As for high profile , let's give it a rest. Uh oh. . . .

DUMPING TRASH IN THE DESERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Can anybody hear me? 
</P>
<P>
 I live in the desert in San Bernardino County. The people in the Los Angeles 
metropolitan area have decided to send their garbage to an area near me, at 
Bolo Station.This project is called RailCycle. It would bring 20,000 tons of 
household wastes a day by train from mainly the coastal counties, and build a 
mountain 40 stories high on a dry lake over the course of 100 years. 
</P>
<P>
 We don't want your garbage. We don't need your garbage. There are alternatives 
to dumping this filth in our desert, to poisoning the water and the air and the 
futures of the folks who live out here. You have a responsibility to develop 
those alternatives. "Out of sight, out of mind" is not an acceptable course to 
follow.  
</P>
<P>
 The officials who run San Bernardino County habitually ignore the interests of 
their desert residents, and don't have the vision to see the positive potential 
of their desert areas. They are also closing their eyes to the ultimate 
terrible dollar costs to our county. In the desert we are screaming, we are 
trying everything we can think of. How can we stop this desecration? 
</P>
<P>
 I don't want to be "victimized." But some millions of carelessly blind people 
in the overdeveloped areas are ignorantly content to dump their trash on the 
folks out here and on the irreplaceable desert. And the power all seems to be 
theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 Take responsibility. The remote location you're planning to hide your trash in 
is a home to many, and the heart of a beloved desert land. Rethink this 
poisonous plan. Find out about your RailCycle plan, and stop it. We need your 
help.

CALIFORNIA COMMENTARY; EACH OBSTACLE TO CONVERSION COSTS JOBS; GOVERNMENT AT 
ALL LEVELS NEEDS TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR BUSINESS TO THRIVE ON FORMER MILITARY 
PROPERTIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE GRISSOM, Lee Grissom is Gov. Wilson's senior adviser for economic 
development and director of the state's office of planning and research.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Twenty years ago, the federal government closed a base that had been 
considered one of the best duty assignments in the military. Hamilton Air Force 
Base was a handsome enclave, with charming Spanish-style buildings situated on 
gentle hills overlooking San Pablo Bay, north of San Francisco. Today, those 
vacant structures have fallen into decay, marred by shattered windows and 
weed-sprouting cracks in their walls. 
</P>
<P>
 The planned conversion of much of Ft. Ord, near Monterey, into a Cal State 
campus and UC research facility is a far more positive fate for another 
geographically desirable military base. But it's the exception, and a publicly 
funded effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Other recent base closures are threatened with grimmer prospects. The runway 
at George Air Force Base in Southern California's high desert bears a yellow 
"X" to warn aircraft that it is closed to traffic. Post-closure preservation of 
the historic blimp hangars at the Tustin Marine Corps Air Station is in 
question because it's uncertain whether the city of Tustin can afford to 
maintain the facility for civilian use after the Marines leave. Conversion of 
Navy housing in San Pedro to a homeless facility has surrounding communities in 
arms. 
</P>
<P>
 The 22 military bases facing closure in California provided 200,000 jobs, 
directly and indirectly. But the current risks and uncertainties of converting 
the bases to private use has deterred businesses from pursuing base 
initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the reality that spurred Gov. Pete Wilson to create the California 
Military Base Reuse Task Force last year. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when we are concerned about urban sprawl, shortages of affordable 
housing and loss of jobs, military bases facing closure are exactly the places 
we should be targeting for development. All of California's affected bases are 
situated near urban areas. Making use of these sites would help avoid urban 
expansion onto agricultural or prime habitat-preservation lands. Military bases 
offer offices, warehouses, airfields, seaports, dormitories, houses and many 
other ready assets, which will deteriorate and become worthless with age and 
disuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Why are there so few takers for base property? The list of reasons is 
daunting. Most base infrastructure -- roads, street lighting, utility systems, 
water, sewer, and storm-drain pipes -- was constructed many years ago for 
self-contained communities that were fully exempt from any state or local 
standards or regulation. Mishandling of toxic wastes has resulted in messes 
that may not be fully cleaned up in our lifetimes. Federal land sale and 
leasing procedures are arcane and time-consuming. Local governments often 
bicker over future land uses and zoning. And virtually any action is burdened 
by the massive red tape that seems inherent in environmental evaluations. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite these impediments, Congress, the Defense Department and our state 
legislators, while giving lip service to base conversion, have refused to adopt 
measures that might avert the disastrous base-reuse failures that loom. To 
counteract the significant disincentives to development, state and federal laws 
must treat closing military bases differently from other parcels of land. 
Several examples come immediately to mind: 
</P>
<P>
 * The California Environmental Quality Act must be modified to encourage 
rather than inhibit reuse of military bases. For instance, environmental 
evaluations should measure pollution, traffic and other activities when the 
base was open rather than using the closed facility as a baseline. 
</P>
<P>
 * The federal McKinney Homeless Assistance Act, written before huge properties 
like surplus military bases were envisioned as potential homeless camps, must 
allow greater local community involvement in decision-making.  
</P>
<P>
 * Additional financing and development tools under California Redevelopment 
Law must be made available to base closure communities. 
</P>
<P>
 * Environmental laws that have the effect of chasing jobs away from closing 
bases must be reasonably mitigated. 
</P>
<P>
 * The military must act more quickly to clean up toxic contamination on 
closing bases and Congress must appropriate adequate funds to complete the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Implementing these remedies would be a good start toward a serious base-reuse 
policy for California and the nation. We can't afford to let Hamilton Air Force 
Base become our vision for the future of California's closing bases.

IT'S HIS CELEBRITY, NOT HIS RACE; IN HIS WEALTH AND FAME, O. J. SIMPSON IS 
INSULATED FROM RACIAL ASSUMPTIONS. IF ONLY MOST BLACK PEOPLE COULD BE TREATED 
SO FAIRLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By R. RICHARD BANKS, R. Richard Banks, a recent graduate of Harvard Law School, 
is completing a book on America's changing racial dynamics. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the rush of opinions and analyses following the arrest oJ. Simpson, few 
have been as misguided as those tagging the Simpson saga as a case of another 
black man toppled by the System. "Let a brother get too big," this chorus of 
voices declares, "and the white man will bring him down. Now he's going to find 
out what it is like to be treated like a black man." In addition to his fame 
and wealth, his marriage to a white woman, the argument goes, is what made it 
necessary to bring him down. This cluster of views ranges from the assertion 
that Simpson was quickly considered a suspect because he is black to the claim 
that he was set up by the police or other officials -- framed. Similar laments 
were heard during the legal troubles of Marion Barry, Michael Tyson and, to a 
lesser extent, Michael Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 For all their rhetorical flourish, such claims misconstrue the contemporary 
role of race in American society and interpret a 1990s event through the lens 
of an outdated 1960s vision of race relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of this argument ignore the reality: Simpson has been treated more 
in accord with his class and celebrity status than his race. Even after 
evidence connected him to the murders, police granted Simpson the dignity of 
turning himself in rather than arresting him as they would a less famous 
suspect. And if people were trying to bring him down, they could have done so 
during those many occasions when the police were called to his home because of 
his brutalizing Nicole Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 O. J. has escaped many of the limits that other black men regularly encounter, 
both in his life and during this criminal proceeding. The overworked publicly 
financed lawyers who represent most black men accused of felonies often 
plea-bargain without the benefit of elaborate strategizing or excruciatingly 
detailed preliminary hearings. In contrast, some of our nation's premier 
criminal defense attorneys have joined Simpson's defense team. 
</P>
<P>
 Before this tragedy, Simpson's public persona, including his marriage to 
Nicole, had made him more acceptable to many whites, not more threatening (as 
would have been the case a generation or more ago). His famous Hertz ads were 
not targeted toward black audiences; they had nothing to do with race. As 
America's most celebrated black athlete at the outset of the post-segregation 
era, Simpson led the way for others, including Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley 
and Bo Jackson, to attain levels of commercial success and public adoration not 
limited by their race. 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of overwhelming circumstantial evidence, many people, white and 
black, cling to their belief that Simpson could not have committed the murders. 
"It just doesn't seem like the type of thing he'd do,' people explain. Had he 
not been insulated by personal wealth and celebrity from prevailing societal 
attitudes toward black men, the presumption would have been the opposite. The 
people lining the freeways during that slow-speed chase did not cheer for 
Simpson's capture. They showered him with the same words of encouragement as 
when he darted past tacklers on the football field: "Go, O. J., go!" 
</P>
<P>
 For sure, this society remains hostile to black men and there are undoubtedly 
bigots who revel in Simpson's downfall. But we are past the time when all black 
Americans are smeared with the same broad brush of explicit racial bias. 
</P>
<P>
 Race relations are more complex and nuanced than a few generations ago. Race 
does play a role in contemporary society, but not its predictable, traditional 
role. Distorted racial imagery lingers in our national consciousness and our 
painful past reaches into the present. Nowhere is that more evident than in our 
national discourse about crime. Our willingness to imprison young black men 
reveals a presumption of worthlessness and criminality. Although legislators 
talk about harsh criminal sanctions in terms of fear of crime, rather than 
race, the two mix in ways people often prefer to ignore. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the norms against bias and stereotyping mean that the underlying racial 
images are rarely expressed openly. And more than at any previous time, the 
social mobility afforded by wealth and celebrity allows countless black 
Americans to separate themselves from the prevailing social image of black 
Americans. People like Simpson are exempt from what others have called "the 
black tax." Thus, how other people see him, and perhaps how he sees himself, 
results more from the individual identity he has carved in the American mind 
than from his race. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever happens, O. J. will not only not be lynched, high-tech or otherwise; 
he will receive the fullest protections the Constitution provides. If only most 
black Americans did as well.

 Frustrated with cellular phones and laptops that run out of power? 
</P>
<P>
 Samsonite Corp. and Besicorp Group Inc. have teamed up to produce a briefcase 
equipped with a solar panel that can collect solar energy for such electronic 
goods. 
</P>
<P>
 The luggage manufacturer and the alternative-energy company announced a joint 
venture in which Sun Wize Energy Systems Inc., a subsidiary of Besicorp., will 
manufacture the battery panels and Samsonite will install them in its 
briefcases. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel unit will be about the height and width of a standard sheet of paper 
and as thick as two credit cards. The panel, which is featherweight, can pool 
energy from direct sunlight or indirect artificial lighting. 
</P>
<P>
 A universal plug, similar to the attachment that can tap battery power through 
a car's cigarette lighter, will transfer the collected energy to cellular 
phones, laptops and other electronic gear, according to a Samsonite spokesman. 
The solar briefcase should be on the market by the spring of 1995, he said.

SHOP TALK: WORKER SHOULD CLEAR UP ISSUE OF SMOKY OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Question: I just started working for a new company and found there is a chain 
smoker in the office, which has no ventilation. I'm afraid I'll get fired if I 
tell my bosses that I can't work in such a smoky environment. What do you 
suggest I do about a chain smoker in the same office and an employer not 
willing to do anything about it? 
</P>
<P>
 -- V.C., Anaheim 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: There is no general legal requirement that an employer control the 
smoking habits of its employees, unless smoking poses a safety hazard in a 
particular work location or if another employee has a medical intolerance for 
tobacco smoke. However, there is no reason for you to continue working in 
discomfort. First, try to discuss the problem with the smoker -- most smokers 
do not want to make nonsmokers uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 If that does not work or if you feel uneasy about confronting the smoker, take 
the matter up with a supervisor or the personnel manager. Simply raising the 
issue is unlikely to get you fired. Most employers want their employees to have 
a comfortable working environment so that they can be as productive as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, many employers have policies designed to promote a smoke-free 
workplace. While your question suggests that your employer does not, you may 
not find out for sure if you do not bring up the subject. If your employer is 
unresponsive, you should investigate whether the office building has its own 
smoke-free policy. Also, some localities may have adopted smoke-free 
ordinances, so you should check with your local elected officials.

 Question: I want to know if there is a law governing the number of sick leaves 
an employee is entitled to in a year. 
</P>
<P>
 -- G.B., Lake Forest 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Paid sick leave is not required by law. Many employers, however, allow 
employees the use of sick leave for family illnesses as a company policy. 
</P>
<P>
 California does require employers to provide pregnant employees up to four 
months of unpaid pregnancy leave under the California Fair Employment Practices 
law, and the federal Family & Medical Leave Act of 1993 requires employers with 
50 or more employees to provide up to 12 weeks off per year to employees for 
adoption, birth or care of sick children, spouses or parents.

 Question: What constitutes a week of vacation? We are all salaried and work in 
the property management industry, which has staffing seven days a week. 
Recently our supervisor has started requiring us to commit our time-off 
requests before making a new schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 In the event a person requests a week's vacation, he receives five days off 
but is usually required to work the day before and the day after the vacation 
period. We feel we should be permitted to add vacation time to our regular days 
off to create nine consecutive days off, considering that we have earned the 
vacation time. Is this legitimate? 
</P>
<P>
 -- P.G., Seal Beach 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Let's first clarify some main points. Vacation benefits, which are a 
gift from an employer, are among the most common of benefits. Any legal rights 
to such benefits normally arise only where vacations are included as a 
provision in an employment contract, a collective bargaining agreement or 
stated as a written employer policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Provided it doesn't violate any state or federal law, conditions placed upon 
taking vacation time are up to the employer. Review your employer policy to 
determine how much vacation time you have available, and if you need the 
weekends before and after the specified vacation time, request this as well.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; MCGWIRE'S HOMER SPOILS BID BY ORIOLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Oakland Athletics closed the first half of the season in dramatic fashion 
Sunday, robbing the Baltimore Orioles of a chance to take over the top spot in 
the American League East. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark McGwire hit a two-run homer off Lee Smith in the ninth inning at 
Baltimore, rallying the A's past the Orioles, 5-4. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orioles were three outs away from moving into first place when McGwire hit 
an 0-2 pitch over the center field wall. The homer, his seventh, followed a 
leadoff single by Ruben Sierra. 
</P>
<P>
 A victory would have pushed the Orioles past the first-place New York Yankees, 
who lost to the Angels, 9-6. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have been exciting to win this one today, have the crowd get into it 
and see Smitty shut them down 1-2-3," Baltimore Manager Johnny Oates said. "It 
didn't happen, but we've got a bunch of games to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith (1-2), who's headed to the All-Star Game, has only four blown saves in 
33 chances. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't trying to throw it down the middle of the plate," Smith said. "I 
missed my spot -- and the big man didn't miss his." 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Darling (8-9) allowed four runs and six hits in eight innings in beating 
Baltimore for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 6, Texas 5 -- Tony Phillips tagged Tom Henke for a three-run homer 
with two outs in the ninth inning to rally the Tigers at Detroit in the final 
game between the two teams this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad I don't have to see this place again," Henke said. "That's twice 
they got me this year on fly balls." 
</P>
<P>
 On May 2, Kirk Gibson hit a three-run, pinch-hit homer in the 10th inning off 
Henke to beat the Rangers, 10-8. But it has been a familiar scene for the Texas 
bullpen, which leads the major leagues with 18 blown saves -- five by Henke 
(2-4). 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Boever (7-2) pitched a hitless 2 1/3 innings in relief of starter David 
Wells for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers, skipping batting practice for the second day in a row, tagged 
Wells for five runs and 10 hits in 6 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Ranger reliever John Dettmer got within one out of his first major-league 
victory after pitching five innings of two-hit ball in relief of Texas starter 
Kevin Brown, who was ejected in the third. After Brown gave up a homer to Cecil 
Fielder, he charged plate umpire Fielding Culbreth while Fielder was circling 
the bases. Brown was upset over a pitch he thought was a strike before 
Fielder's full-count homer. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 9, Minnesota 1 -- Kenny Lofton, who hit only six home runs in his 
first two seasons, hit his 10th in the Indians' victory at Minneapolis. The 
center fielder had four hits and four runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 Lofton homered off Scott Erickson (8-7) in the first inning, singled in a run 
in the second and doubled home two in the eighth, matching his career high for 
RBIs in a game. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Clark (10-3) pitched despite neck pain and allowed only six hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Baerga, Jim Thome and Sandy Alomar Jr. also homered for the Indians, 
who are in first place at the break for the first time since 1959. Cleveland 
(51-33) has its best record at the break since 1954, when it was 56-27 and went 
on to win its most recent pennant. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 7, Milwaukee 2 -- Jack McDowell (7-7) won his fifth consecutive game 
and Lance Johnson drove in three runs and stole home for the White Sox at

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; BAKER'S GAMBLE PAYS BIG IN GIANTS VICTORY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 San Francisco Giant Manager Dusty Baker loves to play hunches, but his 
decision Sunday to have Jeff Reed, a .132 hitter, pinch-hit with two outs and a 
runner on second base seemed like a stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed made his manager look good, though, poking a single between first and 
second base that scored the winning run in the 10th inning at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2-1 victory completed a four-game sweep of the Philadelphia Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Reed had only three hits in 16 previous pinch-hitting opportunities, 
Baker glanced at his statistic sheets and saw the backup catcher had gotten 
hits off Phillie reliever Doug Jones (2-3). 
</P>
<P>
 "Jeff was due to come through for us," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, who leads the National League with 21 saves, was pitching for the first 
time in nine days. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've done pretty well against him," Reed said. "I've seen him more than a lot 
of the guys. He throws a lot of changeups and off-speed stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Reed's hit drove in Dave Martinez, who led off with a single and moved to 
second on Royce Clayton's sacrifice. Dave Burba (1-5) got the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco's comeback spoiled a superb outing by Philadelphia starter Bobby 
Munoz, who took a three-hit shutout into the ninth. But Darren Lewis led off 
the inning with his fourth homer to send the game into extra innings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants' Darryl Strawberry went hitless and struck out twice. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh 7, Cincinnati 6 -- Down by six runs at Cincinnati, it looked like 
the Pirates were starting their All-Star break early, but Brian Hunter changed 
all that. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter, who flied out and struck out in his first two at-bats against Pete 
Schourek, hit the second grand slam of his career in the sixth inning, and the 
Pirates won it in the 11th. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Foley's one-out double in the 11th scored pinch-runner Al Martin as the 
Pirates snapped a four-game losing streak with their first victory at 
Riverfront Stadium since July 2, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Mitchell left the game in the sixth inning after banging into the 
outfield wall in an attempt to catch Hunter's homer. He was taken to a hospital 
for X-rays to his left rib cage. The Reds said the results were negative and 
Mitchell will be re-evaluated after the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 8, San Diego 2 -- Wil Cordero, named to the All-Star team earlier in 
the day, hit his first grand slam and Moises Alou hit two homers for the Expos 
at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Cordero, named to replace Cincinnati's Barry Larkin on the National League 
team, hit his 13th homer off rookie Joey Hamilton (5-4) in the second to snap a 
2-2 tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Fassero (7-5) shut down the Padres after giving up two runs in the first 
inning. He gave up six hits and struck out eight in six innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Mel Rojas pitched the final three innings for his 15th save. 
</P>
<P>
 The Padres have lost nine in a row to the Expos and 19 of 21 over the past two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Padres' Bip Roberts missed the game to be with his father-in-law, who 
suffered a stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis 6, Atlanta 1 -- Mark Whiten hit a three-run homer at Atlanta in 
support of Allen Watson, and the Cardinals reached the All-Star break at .500 
(42-42). 
</P>
<P>
 The Braves (52-33) have lost nine of 15 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson (6-4) allowed one run and five hits in seven innings. The left-hander 
walked one and struck out four. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson, 23, in his second season, has made 32 starts, 17 this season. He has 
yet to complete a game. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 5, Chicago 3 -- Rookie Orlando Miller, playing in his third 
major-league game, hit two home runs completely out of Wrigley Field to lead 
the Astros. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Bagwell drove in his National League-leading 82nd run, and Pete Harnisch 
(5-4) got his third consecutive victory for the Astros, who enter the All-Star 
break 2 1/2 games behind Cincinnati in the National League Central. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida 6, Colorado 4 -- The Marlins are the best second-year team in 
head-to-head competition, beating the Rockies for the third time in a row and 
the seventh time this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinch hitter Mario Diaz hit a bases-loaded triple and the Marlins rallied from 
a four-run deficit to win at Miami. Bret Barberie doubled, homered and scored 
twice for the Marlins. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockie all-star Dante Bichette, who went 0 for 17 in the four-game series, 
lined out to left with the bases loaded to end the eighth inning.

HOLLYWOOD PARK; SLOW PACE HELPS LAKEWAY DEFEAT SARDULA BY 4 1/2 LENGTHS IN OAKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After only a half-mile of the 1 1/8-mile Hollywood Oaks, trainer Gary Jones 
was smiling. His 3-year-old filly, Lakeway, was in second place, 4 1/2 lengths 
ahead of archrival Sardula in third, and the pace of 46 4/5 seconds was slow. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very confident," Jones said. "The spot we were in, I had a hunch we 
were going to win." 
</P>
<P>
 From his vantage point, Brian Mayberry, Sardula's trainer, saw the $205,000 
race slipping away. Opening half-miles of under 45 seconds have been routine 
during Sardula's career, but she wasn't doing that Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have small fields, strange things can happen," Mayberry said. "I 
thought we'd be pressing Lakeway early, but the other filly got the jump on us 
and we never could catch her. When we fell behind, I had a lot of concern, and 
that concern was right. But that's horse racing." 
</P>
<P>
 Lakeway's only loss was by a head to Sardula in the Kentucky Oaks two months 
ago, but she's responded with two record-setting performances since then, 
including Sunday's 4 1/2-length victory in a stakes-record 1:46 4/5 for the 
Hollywood Oaks. On June 12, Lakeway covered the same distance in 1:46 2/5, the 
fastest-ever running of the Mother Goose Stakes at Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Sardula finished second, 14 lengths ahead of Fancy 'N Fabulous, and it was a 
long time before Sportful Snob, the only other starter, reached the wire. After 
leading for a half-mile, she finished last, beaten by 39 1/2 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 Sent off an odds-on favorite for the sixth time, Lakeway paid $3 for $2 and 
earned $120,000 for owner-breeder Mike Rutherford as the daughter of Seattle 
Slew and Milliardaire racked up her sixth victory. Lakeway chopped three-fifths 
of a second off the stakes record, which was set by Tipping Time in 1969 and 
equaled by Fran's Valentine in 1985. She was only a fifth of a second off the 
track record, which was set by The Wicked North, a 5-year-old, when he won the 
Californian last month. The Wicked North carried 120 pounds, one less than 
Lakeway's impost for the Hollywood Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Lakeway had not even cooled out Sunday when Rutherford and Jones were 
suggesting a possible trip to Saratoga for the $750,000 Travers on Aug. 20. 
Some of the top 3-year-old colts in the country will be running there, 
including Holy Bull and Tabasco Cat, winner of two-thirds of this year's Triple 
Crown. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best 3-year-old filly to come along in years and years and 
years," Jones said. "But we've got to prove it one more time. I've got an owner 
that likes to try that. I've never had one like this. She's something else." 
</P>
<P>
 Kent Desormeaux has ridden Lakeway in all her races. Jones said there were no 
specific pre-race instructions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to take any credit whatsoever," Desormeaux said. "She's 
phenomenal. Here she goes up against the best 3-year-old filly in the country 
and she annihilates her. I just hung on. I can't even explain how easy she 
goes. It felt just like the (1992) Santa Anita Handicap, the day Best Pal just 
galloped." 
</P>
<P>
 Sardula, who went off at 13-10, was beaten for the third time in nine starts, 
the other two losses coming last year against Phone Chatter, the champion 
2-year-old filly. 
</P>
<P>
 "She just got outrun today," jockey Eddie Delahoussaye said after Sunday's 
race. "I didn't want to go head-up with the leaders, so I eased her back, and 
she relaxed well. But that other filly, she was just cruising in front of us. 
My filly made a run around the turn, but the last eighth of a mile, she didn't 
kick on anymore. Don't take anything away from the winner." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Kentucky Oaks, Lakeway's training was interrupted by temporary 
lameness and other problems. Rutherford said Sunday it probably was unwise to 
run her, even though she barely missed running down Sardula in the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way Lakeway ran today," Mayberry said, "I guess there might have been 
something to what Gary (Jones) was saying about all his training problems in 
Kentucky. But it (the rivalry) is still one to one, the way I see it." Horse 
Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the Travers, the other option for Lakeway is staying within her 
division and running against fillies at Saratoga in the $200,000 Alabama Stakes 
on Aug. 13. . . . Lakeway races with Lasix, the bleeders' medication, but 
because of New York rules, she was not treated with the diuretic in winning the 
Mother Goose. . . . Lakeway also set a stakes record when she won the Las 
Virgenes at Santa Anita in February. . . . The only time she has been more than 
9-10 odds in any race was when she went off at 13-10, the second choice behind 
Inside Information, in the Mother Goose. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1989, Kent Desormeaux and Eddie Delahoussaye have won all but one of the 
Hollywood Oaks. Delahoussaye has won three, Desormeaux two and Gary Stevens 
one. The other victory for Desormeaux was aboard Pacific Squall in 1992. . . . 
This was Gary Jones' first victory in the stake. . . . Alex Solis, virtually 
ensured of the Hollywood Park riding title, won three races Sunday, giving him 
74 for the meet. 
</P>
<P>
 . . . Delahoussaye also rode three winners Sunday. . . . After three 
consecutive seconds, Silver Music returned to the winner's circle for the first 
time in more than three months, winning the Bold Reason Handicap under Chris 
Antley.

OLYMPIC FESTIVAL; YOUNG GYMNAST SCORES BIG, SO DOES EVENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Olympic Festival ended Sunday with a big day by a young gymnast and 
reviews by organizers who said the 10-day event was a success. 
</P>
<P>
 Doni Thompson of Colorado Springs, Colo., won two gold medals and a silver on 
the final day. The 13-year-old finished with three golds overall, having won 
the all-around title Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackie Joyner-Kersee performed for the third time before the home crowd, 
running a leg on the bronze medal-winning 1,600-meter relay. 
</P>
<P>
 Away from the venues, the president of the local organizing committee said 
there would be a money surplus after costs are covered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything came together for the last 10 days. I couldn't be more proud for 
our staff," Mike Dyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will probably be tabbed as the greatest festival we've ever had," said 
Leroy Walker, president of the U.S. Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Through Saturday night, there had been $2.7 million worth of tickets sold. 
That places St. Louis fourth on the all-time list, behind Minneapolis-St. Paul 
($3.4 million), and North Carolina and Oklahoma City ($3 million each). 
</P>
<P>
 Dyer and others noted that unlike at those other three Festivals, tickets to 
the opening ceremonies here were free, preventing them from surpassing the top 
gate. 
</P>
<P>
 A capacity crowd of 9,600 turned out for the final day of gymnastics. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson won gold in the uneven bars and the balance beam. She shared the gold 
in the bars with Kristy Powell, her Colorado Aerials teammate, when both 
finished with 9.875s. Thompson's winning score on the beam was 9.80. 
</P>
<P>
 Her silver medal came in the floor exercise. She shared the medal with two 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 In hockey, Ashlin Halfnight of Harvard scored 4:45 into overtime to give the 
South an 8-7 victory over the North for the gold medal. A crowd of 9,771, the 
second-largest for a gold medal hockey game, watched the title decided in 
overtime for the second consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
 The baseball gold went to the South, which beat the East, 10-2.

 Jurisprudence 
</P>
<P>
 An arraignment for Larry Demery and Daniel Green, the two teenagers charged 
with killing Michael Jordan's father, has been postponed. 
</P>
<P>
 Robeson County District Attorney Richard Townsend told Durham, N.C., 
television station WTVD that no new date has been set for the hearing, which 
had been scheduled for today in Lumberton, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Demery and Green have been in the Robeson County Jail since their arrest last 
summer in the death of James Jordan.

 Attorneys are still working through discovery motions in the case, WTVD 
reported. Cycling  
</P>
<P>
 Denmark's Bo Hamburger won the eighth stage of the Tour de France, and Johan 
Museeuw of Belgium retained the overall lead heading into a pivotal time trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Colombian Angel Camargo was second in the stage, with Rolf Aldag of Germany 
third and Frenchman Luc Leblanc fourth. All finished more than two minutes 
ahead of the pack. 
</P>
<P>
 For Hamburger, a pro since 1991, it was his first stage victory in the Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the 177 racers took it relatively easy on the 135-mile leg from 
Poitiers to Trelissac, conserving energy for today's individual time trial of 
40 miles from Perigueux to Bergerac. 
</P>
<P>
 Favorites Miguel Indurain of Spain and Tony Rominger of Switzerland stayed 
with the pack. Indurain, in seventh place, was only 30 seconds behind Museeuw. 
Rominger was another 28 seconds behind. Basketball

<TEXT>
<P>
 Al Unser Jr. made it look easy again Sunday, leading from start to finish and 
beating Nigel Mansell by nearly 24 seconds in the Cleveland Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
 Unser's unofficial average speed of 138.30 m.p.h. was a record for the 
2.37-mile temporary course at Burke Lakefront Airport, the fastest road course 
on the Indy-car series. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Unser's fifth victory in eight Indy-car races this year, and the 
seventh win in a row on the circuit for Marlboro Team Penske. Paul Tracy was 
third. 
</P>
<P>
 Unser won from the pole for the second consecutive race, moving to the front 
at the start and steadily pulling away in his Ilmor-powered Penske racer. 
Mansell spent most of the afternoon battling Emerson Fittipaldi for second 
place, until the back of Fittipaldi's car caught fire 20 laps from the end. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Eddie Lawson, who had the fastest laps in the morning warm-up, 
swept past pole-sitter Pedro Chaves late in the race and won the Buick 
Challenge of Cleveland for PPG-Firestone Indy Lights. 
</P>

<P>
 Damon Hill took advantage of a controversial penalty against Michael 
Schumacher in Silverstone, England and won the British Grand Prix, a race that 
his father, Graham, a two-time world champion, never won. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill took the lead on the 27th lap as leader Schumacher, shown the black flag 
five laps earlier, finally pulled into the pits for a five-second penalty 
imposed for passing on the warm-up lap before the start. 
</P>
<P>
 Schumacher was fined $25,000 and his team reprimanded for ignoring the black 
flag. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm unhappy about this," Schumacher said. "It's nothing I want to talk 
about." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, who had been trailing by two seconds before the German was pulled, built 
a huge advantage as Schumacher's Benetton Ford spent 35.5 seconds in the pits 
-- the penalty plus braking and accelerating time. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, driving a Williams-Renault, won the 61-lap race by 18.778 seconds. The 
winning time was one hour 30 minutes 3.640 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is the best day of my life," Hill said after winning the race 
for the first time. "I feel this has completed the hole that my father left in 
his record and I'm sure that he'd be delighted." 
</P>
<P>
 Schumacher retained a 33-point lead over Hill in the world championship 
standings. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Ricky Rudd, averaging 87.619 m.p.h., posted his first victory as an 
owner-driver and Dale Earnhardt took advantage of Ernie Irvan's late crash to 
grab the Winston Cup points lead in the wreck-filled Slick 50 300 in Loudon, 
N.H. 
</P>
<P>
 Earnhardt, who finished about four car lengths behind Rudd's Ford Thunderbird, 
moved into the Winston Cup lead by four points, 2,511-2,507, over Irvan, who 
spun and crashed hard between turns one and two moments after a restart on lap 
276 of the 300-lap event. Irvan finished 30th. 
</P>
<P>
 There were 17 caution flags for a total of 83 laps. Despite it all, there were 
no injuries.

 Mark McCumber ended a five-year victory drought Sunday, chipping in for 
consecutive back-nine birdies on the way to winning the Anheuser-Busch Golf 
Classic at Williamsburg, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 The chip-ins on 15 and 16 highlighted a five-under 66 that gave McCumber a 
three-shot victory over PGA Tour rookie Glen Day at Kingsmill Golf Club. 
</P>
<P>
 McCumber, who also won the event in 1987, finished at 17-under 267, one shot 
off the tournament record. 
</P>
<P>
 "When was the last time anybody chipped in twice in one round to win?" 
McCumber said. "Now I'll do chipping clinics." 
</P>
<P>
 McCumber started the day with a one-shot lead over Bob Lohr. Day, three shots 
back at the beginning of the final round, had a five-under 31 on the front nine 
before stalling on the back nine. He wound up with a 66. 
</P>
<P>
 Justin Leonard, the NCAA champion from Texas who was playing in his third 
event as a pro, birdied his first two holes but couldn't keep up after that. He 
wound up third after a 69 left him alone at 272. Lohr had a 72 and a 274 total. 
</P>
<P>
 Of his five-year tour slump, McCumber said: "It was bugging me. I've always 
felt I could play the game at high levels." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Kelly Robbins birdied the first playoff hole to win the Jamie Farr Toledo LPGA 
Classic, the second victory of her career, at Sylvania, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins and Tammie Green finished 54 holes at nine-under 204. Robbins then 
made a five-foot putt for a birdie on the par-four 18th hole, the first of the 
playoff, while Green left a 16-foot birdie putt inches short. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Williams, who was struck by a stray bullet while entering a drugstore in 
Niles, Ohio, after the second round of last weekend's Youngstown-Warren 
Classic, had a 70 and finished tied for 10th.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Colbert shot a final-round 69 to win the Kroger Senior Classic by two 
strokes over Raymond Floyd at Mason, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 Colbert's 14-under-par 199 was one stroke off the tournament record. 
</P>
<P>
 Colbert started the day with a six-shot lead over Floyd and four others. He 
made the turn in 30 to move to 18 under, 10 strokes ahead of Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Floyd staged a charge. 
</P>
<P>
 With an eagle on No. 9 and four consecutive birdies, Floyd made up six strokes 
in five holes. When Colbert bogeyed Nos. 15 and 16, the lead was down to four. 
</P>
<P>
 The charge ended on No. 14, however, when Floyd bogeyed. He finished with a 
65. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Anderson, a former defensive back for the Miami Dolphins, made a 10-foot 
birdie putt on the first playoff hole to win the $400,000 Isuzu Celebrity Golf 
Championship at Stateline, Nev. 
</P>
<P>
 He was tied after 54 holes at four-under 212 with former quarterback Steve 
Bartkowski and defending champion Rick Rhoden.

BULLFROGS DECRY THE OFFICIATING AFTER 12-9 LOSS TO THE RHINOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There was another penalty-marred rout Sunday at The Pond of Anaheim, but the 
Bullfrogs were on the wrong side as San Jose took a seven-goal lead in the 
fourth quarter to win, 12-9. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Woolf and Denny Purdie each had three goals and three assists as the 
Rhinos (7-1-2) scored eight third-quarter goals to take control before coasting 
to a Roller Hockey International victory. A crowd of 8,991 saw two scuffles, 
110 penalty minutes and a game the Bullfrogs played under protest. 
</P>
<P>
 Bullfrogs Coach Grant Sonier and Rhinos Coach Roy Sommer criticized the 
officiating. 
</P>
<P>
 "They awarded a penalty shot after a game-misconduct penalty and a four-minute 
roughing penalty," Sonier said. "Nowhere in the rules does it say that a 
penalty shot should be awarded under those circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 In the RHI, an automatic penalty shot is awarded after a five-minute major 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Bullfrogs have a hell of a hockey club," Sommer said, "and to come in 
here and get a win, well, it's never been done before." 
</P>
<P>
 The loss ended a 16-game home winning streak for the Bullfrogs (9-2). The loss 
was also the first for Bullfrogs goalie Rob Laurie, who won in 15 starts. 
Goalie Chris Gordon replaced Laurie, who allowed 11 goals on 36 shots, in the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Both coaches said San Jose's victory was tainted.  
</P>
<P>
 "The referees let the game get out of hand," Sommer said. "Some things 
happened that were uncalled for and no one wants to see anyone get hit with the 
butt end of a stick. (The officiating) made it bad for both teams." 
</P>
<P>
 For the Bullfrogs, the ugliness began in the third quarter when San Jose 
scored eight goals and officials whistled the Bullfrogs for 50 minutes in 
penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 After San Jose scored three goals in the first 2 minutes 38 seconds of the 
third quarter, Bullfrogs captain Kevin Kerr, who had two goals, scored on a 
rebound to put Anaheim a goal behind, 6-5. 
</P>
<P>
 After Kerr pointed to the net, he exchanged words with San Jose's Rob MacInnis 
and a fight ensued with the Bullfrogs' Darren Langdon going after MacInnis. 
</P>
<P>
 When officials maintained order, Langdon was assessed a game-misconduct 
penalty. Kerr received the first of his two 10-minute misconduct penalties, and 
Savo Mitrovic joined him in the penalty box, also drawing a 10-minute 
misconduct penalty.  
</P>
<P>
 San Jose took advantage of the situation, scoring five unanswered goals in the 
final 8:18 of the third quarter for an 11-5 lead. Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's RHI All-Star game will be broadcast at 10 a.m. today on ESPN. 
Goalie Rob Laurie was the Bullfrogs' lone player on the Western Conference 
squad. . . . The Bullfrogs travel for games Thursday in Las Vegas and Friday in 
San Jose. Anaheim returns home July 17 to play San Diego.

FOOTNOTES / JAMES BATES: THE HYPE HAS LANDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just in time for the media blastoff of articles commemorating the 25th 
anniversary of the moon landing comes one small souvenir for a man, courtesy of 
Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin. 
</P>
<P>
 An ad in the current Robb Report magazine for the affluent offers "Buzz 
Aldrin's 25th Anniversary First Men on the Moon Watch." 
</P>
<P>
 The $79.95 watch "contains actual historic metal flown" on the Apollo 11 
spacecraft Columbia and Eagle. 
</P>
<P>
 Aldrin, the ad says, "created and now offers" 25,000 limited-edition watches 
and is selling a chance to "literally own a piece of history." The Case of the 
Missing Coins 
</P>
<P>
 In a potentially embarrassing development for securities giant Merrill Lynch, 
some 399 coins purchased for $3.3 million are mysteriously missing from the 
inventory of a rare coin limited partnership it formed in 1990 with Los Angeles 
sports mogul Bruce McNall. 
</P>
<P>
 A cryptic one-paragraph reference to the missing coins is contained in a 
Securities and Exchange Commission filing made earlier this month by limited 
partnership NFA World Coin Fund, which Merrill Lynch formed with McNall's 
Numismatics Fine Arts International. 
</P>
<P>
 The filing says McNall and his companies -- which managed the partnership -- 
severed their ties to the fund in May. McNall, who recently sold a majority 
interest in the Los Angeles Kings hockey team but remains the club's president, 
is in personal bankruptcy proceedings and is being investigated by a federal 
grand jury looking into whether he falsified bank loan documents. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, a Merrill entity, MLL Collectibles, has taken over the running of 
the partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement to The Times, Merrill said it has reported the disappearance of 
the coins to insurance carriers as well as the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill declined to comment further until the investigation is complete, 
except to say: "We have no facts which would cause us to suspect any entity or 
individual to be responsible for this currently unaccounted-for shortage. We 
are continuing to try to locate the coins and to research this matter through 
our accounting procedures." 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney for McNall declined to comment. A source close to McNall said 
McNall did not personally handle the coin inventory and would have no knowledge 
of what could have led to the inventory shortage. The Duke Not Included 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Great Western Bank put its former Beverly Hills headquarters up for 
sale, asking $30.7 million for the building. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank hardly got the price it wanted, nor exactly the buyer it expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Purchasing the 10-story building for $18 million is LFP Inc., a company owned 
by controversial Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt. 
</P>
<P>
 Great Western retains one part of the property: a 21-foot-tall bronze statue 
of John Wayne riding a horse at the building's entrance. The statue, created by 
noted artist Harry Jackson, was unveiled in 1984. Great Western plans to handle 
all maintenance of the statue as well.

HOT JOBS: HEAD COOK SAYS CONSISTENCY IS MOST IMPORTANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE L. JONES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For Jaime Macias, being a restaurant cook means constant learning and 
improving. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day I try to be better at my job," said Macias, who started working at 
El Torito Grill in Costa Mesa 15 years ago and is now the head cook. 
</P>
<P>
 He starts work at 8 a.m. to begin preparations for lunch and remains on the 
job until 8 p.m. to help out during peak dinner hours. "To me, the job is not 
difficult. But you have to be willing to work hard sometimes and want to 
learn," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before coming to El Torito, Macias worked at various restaurants throughout 
Orange County, learning to prepare a variety of cuisines. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important thing is consistency," Macias said. "The food can't be 
good one day and bad the next, or customers won't come back." That means 
attention to detail, which includes checking the quality of supplies, 
maintaining proper storage and careful preparation. 
</P>
<P>
 Macias advises beginners to avoid fast-food restaurants if they are serious 
about becoming a cook. "The menus are too limited and there is little 
training," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At larger restaurants, it is not unusual for someone to start as a dishwasher 
and move up to become a cook. "At El Torito, we are always looking for people 
who want to learn and are reliable. We will give them many opportunities," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aspiring cooks start by doing prep work, cutting up cold foods and making sure 
there are enough ingredients ready for use during peak hours. Then they are 
advanced to the pantry, where they prepare mostly salads. The next step is to 
become a line cook, where they get their first chance to prepare meals. After 
several years, they may advance to assistant head cook and then head cook. 
</P>
<P>
 As El Torito's head cook, Macias is involved in the restaurant's catering 
activities. "Not too long ago, we catered an event at Fashion Island called 
'The Oscars Come to Fashion Island.' I like going out to different places and 
meeting the people involved," he said. OCCUPATION: Restaurant Cook 
</P>
<P>
 * What's involved: Restaurant cooks prepare food for meals, buffets and 
catered banquets. They are responsible for ordering supplies, proper food 
storage and for the quality of food served. 
</P>
<P>
 * Qualifications: Most restaurant cooks are trained on the job. Some have a 
high school education, but many do not. Most add to their skills by working at 
various restaurants and learning specialties such as seafood, catering and 
ethnic cuisines. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: By 1998, the number of restaurant cooks is projected to increase by 
10.1% to 7,830. 
</P>
<P>
 * Salary range: $5 to $9 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pros: Cooks employed by busy restaurants with a varied menu enjoy the 
fast-paced environment and the opportunity to learn various cuisines. Most 
receive medical and dental benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cons: Restaurant cooks are on their feet throughout most of the shift and 
are required to work evenings and weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 * Advancement: Cooks may advance to assistant head cook or head cook. They may 
also specialize in catering or banquets. 
</P>
<P>
 * Quote: "A restaurant kitchen has many things going on at once. Being a cook 
requires good organizational skills to make sure everything comes out right."

ANN CONWAY: MUSEUM SUPPORTERS WILL FIND THAT HOME IS WHERE THE ART IS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN CONWAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You can't help but think "earthquake and fire" when you step into Teri and 
John Kennady's new hilltop digs in Emerald Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Everywhere you look you see art crystal -- some of it by Murano master 
glassblower Serguso and some of it by his American counterpart, Dale Chihuly. 
Not to mention wall after wall hung with masterful works of contemporary art. 
</P>
<P>
 Given last year's quakes and firestorms, aren't the Kennadys -- he's a 
neurosurgeon, she's the powerful president of the Laguna Art Museum board (when 
museum director Charles Desmarais was fired last March, it was Teri who 
knowingly explained that "he and the museum have different needs") -- terrified 
of losing it all? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's already gone through it once," a philosophical Teri said of her crystal 
collection on a recent afternoon in Emerald Bay. "It is what it is. If it 
breaks, it would be sad and we would start again and keep going. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the fire raged in Emerald Bay last fall, our house was under 
construction, a shell. But we had to quickly resign ourselves to the fact that 
if it burned, it burned. We had plans, a foundation, and we could go on. 
</P>
<P>
 "The same with collecting. When you collect, you make a choice. That's part of 
the process." 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 11, Kennady's 4,700-square-foot gallery of a dwelling will be 
featured in a home tour that is part of the museum's annual Perspectives 
fund-raising event series. For $100 per person, guests will tour five Laguna 
Beach homes -- all strongholds of art. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tour presents a unique opportunity for people to get a glimpse at the 
kind of people who are active in the museum as well as see some unique homes 
and art collections," said Elyse Miller, event chairwoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides their art and glass collections, the Kennady home features: 
</P>
<P>
 * A blue-tiled rectangular pool with a multicolor confetti bottom. "The 
confetti look warms things up," said Teri. "Everything else about the house is 
very staid and thought-out." 
</P>
<P>
 * A living room where saffron-silk sofas rest on rust-colored concrete floors. 
No all-the-rage marble in this house. Why concrete? "We like the way it ends 
up," Teri explained. "So we put it in the entry, the living room and the powder 
room." (Other living areas are carpeted or feature natural birch flooring.) 
After the concrete sets, a "color is polished in," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Floating" counters in the master bathroom. Each wall-hung vanity table is 
made of clear sandblasted glass. The handblown art glass that sits on each 
counter seems to be suspended in mid-air. 
</P>
<P>
 * A large living room painting by Fritz Sholder with a great story behind it. 
"That's a very important painting to me," Teri explained. "We bought that on a 
museum trip to Santa Fe but we didn't have a place to put it. It was because of 
that painting that we bought this property." 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the Perspectives' dance-card: A bay-side "Caribbean Carnival" on Aug. 
25 at the Linda Isle home of Dolores Milhous, former museum board president. 
The first 20 guests to book a reservation for this romp will be taken on a 
pre-party cruise aboard Milhous's stately yacht. This $150 per-person event 
includes a Caribbean-themed repast and entertainment by a steel band. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 8, the museum will stage "Get Smart," a dinner party which will also 
feature a discussion about art forgery by FBI agent Virginia Curry. "We'll have 
a forged Modigliani on hand," to show guests how clever forgers can be, said 
Miller. Museum supporter Geoffrey Beaumont will host the event in his Newport 
Beach home. Tickets are $100 per person. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruby's Auto Diner in South Laguna will cater "Rebel With a Cause," a Sept. 18 
supper that will feature a display of custom and classic bikes. Tickets for 
adults are $30; children under 12, $10. 
</P>
<P>
 The final Perspectives outing will take place at chef Pascal Olhats' Epicerie 
in Newport Beach. Situated next to his popular Pascal restaurant, the intimate 
deli/bakery will provide the backdrop for Pascal when he demonstrates the 
preparation of his favorite Provencal dishes. Tickets are $75.

JACK SMITH: 'EMBARRASS' IS A WORD WITH A LONG MEMORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Embarrassment is perhaps the most common and widespread of human frailties. It 
afflicts the Tibetan as well as the New Yorker. It is rarely, if ever, fatal, 
but it is, in a word, embarrassing. 
</P>
<P>
 The dictionary defines the word as "to cause to feel self-conscious or 
ill-at-ease; disconcert." Actually, it can be a lot worse than that. 
</P>
<P>
 In the book "Embarrassment in Everyday Life: What to Do About It" out this 
month from ETC Publications, sociologist Edward Gross analyzes hundreds of 
embarrassing moments to get at the nature of the beast and to offer some 
suggestions on dealing with it. 
</P>
<P>
 He points out that nobody is immune, not even the high and mighty. He recalls 
that President George Bush, seeking economic peace with Japan, leaned toward 
the Japanese prime minister at lunch and vomited on his lapels. He doesn't say 
what the President said. I can't think of anything appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 He also recalls the notorious run of Roy Riegels, a football player for Cal 
who picked up a fumble in the Rose Bowl and ran the wrong way, thereby losing 
the game. No one who heard that on the radio, as I did, will ever forget "Wrong 
Way Riegels." 
</P>
<P>
 Gross says recovery from embarrassing moments is rare, but it can be done by 
wit and boldness. He recalls that Margaret Chase Smith, the only woman in the 
Senate during the Eisenhower reign, was asked by a tenacious reporter whether 
she might run for President. He said: "Have you ever thought about what it 
would be like to wake up in the morning and find yourself in the White House?" 
Sen. Smith said, "If that happened, I would apologize immediately to Mrs. 
Eisenhower and go straight home." 
</P>
<P>
 Gross points out that one may disarm one's audience with timely humor. A 
reporter once asked President John F. Kennedy how he prepared himself for a 
speech. Did he think of a line from Shakespeare, or perhaps from speeches by 
the famous orators of history? 
</P>
<P>
 "No," the President answered. "I just check to be sure my fly is zipped up." 
</P>
<P>
 Gross suggests handling small embarrassments by making a quick 
reinterpretation of the gaffe. If you have picked the wrong raincoat off a 
restaurant rack and are observed, you can make it into a mock theft by saying, 
with a laugh, "I almost got away with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Oddly, what might have been the most excruciating embarrassment of my life 
never happened. I caught myself just in time. 
</P>
<P>
 I was in New York with a couple of days to kill and I decided to visit the 
United Nations. I looked up Lou Fleming, then The Times' U.N. correspondent, 
and he graciously showed me around the building. I was carrying a topcoat over 
one arm, and at one point a black man in a green robe came up to me and 
extended a hand. 
</P>
<P>
 I made the dreadful assumption that he was a servant of some kind. I was about 
to hand him my coat when Lou introduced him as a representative to the United 
Nations from a new African state. 
</P>
<P>
 I shook hands with the man and made some appropriate remark -- or one that I 
hoped was appropriate. I didn't know whether Lou sensed my predicament or not; 
I had escaped a major embarrassment by the narrowest of margins, and so had 
Lou. 
</P>
<P>
 What would have been the repercussions? The man would have been humiliated. 
Lou would have been embarrassed. I could not imagine how I could have 
apologized. What could I have said? 
</P>
<P>
 The other embarrassing moment I remember most vividly happened not to me, but 
to my dog. When I was a small boy, we lived in Fresno and I had a combative 
mongrel, part English bulldog, named Buddy. He barked at every stranger, so we 
taught him to go into the cellar when someone approached and bark through a 
little vent. 
</P>
<P>
 My sister was in high school at that time and took the trolley to school, 
arriving home at about the same time every day. Buddy trained himself to meet 
the trolley, and when she stepped off it he was there, bounding about, barking, 
exulting and licking her hand. 
</P>
<P>
 One day he went through this little drill only to discover that the girl 
wasn't my sister. His embarrassment was pitiful. He lowered his tail. He 
moaned. He slunk away into the cellar for cover. 
</P>
<P>
 I have never believed animals have human intelligence, but that dog was 
embarrassed. 
</P>
<P>
 Gross says embarrassments can be far more memorable than the occasions that 
produced them. He recalls that a well-known radio announcer named Harry Von 
Zell once introduced Herbert Hoover as "President of the United States Hoobert 
Heever." He says nobody can remember what Hoover said on that occasion, but 
nobody can forget the introduction. 
</P>
<P>
 I can't remember what country the man in the green robe represented, but I 
will never forget my close call.

 David Letterman, on President Clinton's increasing use of Camp David: "During 
the first year and a half of his Administration, he was only up there two or 
three times. So, he's there now three weekends in a row. This can mean only one 
thing: They've fixed the deep fryer." 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Leno, on Clinton's plans to give Russian soldiers $25,000 vouchers to buy 
new houses when their bases in Latvia close: "This means that if you work in a 
U.S. military base that has been closed, your best bet of getting help is to 
defect to Russia, get the 25 grand and then move back here." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the President made real progress on his European tour. Of the 35,000 
Latvians who greeted him, reports comedy writer Mark Miller, "less than 8% 
claimed to have slept with him."

 Comic Argus Hamilton, on Judge Kathleen Kennedy-Powell's search warrant ruling 
in the O.J. Simpson case: "Back in Oklahoma, cops use the 'consent warrant' to 
gain entry. One cop knocks on your front door and then another runs around to 
your back door and yells, 'Come in.' "

<P>
 In an effort to clean up the Big Apple, the NYPD will now seize cars used by 
the patrons of prostitutes. This could result in a lot less prostitution, says 
comedy writer Tony Peyser, or a lot more car rentals .

<P>
 When Lucie Salhany got the heave-ho as head of the Fox TV Network, no reasons 
for her ouster were announced, says comedy writer Bob Mills: "But, her pink 
slip was printed on the back of an old 'Chevy Chase Show' ticket."

 We got several updated versions of an old joke: 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton was touring a desert military base when he came upon an old 
bottle. When he picked it up, its top flew off and a genie appeared. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank you, sir, you have freed me," the genie said. "I have been captive in 
that bottle for 800 years and am willing to grant you one wish, any wish." 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing opportunity with the reporters and camera crews around him, 
Clinton quickly replied: "I wish for world peace and prosperity." 
</P>
<P>
 The genie looked puzzled, then answered: "But, sir, I have been out of 
practice for so long and that task is so monumental. Couldn't you pick another 
wish?" 
</P>
<P>
 The President motioned to the genie and they walked out of hearing range. 
"What I really wish," Clinton said, "is for Hillary to accept the fact that I 
am the President. And I want her to quit upstaging me and acting so superior to 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 The genie turned and walked away. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where are you going?" Clinton asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gotta run," the genie replied. "I have to get busy on world peace and 
prosperity."

 Reader Phil Willen of Woodland Hills says that at a Fourth of July pool party, 
his daughter, a swimming teacher, discovered that one guest couldn't swim. So 
his daughter told the woman that she could help her overcome her fear of water.

 "First," replied the guest, "I have to overcome my fear of bathing suits."

IT'S A VIVID TALE OF YOUTH -- TOO BAD THE WRITER INTRUDES; LUCKY TOWN BY JAMES 
BROWN . HARCOURT BRACE; $22.95, 287 PAGES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Important stuff happens to us when we're young, but we have to grow up before 
we can figure it out -- by which time we've forgotten much of it, distorted 
much more and, at best, lost touch with its power and immediacy. 
</P>
<P>
 This poses a problem that every memoirist and every novelist who writes about 
youthful experience has to solve. Should the writer speak as an adult, at the 
risk of drowning out the voice of the child? Pretend to be a child, at the risk 
of losing the perspective of the adult? Or shift back and forth, hoping to 
strike an optimum balance? 
</P>
<P>
 There's no right answer. Good books -- and bad -- have been written all three 
ways. In "The Catcher in the Rye," J.D. Salinger seems to vanish into Holden 
Caulfield; the adult insights he expresses seem to come to us subliminally. In 
"This Boy's Life," Tobias Wolff balances his youthful fear of an abusive 
stepfather with a grown-up view in which the man is pitiable as well as mean. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Lucky Town," James Brown speaks mainly as an adult: 36-year-old Bobby 
Barlow, looking back two decades on his love-hate relationship with his 
handsome, charming dad, Floyd, whose erratic lunges at the American Dream 
involve romantic obsession, gambling and armed robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobby's mother has disappeared. He has been raised by Floyd, a carpenter whose 
failings seem no worse than immaturity and impatience (driving through an 
affluent neighborhood, he mutters, " I should be in that nice warm house. I 
should be behind the wheel of that Dodge") until he meets his femme fatale, 
Melinda Johnson, and commits his first crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Floyd spends three years in an Oregon prison, emerging somewhat hardened and 
even more impulsive. Bobby senses this, yet immediately leaves his foster 
family in Portland to be with him -- although Floyd's only plan is to track 
down Melinda, a former hooker and sometime law student now married to a brutal 
Seattle cop named Bo. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown makes us understand why Bobby chooses his father. And he does it the 
hard way, by giving Floyd such a mixture of machismo and winsomeness, violence 
and vulnerability, good intentions and bad judgment that few boys could help 
loving him -- even though, Bobby soon realizes, "He was the child. I was the 
parent." 
</P>
<P>
 The minor characters are equally vivid. Brown's prose in direct scenes is 
crisp -- he has an especially nice touch with background sounds -- and he can 
sum up a relationship in a few lines of dialogue. When Melinda leaves Bo and 
runs off to Las Vegas with Floyd and Bobby in a stolen car, Bobby asks her: "I 
know what my father sees in you. What I don't get is what you see in him." 
</P>
<P>
 "Like he does things. Like he's going places. . . . He knows how to treat a 
woman, too, plenty better than most of the jerks I've known. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "I know one thing. We wouldn't be in this mess right now if it wasn't for 
you." 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate to break your heart," Melinda tells him. "But let's get something 
straight right now. If anyone goes it'll be you." 
</P>
<P>
 She's right, although it's a long time before Floyd is desperate enough to 
prove it. In Las Vegas -- "Lucky Town" -- he prospers for a while at the craps 
tables, aided by Melinda, who lands a job as a dealer. Even after Floyd tries 
to make a killing with loaded dice and is beaten up by casino hoods, Bobby can 
pity him for his knocked-out tooth and cut-off finger, the two other fingers 
lost in a sawmill accident, his doomed passion: "The years hadn't been kind." 
</P>
<P>
 It takes a whole string of selfish and stupid acts for Floyd to alienate his 
son, but he finally does it. We can understand Bobby's alienation, just as we 
understood the love. What we can't quite grasp is how this smart-aleck, 
pot-smoking "hippie" teen-ager has become the distant, slightly stuffy and 
long-winded adult who tells the story. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobby seems to be saying that he wised up to his father's flaws and simply 
walked away. If this were a lie -- if we knew Brown intended for us to see the 
adult Bobby as wounded and in denial, reliving a past he can't quite shake -- 
then the novel would work in the past and the present. But as it is, the adult 
Bobby speculates about the past without adding anything to it; his voice is 
only a distraction to the compelling story being told.

ORANGE SCHOOL AWAITS SECESSION FROM DISTRICT; EDUCATION: SANTIAGO WOULD BECOME 
COUNTY'S FIRST CHARTER SCHOOL, JOINING 62 IN THE STATE FLYING SOLO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODI WILGOREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After 20 years of teaching history at Santiago Middle School, Suzanne 
Bell-Dragoon dreams of early morning classes on Civil War-era dances to 
complement her lessons on that period. 
</P>
<P>
 English Department chairwoman Cathie Hunsberger imagines an hourly payroll of 
college students to help grade papers. Robyn Tunstall, who coordinates 
Santiago's program for gifted and talented students, wants teachers from all 
subjects to synchronize their curricula. 
</P>
<P>
 All three are desperate to shrink classes, which ballooned as high as 42 
students in one class last year. And they'd love it if the air conditioner were 
fixed when it breaks -- not weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference between this wish list and the one every educator keeps is that 
Santiago's staff plans to make these and other innovations reality by seceding 
from the troubled Orange Unified School District and functioning autonomously 
as Orange County's first "charter school." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Unified trustees said they will approve Santiago's petition for 
independence at a meeting this week, making it a self-governing school in 
control of its own budget and free from district and state mandates. Santiago 
would become the first charter school in the county, joining 62 others around 
the state that have decided to fly solo since the charter school concept was 
approved by the Legislature two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very exciting because it's like you're controlling your own destiny," 
said Tunstall, who led the charge for a charter at Santiago. "It's the sort of 
rhetoric that you've read a million times, but we honestly believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Hunsberger: "The education system is in upheaval. Change is inevitable. 
We're better off taking it by the horns than being told later on that this is 
what you have to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the previously approved charters are for elementary schools scattered 
throughout 23 of California's counties. About 25 charter schools have been up 
and running for a year. Thirty more are scheduled to open this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Santiago plans to begin operation as a charter school in September, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Some schools adopted charters in order to specialize in the arts, technology, 
science or vocational training, while others focused on saving would-be 
dropouts. A handful are networks of parents receiving money from the state to 
teach their children at home. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Los Angeles Unified School District, for example, Westwood Elementary 
uses its charter to group students in multi-age, multi-grade "families" rather 
than traditional classes. A consortium of Palisades charter schools provides a 
cohesive humanities curriculum from kindergarten through 12th grade and 
requires students to perform community service. And a Pacoima charter school 
slashed class sizes from an average of 32 to 26, added a computer lab and ended 
up with a budget surplus during its first year of operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some pretty amazing schools have come forward," said Sue Burr, the state 
Senate Education Committee staffer who authored the charter legislation. "We 
got the question a lot: 'What's your idea of what a charter school should be?' 
We don't have an idea." 
</P>
<P>
 Burr's boss, state Sen. Gary Hart (D-Santa Barbara), says "charter is a 
license to dream." 
</P>
<P>
 At Santiago, the dream is to increase parent involvement, allow more 
flexibility for progressive teaching methods and decrease class size. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I empower my staff to be in charge of their domain -- even if it's just 
a little, itty-bitty domain -- they work harder, they work smarter," Santiago 
Principal Mary Ann Owsley explained. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you give people the ability to soar with the eagles, they do, because they 
don't work for somebody else anymore, they work for themselves," said Owsley, 
who began her career in Orange Unified a quarter-century ago as a Spanish 
teacher, and has since been a counselor, assistant principal and principal at 
various schools. "If that's true on a smaller class-by-class basis, why can't 
it be true on a schoolwide basis?" 
</P>
<P>
 According to Santiago's petition to the school board, the charter school would 
emphasize cultural diversity and communication skills, with classes coordinated 
to address similar themes across subject matter. Students and parents would 
have to sign contracts to attend, with parents required to donate time or money 
to the school. 
</P>
<P>
 There would be a strict dress code and harsher discipline. Under Owsley's 
leadership, an appointed 13-member board of parents and staff, meeting monthly, 
would run the school. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrangement is designed to give parents, teachers, the school's 
administrators and other staffers, who will be selected by their peers at the 
school, more clout in important decisions that affect students. The charter 
board's governing autonomy would be so complete that the seven-member Orange 
Unified school board would have neither authority nor responsibility for the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main thrust is to make it a partnership between the parents, the 
students, the teachers and the community -- to get more people involved in 
education," said Marvella McAllister, one of several parents who helped write 
the charter. 
</P>
<P>
 One key element in the charter is the introduction of a two-tiered teaching 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "Master teachers" would be credentialed educators, while lower-paid 
"instructors" -- who must have some college education but need not be trained 
as teachers -- would help ease the workload and save money. 
</P>
<P>
 The charter plan's originators say "instructors" may include a retired 
engineer who assists with math, a museum curator helping with art history, or a 
concert guitarist teaching music. 
</P>
<P>
 Other tentative plans for saving money include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Aggressively fighting truancy, because state funding is tied to daily 
student attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 * Changing cafeteria services to make a bigger profit on food sales without 
necessarily raising prices for students. 
</P>
<P>
 * Seeking local companies to donate services such as maintenance and 
gardening. 
</P>
<P>
 Owsley also believes that teachers will try harder to save money -- perhaps by 
or taking fewer days off -- if they believe they will reap the benefits 
directly in terms of smaller class sizes or increased resources. 
</P>
<P>
 Santiago, a school of 877 students and 34 teachers that scores well on 
standardized tests and has been named a California "distinguished school" twice 
in the past five years, already has leaped to the forefront of reform efforts 
in the Orange Unified district. 
</P>
<P>
 Becoming a charter school, staff members believe, will free the school from 
the educational bureaucracy to experiment even more. They can try a new 
textbook, change the class schedule -- or the cafeteria schedule -- without 
filing stacks of state-required forms or having a string of meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just want the reins, the official reins," Bell-Dragoon pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
 Charter schools must maintain a racial and ethnic balance similar to the 
populations in their attendance areas. They must be non-sectarian and cannot 
discriminate in enrollment. Beyond that, they are free from California's 
6,000-page, 11-volume Education Code, and from district governance. 
</P>
<P>
 Once approved, the charter is good for five years before it must be renewed. 
The only requirement is that the school set specific achievement standards and 
show results. 
</P>
<P>
 It is hardly a surprise that Orange County's first charter school comes in 
Orange Unified, a district of 26,000 students whose central office has long 
been in turmoil. Seven superintendents have headed the district since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Charter planners said getting away from the district's woes was not a primary 
motivation, but admitted that administrative headaches "downtown" have made it 
difficult to get top officials to focus on education reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Although unions and school boards have typically opposed charters, Santiago 
has gained near-universal support, teachers and administrators said. That is in 
part because Santiago's charter would allow teachers to maintain their union 
memberships and seniority, and the school would continue contracting with 
Orange Unified for many services. 
</P>
<P>
 To receive a charter, 50% of a school's teachers -- or 10% of those in an 
entire district -- must approve. At Santiago, 32 of the 34 teachers have 
supported the petition. 
</P>
<P>
 Marilyn Moore, a veteran teacher who opposes the charter, declined to comment, 
and Sandy Reece Collier, the other teacher against the move, could not be 
reached last week. 
</P>
<P>
 School board members said they anticipate easy passage of the charter petition 
at their meeting Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm quite committed to any effort to decentralize the operations of our 
district in order to provide a greater amount of authority closer to the 
students in the classroom," Trustee Robert Viviano said. "There is a need in 
the school system in general to return more control and more responsiveness to 
the local schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Lewis, another school board member, expressed concern that a small group 
of teachers or parents might take over the school, or that the district would 
be held responsible for problems at Santiago but have no recourse to address 
them. Still, he said he plans to support the charter petition. 
</P>
<P>
 Many believe the charter will allow Santiago to serve as an experiment for 
Orange Unified and the county. Innovative teaching and funding mechanisms that 
work at Santiago might be adopted by other schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like having an R&D unit, research and development, right in your own 
back yard," Trustee James Fearns said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tunstall, Owsley and other key figures in the charter movement say the most 
crucial challenges still lie ahead. They must chart a specific course for the 
school over the coming year. Once it is transformed into a charter school, 
everyone expects the workload to increase. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though we had close to 100% of the staff say 'yes, we're interested in 
this,' when you get down to the nuts and bolts of asking people to change, it's 
scary," Hunsberger admitted. "Unfortunately, teachers have been trained to 
follow the rules and have never been given the opportunity to be innovative, 
and now it's thrown into your lap. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of like being a first-time parent and the baby is thrown into your 
lap," she added. "It's exciting, but it's intimidating." Looking for Autonomy 
</P>
<P>
 Santiago Middle School is hoping to become a self-governing school by seceding 
from the Orange Unified School District and adopting its own "charter" under a 
program approved by the Legislature two years ago.

ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH: A SPECIAL REPORT: MULTIMEDIA INDUSTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 BEYOND VIDEO: The multimedia industry -- which produces computer programs for 
products like games that combine video, sound, graphics and text -- gathers 
steam in Orange County. A decade ago, there were just a few one-person firms; 
now there are more than a dozen companies with hundreds of employees. . . . 
Enter Jon Sidoli, a UC Irvine fine arts graduate, who started Digital Artists 
Agency in Irvine to supply multimedia companies with performers. "We're the 
talent scouts," Sidoli says. "We provide the actors and actresses that appear 
in the new digital world." 
</P>
<P>
 SUBCONTRACT: People used to smirk when William C. Fisher told them a decade 
ago that he created computer games for a living. "Now it's so vogue that people 
get googly-eyed and say it's cool," says Fisher, 35. His Quicksilver Software 
Inc. in Costa Mesa, which has 12 employees, helped Interplay Productions Inc. 
produce its award-winning Castles II: Siege & Conquest multimedia game about 
life and war in medieval times. "It's like a Hollywood job," Fisher says. "It's 
not always glamorous. . . . It's half technical and half artistic." 
</P>
<P>
 CULTURAL: Shelia Monique and her husband, Ron May, above, started May CoII 
Entertainment, a multimedia company in Santa Ana, to produce multicultural 
children's education programs for media, including TV shows and computer 
programs. The firm's initial project is "Yesterday," a set of animated short 
stories that will run as a TV show. Monique is the voice of a 6-year-old 
character "Little Ms. Monique." 
</P>
<P>
 DAY JOB: Michael Salazar, a 28-year-old actor with a fine arts degree from UC 
Irvine, never thought he'd be using his stage voice in computer multimedia 
productions. But it certainly pays the bills while he's looking for theatrical 
work. Salazar's voice may be heard in an upcoming Shakespeare edition of 
Irvine-based World Library Inc.'s electronic books, which run on personal 
computers. Such "books" feature the text of the work on a computer disk but 
also supply audio and video clips. Says Salazar: "I've had more calls in the 
last year than ever before."

SOME BRAZILIANS CHOOSE SLUMS TO ESCAPE RIO CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For as long as Luiza Maria Nascimento Elias can remember breathing, she has 
wanted to move away from Rocinha. 
</P>
<P>
 When she gazed out onto the crumbling, narrow streets winding their way up the 
back of Two Brothers mountain and at the shacks stacked precariously atop each 
other like children's building blocks, all she saw was poverty and neglect. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, Elias, a 32-year-old Brazilian event organizer, finally got 
her wish and moved with her bank-manager husband and their son from the Rocinha 
favela , or slum, into a nice apartment in the upscale Flamengo area of this 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 That, she said, was a big mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was scared all the time," she said of Flamengo. "I was afraid on the 
elevator. I was afraid in my car. I was afraid in my apartment. There was crime 
everywhere. People were always getting robbed." 
</P>
<P>
 So the couple moved back to the largest slum in all of Latin America, a place 
where drug traffickers reign, health care and education are inadequate, and the 
average salary is $130 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Elias and her husband are part of a small but growing middle class that has 
found that, ironically, life in the impoverished favelas is in many ways better 
than that in the city's more affluent Flamengo, Ipanema and Copacabana 
neighborhoods that they border. 
</P>
<P>
 These people include store owners, professionals, retirees and owners of 
second homes who want the beautiful hilltop vistas. From the outside, many of 
their homes resemble the hodgepodge of unfinished brick construction that has 
replaced the old wooden and tin shanties and now typifies favela structures. 
</P>
<P>
 The homes, however, have well-appointed rooms, parquet floors, well-stocked 
bars, rooftop decks or verandas with sweeping ocean vistas, modern appliances, 
imported cars, and sometimes swimming pools and maids. Satellite dishes have 
begun to sprout like mushrooms from rooftops. 
</P>
<P>
 On the one hand, the emergence of middle-class dwellings in these squatter 
communities, which for decades have housed many of the nation's urban poor, 
signals a gradual coming of age for neighborhoods historically synonymous with 
misery. It is a testament to the ingenuity and perseverance of thousands of 
Brazilians who have fashioned some dignity and decency out of still-harsh 
living conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, it highlights the incongruities in Brazil's urban centers, 
which have caused people who could live elsewhere to feel more comfortable 
residing with pistol-packing teen-age drug lords and thousands of poor, illegal 
squatters who buy, sell and remodel homes that are not theirs in communities 
that the city does not officially recognize. 
</P>
<P>
 What attracts many outsiders to the favelas and keeps most longtime residents 
inside them are two issues that plague all of urban Brazil, particularly Rio: 
prices and crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Homes in the favelas can be had for a fraction of the costs elsewhere, even 
though land values there have begun to climb dramatically as more people have 
begun buying and building. The problem is that the vast majority of new homes 
are illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of the land belongs to anybody at all," said Bob Nadkarni, 56, a British 
television producer who moved onto the mountainside that is the Morro da 
Novacintra favela 13 years ago and eventually married his next-door neighbor. 
"Legally, you have the same status as squatters." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents therefore do not pay taxes, but that benefit is outweighed by a 
larger set of problems. Because they are illegal communities, they lack city 
services. Roads and sidewalks are a patchwork of uneven construction. Open 
sewers run throughout, and many residents lack running water. 
</P>
<P>
 Without land titles, residents cannot seek legal recourse to property 
disputes, and landlords cannot evict delinquent tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 To make sense of it all, residents years ago began forming volunteer groups 
that act as a clearinghouse for community problems, securing services like 
community centers, health clinics and even cooking schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably our No. 1 issue here is land titles," said Tominho Barros, secretary 
of the Vidigal Dwellers Assn. representing the Vidigal favela that borders the 
Leblon beach colony. 
</P>
<P>
 A person who wants to move to a favela must be approved by the local dwellers 
association. Buyers then can purchase a building, completing the transaction by 
transferring electrical service to the new owner's name. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Eliases moved back to Rocinha, which for decades existed in the same 
legal limbo as other favelas , they bought a home and then spent tens of 
thousands of dollars putting in hardwood floors, redesigning the veranda and 
adding new closets, a brick bar and an outdoor barbecue pit. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for them, last year the city recognized Rocinha as a legal 
neighborhood in which people can hold title to their property and apply for 
badly needed city services. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the favelas , people leave their doors unlocked, while we live almost in 
virtual prisons," said Christina de Souza, a housewife from Barra da Tijuca, a 
middle-class beach enclave on Rio's southern outskirts. 
</P>
<P>
 While some favelas are violent, crime-ridden places like the slums of the 
United States, others are quite safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel completely safe anywhere in Vidigal," said Angela de Castro, 42, a 
newspaper sportswriter who lives in the 50,000-resident favela with her mother 
and father in a bungalow surrounded by flowers and exotic plants. "It's a small 
place, and everybody knows each other. In other places, you don't know your 
neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 Next-door neighbor Manuel da Cruz Ferreira, 67, a retired government worker 
and contractor who lives in a three-story home with three balconies and a pool, 
says he strolls his neighborhood without a worry. Nadkarni hasn't had a lock on 
his door in Morro da Novacintra for seven years. "Every friend I have living 
down below has been robbed at one time or another." 
</P>
<P>
 In Rocinha, home to 250,000 residents, police scratch their heads when asked 
to recall a case of a robbery, burglary or theft in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The drug dealers scold (anybody who commits a crime) pretty thoroughly," said 
Deputy Police Chief Jose Carlos, visiting with his officers in a concrete shed 
that is the Rocinha substation. "Well, OK, they kill them. That's why they 
don't have any crime." 
</P>
<P>
 In nearly every favela , drug traffickers rule. Nothing moves without their 
knowledge or tacit consent. The drug dealers dangerous "profession" means they 
rarely live past the age of 25 and accounts for the favelas ' high murder 
tally. 
</P>
<P>
 In some favelas, they are cruel, vicious criminals who have brought with them 
a cult of violence that permeates the communities in which they reside. 
</P>
<P>
 In others, the drug barons enforce a protective code, meting out a swift, 
strict justice that provides a sense of order upon which many residents, 
including the middle class, have come to rely, however grudgingly. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife wishes they weren't here, and I understand her point," said Jamine 
Mendonca Merence, a 38-year-old contractor who lives with his family of four in 
a narrow, four-story home in Vidigal. "But I've lived in favelas that didn't 
have drug traffickers, and this is much better." 
</P>
<P>
 In Vidigal, as in other favelas , the drug traffickers' doctrine makes crimes 
against other residents, particularly women, unthinkable, and that extends to 
nearby areas where crimes that might mar the neighborhood's reputation or 
otherwise upset the status quo are punished severely. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, when three youngsters assaulted a bus driver whose route serves 
the Morro Dona Marta favela in Rio's Botafoga district earlier this year, drug 
traffickers shot them each in one hand and left them for police. 
</P>
<P>
 Favela residents speak nonchalantly about fellow residents whom traffickers 
have told to leave for their misdeeds, or who suddenly disappeared after 
committing a crime against a neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "In all the time I've been here, I can think of only one person who broke into 
a house and stole something, and he lived for about 10 minutes after that," 
Nadkarni said. 
</P>
<P>
 When residents have problems, they go to the drug traffickers, not the police. 
Earlier this year the father of soccer star and Jacarezinho favela native 
Romario dos Santos Ferreira, now leading the Brazilian team in the World Cup, 
was kidnaped in Rio. Instead of seeking help from police, the family went 
straight to a major drug trafficker. His father was released immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 The emergence in recent decades of drug dealers as the protectors of the 
community reflects the general service vacuum in Brazil, particularly for poor 
people, says anthropologist Alba Zaluar. 
</P>
<P>
 "The police don't play the role that they should play," said Zaluar, author of 
"Condominium of the Devil," a book released last month that examines the 
culture of a particularly notorious favela ironically named Cidade de Deus, or 
God's City. "They don't protect the people in the favelas , because the people 
of the favelas are not considered citizens. If anything, they are afraid of 
being killed by the police. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's true for many other aspects of life. So people have come together to 
fashion their own systems. Actually, they're sort of caught between a rock and 
a hard place, so they've created a special sort of community. They are closer, 
more tightly bound together. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's much different from the more sterile communities down below where people 
hardly know their neighbors. So, I understand why that woman decided to move 
back to Rocinha."

YELTSIN BALKS AT TROOP PULLOUT FROM ESTONIA; SUMMIT: HE STEALS THE G-7 SHOW, 
DEMANDING BETTER ECONOMIC TREATMENT. GROUP URGES BOSNIA ACCORD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As the world's great powers embraced him as a near-equal at their summit 
Sunday, Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin demanded better economic treatment 
from abroad and bluntly denied that he plans to withdraw his last troops from 
the Baltics. 
</P>
<P>
 In a scene-stealing performance near the close of the industrial nations' 
three-day gathering, Yeltsin declared at a news conference with President 
Clinton that he cannot commit to withdrawing the last 2,500 Russian troops from 
Estonia until that nation pledges better treatment for its large Russian 
minority. And he complained that the peers who are now accepting Russia into 
their institutions have been tardy in taking down Cold War-era trade barriers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's give us equal rights. Get rid, once and for all, of that red jacket!" 
Yeltsin declared, referring to the Soviet-era curbs. "Take that red jacket from 
the president of Russia!" 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin left dour Soviet-style presentation in the dust, teasing his 
questioners and stealing the limelight with a series of one-liners and 
lighthearted banter. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether he plans to finally withdraw his Baltic troops, Yeltsin answered 
wryly: " Nyet! I like that question -- because I can answer no." 
</P>
<P>
 While he does plan to remove remaining Russian troops from Latvia by Aug. 31, 
following a signed agreement, he said that "the situation is different in 
Estonia because there are very crude violations of human rights." 
</P>
<P>
 Russian and Baltic officials have been wrangling since the Baltic republics 
gained independence three years ago over the treatment of thousands of former 
Soviet troops and their families, whom other residents of Latvia, Lithuania and 
Estonia long viewed as the agents of an occupying foreign power. For example, 
Estonians have been debating proposals that would effectively deprive many 
ethnic Russians of citizenship by requiring knowledge of the highly complex 
Estonian language as a precondition. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin's peppery comments came amid declarations of the growing harmony 
between the Russians and the leaders of the Group of Seven -- the United 
States, Germany, Italy, Britain, France, Canada and Japan. Once their 
adversary, Yeltsin met with them Sunday for political discussions as a full 
partner in what is now referred to as the "political Group of Eight." 
</P>
<P>
 In a final communique, the group called on the parties in the 27-month-old 
Bosnian war to accept by July 18 a partition plan that would give the Bosnian 
Muslims and Croats 51% of the country and the Bosnian Serbs the remaining 49%. 
The communique -- along with a variety of personal statements by the leaders -- 
was designed to increase pressure on the Bosnian Serbs, who have long balked at 
a settlement that would require them to surrender hard-fought territorial 
gains. 
</P>
<P>
 The leaders also called on North Korea to resume suspended negotiations with 
the United States over its nuclear program, and to go ahead with a scheduled 
summit with South Korean officials. The negotiations were broken off Saturday 
after the death of President Kim Il Sung, but U.S. officials said in Geneva 
that they might restart soon after Kim's funeral next Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin's comments served notice that despite a much-proclaimed new sweetness 
in Russia's relations with the industrial powers, he intends to keep speaking 
freely -- particularly because it will help him counter recurring criticism at 
home that he has made too many concessions to foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin's words left his aides glowing with satisfaction but seemed to 
contradict declarations from Clinton minutes earlier that Russia and Estonia 
had "narrowed their differences" and might agree on the troops' departure in 
the "near future." Clinton announced that he had helped arrange a meeting 
between Yeltsin and Estonian President Lennart Meri, which he said he hoped 
will open the way for final troop departures by the end of August. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian president's pronouncement was also likely to set off new alarms in 
the Baltics, where government leaders and the non-Russian public have been 
determined to see a final withdrawal of the Russians by Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 One U.S. official, smiling ruefully, acknowledged that Yeltsin's pungent 
commentary "was not part of any pre-scripted" presentation that was to follow 
the two leaders' afternoon talks. "That was a freewheeling press conference," 
the official said with a sigh. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. aides said they considered the comments a negotiating tactic and that 
they also understood Yeltsin's need to display his independence in order to put 
off criticism at home, including from his ultranationalist rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a vintage performance from a guy who's having a good day," one U.S. 
official said. "This is also for domestic consumption." 
</P>
<P>
 Another said Clinton himself found the episode amusing proof of Yeltsin's 
political skills. 
</P>
<P>
 And U.S. officials insisted that despite Yeltsin's bravado, they expect the 
Russians to withdraw fully by the end of August. The United States has tried to 
ensure that withdrawal by providing 2,500 grants worth $25,000 each for former 
Soviet troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to Clinton repeatedly as "Bill," Yeltsin asserted that Russia is no 
longer the supplicant that has approached the advanced nations repeatedly since 
the fall of communism to ask financial assistance. Even so, he got in a jab at 
the Group of Seven nations for failing to deliver fully on the $4.34 billion 
they pledged at last year's summit in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hurts a little bit" that Russia hadn't so far received even half the money 
it was promised a year ago, Yeltsin lamented. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Yeltsin came away from the summit with promises of only about $3.5 
billion in new loans, and even that is dependent on modification of some rules 
of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin's specific economic grievance was that the United States has so far 
not dismantled Cold War-era laws intended to keep Communist countries from 
obtaining computer and aerospace technology that could be used to make weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has to do with a certain discrimination toward Russia in trade," Yeltsin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said the government intends to eliminate those Cold War-era 
export controls but has not gotten around to doing so. Officials intend to 
replace them with a new international rubric for controlling militarily 
valuable exports to pariah nations. Russia would be a member of the 
international group. 
</P>
<P>
 For Clinton, the summit was marred by the rejection of an Administration 
proposal intended to lead to a further lowering of trade barriers -- an 
initiative most other Group of Seven leaders feared would complicate passage in 
their parliaments of the latest round of the global treaty called the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
</P>
<P>
 The final day of the summit displayed the mixed views Clinton's peers hold of 
his leadership. While Yeltsin spoke warmly of Clinton, French President 
Francois Mitterrand offered a milder assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitterrand, who Saturday led the hasty rebuff of Clinton's trade initiative, 
said in a briefing that Clinton is "young, and not unintelligent." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. aides, meanwhile, said the downbeat assessments of Clinton's performance 
overlooked his behind-the-scenes efforts, including his successful effort to 
make other leaders commit to what turned out to be a $4-billion package of 
benefits for Ukraine. Other European officials acknowledged that Clinton had, 
in fact, pressed for the commitment, which is expected to give Ukrainian 
President Leonid Kravchuk an important boost. 
</P>
<P>
 The Group of Seven leaders spoke loudest on Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin said the group will act with "as much character as we have in our 
bodies." In the negotiations, Yeltsin was also emphatic on the need to stop a 
war that has claimed an estimated 200,000 lives. At one point, he clasped his 
hands in front of himself and said, "We're together on this; we're going to get 
it done." 
</P>
<P>
 British Prime Minister John Major warned that "the risk of this war spreading 
is very real." 
</P>
<P>
 The final statement carried an implicit threat that the group will lift the 
arms embargo against the Bosnian Muslims if the Serbian fighters do not go 
along. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the group discussed North Korea, including the murky question 
of who will succeed Kim Il Sung. The communique called on the country to 
"remove, once and for all, the suspicions surrounding its nuclear activities." 
</P>
<P>
 But the G-7 leaders did not agree on what they will do if North Korea's new 
leadership ignores pressure on the country to end its nuclear program.

SMOOTH TRANSITION SEEN IN N. KOREA; ASIA: KIM JONG IL APPEARS TO BE 
CONSOLIDATING POWER IN WAKE OF HIS FATHER'S DEATH, SEOUL OFFICIALS SAY. GENEVA 
NUCLEAR TALKS AND NORTH-SOUTH SUMMIT ARE POSTPONED.

<P>
 Kim Jong Il, the secretive son of the late North Korean dictator Kim Il Sung, 
appeared to be moving "more smoothly and more rapidly than expected" Sunday 
toward an official takeover of the leadership of the Stalinist nation, South 
Korea's Unification Ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
 No signs were seen of a power struggle, nor of any military movements. South 
Korea had immediately ordered a military alert after Saturday's announcement of 
Kim's death, but the United States, which maintains 37,000 troops here, did not 
follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Saturday night and Sunday, North Korean radio broadcasted pledges of 
loyalty to Kim Jong Il from North Korean officials. 
</P>
<P>
 And Radio Pyongyang, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp., carried the 
report that security officers had acknowledged Kim Jong Il as their new leader. 
The younger Kim, who had never served in the army, was named commander of the 
military only 2 1/2 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Unification Ministry's evaluation was given after South Korean officials 
spent Sunday analyzing reports and studying measures related to Kim's death, an 
event that leaders here have been predicting for years would herald the first 
possibility for major change in the northern half of their divided nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Although fear of Kim Jong Il, 52, who is blamed here for instigating terrorist 
attacks against the South, runs high, hope has also emerged for a change for 
the better. A Gallup Poll found that 41% of the respondents felt that Kim Il 
Sung's death had lowered the chances of a war; 36% believed chances had 
increased. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea today notified the South that it would have to postpone what would 
have been a first-ever meeting between the presidents of the North and South. 
President Kim Young Sam of South Korea had been scheduled to visit the North 
Korean capital from July 25 to 27. 
</P>
<P>
 In Geneva, U.S. and North Korean officials agreed to a brief postponement of 
their talks over Pyongyang's nuclear program. They decided that a specific date 
for resuming the talks will be set after Kim Il Sung's funeral next Sunday. 
U.S. officials suggested that the talks might start up soon after the funeral, 
around the last week of July. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Secretary of State Robert L. Gallucci, the top U.S. negotiator, 
called the delay "proper, under the circumstances." He said North Korean 
officials at the Geneva talks assured him that North Korean policies will 
continue and that the assurances given by Kim Il Sung of a freeze on the 
nuclear program will remain in place. 
</P>
<P>
 Top Clinton Administration officials in Washington took to the Sunday talk 
shows to assert that the White House plans to be "vigilant" in assessing the 
new situation in North Korea, while at the same time signaling its willingness 
to continue talks with Pyongyang. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, this is a period of sensitive transition," White House Chief of 
Staff Leon Panetta told the CBS program "Face the Nation." "I think the 
guideposts for us are to be very cautious and very vigilant but to hope that we 
can return to the dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
 In Pyongyang, thousands of mourners, many of them arriving in groups, fell to 
their knees, their heads bowed and their hands on the pavement, weeping and 
sobbing in front of a massive statue of the late "Great Leader." Many left 
bouquets of flowers around the base of the sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
 The scenes were shown on South Korean television, which monitors northern TV, 
at unprecedented length. Only after South Korea's own dictatorial rule ended in 
1987 were North Korean TV clips permitted on the air here -- and even then for 
only one hour a week. 
</P>
<P>
 China, meanwhile, added its support. In messages of condolence, its top 
leaders expressed their "strong belief that the Korean people would carry out 
the behest of the 'Great Leader' . . . and unite (under) Comrade Kim Jong Il." 
</P>
<P>
 All members of the 687-member Supreme People's Congress, which elects the 
president, and the 145-person Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party, 
which picks the party boss, were summoned to Pyongyang for meetings today. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not clear, however, whether Kim Jong Il will be elevated to the two top 
posts immediately. South Korean analysts speculated that Kim might be named 
successor during the state funeral for the nation's founder and only leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Kim Jong Il wins his expected stamp of approval, the changes he might 
bring to North Korea's policies of militancy and terrorism can only be guessed 
at. 
</P>
<P>
 This includes North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons. Some 
experts believe Kim Jong Il has personally directed the nuclear program. 
</P>
<P>
 But Secretary of State Warren Christopher, attending the summit of the major 
Western democracies in Naples, Italy, suggested Sunday that U.S. officials 
believe that Kim Jong Il may have played a key role in his country's recent 
overtures to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think he may have been involved in the decision to start the (U.S.-North 
Korean) talks in Geneva," Christopher said, "as well as the North-South talks" 
between Seoul and Pyongyang. 
</P>
<P>
 But "we know relatively little about him," Christopher said. "We've not had 
contact with him, and he's been largely out of the press and out of public 
appearances in recent years." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawaii University Prof. Suh Dae Suk, interviewed by the Joong Ang newspaper, 
predicted that Kim will establish himself in power, focus on bringing growth 
back to a declining economy and adopt a more rational and flexible attitude 
toward better relations and ultimate reunification with the South. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kim Jong Il is not as violent and unpredictable as South Koreans generally 
believe," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Hak Joon, once an adviser to former South Korean President Roh Tae Woo, 
said that Kim Jong Il is virtually guaranteed two years at the helm of North 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if members of the ruling group have complaints about Kim Jong Il, they 
will have to rally around him to fill the vacuum created by the death of the 
'Great Leader,' " said Kim, now chairman of the board of Dankuk University. 
</P>
<P>
 He predicted that Kim Jong Il ultimately will fail and be replaced by an 
alliance of pragmatic military officers and technocrats, with whom South Korea 
will be able to cooperate on such issues as economic development.

COLUMN ONE; THE IMPACT OF COSMIC COLLISIONS; WHEN A COMET HITS JUPITER THIS 
WEEK, SCIENTISTS WILL GET THEIR FIRST CHANCE TO SEE THE SORT OF CATACLYSMIC 
CRASH THAT MAY HAVE SPARKED LIFE -- AND DEATH -- ON EARTH EONS AGO.

<P>
 Eugene Shoemaker, who has spent his life scanning the heavens for starry 
messengers, thinks we are all the children of comets. 
</P>
<P>
 The genial Arizona astronomer embraces the theory that organic chemicals sown 
by comets that struck Earth eons ago may have been the key components enabling 
life to root in the planet's barren crust. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in periodic impacts so violent that thousands of species died, comets 
pounded life into its most modern form, indiscriminately wiping out some 
promising organisms and allowing others to thrive. By some expert estimates, as 
many as 5 million comets may have bombarded Earth in its first billion years. 
</P>
<P>
 At least that's the theory. 
</P>
<P>
 No one has actually seen a comet hit anything. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, humanity will get its first glimpse of the cataclysmic collisions 
that helped shape the planets and perhaps the evolution of life on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 An unusual comet, Shoemaker-Levy 9, will strike Jupiter just before 1 p.m. 
Saturday with the force of up to a million nuclear weapons. The comet was 
discovered by Shoemaker, his wife, Carolyn, also an astronomer at Lowell 
Observatory in Flagstaff, and David H. Levy, a colleague at Palomar Observatory 
near San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 What they hope to see is a glimpse into the Earth's catastrophic past and a 
troubling look at the hazards it will almost certainly face in the future. Some 
astronomers believe that the threat of a cosmic collision involving Earth is 
higher now than at any time in recent history. 
</P>
<P>
 So Shoemaker-Levy 9 is the focus of the largest coordinated astronomical 
effort in history. Telescopes around the world -- and space probes around the 
solar system -- will be straining to capture an image of the impacts. 
</P>
<P>
 Jupiter's powerful gravitational field already has ripped the comet into a 
string of 21 fragments -- some a mile in diameter -- hurtling toward the 
planet's far side like immense buckshot, according to Hubble Space Telescope 
scientist Harold Weaver. The bombardment should last five days. 
</P>
<P>
 The impending collision has roused public interest as scientists reassess the 
role that comets may have played in past planetary disasters, while astronomers 
are becoming more wary of the hundreds of asteroids and comets known to cross 
Earth's path today. 
</P>
<P>
 To a handful of dedicated astronomers, the shooting stars that burn through 
Earth's atmosphere every night are more than a clear evening's romantic 
counterpoint. They are tokens of a threat that could wipe out almost all life 
on the planet -- as celestial impacts may have done several times in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Protected by the umbrella of the atmosphere, Earth speeds through a cosmic 
rain of comets, asteroids, meteors, dust and other rubble left over from the 
creation of the solar system. There may be 100 billion comets in all, most 
clustered in a loose shell of debris called the Oort Cloud about 1 1/2 light 
years from the sun. Each comet, with a nucleus up to 30 miles in diameter, is 
embedded in a cloud of gas and dust, moving in a highly elliptical orbit around 
the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike asteroids, which are simply very large rocks, comets can develop 
spectacular -- and characteristic -- fiery plumes as they near the center of 
the solar system. Even if a comet's core is small, its tail can be immense. 
</P>
<P>
 One comet, observed in the last century, had a tail that stretched the 
distance from Earth to Mars. Asteroids tend to cluster in a predictable band 
between Mars and Jupiter; comets swoop in toward the sun from any angle. 
</P>
<P>
 Although small asteroids are thought to strike our planet every century or so, 
a disastrous encounter with an object the size of just one of the fragments 
speeding toward Jupiter might take place on Earth only once every few hundred 
thousand years. Larger objects can be expected every few million years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Earth is under a constant shower of smaller cosmic bombs that do not make 
it all the way through the planet's protective atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously classified data from military early warning satellites shows that 
every year up to eight large meteors explode in the upper atmosphere with the 
force of a small atomic bomb. The explosions have escaped detection by civilian 
astronomers. They had no effect on the Earth's surface. 
</P>
<P>
 But in 1908, a massive fireball hurtled to within four miles of the Earth and 
exploded, leveling a swath of forest the size of Rhode Island in the Tunguska 
region of northern Siberia. The blast is thought to have involved an object 
about 200 yards in diameter. 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows what caused the explosion -- a comet, an asteroid, a black hole 
or anti-matter -- but it was strong enough to knock a man out of his chair 60 
miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses estimated that the object had a tail of fire 540 miles long. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1978, an explosion equal to 100 kilotons of TNT -- believed to have been an 
asteroid impact -- occurred in the Pacific. The blast was so powerful it was 
first mistaken for a clandestine nuclear test. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989 and 1991, asteroids narrowly missed the Earth. The January, 1991, 
episode was the closer call. An asteroid 30 feet in diameter passed between the 
Earth and its moon. New research indicates that some asteroids known to stray 
across Earth's orbit on occasion may be the cores of extinct comets. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, a 2,200-pound meteorite broke up and rained debris over a heavily 
populated area of Mbale, Uganda. Chunks of rock smashed through a train station 
and crashed into a cotton factory and at least one home. A boy was struck by a 
fragment, the first person known to have survived being hit on the head by an 
extraterrestrial object, according to the science journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
 Last August, the comet Swift-Tuttle, its orbit perturbed by Jupiter and other 
planets, passed close enough to Earth to cause one of the most intense meteor 
storms in a century as the planet brushed its tail. NASA was worried enough to 
postpone the launch of a space shuttle until the danger passed and took 
precautions to safeguard its orbiting Hubble telescope from collisions. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, geochemists and paleontologists have uncovered the buried 
evidence of Earth's violent encounters with other celestial bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, a team led by UCLA geochemist John Wasson announced that it had 
detected evidence of a 2-billion-ton celestial object that crashed into 
Southeast Asia about 770,000 years ago with the force of 1,000 hydrogen bombs. 
</P>
<P>
 There are about 150 known impact craters on Earth. The largest -- on Mexico's 
Yucatan Peninsula -- is more than 110 miles across. It is the imprint of a 
comet or asteroid that hit Earth 65 million years ago at the same time 
dinosaurs apparently vanished. 
</P>
<P>
 The object that caused the crater is believed to have been about six miles in 
diameter -- about three times the size of the largest fragment speeding toward 
Jupiter and 12 times the size of the object that Wasson thinks devastated 
Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers offer tantalizing geological evidence that collisions with comets 
could have caused more than just the dinosaurs' demise. Cosmic collision may 
have played a role in half a dozen other major extinctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists say the regularity of such extinction -- every 35 million years or 
so -- suggests the timing of a comet's orbit. David Raup, a paleontologist at 
the University of Chicago, has concluded that about 60% of species extinctions 
may have been caused by asteroids, comets and other bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 Although comets may have been responsible for eliminating many species, 
astronomers at the University of Illinois have detected evidence that the amino 
acids crucial to the development of life on Earth can exist in space, lending 
support to the idea that comets also seeded the planet with the building blocks 
of essential proteins. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether any more such apocalyptic events await the Earth is unknown, but some 
European astronomers argue that the impact hazard facing Earth today is 
unusually severe. 
</P>
<P>
 The planet, they say, is passing through an unusual cloud of small comets, 
asteroids and other debris from a giant comet that broke up about 20,000 years 
ago as it approached Earth's orbit -- just as the Shoemaker-Levy comet is 
believed to have shattered two years ago on its approach to Jupiter. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual Taurid meteor shower is believed to be the most visible remnant of 
that giant comet. But there may be at least 10 large asteroid-sized fragments 
of the comet that also cross Earth's path regularly, researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1973, astronomers have identified more than 200 sizable objects -- 
asteroids or extinct comets that range up to 24 miles in diameter -- that cross 
Earth's orbit, posing some danger of collision. They discover new ones at the 
rate of a few dozen every year. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, astronomers briefly thought that the Swift-Tuttle comet -- 
responsible for the annual Perseid meteor shower -- would collide with Earth in 
the 21st Century. When they double-checked their calculations, they realized 
they were wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "What this all means is that, as far as we can see, the Chinese curse has come 
true: We do live in interesting times. The impact hazard is much higher at 
present," said Duncan Steel at the Anglo-Australian Observatory in 
Coonabarabran, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect of an impending collision lent new urgency to a lobbying campaign 
for a missile system to defend the planet against any asteroid or comet that 
strayed too close. Congressional reports were commissioned. Some astronomers 
proposed a $50-million "Safeguard" system of telescopes and sensors to pinpoint 
any large object threatening Earth. Researchers at the Los Alamos National 
Laboratory in New Mexico suggested spending $100 million a year to develop 
interceptors to deflect an asteroid or comet. Others suggested hurling nuclear 
bombs. 
</P>
<P>
 Many scientists and policy-makers greeted the ideas with derision. No funds 
have been allocated, but NASA has taken the threat seriously enough to propose 
launching a satellite in 1996 to seek clues about the nature and origin of 
near-Earth objects. 
</P>
<P>
 In the very long run, some astronomers suggest, the hazard will only get 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
 The solar system is expected to pass close enough to other star systems in the 
next 45,000 years that the nearby stars could nudge as many as 100,000 comets 
out of the Oort cloud and toward our inner solar system, according to research 
published by the Royal Astronomical Society. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the distances are so vast that any risk to Earth may not actually 
materialize for another 20 million years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since before the first telescope, people have brooded over the appearance of 
comets in the sky, greeting each new apparition as a harbinger of disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Even today, after decades of scientific observation, comets are a mystery 
compounded by mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 Set in motion billions of years ago, they careen unpredictably from the 
farthest reaches of the solar system, past the planets and around the sun like 
pinballs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are streams of cometary debris in the solar system," and Earth is 
continually exposed to the risks they present, said Mark Bailey, of the 
Liverpool John Moores University in England. 
</P>
<P>
 No one is certain what a comet is made of. It may be rock, a loosely compacted 
snowball of ice and gravel, or a confection of gases that resembles nothing 
quite so much as frozen car exhaust. 
</P>
<P>
 The best evidence suggests that they are so fragile a person could pull one 
apart. Yet a comet of sufficient size traveling fast enough can lay waste to a 
planet with one blow. 
</P>
<P>
 When the European Space Agency maneuvered a probe alongside Halley's Comet in 
1986 -- mankind's closest intentional encounter with any comet -- space 
scientists caught a fleeting glimpse of an irregular, coal-black object shaped 
like an immense potato. That encounter raised as many questions about a comet's 
composition as scientists had hoped it would answer. 
</P>
<P>
 What scientists do know is that celestial collisions are as common -- at least 
in astronomical terms -- as freeway fender-benders. 
</P>
<P>
 Impact craters scar all the inner planets, including Earth. The solar system's 
largest crater -- more than 1,500 miles across and 7.5 miles deep -- is no 
further away than the moon. It was discovered near the moon's south pole this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, most scientists believed comets were too small to cause such 
monumental craters. But recently, some European astronomers proposed the 
existence of so-called "great" comets more than 180 miles in diameter that 
could be responsible for the impacts previously attributed to large meteors or 
asteroids. 
</P>
<P>
 When such a comet disintegrates, it could shower the inner solar system with a 
million lethal fragments, each more than half a mile in diameter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is that great comets exist -- with masses thousands of times 
the mass of Halley's Comet," Bailey says. "The hazard posed by comets has to be 
considered in the same breath as the asteroid hazard." 
</P>
<P>
 Jupiter plays a crucial role in steering the course of comets throughout the 
solar system. 
</P>
<P>
 Its immense gravity can hurl comets and asteroids onto new courses that take 
them into the inner solar system -- and closer to Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers now suspect that comets like Shoemaker-Levy, which Jupiter pulled 
apart into a distinctive "string of pearls," may not be as rare as initially 
believed. 
</P>
<P>
 Astronomers at the University of Hawaii and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 
Pasadena calculate that comets may break up as often as once a century -- 
relatively frequently in the lifetime of the solar system. 
</P>
<P>
 A chain of identical craters 21 miles long on the surface of the moon is 
believed to be evidence of such a breakup. Inspired by Shoemaker-Levy, 
astronomers suggest that it was caused when a comet passed too close to Earth, 
shattered and struck the moon. 
</P>
<P>
 There also are similar chains of identically sized craters on two of Jupiter's 
moons, Callisto and Ganymede. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the giant planet captures passing comets -- as evidently is the case 
with Shoemaker-Levy 9. Astronomers even speculate that four of Jupiter's 16 
moons are comet fragments. 
</P>
<P>
 Astronomers anxiously awaiting Saturday's collision caution that they aren't 
sure whether the comet will end in a bang or a whimper. By then, Jupiter's 
immense tidal forces may well reduce the fragments to harmless shoals of flying 
gravel. 
</P>
<P>
 But scientists hope to witness the kind of collision that is thought to have 
wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. Even if the bombardment is that 
violent, it will have little effect on Jupiter because the planet is so large. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time in history we've been able to predict a major impact 
and then prepare to observe it directly," Shoemaker said.

MEXICO OFFICIALS CHARGED IN PROBE OF SMUGGLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The regional chief of the Mexican immigration service in Tijuana and two 
deputies have been dismissed and charged with corruption in a growing scandal 
involving an alleged network of Mexican federal officials allied with immigrant 
smugglers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican Secretariat of the Interior is investigating allegations that the 
immigration service delegation in Tijuana earned as much as $70,000 a week for 
providing safe passage through the border region for Chinese, Central American 
and other non-Mexican immigrants. A well-informed Mexican official said that 
further revelations and arrests are likely. 
</P>
<P>
 The corruption has become so systemic that some Mexican immigration inspectors 
allegedly traveled elsewhere in Mexico to escort groups of U.S.-bound illegal 
immigrants by plane to Tijuana, according to a report released last week by a 
veteran human rights activist. 
</P>
<P>
 A law enforcement source in the report described the practices of such brazen 
"agent-smugglers." The agent "travels to Cancun, for example, and brings 20 or 
30 people. When the agent gets to the immigration checkpoint at the airport, 
the agent himself pays his colleagues. Then he transports (the migrants) in his 
own vehicles. There is one who they call 'the Orient Express,' because he 
brings Asians from Cancun." 
</P>
<P>
 Alleged misconduct by immigration administrators in Tijuana recently provoked 
a complaint from the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City in the form of a diplomatic 
note of protest, according to Mexican officials. Asked to comment, a U.S. 
Embassy representative said only that the U.S. government "expressed its 
concern about the allegations to the government of Mexico, which advised that 
it would take appropriate steps." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican federal attorney general's office Friday arraigned Virgilio 
Alberto Munoz Perez, the regional immigration delegate and a well-known former 
newspaper editor in Tijuana, on charges including abuse of authority. Munoz's 
former deputy and a former chief inspector, who remains a fugitive, were also 
dismissed and charged. 
</P>
<P>
 The crackdown bolsters suspicions expressed last year by U.S. and Mexican law 
enforcement agents when the flow of Chinese border-crossers through the Baja 
corridor escalated: Despite pledges to crack down on non-Mexican illegal 
immigrants, some Mexican authorities appear to be an integral part of the 
big-money smuggling industry at the border. 
</P>
<P>
 The revelations come during a period of turbulence and violence in Mexico that 
has made law enforcement corruption a top issue of the August presidential 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, human rights activist Victor Clark Alfaro of the Bi-National Center 
for Human Rights released a 20-page investigative report in which law 
enforcement insiders and smugglers give a detailed look at illicit money making 
in the regional branch of the National Institute of Migration, the agency's 
formal title. 
</P>
<P>
 "The enrichment has been scandalous and ominous," Clark stated, accusing 
immigration officials of treating migrants like "merchandise." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark said he spoke Friday to Interior Secretary Jorge Carpizo MacGregor, 
whose ministry oversees the immigration service. Carpizo assured him that 
investigators are scrutinizing the more than 15 federal officials accused of 
misconduct in the report, Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the report, titled "Old Forms and New Methods of Corruption,"the 
past 18 months have seen a boom in corruption attributable to immigration 
delegate Munoz and his predecessor, Fabio Gaxiola Paredes, who served during 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of extorting the migrants themselves, top officials and inspectors 
assigned to the high-volume hubs of Tijuana's migratory network -- the city bus 
station, Abelardo L. Rodriguez International Airport, the border ports of entry 
-- cemented connections directly with the kingpins of smuggling "mafias," 
according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 These criminal rings specialize in illegal immigrants from China, Central 
America and India, and earn up to $250,000 a week, according to one estimate. 
They control an array of safehouses, vehicles, drivers, guides, recruiters and 
other foot soldiers on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border. 
</P>
<P>
 Although non-Mexicans account for about 10% of arrests made by U.S. border 
agents, they are the most lucrative of human traffic -- and therefore have much 
better chances of crossing the border without getting caught. Chinese pay 
smugglers up to $30,000 apiece for their lengthy journey, compared to the 
average $350 fare for Mexicans traveling from Tijuana to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to accepting bribes and looking the other way, Clark charged, 
officials actively participate in wrongdoing. They allegedly protect preferred 
smugglers from incursions by rivals, shake down non-Mexican immigrants with 
threats of deportation and detain unsuccessful migrants who are returned to 
Tijuana by U.S. agents in order to "sell" potential clients to smugglers, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The sum total has been the "opening, protection and consolidation of a 
migratory route of foreigners transported by smuggling mafias from south to 
north, abetted by immigration officials," Clark concluded.

RACE PLAYS PART IN HAITI POLICY, U.S. AIDE SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton's chief adviser on Haiti said Sunday that there is "some 
truth" to critics' charges that the United States has a tougher immigration 
policy for Haitians because they are black, but he defended Clinton's overall 
efforts as humane. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to argue that difference, because I think that there is some 
truth to that statement," William H. Gray III said when confronted with the 
allegation on ABC's "This Week With David Brinkley." 
</P>
<P>
 Gray's comments came as Panamanian President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares 
said he is prepared to accept a group of Haitian refugees at a U.S. military 
base in Panama, the Reuters news service reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez, speaking to reporters at Panama's Tocumen International Airport, did 
not say when the Haitians could begin arriving in Panama. But he said they 
would be fewer than the 10,000 requested by the United States and that they 
could stay for no more than six months. On Sept. 1, Perez is scheduled to take 
over from President Guillermo Endara, who agreed last week to accept the 
refugees and then shocked the Clinton Administration by changing his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray's comments, which he tempered somewhat, marked the first time that a 
senior Administration official has admitted that U.S. immigration policies 
toward Haitian refugees are at least partly based on race. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray, a former Democratic congressman from Pennsylvania who now heads the 
United Negro College Fund, was once the chairman of the Congressional Black 
Caucus, one of the most outspoken critics of U.S. policy toward Haiti during 
both the George Bush and the Clinton administrations. 
</P>
<P>
 It was largely because of complaints from the Black Caucus that Clinton began 
easing the Bush-era policies on Haiti that he had been following for the first 
1 1/2 years of his term. Caucus complaints also influenced Clinton's decision 
to name Gray to head the effort to resolve the situation in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray, however, carefully asserted Sunday that there has been a distinction in 
the way different immigrant groups have been treated throughout U.S. history, 
and he defended the Administration's policy as one that has expanded "haven" 
protection for Haitians. 
</P>
<P>
 "The announcement made this week actually gives more political asylum to 
Haitians than ever before, because we've gotten six other countries involved 
(as potential hosts for haven facilities)," Gray said. "And we're expanding 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Haitians continued to stay home Sunday for a second day in a row instead of 
setting out to be picked up by U.S. patrol ships -- bolstering earlier 
suggestions that the Administration's new restrictions on asylum-seekers may be 
having an impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials reported that 398 Haitians were intercepted Sunday, reinforcing a 
drop-off to 242 people Saturday. The figures had been far heavier since 
mid-June, when the United States expanded its refugee-processing facilities. On 
Friday, the total was 1,859. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the exodus was dampened somewhat by bad weather in the region over 
the weekend, officials said there were increasing indications that radio 
broadcasts that the United States has been beaming to Haiti describing the new 
restrictions may be beginning to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities cautioned that while Sunday's figures seemed "encouraging," it is 
too soon to conclude definitively that the decline will hold. Reports from 
Haiti say that many Haitians are continuing to build escape boats and may use 
them soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton eased immigration policies June 16, allowing Haitians to seek asylum 
on ships in the Caribbean and off the coast of Jamaica that are equipped to 
process their applications, but the shift spawned an exodus of refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to slow the exodus, the White House announced last week that 
Haitians intercepted at sea would no longer be allowed to immigrate to America 
and would instead be transported to "havens" outside the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new policy, only those Haitians who apply for asylum at the U.S. 
Embassy in Port-au-Prince and two provincial locations will be allowed into the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a Navy task force carrying about 2,000 Marines continued to steam 
toward Haiti amid increasing warnings by top officials that the United States 
might invade the island nation if the military junta there does not step down. 
The ships are due to arrive tonight or Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher, in Naples, Italy, for the summit of the 
world's seven richest industrialized democracies, said on NBC's "Meet the 
Press" that an invasion "is one of the things on the table" in case Haiti's 
military rulers do not step down. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray's allusion to racial factors in U.S. immigration policies was reiterated 
by Rep. Carrie Meek (D-Fla.), a current member of the Black Caucus. Meek said 
on "This Week With David Brinkley" that "there is a double standard" in U.S. 
immigration policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Other top Administration officials had little to say on the subject. 
Christopher sidestepped a question on the racial issue entirely, saying 
Americans "need to remember where the real problem is" -- with the Haitian 
military.

HEALTH REFORM MAY REFLECT BUSH APPROACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN TUMULTY and EDWIN CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Call it the George Herbert Walker Clinton Health Care Act. 
</P>
<P>
 In what may turn out to be the ultimate irony of Bill Clinton's presidency, it 
appears that any health care legislation that emerges from a yearlong battle on 
Capitol Hill will look more like George Bush's vision of reform than Clinton's. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Democratic leaders in the House and Senate may succeed in their 
struggle to reverse the political tide, momentum now appears to be building 
toward a consensus that would drastically scale back the role of government 
initially proposed by Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of government, the still-evolving legislation appears likely to rely 
primarily on private businesses to bring health care costs under control. It 
probably will fall considerably short of Clinton's goal of making sure that all 
Americans who are now uninsured would be able to obtain coverage. And it would 
do little or nothing to distribute the health care burden more equitably by 
requiring employers to take part and by reducing rampant cost-shifting between 
different groups of patients and providers. 
</P>
<P>
 This more modest approach, which puts most of its faith in reforming the 
insurance market and giving government subsidies to those who cannot afford 
coverage, has a familiar ring. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question we are heading back to the Bush health plan. Absolutely," 
said Richard I. Smith, the top health care analyst at the Assn. of Private 
Pension and Welfare Plans, a consortium of large employers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that we've been starkly confronted with a dramatically different vision 
that arguably goes much too far, the clear trade-offs are apparent and the more 
modest approach looks better," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Two House and two Senate panels have approved their own versions of health 
care reform. Although the bills still must clear the House and Senate floors, 
some outlines of what could be the ultimate legislation are coming into focus. 
</P>
<P>
 Already gone are Clinton's huge, government-organized "alliances" through 
which most Americans would have bought their health coverage. Instead, the 
congressional committees have opted for voluntary cooperatives -- similar to 
the concept pioneered in California -- through which small businesses and 
individuals could pool their purchasing power. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also fairly clear that government will not have as much power over 
health care costs as Clinton had proposed. Most of the committees weakened his 
provision to impose caps on increases in health insurance premiums, and there 
will be intense pressure on the floors of the House and Senate to water them 
down further or discard them entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 The most important question that remains is whether Clinton can hold to his 
goal of guaranteeing coverage for every American. House and Senate leaders 
insist that they will present legislation that does that, but no one has come 
up with a politically acceptable means of paying the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Leon E. Panetta, the newly appointed White House chief of staff, reiterated 
Sunday that Clinton will fight for universal coverage in some form, which he 
said must be financed by a so-called employer mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's alive is universal coverage, and to get to universal coverage you have 
to have some kind of mandate . . . ," Panetta said on CBS-TV's "Face the 
Nation." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton would require employers to pay 80% of their workers' health premiums. 
Most outside analysts say they believe that Congress is likely to follow the 
lead of the Senate Finance Committee, which abandoned the employer mandate in 
the face of enormous opposition from the business community. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the committee voted in favor of a package of incentives and reforms 
that its sponsors predict will lead to the coverage of roughly 20 million of 
the more than 37 million Americans who now lack health insurance. Critics, 
however, say that projection is far too optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 The winners in this monumental battle are likely to be employers -- which is 
not a bad thing in the view of Paul Ellwood, a guru of the "managed 
competition" theory to which most in the health care debate now say they 
subscribe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the employers have been the most powerful influence in shaping 
whatever positive directions the health system is taking," Ellwood said. 
Corporations have been at the forefront in embracing such cost-saving 
approaches as managed care and are increasingly hard-nosed in bargaining down 
rates that hospitals and insurers can charge. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, health care costs are moderating even without a government 
overhaul of the system. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet those benefits would largely miss the working poor and the middle-class 
uninsured, which means most of those who now lack coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 If anything, "the consequences of being without health insurance are becoming 
more extreme," as hospitals find it more difficult to shift the costs of 
providing charity care to those who pay, said Bill Custer, research director of 
the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a nonprofit public-policy research 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Custer added, "there's a fairly straightforward way to solve the problem 
of coverage, and that's just to throw money at it." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the approach now taking shape on Capitol Hill, the government would try 
a different strategy. It would give money or vouchers to those unable to afford 
health coverage -- a variation on Bush's plan to provide $3,750 in tax credits 
to low-income families and the same amount in tax deductions for middle-income 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 However promising the idea may sound, it is far from clear that there will be 
enough money to do it. By most estimates, any meaningful subsidy program would 
cost tens of billions of dollars a year; none of the congressional committees 
has come up with a politically popular way of raising the money. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, a so-called fail-safe provision in the Senate Finance Committee 
bill would actually reduce the subsidies if overall health care spending rose 
faster under a revised health system than it would otherwise have increased 
under the current setup. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no guarantee that the subsidies are going to be there. If costs get 
out of line, the subsidies are the first thing to get cut back," said Gail 
Shearer, manager of policy analysis for Consumers Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, the approach that is being shaped in Congress would change the 
problem of cost-shifting, but it would not end it, analysts said. People who 
now do not have coverage generally get health care when they most desperately 
need it. Hospitals and doctors then add the costs to the bills of their paying 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 The same is true with the federal health insurance programs, Medicare and 
Medicaid, which do not compensate health providers fully. Some of the true 
costs of those programs also are being borne by private insurance customers. 
</P>
<P>
 The key proposals before Congress, including Clinton's, look to cuts in 
Medicare for some of the savings they need to fund other areas of the health 
care reform effort. "That could actually exaggerate the cost shifts to the 
private sector," Ellwood said. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, Custer said, as corporations and health maintenance organizations 
strike tougher bargains with private hospitals, fewer of them will be willing 
to provide uncompensated care. That means the uninsured will increasingly find 
their way to public hospitals, putting a greater demand on local property 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet if the bill that ultimately emerges from Congress seems modest in relation 
to the grand proposal unveiled last fall by the President, analysts insist that 
it should nonetheless be regarded as no small feat. 
</P>
<P>
 As Drew Altman, president of the Menlo Park, Calif.-based Kaiser Family 
Foundation, put it: "We are in a position where even the most conservative 
proposal, while far short of comprehensive reform and rapid universal coverage, 
would still in itself be the most significant piece of federal health 
legislation since Medicare and Medicaid."

SLAB CITY SHOWDOWN; ARTWORK MAY BE BULLDOZED AS AN ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONY PERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The laws of God and the laws of man are on a collision course in a hot and 
sandy wasteland east of the Salton Sea. 
</P>
<P>
 For eight years a sublimely contented artist named Leonard Knight has been 
painting religious messages on a large mound of desert earth he calls Salvation 
Mountain. Knight painted, the public watched, and everybody, or so it seemed, 
was happy. 
</P>
<P>
 Religious pilgrims and curiosity seekers came to Salvation Mountain to witness 
its timeless communication, "God Is Love." The story of one man's multicolored 
obsession was chronicled by the news media in this country and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, in the name of progress and environmental purity, Salvation Mountain 
appears to have a reluctant rendezvous with a bulldozer. 
</P>
<P>
 Soil samples have uncovered a high level of lead at Salvation Mountain, the 
result of Knight slathering it with an estimated 10,000 gallons of paint. He 
has adorned his mountain with Biblical citations (John 3:16), an American flag, 
the Lord's Prayer, Sinner's Prayer, a variety of pastoral scenes and more. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm dumbfounded at what's happening," said Knight, 65, who lives rent-free in 
the back of his 1951 Chevrolet truck just a few dozen yards from his mountain. 
A Korean War veteran and transplanted Vermonter, Knight has worked as a welder 
and handyman and now subsists on Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
 Knight sees Salvation Mountain -- which is three stories high and 100 feet 
long -- as a monument to God. He thinks it ought to be saved. Imperial County 
Supervisor Brad Luckey thinks differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a mess," Luckey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Knight's offbeat creation sits at the entryway to an abandoned military base 
that has become a squatters' camp called Slab City. Each winter some 5,000 
"snowbirds" flock to Slab City in recreational vehicles, trailers, converted 
buses and high-mileage automobiles in search of free rent. 
</P>
<P>
 The Imperial County government wants to take over Slab City from the state of 
California, which inherited it from the Army after World War II. The county 
would like to bring some order -- and water and toilets and trash pickup -- to 
the 600-plus acres of weeds and gravel. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Lands Commission would like nothing better than to unload Slab City, 
which has become something of an of embarrassment. Several attempts in recent 
years to find a private buyer have flopped. 
</P>
<P>
 The lands commission controls 5 million acres from Yreka to San Ysidro, but 
only Slab City has deteriorated into a squatters' camp and eyesore. "There is 
only one Slab City," said commission staffer Don Reese. 
</P>
<P>
 Its name comes from the concrete pads that were left when the Army tore down 
its barracks. Before it went to ruin, the area was used as a desert training 
ground for troops under Gen. George Patton. 
</P>
<P>
 As much as Imperial County would like to turn Slab City into something 
respectable (and profitable), the cash-poor county does not want to be stuck 
with the bill for cleaning it up. That's why tests were ordered for Salvation 
Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 30, the commission's senior staff, meeting in Sacramento, got the soil 
results and immediately agreed to spend up to $225,000 to clean up Salvation 
Mountain and the rest of Slab City. In exchange, the Imperial County Board of 
Supervisors must be willing to sign a long-term lease to manage Slab City. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleanup will not be easy: Slab City is littered with rusting automobile 
carcasses, mounds of trash, pools of motor oil and human waste, and other 
unsightly detritus. 
</P>
<P>
 When the lease is signed, the bulldozers and the cleanup crews can go to work. 
Reese said he hopes the task can be completed by the end of summer, before the 
next season of snowbirds starts arriving. 
</P>
<P>
 Salvation Mountain will be the toughest and most costly part of the cleanup. 
The mountain will have to bulldozed and the clay dirt treated chemically before 
being shipped to a toxic waste disposal site, in accordance with anti-pollution 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no problem with people expressing themselves, but this guy has got to 
stop," Luckey said. "Expressing yourself is great but not at the expense of the 
environment." 
</P>
<P>
 But the mood is definitely pro-Salvation Mountain at Gaston's Cafe, a 24-hour 
eatery just off California 111 that serves as the nerve center of tiny Niland 
and specializes in cheeseburgers, homemade pie and large helpings of local 
gossip. 
</P>
<P>
 "The general public likes to have (the mountain) there," said Harold Gaston, 
85, the cafe's pipe-smoking proprietor. "If they tear it up, there's liable to 
be repercussions all around the damned country." 
</P>
<P>
 In less troubled times, Knight is a serene presence around Niland (population 
1,023), painting his mountain, riding his bike to Gaston's, singing and playing 
his guitar, wishing well to all. These days, though, he is increasingly 
agitated. 
</P>
<P>
 The worry of it all left him unable to eat for awhile, he said. His rail-thin 
frame reached a new level of gauntness before the waitresses at Gaston's 
prevailed on him to break his fast. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he has written a country-Western-style song to calm his nerves and 
encapsulate his situation. 
</P>
<P>
 I contaminated California with a four-inch hand paintbrush  
</P>
<P>
 All I ever wanted to do was be an artist  
</P>
<P>
 Lord Jesus I gave them my very best  
</P>
<P>
 California is going to hang me tomorrow  
</P>
<P>
 And put my body to a rest.  
</P>
<P>
 Linda Barnett, 44, one of the few year-round residents of Slab City, is trying 
to rally support for Knight and his mountain. During the winter, when Slab City 
is at its most populous, she provides a nightly Slab City news broadcast over 
citizens' band radio from her tiny trailer. 
</P>
<P>
 With most of her listeners departed for cooler summer venues, Barnett is 
sending letters warning them that the mountain is imperiled and urging that 
pressure be brought to bear on local politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not right," she said. "It's just not right." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Luckey thinks it is not only right but long overdue. The days of no 
rules and no rent, he said, are over for Slab City. 
</P>
<P>
 If done right, Luckey said, Slab City, or whatever it is eventually named, 
could be a beautiful "primitive campground." Indeed, there will be little to 
disturb the tranquillity of campers save the aroma of the Salton Sea to the 
west and the muffled sounds of the Navy bombing range in the Chocolate 
Mountains to the east. 
</P>
<P>
 True to his religious principles, Knight says he is not mad at anyone. He 
loves even those who would remove Salvation Mountain, although he is mystified 
at the whole process. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe they're worried about this dried-up mountain," he said.

PANEL MAY HOLD KEY TO CONSENSUS ON IMMIGRATION; BORDER: FEDERAL COMMISSION IS 
EXPECTED TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON HOW POLICY IS FORMED DURING THE NEXT 
TWO YEARS. EX-REP. BARBARA JORDAN IS CHAIRWOMAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BORNEMEIER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As opposing camps in the national immigration debate exchange rhetorical 
grenades, a federal commission is quietly fashioning a set of recommendations 
that could provide the basis for bipartisan agreement on some of the issue's 
most contentious elements. 
</P>
<P>
 The report being compiled by the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform is 
expected to have a significant impact on how immigration policy is formed 
during the next two years, Administration sources said. The report is due in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 With a diverse cast of eight commissioners and former Texas Rep. Barbara C. 
Jordan as its forceful chairwoman, the commission is expected to chart 
politically defensible positions on such difficult issues as border control and 
public assistance benefits to immigrants -- both legal and illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent Senate testimony, Doris Meissner, commissioner of the Immigration 
and Naturalization Service, said Congress should wait to see the report before 
making legislative changes on its own. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's suggestions will also be required reading at the White House as 
the Clinton Administration ponders its next immigration initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have received every indication from anyone I've spoken with (in the White 
House) that our report will get serious and careful attention," said Jordan, 
whose probity and mellifluous speaking voice brought her fame during the 
Watergate era. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Rasco, Clinton's domestic policy adviser, said that White House staffers 
have maintained close contact with Jordan, attended many of the commission's 
hearings and are familiar with how the panel is leaning on particular issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "We consider it an important process," Rasco said. "(The report) certainly has 
the potential to serve as a basis" for White House initiatives on immigration, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House has its own interagency group looking at many of the same 
issues, but Susan Martin, the commission's executive director, said that the 
two reports would probably be in harmony. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan has said she hopes that the commission's recommendations will help 
dissipate some of the nastiness that now suffuses the debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Some politicians, such as Gov. Pete Wilson, have seized on the anger and 
resentment many Californians feel toward illegal immigrants. The Republican 
governor, who is running for reelection, has proposed a constitutional 
amendment to deny automatic citizenship to the children of illegal immigrants. 
He also has sued the federal government to recover the money California spends 
on health care and the incarceration of illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Among commission members, immigration is seen as having more of a positive 
impact than negative," Jordan said. "I believe quite firmly that the negatives 
are overblown and without basis in fact. I am fairly certain that the 
commission is not going to come out with a report that feeds into the 
emotionalism over the issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan said Wilson's aggressive stand is "wrong-headed . . . and (it is) not 
helpful to use immigration as a scapegoat for a myriad of issues." 
</P>
<P>
 But on key points, Jordan and Wilson appear to be in accord. "Illegal 
immigrants are not entitled to benefits," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan also shares Wilson's view that much of California's immigration woe is 
caused by inadequate enforcement of federal laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the federal government's responsibility to enforce the border . . . and 
it is wrong in issuing mandates for state and local governments that the 
federal government refuses to fund," Jordan said. "That creates the animus and 
spawns the lawsuits." 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan knows that in order to be effective, the commission can't dodge taking 
a stand on controversial issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not know that we will reach majority agreement on every issue . . . but 
I've become much more optimistic that we could forge a consensus around some of 
the difficult issues. (It would be) foolish to sacrifice our credibility by 
filing dissents. It would be better to be silent on an issue," said Jordan, who 
was appointed chairwoman by President Clinton in December. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission was established by Congress as part of the 1990 Immigration Act 
to examine the effects of national immigration policies. During the past year 
it has held hearings around the country and visited Los Angeles in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Two reports will be issued -- an interim report in September and a final 
report in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission's final report will focus on more global themes -- effects on 
economic systems, international trade policy and population issues -- Martin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission members -- four Republican and four Democrat appointees -- hold 
differing points of view on many immigration issues. But a source with 
knowledge of the commission's internal debates said that Jordan has been 
remarkably successful in forging consensus on a number of tricky issues by 
cutting through statistical disputes and focusing on the core issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence H. Fuchs, one of the commission's two vice chairmen, was executive 
director of the last federal panel to tackle immigration. That commission, 
chaired by the Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, submitted its report to Congress in 
1981 and provided the intellectual underpinning for major immigration 
legislation in 1986 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic appointees are Fuchs, a professor at Brandeis University; 
Warren R. Leiden, executive director of the American Immigration Lawyers Assn.; 
Nelson Merced, a former Massachusetts state legislator, and Bruce Morrison, a 
former congressman who played a key role in the passage of the 1990 immigration 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael S. Teitelbaum, a demographer, is the other vice chairman. He is joined 
by Republican appointees Richard Estrada, an editorial writer for the Dallas 
Morning News; Harold Ezell, the former western regional commissioner of the INS 
under Ronald Reagan, and Robert Charles Hill, a lawyer and Reagan-era Justice 
Department official. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan is scheduled to testify before Sen. Edward M. Kennedy's immigration 
subcommittee later this month to brief lawmakers on the commission's progress.

ANTI-CORRUPTION CRUSADER WINS BELARUS VOTE; RUNOFF: ALEXANDER LUKASHENKO IS 
ELECTED IN A LANDSLIDE. HE WILL BE THE FORMER SOVIET REPUBLIC'S FIRST 
PRESIDENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A fiery anti-corruption crusader scored a landslide victory as Belarussian 
voters turned out in force Sunday to elect the former Soviet republic's first 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander Lukashenko -- dubbed the "Belarussian Zhirinovsky" by critics who 
compare his populist tactics and outspokenness to those of Russian right-winger 
Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky -- received 80% of the vote against Prime Minister 
Vyacheslav Kebich, according to Reuters news service. 
</P>
<P>
 Lukashenko had outpolled Kebich by a nearly 3-1 margin in first-round 
balloting June 23, and another high turnout Sunday, similar to the 73% of 
voters who cast ballots last month, had fueled widespread expectations that the 
39-year-old Lukashenko would win by a large margin. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 64% of Belarus' 7.4 million eligible voters turned out, the Central 
Election Commission said an hour before the polls closed Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 No formal polls on the candidates' popularity were conducted during the brief 
runoff campaign. But an opinion survey conducted on the eve of the vote showed 
Belarussians overwhelmingly in favor of change for their conservative nation of 
over 10.3 million, which has been plagued by a worsening economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Lukashenko had captured 45% of the vote in the first round, far outdistancing 
runner-up Kebich, who got 17%. None of the six candidates last month succeeded 
in winning the 50% majority necessary for a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 During the campaign, Lukashenko vowed to tax the rich, exert strong control 
over the economy and defeat corruption, "which like an all-devouring octopus 
has ensnared all government organs with its tentacles." 
</P>
<P>
 The 58-year-old Kebich, like Lukashenko, favored closer ties with Russia as a 
way to rescue the crippled economy. But he was hampered by a bland campaign 
style and partial culpability for the current economic malaise. He has been 
prime minister since 1990.

ECONOMY IS AT HEART OF UKRAINE VOTE; ELECTION: THE CHOICE AT THE POLLS SEEMS TO 
BE EITHER INDEPENDENCE AT THE RISK OF FINANCIAL RUIN, OR A MOVE TOWARD 
RUSSIANIZATION. RETURNS ARE EXPECTED TODAY.

 Volodymyr Volkov counts his wife's monthly wage in bags of mushrooms. "She 
earns three of these," he said, pointing to the two-pound bags of creamy white 
champignons he was selling Sunday at Kiev's Bessarabian Market. 
</P>
<P>
 Volkov's wife, a government office worker, isn't the only one who couldn't 
afford them. "If you're living on your salary, don't bother," he told a matron 
who groused at the price of a bag, equal to about $4. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it took just 10 minutes for Volkov to sell four bags of mushrooms. "I 
earn a good living doing this," said the economist-turned-food peddler from 
Fastov, a town about 40 miles southwest of here. 
</P>
<P>
 As Ukrainians voted for a president Sunday, they also scrambled to make a 
living in the ruins of economic collapse. Activity at outdoor markets, where 
many salaried Ukrainians moonlight as unlicensed merchants, was as brisk as it 
was at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 The bustle of Ukraine's informal economy is one reason why this former Soviet 
republic has peaceful politics and President Leonid Kravchuk is still in the 
race. Opinion polls showed the runoff between Kravchuk and former Prime 
Minister Leonid Kuchma too close to call. 
</P>
<P>
 On paper, slow-reforming Ukraine is the basket case of Europe. Consumer 
output, as measured by official statistics, is down 40% over the past year. 
National income has dropped by 36%, construction by 40% and exports by 30% 
since mid-1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a market economy had those kinds of statistics, people would be 
revolting," said Ian Brzezinski, a U.S. political analyst who advises the 
Ukrainian Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 But after 2 1/2 years of independence, Ukraine still doesn't have a free 
market; instead of a revolt, Ukrainians are choosing between their current 
leader, who engineered the break with Moscow, and a challenger who advocates 
closer ties with wealthier Russia to jump-start the economy. Early returns were 
not expected until today. 
</P>
<P>
 The election has polarized Ukraine between the independence-minded western 
provinces, which heavily backed Kravchuk in first-round voting two weeks ago, 
and the Russianized east, which favored Kuchma. Kravchuk, who had trailed in 
most pre-election polls, won 38% of the overall vote to Kuchma's 32% in a field 
of seven. 
</P>
<P>
 Many political analysts viewed Kravchuk's first-round lead as a measure of how 
many Ukrainians are willing to suffer materially for the sake of statehood. But 
it was also a sign that Ukrainians may not be doing as badly as first believed. 
</P>
<P>
 Volkov, the mushroom peddler, summed up the view of many voters willing to 
settle for four more years under a president who spouts the rhetoric of 
economic reform but maintains an ideology of cautious inaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I voted for Kravchuk," he said. "He won't take us forward, and he won't take 
us backward, and most of all, he won't interfere with my life." 
</P>
<P>
 During the campaign, Kuchma tried to capitalize on the comparisons many 
Ukrainians make with their relatives in Russia, where the average wage is at 
least four times higher than the average here. 
</P>
<P>
 Alla Tovstoles' family hasn't had fresh meat since Easter, even though she 
spends her husband's $35 monthly paycheck almost entirely on food. 
</P>
<P>
 But statistics ignore the signs of wealth everywhere. Mercedes-Benzes and BMWs 
jam city streets from Lvov to Donetsk. Teen-agers pay for taxi rides with 
dollars. Mini-mansions costing $250,000 each are sprouting up in the suburbs. 
College professors earning tiny salaries watch World Cup soccer matches on new 
Sony televisions in their living rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Tovstoles has earned $300 since spring breeding Persian cats to supplement her 
husband's paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I sell a kitten, the children will get new clothes," she said, waiting in 
a Kiev park for anyone willing to pay $100 for the tawny ball of fur sleeping 
in her lap. 
</P>
<P>
 Official statisticians focus only on the formal economy, in which producers 
and merchants apply for permits and pay taxes, and where 90% of everything is 
formally owned by the state. Until recently, it was also state-controlled. 
</P>
<P>
 Not anymore. According to World Bank economist Daniel Kaufmann, the more the 
government has tried to command the economy with Soviet-style diktats , the 
more it has squeezed state factory and farm managers until they wriggle free of 
its grasp. 
</P>
<P>
 Today the burgeoning informal economy is believed to make up about half of all 
wages, 40% of housing construction, 20% of food and 75% of the retail clothing 
trade -- all beyond the reach of statisticians and tax collectors. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is most startling about Ukraine's underground economy is how fast it has 
grown in contrast with the dwindling official economy," Kaufmann said. 
</P>
<P>
 On a grand scale, where state enterprises export "shadow production" and stash 
millions of dollars in earnings in offshore banks, people use the word mafia to 
describe the underground economy and its entrepreneurs. On a small scale -- 
where Tovstoles sells kittens next to women in babushkas hawking parsnips, and 
none of them reports income -- it's called survival, and it is the cushion 
keeping Ukraine's economy afloat. 
</P>
<P>
 Shadow profits have their price. Traders pay bribes for permits instead of 
applying for them. They pay protection money to racketeers instead of taxes, 
breeding corruption, criminality and government budget deficits. There are 
costs for the economy as a whole when assets, labor and brainpower drain into 
short-term, quick-buck schemes instead of investment. 
</P>
<P>
 "No economy can thrive in the underground for very long," said Kaufmann, who 
believes the growing imbalance will eventually force either man elected Sunday 
to free the formal economy from the state's remaining tethers.

WASHINGTON OUTLOOK: IS THE GOP TOO TIMID TO SAY NO TO THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT?; A 
PARTY CAN ONLY ARTICULATE THE NATIONAL INTEREST WHEN IT IS WILLING TO TEMPER 
THE DEMANDS OF ITS SUPPORTERS. 
</P>

<P>
 Scam may be too strong a word, but there's an undeniable element of mutual 
self-interest in the recent skirmishes between Republicans and Democrats over 
the political role of religious conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides are primarily aiming their invective at their own partisans. 
Democrats are trying to invigorate their activist liberal base by raising the 
specter of a "radical" fringe using "subterranean tactics" to engineer a 
"stealth takeover" of the GOP, as Rep. Vic Fazio (D-West Sacramento) 
breathlessly declared in a recent speech. Republicans are trying to stoke their 
activist Christian base by accusing the Democrats of a jihad against all 
Americans of faith. 
</P>
<P>
 This hothouse holy war is less a genuine debate than a conspiracy to rouse the 
faithful. That's too bad, because there is a legitimate issue in the growing 
prominence of religious conservatives -- not whether Christians are "taking 
over" the Republican Party, but how the GOP deals with the kind of insistent 
interest-group demands that have long bedeviled Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Fazio and other leading Democrats are trying to portray religious 
conservatives as God's fifth column -- an insidious force out to subvert not 
only the GOP but the separation of church and state itself. 
</P>
<P>
 But conservative Christians are not a new, singularly threatening movement 
that needs to be uniquely segregated from American politics. To the contrary: 
They are a force entirely familiar in American politics -- an interest group 
systematically organizing to expand its influence within one of the national 
political parties. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, together with the anti-abortion movement, religious conservatives are 
rapidly becoming the most powerful interest group in the GOP -- the equivalent 
of organized labor within the Democratic Party. Republican pollster Bill 
McInturff says about one in five GOP primary voters nationwide -- and one in 
three in the South -- are religious conservatives. Those figures are comparable 
to the numbers that unions can marshal in key Democratic primaries. 
</P>
<P>
 That parallel points to the real issue raised by the ascent of the religious 
right: Are Republicans willing to stand up for the national interest when it 
conflicts with the narrow agenda of their own party's most powerful special 
interest? 
</P>
<P>
 For a political party, that's a dangerous test to fail -- as Democrats well 
understand. For years, Republicans battered Democrats by arguing they lacked 
the will to say no to powerful constituencies like organized labor and civil 
rights groups when their demands didn't serve the nation as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 But Democrats began to stiffen their backbone after the disastrous 1984 
presidential campaign, when Walter F. Mondale lost 49 states. In retrospect, 
the turning point came in an early primary debate when Gary Hart asked Mondale 
to name a single issue on which he disagreed with organized labor. Mondale 
refused -- and indelibly stamped himself the candidate of "special interests." 
</P>
<P>
 That was a defining moment, not only for Mondale but also for the party, which 
increasingly took Hart's message to heart. Although President Clinton has 
excessively deferred to liberal interest groups on some issues -- such as the 
racial justice measure now senselessly stalling the crime bill -- he has stared 
down civil rights groups to withdraw the nomination of C. Lani Guinier; defied 
feminist groups with his welfare plan, and, most dramatically, gone to the mat 
against organized labor to pass the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Where are the comparable examples today of prominent conservatives standing up 
to the demands of the religious right? 
</P>
<P>
 When former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp was asked an 
updated version of the Hart question recently on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press," he 
hemmed, hawed, filibustered -- and couldn't produce a single instance in which 
he disagreed with broadcaster Pat Robertson and his Christian Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) promises to face down Clinton on 
health care, but he's shown less resolve in bucking Robertson. The day after 
Virginia Republicans nominated Oliver L. North for the U.S. Senate last month, 
Dole signaled his reluctance to embrace a man who has admitted misleading 
Congress during the Iran-Contra affair, and hinted he might endorse independent 
J. Marshall Coleman. Dole quickly heard objections from a number of voices, but 
perhaps most powerfully from Robertson -- who informed him that support for 
North would be "symbolically important from a 1996 point of view" to Christian 
conservatives, according to one source familiar with the events. 
</P>
<P>
 Within days, Dole had endorsed North. 
</P>
<P>
 Most revealing has been the Republican silence on the Rev. Jerry Falwell's 
distribution of a videotape in which, among other things, Clinton is accused of 
complicity in murder. Paul Begala, a top Clinton political adviser, says that 
just as Democrats are pressured to denounce black nationalist Louis Farrakhan's 
anti-Semitic creeds, Republicans should now be required "to either embrace or 
denounce Jerry Falwell's accusation of murder against the President." 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly any Republicans have stepped up to that bar. Former Education Secretary 
William J. Bennett has condemned Falwell, and Kemp coughed up a milder 
objection when repeatedly squeezed in a television interview. 
</P>
<P>
 But most other leading Republicans have ducked the issue. Asked recently about 
Falwell's video, Dole, House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) and likely 
1996 presidential candidate Dick Cheney all said through spokesmen that they 
hadn't personally seen the tape and couldn't comment on it -- even though the 
video's contents have been widely reported. When convenient, these same 
Republicans have been less scrupulous in their standards of evidence: They have 
not hesitated to rely on newspaper accounts to condemn the attacks on religious 
conservatives from Fazio, Democratic National Committee Chairman David Wilhelm 
and Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a measure of the GOP's timidity that even some prominent religious 
conservatives consider it morally untenable to denounce the Democrats while 
absolving Falwell. Richard Cizik, a policy analyst for the National Assn. of 
Evangelicals, says the President should disavow the sweeping accusations 
against evangelical Christians from Fazio and Elders. But he has no objection 
to Clinton's recent outburst against Falwell. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he (Clinton) needs to draw distinctions, and because I've asked him 
to do so, it's incumbent on me to do the same," said Cizik, a Presbyterian 
minister. "I don't think Falwell should do it. It's not becoming of him as a 
minister, and I say that as a minister." 
</P>
<P>
 The reason Republicans should draw such distinctions is not because religious 
conservatives have any less inherent right to press their agenda than any other 
group. It is because Hart was right: A party can only articulate the national 
interest when it is willing to temper the demands of its supporters, not just 
the groups allied with its rival. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republicans are facing that test now on Falwell. They will confront it 
again as the GOP begins its 1996 debates on issues such as equal rights for 
homosexuals, and whether to rewrite the party platform on abortion to reflect 
the conflicting views of the overall GOP electorate more closely than the rigid 
anti-abortion plank now in place. 
</P>
<P>
 "The principle is the same," Hart said in an interview. "The first test of 
leadership is whether you are able to take on elements of your own party who 
are not operating in the best interest of the party and the country. Those who 
try to skirt around it sacrifice their credibility as leaders." Where the 
Born-Again Vote Has Gone 
</P>
<P>
 Estimates of the number of Americans who consider themselves evangelical, or 
born-again, Christians vary from about 12% to 25% of the total population, 
depending on the definition. Exit polls from the past four presidential 
elections show that white born-again Christians have become a critical element 
of the Republican political coalition: 
</P>
<P>
 1992: George Bush (R): 55% Bill Clinton (D): 26% Ross Perot (I): 19% 
</P>
<P>
 1988: George Bush (R): 71% Michael Dukakis (D): 27% 
</P>
<P>
 1984: Ronald Reagan (R): 78% Walter Mondale (D): 22%

THE NAPLES SUMMIT; NEWS ANALYSIS; G-7 IMPACT HARD TO SEE BUT STILL KEY; SUMMIT: 
FOCUSING ON TOUGH ISSUES OVER SEVERAL DAYS OFTEN RESULTS IN BREAKTHROUGHS, 
LEADERS AND AIDES SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 They have been an annual fixture on the diplomatic calendar now for two 
decades, but for most people the Group of Seven summit conferences remain a 
little-understood blur -- a yearly photo op of the world's most powerful 
leaders, followed by turgid communiques of questionable impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite this image and the enormous global change that has occurred since the 
leaders of the world's seven richest industrial democracies first convened in 
the French chateau town of Rambouillet in the fall of 1975, however, the G-7 
summit tradition endures. 
</P>
<P>
 It does so for two main reasons: It works, and the institution has been 
flexible enough to adapt to the changes that have swept the global landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly how it works is often not easy to see, but those involved in the 
meetings, whether the leaders themselves or their aides, claim that 
breakthroughs on tough issues often come simply because they are forced to 
focus on key problems as a group over a period that usually spans three days. 
</P>
<P>
 "The value of a summit like this is that discussions can be pursued over 2 1/2 
days," German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said. "Without the meeting last year in 
Tokyo, I'm sure we would not have had a (global trade) agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 That accord, which sweeps away a vast array of international trade barriers, 
is expected to add hundreds of billions of dollars to global wealth before the 
end of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 British Prime Minister John Major noted that the summits offer leaders the 
chance to discuss longer-range issues that invariably are pushed aside by 
pressing problems during bilateral meetings -- issues such as how to achieve 
ecologically sustainable economic growth or adjust to the challenges raised by 
the explosion of new technology. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's summit was viewed as especially productive. Among its 
accomplishments, the meeting: 
</P>
<P>
 * Provided the most visible evidence so far of Russia's gradual integration 
into the community of free, industrialized nations as President Boris N. 
Yeltsin was warmly welcomed to the political discussions that took up much of 
the summit's final day. While Yeltsin did not join Saturday's session on 
economic issues, his presence Sunday effectively turned the G-7 into a G-8 for 
the first time in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 * Allowed the leaders of the only nations with any chance to influence events 
in the Balkans -- the United States, Russia, Britain and France -- to 
coordinate a joint warning to all parties involved in the war in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina to accept a recently presented peace plan that many view as 
the last alternative to greater chaos. 
</P>
<P>
 * Enabled the summit participants to consult directly on developments on the 
Korean peninsula following the death of North Korean leader Kim Il Sung. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gave the leaders the necessary forum to confront diverse issues from making 
safe the highly dangerous set of nuclear reactors still operating in Ukraine's 
Chernobyl complex to international crime and money-laundering. Such discussions 
frequently provide pressure to begin work on solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 But such achievements touch little on the economic debates that are supposed 
to be at the heart of the summits -- and go little beyond the level of 
discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 The brainchild of then-French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing and former 
German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, the summits were conceived as an alternative 
to brief bilateral meetings, where leaders are usually steered through a 
choreographed formal program. 
</P>
<P>
 The meetings, it was believed, would be a chance for leaders to gather for 
more than a day and toss around ideas informally. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea worked, with U.S. President Gerald Ford, at the initial summit, 
forging a previously elusive agreement with European leaders on measures to 
stabilize the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 But G-7 summits certainly have their shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, the summits have grown more elaborate. Larger delegations have 
accompanied their leaders, position papers have appeared and a growing news 
media army has given the summits the trappings of a circus. 
</P>
<P>
 By mutual agreement, this year the leaders edged back toward more informal 
discussions and pledged to go further in this direction when they meet next 
year in Halifax, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants have also found many problems beyond their grasp. 
</P>
<P>
 Can they affect currency-exchange problems? Perhaps, but a senior Clinton 
Administration official said traders themselves exert the greatest influence. 
</P>
<P>
 Can they affect broader economic questions? Perhaps, but a growing number of 
industrial powerhouses are missing, such as Brazil, Indonesia and China. 
</P>
<P>
 And as the leaders ended their meetings, this question remained: Had they done 
any more to make the global economic picture secure? 
</P>
<P>
 In the short run, the answer is no: Nothing was done to ease some of the 
United States' most difficult economic problems. 
</P>
<P>
 In the longer run, the answer is less certain, but perhaps not as negative: 
While no concrete steps were taken, the leaders at least moved into the 
politically sensitive area of the price that Europe's expensive social welfare 
programs exact in job creation. 
</P>
<P>
 While summits provide the kind of visibility that leaders love to turn into 
political capital back home, they can also backfire. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton came to Naples juggling three key economic issues: the 
shrinking value of the dollar, the questions tied to the United States' huge 
trade deficit with Japan and a proposal to push ahead with trade liberalization 
even before the latest global trade agreement has been ratified. 
</P>
<P>
 On each, he came away empty-handed. 
</P>
<P>
 While officials said the weekend was no time to expect significant progress on 
such intractable problems as the dollar and Japanese trade disputes, had the 
leaders been able to achieve real advances, they would have been happy to 
trumpet them. 
</P>
<P>
 When they left Washington, Administration officials at every opportunity 
pointed to the strength of the U.S. position: an economy that is leading the 
rest of the summit nations out of recession, steady growth in employment, 
interest rates climbing up only marginally and no solid signs of a return of 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Such sound economic fundamentals, they suggested, would enhance Clinton's 
position of leadership among officials struggling with slower, less certain 
economic growth and uncertainties about their political futures. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was no sign that the President translated the sunnier U.S. economic 
picture into leadership in Naples. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, his trade proposal -- and the way he presented it, without paving the 
way to avoid embarrassment -- was so quickly and roundly derided that he was 
forced to hastily withdraw it.

<P>
 When they weren't scripting the fate of the Earth on Sunday, the world's top 
leaders had a freewheeling discussion of the Louisiana Purchase and proposed 
that the World Cup winner fork over an extra billion dollars in international 
aid. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton reminded French President Francois Mitterrand that it was 
Napoleon who sold Louisiana to America -- and that Thomas Jefferson was 
criticized for spending twice the U.S. annual budget to buy it. 
</P>
<P>
 German Chancellor Helmut Kohl warned Clinton that soon Russian President Boris 
N. Yeltsin would start demanding more money for czarist Russia's sale of Alaska 
to America. 
</P>
<P>
 And Clinton confessed a secret ambition to race across Alaska in the Iditarod 
dog-sledding endurance test. 
</P>
<P>
 "See, Boris and I, we have enough body fat, we can survive even if we can't 
quite make it," Clinton said. "I've always wanted to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy to watch other people do that," British Prime Minister John Major 
replied. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While the leaders were holed up in the magnificent 17th-Century Palazzo Reale, 
munching on veal with beef tenderloin, sipping champagne along with strawberry 
ice cream and deciding how to manage the planet's trouble spots, an anti-summit 
was taking place just a few blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
 The Other Economic Summit -- better known as TOES -- aims to put the 
environment and the fate of the Earth's 1 billion poor on the agenda of the 
leaders of the Group of Seven richest industrial nations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Naples summit has been an insult to the majority of the world's people," 
TOES said in a communique from its dusty storefront a few blocks from the 
official G-7 press center. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, TOES brought to Naples leaders from seven of the poorest and most 
disenfranchised groups in the world, including peasants from Mexico's Chiapas 
state, Colombia and Brazil, victims of the chemical disaster in Bhopal, India, 
and Native American Apaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "Keep your wealth. Enjoy your consumer civilization," they wrote in a letter 
that Naples Mayor Antonio Bassolino promised to hand over to the summit 
participants. "Withdraw completely your interests, companies, investments, 
tourist resorts and good humanitarian intentions from our countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Leave us to confront ourselves and live according to our own cultural 
values." 
</P>
<P>
 The seven elite nations have improved their rhetoric since TOES began 
conducting parallel international summits alongside the G-7 in 1984, TOES said, 
but they have not made good on the Earth-friendly, anti-poverty promises 
included in their long and platitudinous communiques. 
</P>
<P>
 "The longer they get, the emptier they are," TOES activist Jakob von Uexkull 
said with a sigh. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are alternatives to increasing unemployment in the north, 'shock 
therapy' in Eastern Europe and poverty in the south," TOES holds. "Fiscal 
reform and investment in renewable energies, energy conservation, recycling, 
waste reduction and public transport . . . will create many more jobs than 
ineffectual G-7 recipes." 
</P>
<P>
 The G-7 is a closed elite whose past decisions have failed to improve the 
world's situation, Uexkull said, because its members are slaves to a "market 
fundamentalism," the ideology that free markets and more growth will solve all 
the Earth's problems. 
</P>
<P>
 This absolute faith is "as fundamentalist in its way as communist ideology," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, we had governments who were afraid of the trade unions -- who, after 
all, represented millions of workers," Uexkull said. "Now we have governments 
which are afraid of the bond traders and (currency) speculators." 
</P>
<P>
 TOES also has a radical idea for solving the debt crisis of developing 
nations: Forgive all debts to nations whose loans were taken out by dictators. 
And lift worldwide bank secrecy laws so creditors can go after corrupt despots' 
Swiss bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Predictably, the star attraction in Naples was not the G-7 but soccer's World 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 The Italy-Spain quarterfinal match all but shut down the summit Saturday 
afternoon, with Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi rushing out of his own 
news conference to watch the game. 
</P>
<P>
 In a European press center, a pack of journalists sat glued to the World Cup 
game. On a TV monitor behind them, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
spoke into empty air. 
</P>
<P>
 Il Mattino newspaper gave Italy's victory better display than the summit in 
Sunday's editions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With the business part of his own visit to Italy concluded, U.S. Treasury 
Secretary Lloyd Bentsen sent his staff home late Sunday night and took his 
wife, Beryl Ann, on a nostalgic visit to the town of Taranto in Italy's heel. 
</P>
<P>
 It was from Taranto that Bentsen flew B-24 bombers on World War II raids over 
Romania and Yugoslavia, and he had not been back in half a century. 
</P>
<P>
 Memories brought back by the D-Day 50th anniversary ceremonies a month ago 
prompted the Treasury secretary to arrange the trip to Taranto, three hours 
from Naples by car. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen told the Italians he wanted to keep the visit low-key and nixed 
suggestions that he fly over the now-Italian air base in a fighter jet -- for 
old times' sake.

 More than 9,000 sparrows migrating from Europe and Africa have been found dead 
along Brazil's northern coastline, a Brazilian newspaper reported Sunday. 
Remains of plastic were found in the birds' stomachs, leading scientists to 
conclude that ocean pollution was a main cause of the sparrows' death, the 
newspaper said.

 Israel will close the Gaza Strip for 24 hours on Monday, preventing thousands 
of Palestinian workers from entering Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure begins at dawn. The army said the closure was in response to 
"serious disturbances" by several thousand Palestinians throwing stones and 
other objects at Israeli soldiers at a border crossing Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Three Israeli soldiers were injured and electricity lines were damaged in the 
melee.

NEPAL'S LEADER RESIGNS AFTER POLITICAL DEFEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala, Nepal's first democratically elected 
leader in three decades, resigned Sunday after losing a vote in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 His resignation set the stage for new parliamentary elections that will test 
the 3-year-old democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 The political crisis was rooted in factional fighting within the governing 
Nepali Congress Party, but it also reflected frustration with Koirala's failure 
to make headway against Nepal's poverty, illiteracy and underdevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
 Koirala, 70, submitted his resignation to King Birendra after members of his 
party helped vote down the government's annual policy statement. The prime 
minister recommended that Parliament be dissolved and elections held Nov. 13. A 
general election had not been due until 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no immediate statement from the palace. 
</P>
<P>
 Koirala came to power in 1991 in this Himalayan kingdom's first multi-party 
elections in 30 years after street demonstrations forced Birendra to become a 
constitutional monarch. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he took some measures to modernize and liberalize the economy, Nepal 
remains one of the world's poorest countries, with a per capita income of $180 
and an infant mortality rate of nearly one in 10. Nearly three people in four 
cannot read or write. 
</P>
<P>
 The opposition Communists accuse Koirala's government of complicity in the 
deaths of two of its most charismatic leaders in a car accident in May, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The motion Sunday lost 86 to 74 in the 205-seat lower house when 36 Nepali 
Congress Party members abstained.

 Five helicopters roared over this resort town Sunday and a 30-foot cross was 
lighted on a mountain in honor of 14 firefighters killed battling a 
wind-whipped blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 About 400 firefighters and 3,000 others turned out for a tribute to the 10 men 
and four women killed Wednesday on the steep slopes of nearby Storm King 
Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Please forgive this mountain, she couldn't control what happened up there," 
Rep. Scott McInnis (R-Colo.) told the crowd gathered at Two Rivers Park, at the 
confluence of the Colorado and Roaring Fork rivers. 
</P>
<P>
 The helicopters flew in "missing man" formation, with four together and one 
behind. The electric cross on Red Mountain will be lighted 14 days, one for 
each victim. 
</P>
<P>
 "These 14 are now part of Glenwood Springs," said Bob Zanella, mayor of the 
town of about 6,000. "They are ours. They will be remembered." 
</P>
<P>
 The fire, which burned 1,856 acres, was contained by Saturday night. An Army 
helicopter assisted in putting out the remaining small, isolated blazes on 
Sunday.

 Thousands of people gathered Sunday to mourn the 14 firefighters killed by a 
wildfire that was gradually being brought under control despite continued hot, 
windy weather. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire on Storm King Mountain was fully contained by fire lines and was 
expected to be brought under control by this evening, said Tony Svatos of the 
U.S. Forest Service. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials also warned of possibly dangerous weather conditions, with high 
winds, temperatures in the 90s and electrical storms. 
</P>
<P>
 About 650 people were still battling the fire Sunday, including crews of seven 
helicopters dropping water onto hot spots. 
</P>
<P>
 State police expected up to 5,000 people at the memorial service in a local 
park, said the Rev. Roy Altman, who organized the tribute to the 10 men and 
four women who died in the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Forest Service workers shrouded their badges in black cloth, and purple 
ribbons of remembrance hung everywhere in this town of 6,000 people.

FLOODWATER SWAMPS ANOTHER TOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brown waters swamped upscale riverside homes Sunday as this southwest Georgia 
city got slapped by the first wave of flooding that has swept much of the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 The death toll statewide rose to 28 since Tuesday, the day after Tropical 
Storm Alberto brought heavy downpours. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest bodies, discovered Sunday, were of a man who drowned when his 
tractor-trailer washed off a road and a 3-year-old whose mother's car was swept 
into a creek. The mother's body was found Saturday. The bodies were found in 
Americus, about 95 miles north of Bainbridge. 
</P>
<P>
 The Flint River was more than seven feet above flood stage at Bainbridge and 
was expected to crest Wednesday at 45 feet, which is 20 feet above flood stage. 
That is nearly five feet higher than the record set in a 1925 flood. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 2,000 people in West Bainbridge were told to evacuate by Saturday 
evening, and most others in the city of 10,000 were gone or packing up Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "My granddaddy used to tell me about the flood of '25, when you could go 
anywhere by boat. Well, this looks like it could be worse than that," said Mack 
Brock, a home builder who had a pole tracking the flood's rise up the back deck 
of his home. 
</P>
<P>
 The Flint remained at 42 feet, 22 feet above flood stage, on Sunday in Albany, 
about 50 miles north of Bainbridge. A crest of 45 to 46 feet was expected 
Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton on Sunday declared four Florida counties major disaster 
areas. The designation means the counties are eligible for federal assistance. 
Clinton made similar designations last week for several Georgia and Alabama 
counties.

16% OF URBAN MURDERS ARE FAMILY AFFAIRS, STUDY FINDS; CRIME: OF THOSE BIG-CITY 
HOMICIDES, IT'S MOSTLY HUSBANDS KILLING WIVES. NEXT ON THE STATISTICAL 
FREQUENCY LIST ARE PARENTS WHO KILL CHILDREN. 
</P>

<P>
 Murders within a family account for 16% of all big-city homicides, with wives 
the most frequent victims, according to a Justice Department study released 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the assailants in family murders have been males, but the study -- the 
first to focus on family relationships in murders -- found contrasting 
statistics in all-white and all-black marriages. 
</P>
<P>
 Among white victims murdered by their spouse, 62% were wives and 38% were 
husbands. Among black marital partners, 53% were wives and 47% were husbands, 
meaning black wives killed their husband at nearly the same rate as husbands 
killed their wife. 
</P>
<P>
 For other racial groups, samplings were too small to reach conclusions, 
according to the study. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents killing their children was the second most frequent type of family 
murder, accounting for 21% of all homicides within a family. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Langan, one of the study's researchers, said black husbands and wives 
killing each other at virtually the same rate was one of several unexpected 
findings. Langan said he also did not expect to discover that parents killed 
their children as often as they do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have thought that such a bizarre event would have been the least 
frequent type of murder," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, which did not assess reasons for any trend, was compiled by the 
Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics from an unprecedented 
examination of more than 8,000 homicides in 75 large urban counties. The cases 
were taken from 1988, the most recent year for which dispositions were 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence A. Greenfeld, who directed the study, said alcohol was a significant 
factor in many of the homicides. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sixty-eight percent of non-family defendants and 48% of family murder 
defendants were drinking at about the time of the murder," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among victims, about half of the non-family murder victims and a third of all 
family members who were murdered had consumed alcohol before the crime, the 
study found. 
</P>
<P>
 "Victims in spouse murders were the most likely to have been drinking -- 
nearly 50%," Greenfeld said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities called the alcohol factor significant, even for the victims of 
homicide, because one-fifth of all cases studied showed the assailant had been 
provoked by the victim, either by a violent argument or by the brandishing of a 
weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 John Stern, deputy director of the National Organization for Victim 
Assistance, a nonprofit group, said the figures were shocking because "homicide 
is a preventable crime, especially among people who know each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Spousal homicide statistics would be even more dramatic "if we included former 
spouses who have killed one another in the years after their divorce," he said. 
A breakdown of such statistics was not available. 
</P>
<P>
 Stern recommended that high schools place more emphasis on teaching nonviolent 
conflict resolution, a subject he said is becoming popular even among prison 
inmates who are signing up in large numbers for the training. 
</P>
<P>
 "These courses are teaching tough young teen-agers about their capacity for 
empathy," he said. "We can reduce a lot of violence between people who know 
each other, not just between husbands and wives." 
</P>
<P>
 Excluding family members, nearly two-thirds of the remaining homicides were 
committed by friends or acquaintances of the victim, the Justice Department 
study showed. About 20% of the murders involved victims being killed by 
strangers. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the notoriety of a case like the Menendez brothers in Los Angeles, who 
have been accused of murdering their parents, the report says children are 
killed by their parents at twice the rate that offspring kill their parents. 
But sons more often than daughters were defendants when their parents were 
murdered -- 82% versus 18% for daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the murder of children was the only homicide category in 
which females predominated as killers, the study showed. In offspring murders, 
mothers accounted for 55% of all defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 Five Southern California counties -- Los Angeles, Orange, Kern, San Diego and 
Riverside -- were included in the department's study, but no county-by-county 
breakdown was made, officials said.

COSMIC RAIN; JUPITER ENCOUNTERS A STRING OF COMETS

 The planets of the solar system do not move through a void. We are surrounded 
by objects large and small -- comets, asteroids and the debris from their 
ancient collisions. For the first time, scientists in July will be able to find 
out firsthand what happens when a comet slams into a planet. For five days 
starting July 16, an unusual stream of 21 comet fragments -- each the size of a 
mountain -- will slam into Jupiter, offering a unique opportunity to study the 
kinds of cataclysmic impacts that have scarred the planets and helped shape 
life on Earth. THE COLLISION 
</P>
<P>
 Using supercomputers, scientists have developed several scenarios for what 
might happen when the Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 hits Jupiter: 
</P>
<P>
 Meteor Shower: If the comet continues to fragment as it plows deeper into 
Jupiter's gravitational field, it could break into a "flying sand bank" and 
shower Jupiter's upper atmosphere with thousands of tiny meteors. 
</P>
<P>
 Shock Wave: In its plunge toward Jupiter, the comet could generate a shock 
wave powerful enough to keep the fragments together some distance into the 
planet's dense atmosphere, generating a flash that may be visible to a nearby 
space probe. 
</P>
<P>
 Depth charge: The shock wave may help the comet penetrate as deep as 15 miles 
into the atmosphere, generating a fireball that would fountain back up through 
the channel created by the comet's passage. 
</P>
<P>
 Big Bang: In the most spectacular scenario, the comet could penetrate more 
than 200 miles into Jupiter's atmosphere. The enormous pressure of the 
atmosphere would help generate an explosion with an energy of 20 million 
megatons. HOW COLLISIONS MAY HAVE AFFECTED EARTH 
</P>
<P>
 Lunar rocks brought back by Apollo astronauts suggest that the Moon is the 
result of cataclysmic collision between the Earth and a Mars-sized planetoid 
more than 4.5 billion years ago. The impact sent a cascade of molten spray into 
space, scientists theorize. Although most of the debris fell back to Earth, 
some of it stayed aloft and formed a Saturn-like ring around the planet, which 
eventually coalesced into the Moon. END OF THE DINOSAURS 
</P>
<P>
 The Chicxulub crater -- more than 110 miles across -- recently discovered in 
the Yucatan may be the imprint of a mountain-sized comet or asteroid that 
blindsided Earth 65 million years ago, causing the demise of the dinosaurs and 
two-thirds of all species then in existence. IN MODERN TIMES 
</P>
<P>
 In 1908, a celestial fireball trailing a plume 540 miles long exploded in 
midair over northern Siberia, leveling more than 1,200 square miles of forest 
in what is considered the most devastating impact in recent history. The object 
responsible for the "Tunguska Event" could have been a comet, an asteroid, 
anti-matter, or even a black hole. No trace was ever found. 
</P>
<P>
 EYEWITNESS ACCOUNTS 
</P>
<P>
 1) In a nearby nomad camp, the reindeer herd was burned to ashes. 
</P>
<P>
 2) A herdsman lay unconscious for two days, his entire herd of reindeer 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
 3) One nomad later said: "God in his displeasure with us tore the sky apart." 
</P>
<P>
 4) In a nomad's camp, all the tents were knocked down and one elderly man died 
of shock. 
</P>
<P>
 5) A hunter's shirt was on fire: "The sky has split apart. When the fire 
appeared, it became so hot that one couldn't stand it." A Comet's Trail 
</P>
<P>
 Until it was snared by Jupiter, the comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 may have been 
circling the solar system since creation. The planet's immense tidal forces 
broke the comet into a "string of pearls" more than 600,000 miles long. If this 
diagram were drawn to scale, the length of the comet's orbit would be 5 1/2 
feet long. 
</P>
<P>
 Disruption at close approach to Jupiter on July 8, 1992 
</P>
<P>
 Comet discovered March 25, 1993 
</P>
<P>
 Farthest point in orbit -- 31 million miles -- July 16, 1993 
</P>
<P>
 Impacts on Jupiter July 16-22, 1994 GAILIEO'S BOX SEAT 
</P>
<P>
 NASA's Gailileo space probe might get the only direct view of the impacts on 
Jupiter's far side. It will be about 150 million miles from the planet when the 
bombardment begins. Galileo was already no its way to Jupiter when the comet 
was discovered. It is scheduled to begin a two-year orbit of the red planet in 
December, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Evolution of the Brightest Region: These images taken by the Hubble space 
telescope show the continued fragmentation of some parts of the comet that will 
decrease the power of its impact into Jupiter's atmosphere. Most fragments have 
apparently been stable for at least a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking Measure: Jupiter is about 300 times larger than the Earth, but rotates 
three times faster.

 Who are the victims of spousal abuse? 
</P>
<P>
 Last year in California, 93% of the people arrested for spousal abuse were 
men, according to the state Department of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, 1,400 women were killed by their husbands or boyfriends, while fewer 
than 400 men were killed by their wives, said Richard J. Gelles, director of 
the Family Violence Research Program at the University of Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, the victims are women and ownership of the problem is men," Gelles 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Victims of spousal abuse are found across all racial, ethnic and geographic 
lines, said Ronet Bachman, a statistician for the U.S. Department of Justice. 
But the rate of abuse is double for women who live below the poverty line. 
Married women have lower rates of victimization than divorced or separated 
women, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 While rates tend to dip for women who have graduated from college, Bachman 
asked, "Does it go down or is it not reported nor talked about?" 
</P>
<P>
 Like batterers, victims are more likely to have grown up in an abusive 
household, according to Gelles. 
</P>
<P>
 Gelles co-authored the 1985 National Family Violence Survey, which was funded 
by the National Institute of Mental Health. Bachman's findings are based on 
four years of National Crime Victim Surveys, which the federal government 
conducts each year, querying a random sample of the general population about 
whether they have been a victim of crime that year. Gelles' study is also based 
on a random sample of the general population; both studies are considered by 
other researchers to be the best, if still limited, snapshots of the type and 
extent of family violence in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Gelles' study reported a sensitive finding, namely that an equal number of men 
and women reported being hit by their intimate partners. The survey has been 
widely cited in newspapers and talk shows in recent weeks after the arrest of 
O. J. Simpson for the murders of his ex-wife and a friend. Simpson and Nicole 
Brown Simpson had a history of domestic abuse, and the former football star 
pleaded no contest in 1989 to misdemeanor spousal battery. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gelles said some recent interpretations of his work ignore his caveat -- 
that women are seven times more likely to be injured as men. "If the threshold 
of abuse is who gets hurt, it isn't men." 
</P>
<P>
 Based on his interviews of 6,000 people, Gelles estimated that 2 million women 
experienced one or more instances of severe violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Undeniably, many incidents of domestic violence do involve mutual combat, 
Bachman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nevertheless, the extent, severity and potential risk of injury is much 
greater when dealt out by a man's hand," she said.

CLIBURN DAZZLES AUDIENCE AT PREVIEW OF CONCERT TOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Van Cliburn made some mistakes in the opening of his signature piece, 
Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1, but dazzled his audience to the end as he 
gave a preview of his first concert tour in 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Clad in black tails and bow tie, the virtuoso, who is scheduled to perform at 
the Hollywood Bowl tonight, received five ovations Saturday night as he played 
to a near-capacity crowd of 4,600 at the outdoor Embarcadero Marina Park South. 
</P>
<P>
 It was more than 35 years ago that the Texan, then 23, set the classical music 
world on its ear when he won the prestigious piano competition in Moscow, 
returning to the U.S. to a New York City ticker-tape parade and, for a short 
time, as much acclaim as a rock 'n' roll star. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday night, concert-goers paid $35 to $250 per seat to see and hear 
Cliburn's preview of his 15-city, six-week North American tour, which starts 
tonight at the Hollywood Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's deja vu, " said concert-goer Kipp Charlton, of Scottsdale, Ariz., who 
saw Cliburn perform in 1958 after he returned from winning the First 
Tchaikovsky International Piano Competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes me back 30 years. I can hear the same notes. It doesn't seem any 
different."

170,000 LABORATORY ANIMALS DIE IN BLAZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An estimated 170,000 animals died in a medical laboratory fire, a California 
Department of Forestry official said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire broke out Saturday at Simonsen Laboratories in Gilroy and destroyed a 
30,000-square-foot building, said Fire Capt. Nancy Koerperich. 
</P>
<P>
 The laboratory breeds laboratory animals in sterile environments for sale to 
medical researchers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were 170,000 animals killed -- rats, mice, guinea pigs," Koerperich 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 She estimated the damage at $3.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The laboratory, about 30 miles south of San Jose, was picketed for a week in 
April by more than two dozen animal rights activists belonging to a group 
called In Defense of Animals, but Koerperich said there was no evidence of 
arson.

MAN CHARGED IN DEATHS OF WIFE, MOTHER-IN-LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Santa Ana man has been charged with murder and arson after allegedly 
confessing to killing his estranged wife and her mother in a jealous rage and 
then setting their Anaheim home on fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuan Ngoc Le, 32, also faces a special circumstance allegation of multiple 
murder, meaning he could face the death penalty if convicted of fatally 
stabbing Loi Thanh Phan, 30, and her mother, Sao Thi Nguyen, 69. 
</P>
<P>
 Le's arraignment was postponed Friday until Aug. 12. He is being held without 
bail in the Orange County Men's Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Le's court-appointed attorney could not be reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 According to relatives, Le had a history of abusing his estranged wife and had 
repeatedly threatened to kill her. He told Orange County sheriff's deputies he 
killed the women after learning that his wife was car-pooling to work with a 
man, said Sgt. Randy Benicky. 
</P>
<P>
 He told deputies he went to the home Wednesday morning to confront her and 
used a knife to attack her, Benicky said. 
</P>
<P>
 But relatives question whether Le had planned the attack. They say Le knew 
that the man who was taking Phan to work was a relative and there was no reason 
to be jealous. They also say Le's pride was hurt when Phan had found a 
good-paying job with an Anaheim electronics firm, while he had to borrow money 
to make his rent. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple had recently emigrated from Vietnam with their 4-year-old daughter. 
They were experiencing marital problems but were together over the July 4 
holiday weekend and were discussing getting back together shortly before the 
slayings took place, relatives said. 
</P>
<P>
 A neighbor who ran to the house when he saw smoke billowing out a window said 
he found Le washing his hands and a knife in the kitchen. The bodies were found 
in the living room, where Le allegedly set the carpet and a lawn mower on fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Phan's eldest sister, Lien Thi Phan, 46, suffered smoke inhalation and burns 
to her feet.

MOURNERS PADDLE INTO SEA TO BID FAREWELL TO SURFER; VENTURA: BORROWING FROM THE 
HAWAIIAN CUSTOM, FRIENDS AND FAMILY DON WET SUITS TO OBSERVE SCATTERING OF 
ASHES OF NICK VLACO, WHO DIED LAST MONTH AT 36. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Paddling beyond the breakers, three dozen surfers formed a floating semicircle 
of mourners in the chilly waters at Surfers Point in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sunday morning congregation was quiet, even somber, as Erin Quinn cast a 
lei of yellow, purple and red flowers into the calm, gray waters. She opened a 
small wooden box and scattered ashes of her late husband, Nick Vlaco, onto the 
waves that he loved to ride. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nick, you'll be missed, but never forgotten," said Robert Perdue, a veteran 
waterman with long sun-bleached hair who joined in the eulogy. 
</P>
<P>
 At that moment, a massive swell swept through, lifting the carpet of surfers 
and then dropping them again like a brief roller-coaster ride. The sudden surge 
seemed like the ocean's nod of agreement to those straddling their boards. They 
broke into a chorus of hoots, yips and yowls. 
</P>
<P>
 The ritual "paddle out," as it is called, surfaces more frequently these days 
as aging baby boomers refuse to relinquish the beloved sport of their youth. 
Its roots are in Hawaii, where the beach boys of Waikiki have had their ashes 
scattered at sea for decades. More recently, it's been embraced as part of 
California's surf culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the ceremony varies, it usually involves releasing ashes and flowers 
into the water, followed by a prayer and a few words from friends. The ritual 
signifies more than just returning the departed surfer to the ocean as a final 
resting place. It's a symbolic way for him to rejoin his friends in the surf 
they shared. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past year, Nicholas F. Vlaco spent nearly every morning with his 
buddies at Surfers Point, which is across from the Ventura County Fairgrounds. 
Although he moved to Ventura only about a year ago, he quickly fell into a 
group of regulars who surf whenever there are waves, or just hang out along the 
Ventura Promenade when the ocean is flat. 
</P>
<P>
 Vlaco was one of the younger members of the pack at "the Point," as the locals 
call it. He died suddenly at age 36 of natural causes while camping in Yosemite 
with his wife and three children June 19. Physicians speculate that it was 
heart trouble, but are still not sure. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6-foot-4 and 230 pounds, he was fit from surfing. His business was taking 
off, crafting sheet-metal hoods over stoves and installing heating and 
air-conditioning systems. He delighted in his marriage of three years to Erin 
Quinn and their combined family of three children. And he was well-known for 
his boyish enthusiasm and irrepressible spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why it hit everybody so hard," said Jerry Wilson, one of his surfing 
friends. "He was only 36 years old, a big guy and so healthy, and the next 
thing he was gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Like most surf spots along the California coast, the Point has a crew of 
enthusiasts who, no matter how cold it gets, tug off their clothes in the 
parking lot, wriggle into wet suits and slip into the surf -- all before most 
people are out of bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Vlaco, who had grown up surfing in San Pedro as a teen-ager, fit in easily 
with the local crowd. He was a loud and gregarious character who seemed to love 
nothing more than to share some laughs, beers and waves with his buddies. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a great attitude out in the water," said Steve Walden, a professional 
surfer and popular Ventura surfboard maker. "He was always up and smiling and 
excited. It was his enthusiasm that rubbed off on a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
 About 6:30 one morning, Perdue was standing outside his parked car checking 
out the surf. His tape deck blared music with a catchy Congo-drum rhythm. And 
Vlaco showed up. "Nick started dancing," Perdue said. "Then we all started 
dancing trying to put our wet suits on." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike other famous "point breaks" such as Malibu and Rincon, the Point is 
less competitive. There's an easy camaraderie among newcomers and the regulars. 
For the most part, locals do not engage in hazing to chase away visiting 
surfers. And many of them don't mind sharing waves with each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nick always said this is the friendliest place he's ever surfed," Quinn said 
of her late husband. "There is a real fellowship." 
</P>
<P>
 Rich Phelps, a young surfer befriended by Vlaco, remembers sharing many waves 
with him. 
</P>
<P>
 On one big surf day, Phelps was riding a wave and found himself deep inside 
the breaking wave as if he were inside a barrel -- the ultimate experience for 
a surfer. It was then, he said, that he heard Vlaco's voice from behind him. 
"Don't bail. Coming up behind you," he said, reassuring Phelps that there was 
room for two inside the wave. 
</P>
<P>
 "We both got barreled," Phelps said, savoring the memory that bonded them 
forever. "He was a good surfer. He had a lot of control. I still hear his voice 
echoing behind me." 
</P>
<P>
 Phelps canceled out of a surfing competition in San Diego County to join the 
ceremonial paddle out for his friend. "It was something I had to do," Phelps 
said. "I can compete another day." 
</P>
<P>
 All told, 36 people paddled out beyond the breakers to honor a fellow surfer. 
The congregation included three "Cove boys," who drove up from his hometown 
break, called "The Cove" in San Pedro, and a few relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife Erin, an associate dean at the USC School of Medicine, paddled out on 
one of Vlaco's six surfboards. His brother, Marty, rode tandem with Vlaco's 
8-year-old daughter Tamara on another. His sister-in-law, Sheila Quinn Kelley, 
was riding a third while his parents watched from shore. 
</P>
<P>
 After the brief ceremony, the surfers spread out and caught waves to shore. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is how one surfer pays tribute to another surfer," said Perdue, perhaps 
Vlaco's closest friend in Ventura. "I know I would want this. And I think Nick 
would want this too."

STREET SMART: PLAN TO CURB ILLEGAL USE OF DISABLED PARKING IS WINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, the city of Oxnard started a program where volunteers would 
patrol parking spaces for the disabled and ticket illegally parked cars. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, I saw them around quite a bit, but in recent months, I have not 
noticed any ticket-writing. 
</P>
<P>
 I was very impressed with their work and thought they did a great job. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this program still in effect? 
</P>
<P>
 William F. Langley, Oxnard 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 The program is alive and well. 
</P>
<P>
 Fewer tickets are being written of late because most motorists have stopped 
parking illegally in the spots for the disabled, says Sgt. John Crombach, who 
supervises the city's traffic unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think after a while people started to figure out that they weren't going to 
get away with it," Crombach said. "It's really been a successful program." 
</P>
<P>
 In January, Crombach selected four disabled residents who had applied to work 
as volunteers. He trained them in the art of ticket-writing and sent them out 
to scour shopping malls and city streets for parking scofflaws. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first few months, the volunteers wrote hundreds of the $290 tickets, 
Crombach says. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, they were really busy," Crombach said. "But lately, things have 
slowed down quite a bit." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Each day as I exit the Santa Paula Freeway at the eastbound off-ramp for 
Victoria Avenue, I am frustrated that there is no right-turn lane. 
</P>
<P>
 There is always some insensitive driver who pulls smack into the middle of the 
right lane, which leads straight into the Government Center. 
</P>
<P>
 This blocks anyone who wants to make a right turn on red onto Victoria. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem could be solved if a right-turn lane were installed. 
</P>
<P>
 This light is long (more than one minute) and always causes me grief. 
</P>
<P>
 Can we get a right-hand turn lane? 
</P>
<P>
 Marsha Gibson, Ventura 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 You will get your right-turn lane. 
</P>
<P>
 But first you must wait. 
</P>
<P>
 The intersection is on Ventura's list of projects in need of improvement, but 
it is fairly low on the list, Traffic Engineer Nazir Lalani said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other projects, including relieving congestion at clogged intersections and 
repairing crumbled roadways, take top priority, Lalani said. 
</P>
<P>
 So the addition of a lane at Victoria and the Santa Paula Freeway is five 
years or more down the road. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Is it possible to install some passing lanes on California 118 between 
Moorpark and Oxnard? 
</P>
<P>
 As it is now, there are few opportunities to pass slow vehicles. This often 
creates a dangerous situation when impatient drivers pass illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be a great help if there were a few passing lanes. It is very 
frustrating to be stuck behind a car going 40 m.p.h. in a 55-m.p.h. zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Can anything be done? 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Leeds, Moorpark 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Transportation is aware of the problems on California 
118, but a state funding shortage has pushed back plans to widen the roadway. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a project report that calls for widening the road from two to four 
lanes, but we don't have the funding to do it," Senior Engineer Luu Nguyen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to a funding shortage, most available money is being diverted to 
earthquake repairs and seismic retrofitting of bridges, Nguyen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the budget crunch, even installation of a few passing lanes would 
be too costly, Nguyen said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Nguyen's most optimistic estimate, the widening project would not 
begin until after the year 2000.

LONGTIME TRUSTEE NOT READY TO QUIT; EDUCATION: ELAINE K. GARBER, WHO HAS SERVED 
ON THE HUENEME SCHOOL BOARD SINCE 1959, IS ALSO AN ADVOCATE OF CIVIC CAUSES. AT 
67, SHE SAYS, 'IF I'M ABLE TO DO IT, I DO IT.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Until four years ago, the Hueneme school board was one of the most stable in 
California: Its five trustees had served side-by-side for more than a quarter 
of a century. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Elaine K. Garber, a tireless advocate for both educational and civic 
causes, is the only one of the old guard left. 
</P>
<P>
 One veteran school board member moved out of the Hueneme Elementary School 
District. Two others lost reelection bids in 1990. And a fourth was voted out 
in 1992. Only Garber survived. 
</P>
<P>
 First appointed to the Hueneme school board in 1959, Garber is now the 
longest-serving school trustee in Ventura County and one of the most senior in 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Fewer than 50 of the 5,000 school board members across California can match 
Garber's 35 years of service, according to the California School Boards Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 During her tenure, the 7,800-student district has changed dramatically, its 
racial makeup shifting from 85% white in 1959 to three-quarters minority today. 
And it has grown poorer. 
</P>
<P>
 Now nearly two-thirds of its students qualify for free or reduced lunches. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the seven-school district's lack of wealth, Garber and other trustees 
have steered it to national recognition for its use of technology in the 
classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 One Hueneme junior high school, Charles Blackstock, is among a handful 
statewide that has received a multimillion-dollar grant for using computers as 
a teaching tool. Another junior high, E. O. Green, is one of only six Ventura 
County schools ever to be recognized as national Blue Ribbon Schools. 
</P>
<P>
 But Garber, a onetime elementary schoolteacher, has made a name for herself in 
Port Hueneme beyond her school board achievements. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her name is just so known personally to everyone," fellow school board member 
Darlene Bruno said. "She's been in every little nook and cranny in this city. 
People in this community know she's behind a lot of things." 
</P>
<P>
 The 67-year-old Garber has volunteered for nearly every civic cause in Port 
Hueneme over the past few decades. 
</P>
<P>
 She helped launch the city's annual Harbor Days celebration 30 years ago and 
still serves as treasurer. She was one of the founders of Port Hueneme's 
historical museum. And she is an officer in the group that raises money for the 
local library. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like to just talk about 'Someone should do this,' " Garber said. "If 
I'm able to do it, I do it." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to her civic activities, Garber may also be known to Port Hueneme 
residents in a different role: as their astrologer. 
</P>
<P>
 She has run an astrology business from her home for 20 years, preparing 
clients' astrological charts from a personal computer. She has even taught 
astrology courses through the local park district. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she knows that some people dismiss astrology as bunk, that doesn't 
bother Garber. 
</P>
<P>
 "Astrology is folk psychology or folk philosophy," she said. "It's really 
based on a lot of common sense." 
</P>
<P>
 A great believer in common sense, Garber belies any image of astrologers as 
flighty or whimsical. 
</P>
<P>
 A favorite among her wide-ranging interests is finance. Garber has volunteered 
for the past 20 years to help poor Oxnard residents complete their income tax 
forms. And she has served as treasurer for many civic groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has taken care of the money for so long," said Penny Wolcott, chairman of 
the Port Hueneme Harbor Days organizing committee, "that we never even question 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 To Garber, the key to the success of organizations and people is how well they 
handle their money. "You can have all the dreams you want," she said. "If you 
don't know how to manage your finances, you won't get them realized." 
</P>
<P>
 Such pragmatism combined with an open-mindedness that allows Garber to embrace 
such unorthodox philosophies as astrology has been evident during her reign on 
the Hueneme school board. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Garber has been one of the district's leading advocates for 
offering high teacher salaries to attract top talent. And its teachers are 
among the highest paid. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning teachers in Hueneme earned about $25,600 this school year, more than 
in any other county district except Conejo Valley, Oxnard Union High School and 
Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 Garber is also credited with helping make the Hueneme district a pioneer in 
classroom computer use. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's been a total advocate for the use of technology to deliver 
instruction," Assistant Supt. Nikki Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1970s, when it was still unusual to find personal computers in 
homes, Garber and her husband Duane, an engineer, drove to Santa Barbara to buy 
the latest model of a new line of the electronic gadgets. 
</P>
<P>
 After trying it out at home, Garber took her new computer to a Hueneme school 
board meeting, where she demonstrated its capabilities to her colleagues. They 
embraced its use unanimously. 
</P>
<P>
 "A board member has to have a vision and know their community and know what's 
going on all over," Garber said. "We wouldn't be where we're at if I waited for 
the community to tell me" what to do. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, about 10 years after that computer demonstration, the Hueneme 
district was one of only six in California to win a multimillion-dollar state 
technology grant. 
</P>
<P>
 The $3 million is going toward installing computers, video monitors and other 
electronic equipment in classrooms at Blackstock, which will serve as a model 
for school districts across the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hueneme district's emphasis on technology is noteworthy partly because of 
the poverty of many of its students. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, proponents of the so-called information superhighway have voiced 
concerns that the poor and minorities across the nation may be left out of the 
burgeoning computer network. 
</P>
<P>
 But Garber said she has known all along that many Hueneme students come from 
families that cannot afford home computers. So school is the only place where 
these children can become comfortable with such technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted my students to have as good a technological education as in Beverly 
Hills," Garber said. "We're not a wealthy district. But that doesn't mean we 
can't have a teaching-learning experience equal to a wealthy district." 
</P>
<P>
 Garber is also a well-known local history buff. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after moving to Port Hueneme in 1959, she developed a curiosity about the 
city's history that gradually grew into an interest in the county's past. 
</P>
<P>
 She was the first woman president of the Ventura County Historical Society. 
And in 1973, the County Board of Supervisors appointed Garber to head the 
committee organizing the celebration of the county's 100th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 Brady Cherry, the recreation director for Port Hueneme, said he always turns 
to Garber when he has a question about local history. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I want to know, for example, where a certain building stood," Cherry said, 
"Elaine knows." 
</P>
<P>
 But Garber remains a participant in as well as a chronicler of local history, 
and she shows no signs of slowing down. She says she is considering a run this 
fall for a ninth term on the school board. 
</P>
<P>
 As long as Garber wants that job, school officials said, she will probably 
have it. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's hung in there," said Mary Samples, the district's director of pupil 
services. "She certainly has done her due and given her bit to society. Elaine 
will be around in Hueneme as long as she wants to be." Profile of Elaine

BIOLOGISTS WORKING ON PLAN TO PROTECT PARK'S RARE SPECIES; CONSERVATION: THE 
AGREEMENT WILL LIKELY REMOVE SOME LIVESTOCK AND WEED OUT NON-NATIVE PLANTS ON 
THE CHANNEL ISLANDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to keep more than 30 rare species of plants and animals from 
vanishing in Channel Islands National Park, federal biologists are developing a 
new strategy to protect the native flora and fauna before it's too late. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists from the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Channel Islands 
National Park are crafting a conservation agreement designed to prevent further 
decline of the native species on four of the park's northernmost islands. 
</P>
<P>
 As the plan is being developed, officials are considering removing or 
restricting some livestock and game animals that had been placed on the 
islands, and eventually weeding out non-native plants. Biologists may also 
nurture native species with some plantings. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar plan is being developed for the four southern Channel Islands by 
Fish and Wildlife's office in Carlsbad. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the disturbance on the islands has been caused by grazing and browsing 
of game animals imported for hunters or livestock, including cattle, elk, deer, 
pigs and sheep, said Connie Rutherford, a botanist heading up the agreement 
development for Fish and Wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 While most of the large grazing animals have already been removed from Anacapa 
and San Miguel islands, the other two islands covered by the conservation 
agreement, Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa, still host the large grazers. 
</P>
<P>
 The animals denude rare shrubs and disrupt top soil with their hoofs, allowing 
the more aggressive invasive plants and weeds to crowd out native grasses and 
plants, she said. That reduces the vegetation available to native animals as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a couple of decades, you can undo what nature took thousands of years to 
create," Rutherford said. "Putting the pieces back together is not so easy." 
</P>
<P>
 The new conservation plan will try to take a broader look at protecting 
species than the government has taken in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a much more comprehensive approach," Rutherford said of the 
conservation agreement. "We're looking at the whole habitat or the whole 
ecosystem rather than just isolated portions of it." 
</P>
<P>
 The developing agreement reflects the U. S. Department of Interior's new 
direction for implementing the 20-year-old Endangered Species Act, which comes 
up for congressional reauthorization this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt has instructed the Fish and Wildlife Service 
to avoid "train wrecks" and "crisis management" in part through conservation 
agreements among agencies overseeing public lands. Those agreements should help 
protect habitat and preclude the need for placing species on the endangered 
list, the department said. 
</P>
<P>
 When completed next year, the Channel Islands National Park conservation 
agreement should prevent species from becoming extinct. 
</P>
<P>
 "All plants and animals have a value in nature, and we don't want to take the 
risk of causing the extinction of a species before we know what the value is," 
Rutherford said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the measures considered for the agreement include sparking controlled 
fires or selective use of herbicides to rid the islands of some weeds 
introduced by Europeans in the last century. Officials are also thinking about 
re-vegetation programs to bring back the native plants, using fences to keep 
non-native animals out of certain areas or restricting grazing to certain times 
of the year critical to plant growth. 
</P>
<P>
 But eliminating non-native grazing animals is by far the most important 
measure to preserve native species, Rutherford said. "Those animals are the 
main concern," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservation agreement could call for gradually scaling back the ranching 
operation on Santa Rosa Island, where Vail & Vickers Co. runs about 4,500 head 
of cattle, said C. Mack Shaver, superintendent of Channel Islands National 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also has a herd of 100 elk and 100 deer, which may be hunted for a 
fee. 
</P>
<P>
 But Shaver disputed that the grazing animals are an immediate threat to native 
species of plants and animals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before we change radically the grazing on Santa Rosa, we need to understand 
those problems to be sure we don't end up with a worse problem than we started 
with," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaver referred to an unexpected problem that arose on Santa Cruz Island when 
the Nature Conservancy, which owns 90% of the island, pulled all the cattle and 
sheep off the island as soon as it took possession. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of native grasses beginning to flourish, weedy, bamboo-like fennel 
grew in abundance, choking out native plants, Shaver said. 
</P>
<P>
 Feral pigs still roam much of the rest of the island. The National Park 
Service is negotiating to buy the final 25% of the 10% of the island that is 
still privately owned. If the Park Service is successful, it will remove the 
sheep kept there by the Gherini family. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaver said that when money allows, the Park Service will also remove the 
feral pigs from all of Santa Cruz Island. 
</P>
<P>
 On Santa Rosa Island, the problems with non-native animals will take longer to 
resolve, Shaver said. Three years ago, the Park Service hired professional 
hunters to kill the feral pigs on the island. 
</P>
<P>
 But under the agreement to purchase the island from Vail & Vickers in 1987, 
the cattle ranching and deer and elk hunting operations will be allowed to 
continue until 2012, as long as they don't interfere with park management. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaver said he sees no such interference, but that the conservation agreement 
will outline measures to prevent any further decline of native species until 
the agreement expires. 
</P>
<P>
 "The land is in transition from ranch to park and eventually we will have all 
the non-native animals off the land," he said. "In the meantime, we need to 
learn as much as we can about the ecosystems so we don't end up with a 
catastrophe when we pull the animals off." 
</P>
<P>
 But other interested parties, such as the California Native Plant Society, say 
the operations need to be curtailed now. 
</P>
<P>
 The society's staff botanist, Mark Skinner, said he realizes that the Park 
Service would not have been able to acquire Santa Rosa at all without the 
agreement to operate the cattle ranch, but he said the native species could be 
irreparably damaged if the Park Service waits until 2012 to act. 
</P>
<P>
 Skinner said that the Native Plant Society brought up the urgency of the 
matter in a lawsuit and that the Fish and Wildlife Service is in the process of 
proposing that 18 plants on the Channel Islands be added to the endangered 
species list. 
</P>
<P>
 "Impacts from introduced herbivores are overwhelmingly the No. 1 threat to 
these plants," he said. "The vegetation and rare plants are in really bad shape 
now, and some of them will undergo additional decline in the next couple of 
decades, and it's possible some may disappear." 
</P>
<P>
 The same may be true for another 20 species of plants and animals that are 
candidates for the endangered species list, biologists said. 
</P>
<P>
 Skinner said the National Park Service tries to abide by its mandate to be a 
good steward of the land, but that it also wants to honor its agreement with 
ranchers. 
</P>
<P>
 "But those two objectives are mutually exclusive," he said. "It's the ranching 
operations on Santa Rosa that are having such an adverse impact. The Park 
Service is not taking sufficient initiative to change the practices to protect 
rare and endangered plants." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the California Native Plant Society that sued the Fish and Wildlife 
Service in 1991 for failing to propose for listing 159 species statewide that 
were identified as candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the suit settlement, the Fish and Wildlife Service agreed to 
propose the plants for the endangered species list by September, 1996. Skinner 
said the society hopes to avoid any future legal action against the federal 
government to force it to take care of the Channel Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 But the islands are far to valuable to ignore, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Channel Islands are a very special place," he said. "The Channel Islands 
have a number of endemic species found no place else in California or in the 
world. From a biological standpoint, they're priceless."

SIMI VALLEY STREAMLINES DIAL-A-RIDE BUS SERVICE; TRANSPORTATION: DIRECT 
CALLING, ADDED WHEELCHAIR ACCESS AND OTHER IMPROVEMENTS WILL SIMPLIFY THE 
PROCESS FOR SENIOR CITIZENS AND THE DISABLED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Several times a week, Simi Valley resident Bethel Scott phones the city's 
Dial-A-Ride bus service to arrange rides to the doctor and the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott, 85, has learned to plan ahead because sometimes no bus is available 
when she needs to get to an appointment. And she never makes plans to go out on 
the weekends because the door-to-door bus service only operates Monday through 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dial-A-Ride is a lifesaver, but you do have to do a lot of planning ahead," 
Scott said. "When you get to be my age, it's not so easy to get around." 
</P>
<P>
 Getting around may soon get easier. 
</P>
<P>
 In coming months, a series of improvements will be phased in to Simi Valley's 
Dial-A-Ride program, a door-to-door bus service catering to the city's senior 
citizens and disabled residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to new federal regulations and complaints from residents who said 
the city's Dial-A-Ride bus service is too hard to use, the city has streamlined 
the service to make it easier to get appointments and be picked up more 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting today, residents may make an appointment by calling Simi Valley 
Transit directly, rather than calling a volunteer at the senior center and 
waiting several days to find out if a bus is available at the desired hour. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, Saturday service will be added to the program. And in October, a 
third wheelchair-accessible bus will be added to the city's Dial-A-Ride fleet. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the Saturday service and the new bus are required under the federal 
Americans with Disabilities Act, Transportation Manager Rap Turpin said. The 
law requires cities and businesses to make services readily available to 
disabled residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The change in the appointment procedure is being made because the City Council 
agreed to pay for an additional staff person at the transit office to handle 
scheduling. 
</P>
<P>
 "These changes will really be a benefit for the riders," Turpin said. "It will 
make the service more accessible." 
</P>
<P>
 A group of riders boarding the Dial-A-Ride bus at Simi Valley's Senior Center 
last week agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be nice to know right away whether they are going to be able to pick 
you up, rather than having to wait for somebody to call you back," said Ethan 
Parks, 78. "It will be a real improvement." 
</P>
<P>
 Gertrude Smith, 82, said she welcomed any services added to the Dial-A-Ride 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't drive, so I really rely on the bus to go places," Smith said. "Having 
a bus on Saturday will be wonderful. I can't wait." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Bill Davis said he is sure the improved services will benefit 
senior citizens and disabled residents, but he fears that the additional costs 
may increase fares. 
</P>
<P>
 Dial-A-Ride passengers are now asked to pay an optional 75-cent fare. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of these changes are required by law, so we don't have a choice," Davis 
said. "But we'll have to see if the Saturday service brings in enough new 
riders to pay for the increased cost." 
</P>
<P>
 Even without Saturday buses, Turpin said, ridership over the past two years 
has increased steadily. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fiscal year that ended in June, 1993, the service carried 11,028 
passengers. Ridership rose more than 5%, to 11,617 passengers, in the fiscal 
year that ended last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seeing more and more people using the service," Turpin said. "With the 
improvements, the number should continue to go up."

THE NAME BLAME; HOUSTON DRIVE RESIDENTS HOPE TO SHED THEIR STREET'S REPUTATION 
-- AS THE SITE OF THOUSAND OAKS' ONLY DRIVE-BY SLAYING -- BY ASKING FOR A NEW 
MONIKER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It's a beautiful two-story, country-style house that sits atop a hill in 
Thousand Oaks. It includes four bedrooms, a fireplace and a sweeping view of 
the surrounding mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, not a single buyer has been in to look at the house on Houston Drive, 
even though the asking price has dropped from $250,000 to $179,000 in the two 
years that it has been on the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Joanne Kurczeski, who with her husband Walter is hoping to retire to 
Colorado, no longer places the blame on the bad economy or the sluggish real 
estate market. The problem, she said, runs much deeper than that. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been boycotted," said Kurczeski, one of about a dozen homeowners on 
Houston Drive whose houses are up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Kurczeski, who has lived on the street for 24 years, believes that the stigma 
attached to Houston Drive as the namesake of the Houston Hoods gang and the 
site of the city's only drive-by slaying has significantly lowered property 
values and made it nearly impossible to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very hard to live down a reputation," Kurczeski said. "Anywhere you go 
in this town, even if I go K mart shopping, and I say, 'I live on Houston 
Drive,' people say, 'Oh, that's where the shooting was.' " 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't matter that the incident occurred three years ago, she said. People 
remember. 
</P>
<P>
 For that reason, Kurczeski and a number of her neighbors recently petitioned 
the City Council to change the name of their street. And although their request 
was rejected, they say the fight is not over. They plan to bring the issue up 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very, very mad," said homeowner Dolores Cohenour, who has lived on the 
street for 10 years. "We want to get rid of the reputation. . . . We want to be 
anonymous again. We just want to be an average, quiet neighborhood again." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Kurczeski: "It's our reputation too that's at stake. Whatever we have to 
do to (change the street name), we will do it." 
</P>
<P>
 But some homeowners on Houston Drive call the proposed change a "placebo" that 
will do nothing to improve neighborhood security. They also don't want to go 
through the inconvenience of having to change their driver's licenses, 
checkbooks and other important papers listing their addresses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's ridiculous," said Debbie Bavaro, a seven-year resident. "Even if 
we changed the name, it's still the street where the first shooting occurred. 
It's not going to change anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Bavaro said that if residents want to make their neighborhood safer, they 
should spend more time getting to know each other. "If they want to do 
something, they need to get more involved in the community," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bavaro does not agree that property values in the neighborhood have been hurt 
because of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Property values didn't go down because of the shooting," she said. "The whole 
economy fell out (in) Southern California. Everybody's property values went 
down. I knew some people in Westlake Village who lost $89,000 on their house." 
</P>
<P>
 Bavaro notes that there have been shootings on Westlake Boulevard and that no 
one is pushing to change the name of that street. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's change the name of Westlake Boulevard," she said. "Since we have this 
gang problem, maybe we should change the name of the city, too." 
</P>
<P>
 But Gene Bell, another longtime Houston Drive resident, said his street has a 
unique problem because of its association with the Houston Hoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the real crux," Bell said. "There's a direct association." 
</P>
<P>
 Like others, Bell said he is willing to put up with the inconvenience of 
having to change his legal papers if it will help change the image of his 
street. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it will bring a positive effect, then the inconvenience is minuscule," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents say that although some gang members once lived on the street, that 
is no longer the case. Even the couple who lived in the house where the 
shooting took place three years ago are gone, along with their son, who was 
known to associate with the Houston Hoods. It was his girlfriend who was shot 
and killed while attending a birthday party at the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no gangbangers here," Cohenour said. "But the gang kept the name 
Houston Hoods and that gang lives on. But they don't even hang out in these 
parts." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Deputy Patti Dreyer, who once patrolled Houston Drive, agreed with 
residents that while the Houston Hoods gang originated on the street, there is 
scarcely any connection between the two now except for the name. 
</P>
<P>
 Dreyer also noted that since the killing, the number of disturbance calls to 
the area has dropped significantly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to get four or five calls on the weekend," she said of the 
neighborhood. "Now we get two or three a week." 
</P>
<P>
 Dreyer said she supports the proposal to change the street name. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if it makes people feel good, then they will portray a more positive 
image about the neighborhood," she said. "I think it also gives people a sense 
of empowerment, that they do have a say in government." 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, 35 of the 69 residents of Houston Drive petitioned the City 
Council to change their street name to Cameron Drive. But the council voted to 
deny the name change because the petitioners represented barely half the 
families on Houston Drive and because a number of signatures were from renters, 
rather than property owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Alex Fiore said that at least two-thirds of the homeowners would have to 
show support for the name change before he could approve the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has to be a more significant showing of support because it puts a big 
burden on the rest of the people in the neighborhood," he said, adding that he 
is not sure that changing the name would make any difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Andy Fox, who heads the Neighborhood Watch group, said residents will 
definitely bring the issue back before the council. Fox lives on nearby 
Masterson Drive, but said property values have been affected throughout the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox and residents of Houston Drive said the issue will be discussed at the 
Neighborhood Watch meeting next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, homeowners in Newbury Park's Las Casitas neighborhood have applied 
to change the names of the tract's seven streets as part of an overall effort 
to rid the area of crime and to create a new image for the community. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past few years, residents and city officials have worked aggressively 
to improve conditions at the 25-year-old condominium complex, which includes 
more than 500 units. The homeowners association has installed new security 
fencing, banned vendors and persuaded the city to restrict overnight parking. 
It has also hired a new security company to patrol the complex. New street 
lights are set to go up soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've put a whole lot of work into the neighborhood," said Robert Bickle, 
president of the Las Casitas Homeowners Assn. "I think we've really proven 
ourselves. I think we've earned another chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Bickle said that changing the names of the streets -- and of the homeowners 
association itself -- could help erase the stigma of a once crowded and 
crime-plagued neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to wash away the whole mess the association people attribute to it," 
he said. "We don't want to just get rid of the spots. We want to get rid of the 
leopard too." 
</P>
<P>
 Bickle said an overwhelming majority of the residents in the complex support 
the name changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the new names will go with the new look and the new attitudes in the 
neighborhood," he said. "Residents here have really tried to make a 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Judy Lazar said she believes that the request to change the 
street names at Las Casitas is a reasonable one because of all the work that 
has been done there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Las Casitas is different," she said. "I think it has changed. When I 
drive through there now, I see the difference . . . police calls are down, a 
lot of community efforts have paid off."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: CANINE SHOW A DELIGHT FOR DOG FANCIERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marilyn Donlon of Westlake and her golden retriever, Lacey, stood in the shade 
near Ring 18 on Sunday at the county's annual dog show in Ventura, as Donlon 
primped and preened Lacey in anticipation of their turn to enter the ring. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, the judges called for Donlon and the long-haired canine to 
begin. Lacey, with head held high, embarked on a series of well-practiced 
walks, turns and jumps that Donlon hoped would result in a blue ribbon for her 
6-year-old companion. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Donlon rewarded Lacey with snacks and sips of cold water. 
</P>
<P>
 But she doubted that the effort would be good enough to take first place at 
the Ventura County Dog Fanciers Assn. Dog Show concluding Sunday at the Ventura 
County Fairgrounds. Instead, she learned later, Lacey won a yellow ribbon for a 
third-place showing. 
</P>
<P>
 "She tried and that's what was most important," said Donlon, a professional 
dog trainer who won champion status with Lacey at an earlier meet. "There are 
still some weaknesses, but she did a nice job." 
</P>
<P>
 Lacey was one of more than 2,300 dogs entered in a series of competitions at 
the fairgrounds in a weekend contest that attracted canines from all across the 
Western United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have to love animals to do this, and you have to love the 
competition," said William Bergum of Ventura, a director of the American Kennel 
Club, which sponsored the three-day show. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people are here just for the joy of competing," he said. "Nowadays, 
there are very few money prizes." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of people streamed through the Ventura County Fairgrounds on Sunday 
to applaud the animals' performances. Dogs competed in divisions of two primary 
categories that assess obedience and physical appearance. Divisional winners 
are presented ribbons that increase their value for breeding. 
</P>
<P>
 Dogs competing for obedience ribbons must perform a routine that calls for the 
animals to walk unleashed on long stretches of grass and sit at their owners' 
commands. They must also fetch bones and hurdle a three-foot-high fence. 
</P>
<P>
 Contestants in the conformation category, Bergum said, are judged strictly on 
physique and how closely they match a perfect computer-generated model. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Holstein, a Navy physicist who lives in Oxnard, brought his 3-year-old 
golden retriever, Trooper, to the show Sunday. But he didn't enter the young 
canine. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just hasn't been trained enough," Holstein said, watching the obedience 
contest near the fairgrounds entrance. "I'll have him in the Lompoc show at the 
end of the month." JEFF McDONALD

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: BENEFITS FOR COUNTY RETIREES FACE REVIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to an outcry from retired county employees, the Ventura County 
Board of Supervisors on Tuesday will consider restoring part of the benefits 
cut from retirees' pay earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's Board of Retirement voted 7 to 2 in May to eliminate as much as 
$280 a month in supplemental benefits to avoid dipping into reserve or general 
county funds.The move was prompted partly by real estate losses in the county's 
pension fund. 
</P>
<P>
 The supplemental benefits include payments that county retirees receive beyond 
their regular pensions. 
</P>
<P>
 One such benefit, granted in 1977, gave pensioners up to $70 a month in 
supplemental pay beyond the pension that county retirees are already due. 
</P>
<P>
 Another supplemental benefit, approved in 1990, was intended to compensate for 
policy changes that required the newest retirees to make higher pension 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors are expected to discuss restoring part of the supplemental 
benefits only for the oldest of the county retirees whose pensions have 
dwindled significantly because of inflation. JULIE FIELDS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; COUNCIL TO STUDY MODIFYING OF CREEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A discussion on whether to install concrete along the banks of a one-mile 
section of Calleguas Creek and redirect its course is scheduled for a Camarillo 
City Council study session tonight at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting will help the council decide later what to do with the meandering 
stream, which has posed flooding problems for nearby developments. 
</P>
<P>
 City and county staff officials, along with local housing developers, are 
recommending that the waterway be modified to prevent flooding at existing and 
proposed developments. But area environmental activists say such action will 
destroy wildlife and native vegetation. 
</P>
<P>
 One Pardee Construction Co. development, Montelena, overlooks the creek. City 
officials are considering two proposals -- totaling more than 450 homes -- by 
Pardee and the Baldwin Co. for land north and south of the creek bed. 
</P>
<P>
 No formal decision is expected by the council tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 The 7 p.m. meeting will be held in the main conference room at City Hall, 601 
Carmen Drive. J. E. MITCHELL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PORT HUENEME; FOSSE HOPES TO KEEP POST ON HARBOR 
PANEL

<TEXT>
<P>
 Raymond Fosse, a retired harbor pilot in Port Hueneme, has announced that he 
will seek reelection to the Oxnard Harbor District Board of Commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
 Fosse, 55, was first elected to the five-member board that oversees the port 
in 1990.More than $200 million in cargo is shipped out of the harbor each year, 
Fosse said. The district takes in about $6 million annually in revenue from 
shipping companies that use the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Fosse said that if reelected, he would work toward completing an agreement 
with the Navy to share the use of its wharf with commercial carriers. Sen. 
Dianne Feinstein, who supported legislation that allowed the military-owned 
wharf to be used for commercial purposes, recently visited the port to show her 
support of the joint-use plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very close to completing the (agreement with the Navy), and I'd like to 
make sure it happens as planned," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fosse worked as a ship's captain for close to 40 years, including 20 years as 
the Port Hueneme Harbor pilot. He is currently serving as president of the 
Harbor Commission. SCOTT HADLY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; POLICE SWEEP TARGETS RISING GANG VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to increasing gang violence in Oxnard, police conducted a citywide 
sweep early Sunday, citing 23 juveniles on curfew violations and arresting a 
20-year-old man on suspicion of illegally possessing a firearm. 
</P>
<P>
 During the four-hour sweep ending at 2 a.m. Sunday, which hit several 
locations throughout the city, police arrested Jermaine Johnson of Oxnard for 
possession of a 9-millimeter semiautomatic handgun. 
</P>
<P>
 "These sweeps let the gang members know that the police are there out keeping 
an eye on their activities," Oxnard Police Sgt. George Pultz said. "So they're 
very successful to that extent." 
</P>
<P>
 Police cited and released the 23 curfew violators and ticketed four of them 
for various traffic violations, officials said. Twenty-five other people were 
stopped, interviewed and released during the sweep. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said they conducted the sweep in response to escalating gang 
violence in Oxnard. In the past two weeks, there have been three drive-by 
shootings and one gang-related stabbing, according to police. JEFF McDONALD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; PLANS TO SELL PEIRANO BUILDING ADVANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The developer who planned to raze Ventura's historic Peirano building has 
received a tentative OK from a City Council committee to go ahead with the 
project, even though financial backers have withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Wood, president of Ventura Realty, told the council's economic committee 
last week that company shareholders may not support the deal, but that he and 
his father, Jack Wood, still want to build the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood told city officials he will look for funding elsewhere, the officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee decided to recommend that the city negotiate the sale of the 
historic building to Wood. The City Council is expected to make the final 
decision July 25. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, Wood proposed knocking down all but two walls of the old grocery to 
expose a laundry underneath. Wood then wanted to restore the lavanderia and 
surround it with restaurants, shops and offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Peirano's Market operated on Main Street from 1877 to 1987, when the city 
bought it from the Peirano family with the intention of preserving it as a 
historic landmark. 
</P>
<P>
 The lavanderia , a 26-by-30-foot tile-lined pool, may have served as the 
laundry for the San Buenaventura Mission across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Angry residents with sentimental attachments to the grocery jammed the council 
chambers and urged the politicians to reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the cost estimated at $430,000 just to bring Ventura's oldest brick 
building up to earthquake standards, council members said they would not oppose 
tearing the structure down. 
</P>
<P>
 For months following the meeting, city officials tried to negotiate a deal 
with Ventura Realty, but the company's shareholders balked at such a 
controversial project. CONSTANCE SOMMER

VALLEY CHRONICLE: SOMETIMES ALL TROUBLED KIDS, AND DOGS, NEED IS A LITTLE TLC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUE REILLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four years ago, a psychiatrist branded Sue Shaffer's little grandson Michael 
"incorrigible" because of his terrible behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 It was so bad, the Palmdale woman says, "one doctor's recommendation was that 
he be put into a facility where they would basically lock him up and forget 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, 8-year-old Michael Shaffer, who lives with Sue and her husband, Tom, 
goes to a neighborhood Christian school, gets straight A's and reads at the 
seventh-grade level. In short, says Sue, he is a delight. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael's mother, the Shaffers' daughter, was an unmarried 17-year-old on Feb. 
1, 1986, when Michael was born, according to Sue. 
</P>
<P>
 The baby was in Sue's care until he was 18 months old and his mother married. 
But when Michael was 4, that marriage fell apart and he was back with Sue and 
Tom by court order. 
</P>
<P>
 Sue says her daughter couldn't control the youngster. So, after going to court 
to get legal guardianship, she was awarded custody of him. But Sue couldn't 
understand the child's behavior either. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got him back he was a wild animal," she says. "He once screamed 
without stopping for 48 hours." 
</P>
<P>
 For a while, Michael was so wild he had to be put in a Valley psychiatric 
hospital, according to Sue. That was when one doctor told the Shaffers that 
Michael might never have a normal life. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the determined efforts of the couple and several other doctors, 
Michael was put on an antidepressant drug and returned to the Shaffers. 
Gradually, his behavior began to improve. 
</P>
<P>
 After a time at a school for children with a variety of disabilities, Michael 
was placed in a private school for normal children. His progress since then has 
given the Shaffers reason to feel very encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this time in our lives, Tom and I hoped we would have raised our two 
children and be able to devote time to travel and each other," says Sue, 47. 
Tom is 48. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, that is not the way things turned out, and we are not complaining," she 
adds. "We have the pleasure of seeing our grandchild grow up." 
</P>
<P>
 There have been no miraculous cures or sudden breakthroughs in their struggle 
to help Michael. "It's been hard work, a lot of discipline and a lot of love," 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
 And lately another element has been added to the equation: a mixed-breed dog 
named Honey, who has a story of her own. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, Nancy Hovey was driving down Avenue S near the Antelope Valley 
Freeway on her way to a Park-N-Ride in Palmdale when she saw something in the 
road she thought was a dead dog. 
</P>
<P>
 Hovey stopped and discovered a female, honey-colored mixed breed that was 
alive, but in pain and unable to get up. She took the dog home and put it in 
the care of her brother while she went to work. 
</P>
<P>
 When the dog did not get better, Hovey called the Los Angeles County Animal 
Shelter in Lancaster and the shelter sent a vehicle to pick the dog up. 
</P>
<P>
 A veterinarian said she was suffering from multiple fractures of her pelvic 
bone. The dog was treated, sent to the shelter and then to a private kennel to 
convalesce while the Save-a-Pet organization tried to find her a home. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Wilma Peterson of Save-a-Pet, everyone who came in contact with 
the dog was impressed by her will to live and her gentle nature. "We finally 
put a story in the local paper to try to find her a good place to live," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Sue Shaffer saw the story and asked Michael if he would like to try to read 
it. Not only did he read about the dog, by now named Honey, he decided he 
wanted her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I called the number in the paper and told the lady I wanted to adopt Honey," 
Michael says. "The lady told me a lot of people wanted Honey, and she would 
have to talk to my mother before she could put me on the list." 
</P>
<P>
 Sue got on the phone and said she would also be interested in having Honey and 
told Peterson a little about Michael. After some investigative work, Peterson 
brought Honey to the Shaffers' home. 
</P>
<P>
 Honey is a good dog, Michael says, even if she did chew up his Game Boy. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Sue, Honey follows Michael everywhere and he is very loving 
toward her. 
</P>
<P>
 She adds that she sometimes looks at the dog and boy and thinks how different 
things might have worked out for each of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes all the effort worthwhile," Shaffer says. Teacher Works Hard to Find 
Hosts for Great Danes 
</P>
<P>
 When Liliana Garcia of Sunland agreed to find homes for some Danish exchange 
students, she didn't know what she was getting into. 
</P>
<P>
 The 32-year-old Garcia, who teaches elementary school in Burbank, did know of 
a place that might be able to help: the Center for Educational Travel, 
headquartered in San Rafael, Calif. "I knew the organization is eight years old 
and brings students from all over the world to live with Americans to become 
familiar with their lifestyle and language," she says. "It is an educational 
opportunity for the students, who range in age from 15 to 18 and have taken as 
much as six years of English to come to this country for this total-immersion 
opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 When she learned that about 21 young people from Denmark would be visiting the 
Valley, Garcia agreed to house one of the students and offered to find homes 
for the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was given lists of local people who had expressed an interest in the 
program, and I had many friends I thought might take one or two students," she 
says, adding she figured, "How hard could it be?" 
</P>
<P>
 In short order she found out the recession was not going to make her job easy. 
"Many people were interested, but not now," Garcia says. 
</P>
<P>
 By June 17, her last day of teaching for the summer, Garcia had homes for all 
but four of the Danish students. But they were all about to arrive, and she 
still needed four sponsors. In desperation, Garcia parked herself in front of a 
local church to try to solicit sponsors for those last four. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she didn't come up with any, she did get calls back from two families 
who said they would each take two students, and Garcia says she finally started 
to breathe easier. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Garcia's only duty, in addition to enjoying the company of her own Danish 
student, 15-year-old Annemarie Boe, is helping to chaperon all of the young 
Danes on group outings around Southern California. 
</P>

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; PIAZZA SAYS HE IS MORE MATURE 
</P>

 Mike Piazza hits the ball so hard and so high that it is sometimes difficult 
to remember that at 25, he is still a kid. The thing is, he was hitting the 
ball nearly as well when he was 15. His strength notwithstanding, Piazza has 
matured, both as a hitter and as a person. He still beats up his batting 
helmet, but sometimes this season when he finds himself reaching for it in 
disgust, he thinks for a moment and says, "Nah . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "Maturity encompasses so many areas of life both on and off the field, then 
there is dealing with the ups and down of the game . . . dealing with the 
media, " said Piazza, who heads to the All-Star game batting .325 with 76 runs 
batted in and 21 home runs.  
</P>
<P>
 "Then you have a little slide and it's such big news. In the minors, it's 
like, so what? But here, you are under a microscope. I'm not complaining, it's 
just an observation. You have to separate yourself from it or mentally it could 
get to you. I can see how it can affect somebody." 
</P>

 Manager Tom Lasorda removed Pedro Astacio from the game for pinch-hitter Chris 
Gwynn in the seventh inning with two out, none on and the Dodgers trailing, 
2-1. Gwynn struck out against the Mets' Bret Saberhagen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Astacio threw a great game, and made one bad pitch," Saberhagen said, 
referring to Rico Brogna's two-run homer in the second inning. "He was probably 
better than I was. He didn't have as many guys on base and he only gave up two 
hits. He had a lot of strikeouts (10) keeping everybody off balance. So it was 
kind of nice to get him out of there after seven."

 Left-handed reliever Brian Barnes was optioned to triple-A Albuquerque to make 
room for Jim Gott, who is expected to return to the bullpen when the team 
begins the second half in Philadelphia on Thursday. The move leaves Omar Daal 
as the only left-hander on the Dodger staff.  
</P>
<P>
 Barnes, who was obtained from the Cleveland Indians on June 16 for minor 
leaguer Eddie Lantigua, gave up four runs and 10 hits in five innings for a 
7.20 earned-run average. MARYANN HUDSON

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; NEGOTIATIONS BEGIN WITH DAVIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels have begun negotiations to retain designated hitter Chili Davis 
through at least the 1996 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, who's on the final year of a two-year contract, is enjoying his finest 
season -- batting .340 with 17 homers and 61 RBIs. Davis, who will earn $3.05 
million this season if he attains 143 more plate appearances, was selected to 
represent the Angels at the All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no secret we'd like to have Chili Davis back," General Manager Bill 
Bavasi said. "He's settling into his niche on this ballclub." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Angel Manager Marcel Lachemann removed closer Joe Grahe in the ninth inning 
Sunday in the 9-6 victory over New York, and is now considering the possibility 
of also using Mark Leiter in that role. 
</P>
<P>
 Grahe, who has saved 12 games in 17 opportunities, struggled for the second 
consecutive game. He entered with a five-run, ninth-inning lead, but after 
yielding three hits and two earned runs, he was pulled for Leiter. Leiter 
retired Paul O'Neill for the final out, and his first save of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Angel left fielder Jim Edmonds was batting .331 a couple of weeks ago, and was 
considered a strong candidate for rookie of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Angels began a four-city, 13-game trip, and Edmonds never has been so 
glad to be going home in his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmonds batted .111 on the trip, going five for 45 with one homer and three 
RBIs, his average dropping 49 points to .282. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never had a trip like this in my life," Edmonds said, "and that's going 
back to Little League. It's not like I'm losing confidence, but now I'm trying 
to survive." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Angel second baseman Harold Reynolds went home to Corvallis, Ore., hoping he 
won't be coming back to Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bavasi said no trades are imminent, and it's unlikely he will release 
Reynolds during the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't understand it," Reynolds said. "It's like all of a sudden, I 
can't play this game. Come on. I know I can play. I just need the chance." BOB

MINOR LEAGUE NOTEBOOK / MIKE DIGIOVANNA: SUTTON MAKES CASE FOR PROMOTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Not that playing in a new stadium in front of capacity crowds or competing for 
the Carolina League Triple Crown isn't nice, but Larry Sutton would give it up 
in a second for a ticket out of Wilmington, Del. 
</P>
<P>
 Sutton won't come right out and say it, but the first baseman from Mater Dei 
High and Illinois believes he should be playing for the Kansas City Royals' 
double-A affiliate at Memphis, Tenn., not Class A Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
 His credentials -- Sutton ranks second in the league in batting (.318), fourth 
in home runs (17) and first in runs batted in (68) -- seem to warrant a 
promotion. 
</P>
<P>
 But when there are talented first basemen ahead of you, and when you're not a 
player the organization has invested loads of money in, you must be patient. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty obvious if I was a first-rounder, with the numbers I have, I 
wouldn't be in Wilmington right now," said Sutton, a 21st-round pick in 1992. 
"Every organization says it doesn't matter where you're drafted, that once 
you're on a team, everything is equal. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's not true. The higher picks get more chances, more times to fail. If 
we fail once or twice, we get cut. I have to put up real good numbers just to 
get noticed." 
</P>
<P>
 You can bet Sutton has turned a few heads this season. After a sub-par year at 
Class A Rockford (Ill.) -- (.269, seven homers, 50 RBIs) -- the 5-foot-11, 
180-pound left-hander has more than doubled his number of home runs, surpassed 
his RBI totals and equaled his number of doubles (24) from 1993 -- in just more 
than half a season. 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps a more telling statistic might be walks. Sutton has only 50 of 
them this season and is on pace to finish under last season's 95 walks. 
Insignificant, you say? Not to Sutton. 
</P>
<P>
 After an excellent professional debut at short-season Class A Eugene (Ore.), 
where Sutton led the Northwest League in homers (15) and RBIs (58) and finished 
fourth in batting (.311) in 1992, Sutton noticed pitchers were handling him 
with a little more caution in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 There were more off-speed pitches on 2-0 and 3-1 counts, and instead of 
jumping on them, Sutton waited for a fastballs. Too often, ball four came 
before a ball he could drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't real aggressive and I got a lot of walks," Sutton said. "But Tom 
Burgess, our roving hitting instructor, sat me down during instructional league 
(last fall) and we had what was like a father-son talk. He told my I'm hitting 
in the No. 3 or 4 hole and I have to be more aggressive, that I couldn't wait 
for fastballs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started working on taking off-speed pitches the other way, and it has 
really helped my approach at the plate. It's amazing what can be accomplished 
when you keep an open mind and you listen." 
</P>
<P>
 Sutton isn't sure how much he'll accomplish in the Royal organization, though. 
The path ahead is clogged with good first basemen -- George Canale is batting 
.300 at Memphis, Joe Vitiello is batting .350 at triple-A Omaha (Neb.) and is 
backed up by former Houston Astro and Baltimore Oriole Glenn Davis, and Wally 
Joyner (.302) and Bob Hamelin (.266, 14 homers) are doing well at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Royals just used their first-round pick (16th overall) on Matt Smith, 
a high school first baseman from Oregon who signed with Kansas City last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It kind of makes you wonder," Sutton said. "I don't know, all I can do is 
play hard where I am now, and hopefully at the end of the year things will 
happen. This is my third year, so Kansas City will either have to protect me 
(on the double-A, triple-A or major league roster) or I go on waivers. I'm 
trying to make people move me." 
</P>

 Eat to win: The question has followed Scott Vollmer from Irvine High to 
Pepperdine to the Chicago White Sox farm system: Is he big enough to handle the 
rigors of catching? 
</P>
<P>
 Now that he has added 10-15 pounds to his 6-foot-1 frame, bulking up to 185, 
Vollmer is finally beginning to put those concerns to rest. So has his play -- 
Vollmer is batting .276 with four homers and a South Atlantic League-leading 65 
RBIs for Class A Hickory, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm starting to hear less about my size," said Vollmer, who weighed 155 in 
high school and 170 when he signed with the White Sox in 1993. "It's still a 
factor, but I definitely feel I'll get bigger because I have every year. I hope 
to put on another 15-20 pounds." 
</P>
<P>
 Vollmer, who helped Pepperdine win the 1992 national championship, underwent a 
strenuous off-season weight-training program and an ambitious calorie 
consumption plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ate anything I could get my hands on, a lot of fruits, pasta, and big 
dinners," Vollmer said. "I just tried to eat all the time. Instead of having 
three meals a day, I'd have three big meals and snacks throughout the day." 
</P>

 Regrets only: The Mujibar and Sirajul national tour, which brought laughs to 
the "Late Show With David Letterman," ended without a stop in Lake Elsinore, 
much to the dismay of officials from the Angels' Class A affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
 The team had extended an invitation to the salesmen-turned-cult heroes to take 
batting practice, work as batboys or groundskeepers or watch a game from the 
dugout. Lockers and uniforms were prepared for the Bangladesh natives, who have 
provided remote feeds from places such as Niagara Falls, Mt. Rushmore and Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I spoke with the Late Show folks, and unfortunately their journey to the 
Grand Canyon (Thursday) was the end of their trip," said Dave Louis, Lake 
Elsinore's assistant general manager. "Our staff is into doing different kinds 
of goofy things, and it would have been a fun way to get publicity." 
</P>
<P>
 The team won't give up in its quest for national exposure, though, and it 
might even target the host of the popular talk show. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're going to see America, you've got to see California, and you've got 
to see a baseball game," Louis said. "Maybe they'll send (Mujibar and Sirajul) 
on a second tour, or maybe we can get Dave out here the next time he's in Los 
Angeles. This was a long shot, but they were very nice to us and said they 
liked our offer, that it just didn't work out."

NEW U.S. CHIEF SIGNALS STAFF SHAKE-UP AT WARNER MUSIC; ENTERTAINMENT: EXPECTED 
PROMOTION OF DOUG MORRIS WILL CULMINATE LONG POWER STRUGGLE AMONG RECORD 
EXECUTIVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHUCK PHILIPS and JAMES BATES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Warner Music Group has promoted Doug Morris, head of its Atlantic division, to 
chief of North American operations, signaling the start of a dramatic shake-up 
at the world's biggest record conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
 The move, which is expected to be announced today, culminates a months-long 
power struggle among the company's executives and is the first step in a 
sweeping realignment at Time Warner's domestic music division, home to such 
superstar acts as Madonna, Metallica and Snoop Doggy Dogg. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris, 54, who in four years transformed the firm's floundering Atlantic 
division into the jewel of the Warner group, will be elevated to president and 
chief operating officer of Warner Music-U.S., the No. 2 position under Warner 
Music Group Chairman Robert Morgado. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see Doug as a bridge connecting the past to the future -- the best bridge 
this company has," said Morgado, whose division has dominated the record 
business for a decade, with $5 billion in global revenue annually and 22.5% of 
all record sales at U.S retail outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a real music man who does not bemoan the fact that the business has 
become more fragmented but looks on that as an opportunity," Morgado said. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris -- a former songwriter whose credits include the Chiffons' 1966 "Sweet 
Talkin' Guy" -- was chosen to head the new division primarily because of his 
strong management record and his skill at discovering talented young 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
 Global revenue at Atlantic is expected to top $900 million in 1994, thanks to 
successful artistic gambles made by Morris' hand-picked stable of young label 
chiefs, including Jimmy Iovine at Interscope, Sylvia Rhone at EastWest, Danny 
Goldberg at Atlantic and Rick Blackburn at Atlantic Nashville. Morris also cut 
profitable deals with half a dozen independent labels and set up such non-music 
ventures as A-Vision Entertainment and Time Warner Audio Books. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris' ascension is expected to set off a chain reaction among senior 
executives and a staff consolidation at Warner record labels on both coasts. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Warner sources speculated that the move was orchestrated in part to 
hasten the departure of key figures at two of the conglomerate's major music 
units, Warner Bros. Records and Elektra Entertainment -- rumors Morgado 
adamantly denies. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the restructuring plan, all American label chiefs will report directly 
to Morris -- including industry legend Mo Ostin, chairman of Warner Bros. 
Records, and Elektra chief Bob Krasnow, whose labels have not performed as well 
as Atlantic's recently. 
</P>
<P>
 The new chain of command is not likely to please either industry veteran, 
especially Ostin, who in January reportedly extended his contract to 1996 after 
reluctantly agreeing to report to Morgado. Before that, Ostin -- whose savvy 
business skills and commitment to artist development have been revered in 
entertainment circles for decades -- operated with autonomy, reporting only to 
Time Warner top brass. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also speculation that Rhone, CEO at EastWest, may take the reins at 
Elektra later this year if the Elektra and EastWest labels are merged, as 
expected. Under that scenario, sources said Krasnow would take on other duties 
within the new Warner Music-U.S. division. Morgado declined to comment; Ostin 
and Krasnow did not return calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said Ahmet Ertegun will continue as chairman of the Atlantic Group and 
that Goldberg will retain the title of president at the label until 1995, when 
he is expected to be elevated to Atlantic Records chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first concrete changes expected under the restructuring plan is 
that Warner Music Group will purchase the 50% interest in Interscope Records 
that Atlantic doesn't own, from Iovine and his partner Ted Field. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a rescue mission here," Morgado said. "Warner Music is the 
strongest company in the business, but we don't want to become complacent. I 
chose Doug because he has what it takes to guide us through this transition as 
we attempt to refocus our energies in the U.S." 
</P>
<P>
 The promotion is a sweet reward for Morris, a longtime Atlantic insider who 
cooled his heels for years awaiting his chance. He finally got it in 1990 when 
Morgado gave Atlantic what amounts to an ultimatum to improve.  
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Atlantic was considered an industry dinosaur that was living off 
an aging catalogue of music from such former top groups as Led Zeppelin and 
Crosby, Stills & Nash. 
</P>
<P>
 Although sharing the title of chairman and chief executive with Atlantic 
founder Ertegun, Morris was given the management authority. 
</P>
<P>
 After suffering a loss in 1991, in part because of some of the initial 
long-term investments Morris was making, the company rebounded in 1992 and 1993 
to become one of music's biggest success stories. Industry sources have 
estimated the company's revenue jumped from $400 million in 1991 to about $750 
million in 1993.

TOKYO STOCKS FALL SLIGHTLY IN LIGHT TRADING; MARKETS: DROP IS SEEN AS A MILD 
REACTION TO CONCERNS ABOUT THE YEN, NORTH KOREA'S FUTURE AND LACKLUSTER G-7 
RESULTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Stocks declined in early trading here today on worries about the yen's 
strength against the dollar, the death of North Korean President Kim Il Sung 
and lackluster results from the Naples, Italy, summit of industrialized 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim's death, announced Saturday, and the Group of Seven summit, which ended 
Sunday, "both were negative" for Tokyo markets "but not tremendously," said 
Keith Donaldson, equity strategist at Salomon Bros. Asia. "The real crux of the 
matter still is the yen" and whether it will continue to gain in value against 
the U.S. dollar, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 225-stock Nikkei index fell 67.12 points, or 0.3%, to close the morning 
today at 20,459.39 in light trading. "The market is likely to stay cautious as 
players try to gauge the effects of a leadership change in North Korea," said 
Shigeyoshi Fujita, general manager at Cosmo Securities. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar, meanwhile, was trading at midmorning today at 98.32 yen, down 0.21 
yen from Friday's Tokyo close but up 0.22 yen from Friday's close in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point earlier today, the dollar hit a new worldwide low of 97.60 yen in 
Sydney, Australia. It also dipped to 97.90 yen in the Tokyo market this morning 
before recovering some ground on the strength of intervention by the Bank of 
Japan in support of the yen. The dollar closed morning trading at 98.37 yen, 
down 0.16 yen from Friday's Tokyo close but up 0.27 yen from Friday's close in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The death of Kim "raises the specter of some political instability for the 
region," Donaldson said, "but I don't think people are overly concerned."  
</P>
<P>
 The impact on the Tokyo stock market is also limited, he said, by the tendency 
of investors to treat the dollar as a "safe haven" during times of 
international instability. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as there's no more negative news from Korea, the (value of the) yen 
is more likely to have an impact on the (stock) market than North Korea," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim's death may be seen as a negative factor for the Tokyo stock market 
because it ends hopes for an early summit meeting between the presidents of 
North Korea and South Korea, and could delay other efforts to ease tensions 
over Pyongyang's nuclear program, said Geoffrey Barker, an analyst at Baring 
Securities Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
 But there also is a "compensating factor" in that there may be "a period of 
introversion in North Korea," he said. "I would think that having a fight with 
the United States or pushing the nuclear issue would go on the back burner for 
a while. So I think this is not a key point. We're not going to need to worry 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
 The G-7 summit in Naples was marked by "an immense amount of complacency" by 
the various leaders, but its limited results produced "very little 
disappointment in the markets because there was so little expectation," Barker 
said. "The Japanese market is off a little, but we're not talking about major 
disappointment."

DISNEY PARKS' NEW THEME: UNCERTAINTY; GROWTH PLANS MEET PROTESTS, RECESSION, 
DECLINING TOURISM 
</P>

 While the audience inside Washington's Uptown Theater was voicing its 
resounding approval of Walt Disney Co.'s new animated feature, "The Lion King," 
company Chairman Michael Eisner was getting a very different reception outside: 
100 sign-toting demonstrators were chanting "Disney go home!" 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of the recent protest was to urge Eisner to shelve plans for the 
controversial Disney's America theme park near their homes in suburban 
Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 The homeowners are being joined by an unlikely coalition of civil rights 
groups, farmers and historians such as C. Vann Woodward, who denounces the way 
"Disney and its Hollywood investors" want to commercialize ground that has 
"soaked up more of the blood, sweat and tears of American history than any 
other place in the country."

<P>
 The troubles in Virginia point up the mess that is being made of what Eisner 
proclaimed would be "The Disney Decade" of new and expanded theme parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Tinkerbell's wand continues to work magic on the company's animated movies and 
its forays into enterprises as diverse as the Broadway production of "Beauty 
and the Beast" and the Mighty Ducks hockey team. But the theme parks--although 
they are still growing--are hardly the happiest places on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 * In Southern California, the company disclosed last month that it will wait 
until at least next year to decide whether to build a $3-billion resort next to 
Disneyland in Anaheim. That project is already two years behind its original 
schedule, and Disney says it remains too financially risky to build. 
</P>
<P>
 * In France, the troubled Euro Disney project has fallen $1 billion in the red 
since its opening in April, 1992, and the losses there are continuing to pile 
up. Disney, whose half-share in the project cost it $514 million last year 
alone, is hoping to reduce its exposure by arranging for a Saudi prince to help 
bankroll the park. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Florida, construction has yet to begin on a fourth theme park. The park 
was reportedly going to be a newfangled zoo, but it ran into opposition from 
environmentalists concerned about an existing turtle habitat. A group of them 
picketed a Disney annual meeting dressed in turtle costumes. Disney responded 
by creating a "wilderness preserve" on its vast Florida holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 And while Disney shifts gears between expansion projects, attendance at 
Disneyland in Anaheim and Walt Disney World in Florida has been sagging. 
</P>
<P>
 The two parks have responded by encouraging older workers to retire and by 
investing in lavish new rides and attractions. For the first time, however, 
they face strong competition from the Universal Studios and Six Flags theme 
parks, and also from new family-friendly gambling resorts in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 The one continuing bright spot is something in which the company has no 
significant ownership interest: Tokyo Disneyland. That is owned by a Japanese 
company that pays licensing and other fees to Disney but keeps the bulk of the 
profits for itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney officials say they expect attendance at the company's parks to rise as 
the U.S. and European economies improve. They also say the stops and starts of 
the new theme park developments are normal for projects of so large a scope. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to be very patient in this industry and be a long-term player," 
Disney theme park division President Judson C. Green said. He noted that from 
conception to opening day, Euro Disney took about a decade to create. 
</P>
<P>
 The theme park troubles are disappointing, but they are substantially less 
important to Disney's bottom line than they were a decade ago. When Eisner took 
over in 1984, the parks accounted for more than three-quarters of Disney's 
operating profit. Last year, the division contributed less than half, or only 
13% if Euro Disney losses are included. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Eisner: "Theme parks are still very important to us." Industry observers 
agree, but they note that the parks are stable, mature businesses with less 
opportunity to grow than other endeavors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will become a smaller part of the mix," predicted Jessica Reif, who tracks 
entertainment companies for the New York brokerage Oppenheimer & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 There was nothing small about Disney's vision for its theme parks in the 
1980s, when there seemed to be a never-ending parade of free-spending baby 
boomers and their eager-to-be-entertained offspring streaming through the 
gates. 
</P>
<P>
 Such demand allowed Disneyland prices--now $31 for an adult pass--to rise 14 
times during the past decade. Eisner proclaimed "The Disney Decade" and vowed 
to build four new theme parks by the year 2000--two in Europe, one in Florida 
and one in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the world changed. First came the Persian Gulf War in 1991, bringing 
international tourism to a standstill. It was followed by recession and 
disasters in California and Florida. Tourists shied away from Southern 
California after the Los Angeles riots and earthquake. Florida became better 
known for Hurricane Andrew and as a place where tourists are slain than as a 
holiday haven. 
</P>
<P>
 As demand fell, Disney took the rare step of laying off about 300 park 
workers. Equally unprecedented have been discounts, which appear not to have 
led to substantial rises in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 Through it all, Disney has continued to invest in new attractions at its 
parks. This summer, for instance, a new "Twilight Zone Tower of 
Terror"--featuring a drop down an elevator shaft--made its debut in Florida. 
Disneyland has a new parade this summer, and a big new ride is planned for next 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Other entertainment giants, meanwhile, have been angling to catch part of the 
Disney franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 MCA's Universal Studios division is planning a huge resort in Florida and has 
already seen big gains from its "Back to the Future" rides on both coasts. Time 
Warner's Six Flags parks, which include Magic Mountain in Valencia, have spent 
lavishly on new roller coasters. 
</P>
<P>
 Las Vegas has seen the opening of the first theme park on the Strip at Kirk 
Kerkorian's MGM Grand Hotel, and other new resorts have also spent generously 
on entertainment for children. 
</P>
<P>
 Against this backdrop, only one of the four parks laid out as part of Eisner's 
Disney decade was built: Euro Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans for a second park in France are on hold while investors, bankers and 
Disney try to stave off further damage at Euro Disney. There is no word yet on 
the new Florida park. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as it appeared Disney might be abandoning all its plans, it turned its 
attention to yet another project: the history theme park that would be built 35 
miles west of downtown Washington in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, Disney had a project it actually wanted to build. And it was easy to see 
one reason: At $650 million, Disney's America is a bargain compared to the cost 
of building California and European resorts. 
</P>
<P>
 First, though, Disney must conquer protesters such as Virginian Sylvia Gilman. 
She grouses that "the red carpet gets rolled out everywhere" when Eisner comes 
to town, and "I wish somebody would listen to me when I say we don't want this 
park." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the historians, and even some in Congress, who say they are 
worried about the park's proximity to Civil War battlefields. The site is five 
miles from the Manassas National Battlefield Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want them to put a theme park there and destroy real history," said 
Richard Moe, president of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the critics, Eisner says, are exclusionists bent on stopping all 
development in Prince William County, Va. "They have a right to their opinion. 
I just think they are overly sensitive," he said, adding that the opposition 
took him by surprise.  
</P>
<P>
 "Had we known there was going to be a public relations issue here, we would 
have prepared more," Eisner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the trouble encountered in Virginia, the experience raises questions as 
to whether Disney--or any major theme park company--will be able to build a 
large-scale resort in the future without significant opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 But industry experts say to give it time; they believe the Disney touch is 
still intact. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe they will hold their appeal for a couple of decades if the Disney 
organization is as innovative as they have been," said George Wade, a veteran 
amusement executive. Lagging Theme Parks 
</P>
<P>
 Though the Walt Disney Co.'s theme parks are still growing, the division has 
accounted for less and less of Disney's total operating income and revenue 
during the past 10 years primarily because of the stellar performance of 
Disney's film and video business. 03,22,07,07 1984 1993 REVENUE Theme parks 75%

 Cheese Recalled for Listeria Threat: A California company is recalling 
thousands of packages of goat milk cheese because they may contain the 
life-threatening bacteria.Anyone who purchased Cypress Grove Chevre between 
early May and June 22 is asked to not eat the cheese and to return it to the 
store where it was purchased. Refunds will be given. The cheese was sold 
primarily in California, but contaminated shipments may also have gone to 
Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, Oregon and 
Texas. The Food and Drug Administration discovered that some of the cheese was 
not pasteurized long enough.

 Coffee Crops Hit Again: Frost struck farms in southern Minas Gerais, Brazil's 
biggest coffee-growing state, and growers said the effects were harsher than 
the freeze that hit the area two weeks ago.Coffee prices soared after the 
previous cold snap, called the worst frost there in more than a decade. Brazil 
is the largest coffee producer in the world, and any threat to its crop 
dramatically affects world coffee prices. An official at a coffee cooperative 
confirmed there had been heavy frost but said it was too early to make a 
specific estimate of damage.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ENTERPRISE; PUBLIC BROADCASTING INTERACTS WITH SHOPPERS; 
RETAIL: NONPROFIT STATIONS SEE A NEW SOURCE OF REVENUE IN PARTNERSHIPS WITH 
FOR-PROFIT ENTERPRISES. CRITICS SEE IT AS SELLING OUT.

<P>
 Last fall, Store of Knowledge opened an outlet in the Glendale Galleria. On 
its heels in the spring came Learningsmith Inc. at the Beverly Center and South 
Coast Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 In coming months, other Southern California shopping malls are likely to 
become the settings for a unique competition involving for-profit enterprise 
and nonprofit public broadcasting. Both the Store of Knowledge and 
Learningsmith chains offer an array of entertaining, interactive instructional 
materials for children and have attracted legions of fans among baby boomer 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Store of Knowledge is owned by Los Angeles' KCET-TV, Carson-based Lakeshore 
Learning Inc. and the Los Angeles venture capital firm Riordan, Lewis & Haden. 
</P>
<P>
 Learningsmith is jointly owned by Boston's WGBH public television station and 
venture capitalists. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say the stores, which also sell items such as tote bags and coffee 
mugs bearing the stations' logos, are further proof that public broadcasting 
has gone commercial. Broadcasting executives counter that the stores are an 
efficient way for the stations to augment decreasing government and public 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
 They also say the stores help them fulfill their core mission of fostering 
lifelong learning. They can do that more effectively, they argue, by helping to 
make educational books, videos, games and toys available. 
</P>
<P>
 "The world is changing, and (public broadcasting is) changing with it," said 
Maria Eitel, a spokeswoman for the Washington-based Corporation for Public 
Broadcasting, which is urging affiliated stations to explore joint ventures 
with for-profit partners. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the advantage to companies that link up with respected public 
broadcasters, Learningsmith's marketing director, Ken Zuckerman, said, "We look 
at the affiliation as sort of a Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The broadcasters' stated goals of fostering education and reducing their 
dependence on the public purse leave some critics unmollified. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they're engaging in blatant advertising for consumer goods, they're 
cashing in on their credibility and their non-commercial status," said Karen 
Brown, research director for the Washington-based Center for Study of 
Commercialism. "We see it as part of a disturbing trend: the privatization and 
commercialization of public broadcasting." 
</P>
<P>
 As broadcasters and detractors argue, consumers are flocking to stores that 
were designed to keep pace with some of the most successful retailers. 
Learningsmith's South Coast Plaza store, for example, has at times drawn bigger 
crowds than the Disney Store next- door. 
</P>
<P>
 Learningsmith describes its outlets as "general stores for the curious mind" 
where "learning specialists" invite customers to test-drive computer programs 
and leaf through books. 
</P>
<P>
 Store of Knowledge boasts that it has "culled the best of the best from 
bookstores, computer stores, video stores and toy stores," said Laura Wynne, 
Store of Knowledge's chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
 The stores are in the right place at the right time, said Tony Cherbak, a 
retail industry expert with Deloitte & Touche in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "Education is in vogue right now, especially when it's interactive, which is 
increasingly important when it comes to getting kids to learn," Cherbak said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's no accident that the two chains hooked up with public broadcasters. 
Executives at both Learningsmith and Store of Knowledge said public 
broadcasting supporters are better-educated and boast higher incomes than the 
national average. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebecca Sultan has ordered by mail from Learningsmith's Boston store, which 
opened in 1992. "I'm so glad they opened in Orange County. It's just an 
incredible store," she said while browsing with her children. 
</P>
<P>
 Learningsmith's Beverly Center and South Coast Plaza stores are affiliated 
with KUSC-FM, a public radio station owned by USC. In October, the chain plans 
to add a store in San Diego that will not be affiliated with a local station. 
</P>
<P>
 Learningsmith also operates stores with WNET-TV in New York, WETA-TV in 
Washington and WCNY-TV in Syracuse, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike KUSC, which accepts royalty payments in return for its Learningsmith 
affiliation, KCET has taken an equity stake in Store of Knowledge. KCET's 
managers say the station's for-profit partners put up the cash to open stores 
and that the deal will not expose the station to undue financial risk. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Retail is a tough game, but we really like the unique nature of this," said 
Pat Haden, a former Los Angeles Rams star and a principal with Riordan, Lewis & 
Haden, which once counted Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan as a principal. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm also knew that Thrifty Drug Chairman Emeritus Leonard Straus, a KCET 
board member who helped define the store's concept, "was extremely optimistic 
about its future," Haden said. 
</P>
<P>
 Store of Knowledge plans to open an outlet at Fashion Island in Newport Beach 
in October, and stores are also planned for Santa Monica, San Diego and the 
Inland Empire. Store of Knowledge says it hopes to eventually have as many as 
100 stores nationwide.

 $3 Billion Sought From Capital Markets: Vietnam is planning to tap 
international capital markets for the first time in order to raise capital in 
the years ahead, according to a senior Finance Ministry official. "From selling 
government bonds, we hope to raise between $2 billion and $3 billion by the 
year 2000," said treasury official Le Thi Bang Tam. The government wants to 
raise a total of $50 billion by 2000 to invest in factories, power plants and 
infrastructure to help it double gross domestic product while sustaining an 
annual growth rate of 8% to 10%.

 Stake in Qantas to Be Sold: The government will sell its 75% stake in the 
national airline through a public stock flotation in the first half of next 
year, Finance Minister Kim Beazley said. The float, expected to raise about 
$1.5 billion, was first announced in June, 1992, and was originally scheduled 
for the fiscal year ended last month. But Qantas Airways' weak performance and 
a lackluster aviation market forced the government last year to reschedule the 
sale for 1994-95.

offices of the company's headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been growing faster than we expected and don't have enough space," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 So fast that after only two years in Japan, Compaq K.K. must move to larger 
quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese personal computer companies have watched their sales slump in the 
sluggish Japanese economy. But Compaq, Apple and other U.S. computer makers are 
finding eager consumers in the world's second-largest computer market. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, American companies' share of the Japanese PC market climbed from 
15.1% to 24.2%, according to Dataquest, a market research firm. Each has taken 
a different route to higher sales, but together they have profoundly changed 
Japan's PC market. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an anxious time for Japan's computer industry," says Takahiko Umeyama, 
an analyst for market researcher IDC Japan Ltd. "It needs to change because of 
the foreign vendors, but the changes are very difficult to make." 
</P>
<P>
 Several factors are weakening the once-invincible claim Japanese PC makers had 
on their home turf. Since cheaper American PCs were introduced in Japan two 
years ago, computer prices have dropped more than 60%. Japanese makers, who 
once were able to keep prices high by splintering the domestic market with 
non-compatible designs, are shifting to the worldwide IBM standard. Dealers and 
distributors once wed to a single maker have begun selling other brands, 
including imports. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's market still has plenty of room for growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The average Japanese office has 10 PCs per 100 employees, contrasted with 
about 42 per 100 in the United States, IDC says. If wapuro -- the dedicated 
word processors used widely to handle Japan's complex writing system -- are 
included, the total is 16 machines per 100 workers. 
</P>
<P>
 But as PC prices drop, Japanese are beginning to buy computers to replace the 
word processors. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest winner so far has been Apple. 
</P>
<P>
 Apple entered the Japanese market in 1983 but for years languished with 
expatriate managers, high prices and an exclusive distribution network. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought it was the same market as the United States and tried selling the 
same computers," says John Floisand, president of Apple Pacific and acting 
president of Apple Japan Inc. "It took us until 1988 to discover what it took 
in terms of Japanese-language application software." 
</P>
<P>
 Macintosh sales began taking off in 1989 when a new Japanese management team 
signed up dozens of new dealers, introduced an improved Japanese-language 
operating system and encouraged development of Japanese software. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo's Akihabara electronics retailing district, it is now the rare shop 
that does not display the Apple logo. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, Apple has 3,000 resellers. That's still far short of market leader 
NEC Corp.'s 8,000 outlets. NEC's proprietary models still dominate the market 
with a 52.8% share -- a slip of 0.6 percentage point from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But Apple's market share rose from 8.3% to 13.9% last year, displacing Fujitsu 
as the second-largest PC supplier, Dataquest says. IBM Japan, meanwhile, 
wrested fourth place from Toshiba with 6.7%.

 Automotive Blueprint Published: The government unveiled its plan for 
developing an automotive industry that can satisfy demand for car ownership by 
the country's 300 million families, targeting a 90% market share for 
Chinese-based plants by the end of the century. The long-awaited Automotive 
Industry Policy, approved by Premier Li Peng in March and published in the 
People's Daily last week, calls for removal of obstacles to private car 
ownership and introduces measures severely limiting foreign access to the huge 
market. The policy restricts car imports to six ports of entry and rules that 
the number and type of foreign cars bought must be approved by the State 
Council, China's Cabinet.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: 'JUST VOTE NO' CAMPAIGN SENDS BOARD A MESSAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With just $137 million in annual sales and 6.8 million shares outstanding, MDT 
Corp. seems a small and unlikely target for shareholder activists. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the Torrance-based maker of medical equipment sterilizers finds its 
directors facing a no-confidence vote -- and by some heavyweight investors -- 
at the firm's July 20 annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The central characters in this battle are a 33-year-old upstart money manager 
and a well-entrenched chairman nearly twice his challenger's age. The fight 
also highlights an increasingly popular strategy among unhappy investors who 
want to send a strong message to corporate management but do not wish to oust 
those in charge -- yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Shapiro, a San Francisco-based money manager who owns 2.3% of MDT's 
shares, fired off a letter to other shareholders July 1 asking them to withhold 
their votes for MDT's board as a sign of protest. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro contends that MDT has been floundering and that the six-man board of 
directors has been little more than a rubber stamp, in his words, on 
ineffective management. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, MDT's co-founder and chairman, J. Miles Branagan, thinks 
Shapiro is wrong on all counts. Branagan argues that MDT's problems -- 
slow-growing sales for the past two years and weak earnings for the past five 
-- have largely been a function of health care reform fallout and MDT's 
digestion of a major acquisition in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, insists Branagan, 61, his directors don't need a wake-up call 
from Shapiro. "Our board is way out front in this regard," Branagan said in 
reference to the need to redirect MDT and restore earnings growth. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least two other MDT shareholders, the California Public Employees 
Retirement System and the California State Teachers Retirement System, say they 
will join Shapiro in withholding their votes for MDT's board. Although both 
retirement funds are well-known as activist shareholders, it is still fairly 
rare for them to vote against management. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro, whose Lawndale Capital Management oversees $9.5 million for clients 
in two "hedge" funds, says he's new to the ranks of activist shareholders. He 
says he has owned MDT stock for five years and has watched the price fall from 
a peak of $15.13 in 1989 to $5 now as earnings have been erratic. 
</P>
<P>
 MDT had that peak performance in 1989, when it earned $4.3 million, or 83 
cents a share. Since then, the company's best year has been fiscal 1993 (ended 
March 31 of that year), when it earned 38 cents a share. For the most recent 
fiscal year, earnings declined again, to $1.9 million, or 29 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
 "I finally had to say enough is enough," Shapiro said, explaining his decision 
to oppose MDT's board. He contends that the ultimate blame for the stock's 
weakness must lie with the directors, who run the company on shareholders' 
behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 "My concern is that the board has been inactive and not diligent in exercising 
oversight of management," Shapiro said.  
</P>
<P>
 Yet he also admits that he does not have specific recommendations for 
re-energizing MDT. He notes that the company is one of the leaders in medical 
equipment sterilization and said the issue is not MDT's technology but its 
ability to translate its know-how into rising sales and earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not seeking control or to put forth an alternate slate of directors," 
Shapiro said. Rather, he said, by withholding votes for the board, shareholders 
"can send a message to directors to get their act in gear." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of withholding votes at director elections has increasingly been 
embraced by shareholder activists who want to make a point about corporate 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph A. Grundfest, a law professor at Stanford University and former member 
of the Securities and Exchange Commission, championed vote withholding in an 
April, 1993, article for the Stanford Law Review. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Just Vote No: A Minimalist Strategy for Dealing With Barbarians Inside the 
Gates," Grundfest said that withholding votes for directors will never be 
anything more than symbolic, because the nature of corporate board elections is 
such that victory for management is nearly always assured. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Grundfest wrote, "symbols . . . have consequences. The resultant 
negative publicity can sharply reduce the prestige associated with serving on a 
target corporation's board, thereby providing an impetus for incumbent 
directors to improve corporate performance." 
</P>
<P>
 Branagan insists that MDT has been hamstrung for the past two years by the 
health care reform debate, which he said has frozen many potential buyers of 
MDT's medical sterilization equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, Branagan contends, MDT's and competitors' efforts to bring out 
new technology for medical equipment sterilization have been constrained by 
tighter federal regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 What about the 1989-to-1992 period, before health care reform efforts caught 
fire? Branagan concedes that MDT could have done a better job of a 
restructuring program it undertook in that period, after a major 1988 
acquisition that overnight took the company from $12 million in annual sales to 
$70 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the execution, we could have done it better," he said. But he maintains 
that management always acted in what it believed was shareholders' best 
interests. And he notes that he and his family have 5.5% of MDT stock and thus 
a major stake in what happens. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the failed search for a chief operating officer, Branagan said "we 
talked to many candidates," but none met all of MDT's requirements. The search 
was called off six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Of Shapiro's vote-withholding campaign, Branagan said simply, "We respect 
their right to do what they've done." But he regards it as wasted effort, 
because he insists that MDT's board had already acted to improve the company's 
flagging results. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 22, Branagan notes, MDT announced a hiring and pay freeze and said it 
would undertake a program to further control spending, cut inventory and lower 
the company's break-even point. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the company isn't for sale, but that "there are very significant and 
meaningful steps underway to accomplish the objectives" set forth in February. 
He declined to be specific but said the plan "will be announced in due course." 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro, however, said he will continue to search for shareholder support in 
his "just vote no" campaign. Despite Branagan's efforts to convince him 
otherwise, Shapiro said, "this management needs to have a fire lit under them."

BOY, 5, WOUNDED, 3 TEENS ARRESTED IN GANG SHOOTING; VIOLENCE: A MAN FIRES AT A 
PASSING CAR BUT MISSES, STRIKING A CHILD PLAYING IN A DRIVEWAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A 5-year-old boy playing in his driveway was shot and wounded Sunday when a 
neighbor fired at a passing car and accidentally hit the youngster in what 
police described as a gang-related incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Three teen-agers were later arrested less than a block away. 
</P>
<P>
 "It happened really fast," said Miguel Rosales, 19, who witnessed the shooting 
from across the street. "When we saw it, we all went down. I was really 
scared." 
</P>
<P>
 According to witnesses and police, the incident occurred shortly before 6 p.m. 
in the 2200 block of West Pomona Street when a resident ran out of his house 
near the intersection of Pomona and Townsend streets and began firing at a car 
as it swerved around the corner. One of the bullets missed the car and hit the 
boy as he stood playing in his driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a through-and-through wound in the lower back," Sgt. A.J. Levatino of 
the Santa Ana Police Department said. "Doctors consider it a superficial 
wound." 
</P>
<P>
 The boy was taken to UCI Medical Center, Levatino said, where he was resting 
comfortably with his parents and was expected to be released Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 While police declined to identify the boy, family members and neighbors 
identified him as Jonathan Garcia, 5. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just fell on the ground," said Joseph Garcia, Jonathan's 9-year-old 
brother. "Then my mom picked him up and called the cops." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they arrested two men, ages 18 and 19, as well as a 16-year-old 
girl in connection with the shooting a short time later. According to police, 
one of the three was suspected of being the neighbor who fired at the passing 
car and two others later joined him. 
</P>
<P>
 "We stopped them in a car and took them into custody," Levatino said. He 
declined to identify the three, saying that they were being questioned. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they had not been able to identify any of the occupants of the car 
that was fired on, Levatino said, adding that investigators believe the 
incident was related to local gang activity. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday night, as investigators cordoned off the area in a search for 
evidence, concerned neighbors huddled on the sidewalks. The area, many said, 
has long been plagued by gang activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like there's a drive-by shooting every other weekend," said Juanita 
Nava, 29, who lives nearby with her three children. "It's scary.

CHARTING HIS OWN COURSE; FOR FERRY CAPTAIN AND MUSICIAN, 9-TO-5 ROUTINE CAN 
WAIT

 Scott Woods graduated Phi Beta Kappa from a prestigious university and speaks 
four languages. But instead of trying for a high-powered job, he spends his 
days piloting the Balboa Island Ferry back and forth across 300 yards of water. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He does it, he says, to stay in the outdoors and keep his nights open for gigs 
with his surf punk band, "Just Plain Big."  
</P>
<P>
 "People always ask me if I get bored," Woods said, glistening waves reflecting 
off his black sunglasses. "Naah. I make lists in my head. Sometimes I think 
about what I have to do after work. I read a lot. I listen to National Public 
Radio in the morning to keep my brain active. 
</P>
<P>
 "You meet interesting people on the boat, plus you meet regulars and chat a 
little bit." 
</P>
<P>
 Woods is one of 27 captains who skipper the Balboa Island Ferry on its quick, 
scenic route across a narrow channel linking Balboa Island with the Balboa 
peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6 each morning, the 28-year-old Balboa Island native maneuvers the ferry 
toward the peninsula. At 6:03, he shuttles morning commuters and fishermen back 
through the mist, to the dock where he started. It's the first of about 50 
round trips he makes during a typical Orange County summer day. 
</P>
<P>
 Piloting ferries has long been a summer job for the county's 
maritime-inclined, ever since the service started in 1909. Some use it as a 
steppingstone to becoming captains of large ships, operations manager John 
Mehan said; for others, it's a fun way to get a paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
 Mehan said about 2 1/2-million people ride the ferries each year. Three-fifths 
of them use it from June through September. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the 75th year that the Beek family has operated the ferries. Pioneer 
developer Joseph A. Beek won the bid to operate the ferry in 1919. 
</P>
<P>
 The boats, late-1950s models, can carry as many as 100 people from the 
flower-draped pastel cottages of Balboa Island to the Ferris wheel and carousel 
rides at the Balboa Fun Zone. Pedestrians pay 25 cents each trip and motorists 
pay 65 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Driving the 64-foot boats can be repetitive, but there have been memorable 
incidents in ferry lore: In 1989, an Irvine woman drove off the ferry by 
accident and plunged into the bay (she and a passenger escaped serious injury); 
and Woods said a sailboat once crashed into a ferry he was piloting when the 
sailboat's skipper wasn't paying attention to traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods started working on the boats while he was attending Corona del Mar High 
School, and continued on vacations during his four years at Stanford 
University. He earned a master's degree in 1991 from the Fletcher School of Law 
and Diplomacy at Tufts University. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he studied Latin American history in college and toured South America 
for four months. He also studied in Luxembourg and Spain, and found time to 
learn Spanish, Portuguese and French. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods hooked onto the ferry for the same reason most other teen-agers have: 
His friends worked there and it was an outdoor job with flexible hours. 
</P>
<P>
 But 12 years after he started as a coin collector on the boats and later moved 
up to captain, Woods still spends his summer days shuttling teen-age 
roller-skaters and couples holding hands across the channel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do love being out here, but if I didn't have a band I wouldn't still be 
doing it," Woods said. His band, Just Plain Big, has played at local venues 
like Club Mesa and Club 5902. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with Woods and another fellow ferry captain who plays guitar, the 
vocals-driven band counts a salesman and pizza delivery driver among its surf 
trunk-wearing members. Woods credits bands such as The Beach Boys and X as 
influences. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have two sides to me, I guess," said Woods, who got his first drum set at 
age 12. "There's the serious academic side . . . and then there's the beach and 
music side too." 
</P>
<P>
 After he clocked in six years of heavy-duty studying, do his parents wonder 
what he's doing with his education? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah," Woods said, sliding a triangular wooden block under a Ford Bronco's 
wheel to keep it from shifting on the ferry. "They look at it from the sense 
that entertainment is a hit-or-miss thing. They don't want to see me do this 
year upon year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people think it's a phase, but it's an opportunity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods lived in Boston during his two years at the Fletcher School, but the 
East Coast didn't feel like home. "I like the beach and surfing," Woods said. 
"I was a bit out of my element." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's beaches and friends drew him back. "I didn't move back here to 
start up another band, but it just happened," said Woods, who wrote facetiously 
in a Stanford publication his senior year that his goal was to become a punk 
rock musician. 
</P>
<P>
 If his band doesn't become successful, Woods hopes to someday go into the 
import-export business with South American companies. Then there's his dream of 
opening a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no formula for success in what I'm doing," Woods said. "At one point, 
I could've gone to law school. For that, the path is clear. But in this, 
there's no one way to success -- it's timing. You try a lot of different things 
and hope one works."

VISITING LIFEGUARDS LEFT HIGH AND DRY; CRIME: STOLEN SAFE HELD PASSPORTS AND 
AIRLINE TICKETS FOR 25 TEENS FROM NEW ZEALAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Suddenly minus their airline tickets and passports, a group of visiting New 
Zealand teen-agers spent an uneasy Sunday wondering how they would get back to 
their South Pacific home. 
</P>
<P>
 The 25 junior lifeguards on a two-week stay in Orange County are the victims 
of thieves who broke into the Huntington Beach junior lifeguard office south of 
the pier early Saturday and stole a cash box and a safe. 
</P>
<P>
 The cash box contained about $4,000, most of it in checks that were later 
found discarded in two Huntington Beach parking lots. But the 100-pound safe 
contained 11 of the teens' passports and 14 of their airline tickets; all of 
which will have to be replaced -- at an estimated cost of $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just can't believe somebody did this," said Dave Simcox, the coordinator of 
the Huntington Beach Junior Lifeguard program. "I know there is vandalism in 
New Zealand and all over the world. But these vandals don't realize what they 
do affects other people and their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Simcox said his junior lifeguard program would pay to replace the passports 
and tickets. It will cost $69 for each new passport and United Airlines has 
agreed to charge $50 to replace each ticket, which cost about $1,500 apiece, 
Simcox said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids started to get upset, but we're not going to allow that," said 
Simcox, a health science teacher and swimming coach at Foothill High School 
during the school year. "We're not going to let this ruin their trip." 
</P>
<P>
 A maintenance worker discovered the break-in about 1:30 a.m. Saturday. Someone 
had kicked in the door of a double-wide trailer that is the temporary junior 
lifeguard headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huntington Beach junior lifeguard program has expanded so rapidly -- this 
year there's an estimated 850 youths signed up -- that the trailer had to be 
brought in as an office, Simcox said. The program trains youths who are too 
young to become lifeguards and allows them to work on the beach in support 
positions without pay. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of its annual festivities, the program sponsored a cookout and beach 
party for Friday night for the junior lifeguards and the New Zealanders. The 
event brought hundreds of youths and their parents to the beach near the 
trailer, Simcox said. 
</P>
<P>
 The heavy, metal safe has a combination lock, so whoever took it might not 
have yet been able to open it, Simcox said. 
</P>
<P>
 The theft was the first negative note on the New Zealanders' stay, according 
to Kara Johan, whose 14-year-old son participates in the Huntington Beach 
program. The visitors have spent a week in the county, staying with local 
families and training with the Huntington Beach junior lifeguards, and are 
scheduled to leave Friday, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kids helped make five rescues last week while assigned to towers and 
the jeeps," said Johan, 44, an Orange resident. "Today was supposed to be their 
off day. But I have one of the New Zealand junior guards sitting on my patio 
looking forlorn right now." 
</P>
<P>
 The visitors, all 14- to 16-year-olds, will have to postpone a trip to 
Catalina Island scheduled today and instead spend a day at the New Zealand 
Embassy in Los Angeles. They need to get their passports back quickly because, 
without them, the teens lack identification to cash their traveler's checks, 
Johan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see what anybody could do with those passports, they're for 
14-year-olds, not adults," Johan said.

STREET SMART / NORA ZAMICHOW: THE NEW DMV TEST MIGHT DRIVE YOU A LITTLE CRAZY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 You've borrowed your aunt's car. You've been waiting 45 minutes in 100-degree 
heat to take your driving test, worrying about whether you can parallel park. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the Department of Motor Vehicles examiner steps into your car, 
your palms make slime tracks on the steering wheel and your shirt is glued to 
your back. 
</P>
<P>
 Start the engine. Pull out of the parking lot. Turn left. Turn right. Blinkers 
on, speed is under the limit. You're doing fine -- until the examiner orders 
the unexpected: "Get on the freeway." 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in more than 60 years, the Department of Motor Vehicles has 
devised a new road test for driver's license applicants, which includes many a 
motorist's nightmare: freeway driving. (The written portion of the driver's 
test has been updated about every five years.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I was expecting her to make me do a three-point turn on a turnabout, or 
parallel park," sighed Erica Garrison, an 18-year-old Montebello student who 
recently failed her first try at the new driving test. "This was difficult. " 
</P>
<P>
 The new test -- which is called an exam, not a test -- is completely different 
from the old one. It is the difference between having toast and coffee for 
breakfast or a mega-meal of eggs, bacon, muffins, juice and hash browns. 
</P>
<P>
 The test time, for instance, has more than doubled to a whopping 27 minutes. 
It starts before you turn the key in the ignition. Now you've got to answer a 
lengthy pre-drive pop quiz on equipment. Fail more than three of the important 
items on the checklist and you are disqualified. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the new test takes you up hills and down, through business and 
residential areas, on quiet streets and on the freeway. Your examiner watches 
how you change lanes, what type of stop you make when you pull up to an 
intersection, and whether you adequately scan for traffic and pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to standardize the exam, no more pretest chatter. This is 
strictly business. Please, no rosaries or air fresheners dangling from the 
rearview mirror. 
</P>
<P>
 Drivers have gotten sloppy over the years, DMV officials say. Last year, 4,163 
people were killed and 315,184 were injured in traffic accidents across the 
state. Today, because of school budget cuts, many driver education programs 
have been eliminated and most youngsters learn to drive elbow-to-elbow with a 
family member, DMV officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have as many competent drivers as we had in the past," said DMV 
spokesman Bill Madison. "You've got people running red lights, encroaching into 
crosswalks. There's a lack of knowledge. Plus the driving conditions have 
changed -- we have more traffic, more congestion." 
</P>
<P>
 But the road exam portion of the license test, first implemented in 1933, has 
not kept pace with life in the fast lanes. Until now. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting last month, DMV officials quietly rolled out a new driving test in 30 
offices in Orange, Los Angeles and San Diego counties. After a year, officials 
will evaluate the test, possibly making minor changes, before launching it 
statewide, Madison said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new exam emphasizes what DMV officials believe are more realistic 
day-to-day driving conditions, including congestion, freeway traffic, curves 
and merging into traffic. It's meant to test an applicant's reactions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are hoping to raise the level of competency of drivers in today's 
conditions," said Edwin Imura, assistant manager in the DMV's driver's license 
policy unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Dancy, 20, commutes 90 minutes by bus from her Altadena home to Cal 
State Fullerton. If she passed her road test, she would drive to classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Dancy's grandmother drove her to the DMV office. Dancy's hands were sweating 
by the time she got behind the wheel with DMV examiner Dina Luna at her side. 
As she drove through the parking lot, a car abruptly pulled into her path -- a 
maneuver that Luna saw before Dancy did. "Careful, careful," urged Luna, 
reaching toward the steering wheel. 
</P>
<P>
 The test did not go well. Dancy missed the passing score by two points. 
</P>
<P>
 Luna doesn't like to fail applicants. But if you screw up, you will fail. 
Under the new test, there is less room for an examiner's personal bias. 
</P>
<P>
 Luna enjoys her job but there are facets that drive her crazy, such as the 
strap marks she gets after buckling up in a dirty car. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the times when applicants get nervous and their feet freeze on 
the gas pedal. Or they forget to look before they turn at an intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 "We live for the hand brake," Luna said.

NEWS ANALYSIS; HIGH COURT STRENGTHENS RIGHTS OF LANDOWNERS; DEVELOPMENT: 
SEVERAL FEDERAL RULINGS HAVE REDUCED THE LATITUDE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN 
DEMANDING LAND DEDICATIONS AND PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After more than 50 years of favoring government regulation, the legal pendulum 
of property rights is swinging rapidly back toward the side of private 
landowners. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting most recently in a case involving the proprietor of an Oregon plumbing 
supply store, the U.S. Supreme Court in the last seven years has progressively 
strengthened the rights of property owners. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Oregon case, city officials wanted the store owner to dedicate part of 
her property for public improvements. But the court said such demands, a 
longtime practice in California and across the country, can amount to nothing 
more than blatant land grabs if they are too extreme. 
</P>
<P>
 Through its rulings, the court is reining in cities and counties that overstep 
their bounds as regulators of the land-use approval process, legal and planning 
experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 While of great interest to developers, local planners and of course lawyers, 
the recent spate of decisions and what preceded them also have an indirect but 
profound effect on the general public, influencing both the high cost of 
housing and the scarcity of public amenities. 
</P>
<P>
 How severely the emerging trend will affect California municipalities remains 
to be seen. But it will doubtless force local officials to be more restrained 
when they horse-trade with developers. A city that once might have asked the 
developer of a housing tract to donate land for a fire station, park and horse 
trail might now just ask for the fire station. 
</P>
<P>
 "These decisions basically say there is no free lunch," said Los Angeles City 
Planning Director Con Howe. "They make it clear that public needs ultimately 
have to be met with public commitments." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, the public -- and not individual developers -- must foot the 
bill for improvements that benefit everyone, such as bike paths or parks or 
even flood control channels. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the way it was before Proposition 13 passed in 1978 and virtually wiped 
out local governments' ability to levy taxes to fund public improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Proposition 13, developers had been required only to provide 
improvements directly related to their projects, such as the internal streets 
of a subdivision. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the tax-cutting measure passed, local governments -- uncannily adept 
at sniffing out money -- turned to developers to provide all sorts of public 
improvements, whether they were directly connected to the development or not. 
</P>
<P>
 During the boom of the 1980s, such arrangements worked well enough. Developers 
grumbled, but viewed the so-called "exactions" demanded by local officials as 
the cost of doing business. 
</P>
<P>
 Those exactions, imposed by municipalities statewide, ranged from fees to pay 
for new roads to dedications of land for amenities such as parks or schools. 
Often, such demands were suggested by homeowner groups opposing a developer's 
plan -- and many of the groups became adept at persuading governments to 
squeeze more and more out of builders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Developers were willing to do it," said Sherman Oaks real estate attorney 
Fred Gaines. "The fact that they had to spend an extra amount of money was 
irrelevant because the value of their property was going up so fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, the added costs were passed along to consumers. Even today, exaction 
fees in some parts of California can make up as much as 20% of the price of a 
new home, developers and government officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was a shell game. When the boom soured, more and more property owners 
protested as local governments continued to demand more and more from them. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, though, it was not the big development concerns that challenged 
the exactions all the way to the Supreme Court. It has been the cases of 
smaller landowners, who had less to lose and less need to keep friends in local 
government, that have largely shaped the property rights debate in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The cases that made it to the Supreme Court, starting in the 1980s, include a 
Ventura couple who wanted to remodel their beach house, a Glendale church that 
wanted to rebuild its Tujunga Canyon retreat for disabled children, a South 
Carolina developer who wanted to build his dream home on the coast, and finally 
the subject of the most recent Supreme Court decision: an Oregon woman who 
wanted to expand her plumbing supply store. 
</P>
<P>
 The rulings, taken together, have created a body of law propping up the rights 
of landowners, said Jerold Kayden, senior fellow at the Lincoln Institute of 
Land Policy in Cambridge, Mass. "The court is building one brick at a time." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most significant case involved the Nollan family of Ventura, who 
wanted to demolish their old bungalow and put up a new three-bedroom house on 
the coast. The California Coastal Commission demanded that the Nollans dedicate 
part of their property to improve public beach access. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, the high court ruled that the Nollans did not have to dedicate their 
land because there was no reasonable connection between the private action of 
building a new house and the public benefit of improving beach access. 
</P>
<P>
 That decision put the brakes on cities and counties asking for outlandish 
exactions. The California Legislature even passed a law defining how much local 
governments could legitimately ask for. 
</P>
<P>
 But the case of the Oregon plumbing supply store takes the requirements 
established in the Nollan case one step further. The high court held that local 
governments need even more proof that the exactions they demand are to offset 
effects of a development. 
</P>
<P>
 Florence Dolan wanted to expand her plumbing supply store, but the city of 
Tigard demanded in exchange that she dedicate 10% of her property for a public 
bike path and flood control area. 
</P>
<P>
 The city argued that the bike path would reduce extra traffic and the flood 
control area would improve public safety. The Supreme Court said the connection 
was not strong enough. A plumbing store might indeed increase traffic a bit, 
but the request for a dedication of land was simply too much, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
 Governments retain some leverage, however. Even while bolstering landowners' 
rights, the high court has affirmed the right of local governments to demand 
that new development pay its own way. Officials can still force a developer to 
remedy the negative effects of a project, such as traffic congestion, but only 
to the extent that they can prove a definite connection. 
</P>
<P>
 What frightens local officials and delights property rights advocates about 
the Dolan case is a footnote suggesting the burden of proof in such cases 
should switch from the property owner to the municipality. In other words, 
instead of the property owner proving that an action was unfair, the 
municipality would have to prove that it was not. 
</P>
<P>
 Some municipal leaders say they now must look to other funding sources to 
finance public improvements that the public is unwilling to pay for and 
developers can no longer be forced to pay for. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics of that approach argue instead that local governments should 
simply go without. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time for municipalities to turn and look at themselves and figure out 
what they don't want to pay for," said Robin Rivett, director of the 
environmental law section for the Pacific Legal Foundation in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pretty soon they are going to have to say we cannot provide those kinds of 
services anymore," Rivett said. "If the public wants them, then the public is 
going to have to pay for them."

BACK-ROAD CRIMES; SUSPECT IN SERIES OF RAPES, HOLDUPS KEPT TO SMALL TOWNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During what authorities say was a two-month odyssey of rape, armed robbery, 
kidnaping and general brutality, Timothy Daniel Shue, 38, was essentially a 
small-town criminal. 
</P>
<P>
 The parolee from Cadillac, Mich. -- who was finally arrested last week on 
suspicion of abducting and raping a Val Verde real estate agent -- allegedly 
chose tiny towns and out-of-the-way places to commit a series of crimes that 
spanned half a continent. 
</P>
<P>
 Shue's common appearance -- light-brown hair, hazel eyes, average height and 
medium build -- may have helped him fade into small-town America. So may his 
ability to project an easy, sincere and even charming personality. 
</P>
<P>
 Those same qualities, authorities now say, also helped him gain his freedom 
after years in prison, enabling him to convince judges and parole officers that 
he had turned over a new leaf after serving 11 years in prison for armed 
robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 The crimes that law enforcement agencies attribute to Shue since April include 
takeover robberies and rapes in the Michigan towns of Grand Haven, Petoskey and 
Wyoming; a rape and kidnaping in Perrysburg, Ohio; a robbery in Topeka, Kan. 
The list goes on. 
</P>
<P>
 By avoiding the bright lights of big cities, Shue also avoided their 
relatively sophisticated law enforcement agencies, enabling him to stay at 
least one crime ahead of the FBI, which had tracked him from frigid 
north-central Michigan to the deserts of Southern California and then, last 
week, to Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 He was finally arrested Wednesday in Ogden after showing off his small-caliber 
handgun to a stripper at a club called the Ladies of Lace. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looked like the typical 50-year-old guy, like the golfer type, looking for 
a younger chick," said the woman, 23-year-old Kelly Hocking. "He came off as 
being very decent before he pulled the gun out." 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials familiar with the background of Shue -- who will be 
extradited from Utah to Los Angeles this week -- said they were surprised to 
hear that he had apparently fallen back into a life of crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was very intelligent, and just an exemplary prisoner," recalled U.S. 
Circuit Judge Charles Corwin, who sentenced Shue to prison for robbing a shoe 
store north of Cadillac in 1982. "When he was on parole, he reported when he 
was supposed to, without problems. He did everything right. . . . This is one 
of those nightmares that (judges) have." 
</P>
<P>
 But Gordon Baas, Shue's probation officer, described him as a chameleon-like 
man who seemed to meet anyone's expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 To a judge he was open. To a parole officer he was dependable. To a defense 
attorney he was sincere.  
</P>
<P>
 "Either he snapped or there was a deep, dark something lurking in him that he 
was able to suppress for some time," Baas said. "I really don't know if we'll 
ever know." 
</P>
<P>
 Shue grew up in Cadillac, population 10,000, isolated between two lakes and on 
the edge of a national forest. He came of age there during the turbulent 1970s 
and 1980s, when the state of Michigan saw automotive jobs disappear. 
</P>
<P>
 Shue dropped out of Cadillac High as a senior and within three years was 
convicted of his first adult crime, larceny. While serving 17 months behind 
bars, he completed his high school equivalency degree through a community 
college program. 
</P>
<P>
 While out on parole the following year, he was convicted again, this time for 
burglary and auto theft, but eight months later walked away from a halfway 
house in Muskegon, Mich. When he was caught, he was sent back to jail with a 
longer sentence and not paroled until June, 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 It was in 1982 that the 26-year-old Shue committed the crime that kept him in 
custody for most of his adult life. He robbed a discount shoe store at 
gunpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 After a two-day trial in December, 1982, Judge William R. Peterson sentenced 
him to 30 to 50 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Shue might still be in prison today were it not for a legal technicality that 
helped him win a new trial. Then, before the retrial started, Shue suddenly 
admitted his guilt -- and announced he had gotten religion. 
</P>
<P>
 "He claimed he had found Christ and confessed everything in minute detail," 
said Judge Corwin. "He said he didn't want to put anyone through another 
trial." 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson, the judge who had earlier sentenced Shue, was apparently impressed 
by his conversion and his good behavior in jail: He cut Shue's sentence in 
half, to between 15 and 30 years. After more legal maneuvering, Shue was 
paroled in July, 1993, and returned to Cadillac, living at his mother's house. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he was going to straighten out," said attorney Edward TenHouten, 
who once represented Shue. 
</P>
<P>
 For a while, it appeared that Shue was trying: He took a job his parole 
officer had gotten him washing dishes in a restaurant, then a job at a factory. 
He moved out on his own, rented a cabin, enrolled part time in college and 
started making payments on a used car. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the surface, it seemed like he was making a positive step," said Baas, his 
parole officer. "I never got the impression that he developed any lofty goals, 
but he seemed to get contentment from small accomplishments . . . including 
adjusting to being part of the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet despite his claims of having become religious, Shue rarely went to church, 
his parole officer recalls. And law enforcement officials said there soon were 
hints that he might not be devoting all his time to the Ten Commandments. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In February, he ran up $1,000 worth of "900" phone sex calls, said one 
officer. By late April, he stopped showing up for meetings with parole officer 
Baas. 
</P>
<P>
 About the same time, a string of brutal attacks began in rural towns in 
northern Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 25, in Grand Haven, located on Lake Michigan, an armed man wearing a 
black mask and gloves entered a business where a lone woman was working. He 
robbed her and stole her ATM card and credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than a month later, in an town called Wyoming, a masked man entered a 
home through an unlocked door, and this time raped a woman before stealing her 
credit and ATM cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks later, on May 30, a masked man robbed a house in Harbor Springs, 
after again entering through an unlocked door. About 90 minutes later the man 
entered a home in Petoskey through an unlocked door, tied up a husband and 
raped his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours later, police say, Shue was videotaped by an ATM camera getting cash 
with the victim's bank card. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities did not connect the four crimes, however, until at least a week 
later. In an effort to identify the man in the ATM video, Michigan state police 
on June 7 released his picture to local media and set up a toll-free tip line 
-- producing several tips that the man was Shue. 
</P>
<P>
 Shue then fled the state, authorities said, driving south in his 1988 Pontiac. 
The car, which he had bragged about to his parole officer just weeks earlier, 
now had a dent in the front from an accident with a deer. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 9, a daytime armed robbery and rape were reported at a roadside motel 
in Perrysburg, Ohio. Police said the assailant told his victim: "You'll soon 
know who I am." 
</P>
<P>
 The following day, the FBI issued federal warrants for Shue for unlawful 
flight and using the ATM card stolen in Petoskey. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Shue apparently was headed south, then west. In Kansas, authorities 
have tied him to a robbery in Topeka. In Grand Junction, Colo., authorities say 
he cashed three stolen $100 traveler's checks at three convenience stores on 
June 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, Shue apparently headed north. Idaho state police found his car at Boise 
Airport and learned he had rented a teal-colored Jeep Cherokee, using a credit 
card from the Topeka robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 20, in Yakima, Wash., Shue pawned a camera, using his own 
identification. 
</P>
<P>
 Three days later, a 41-year-old woman was raped and robbed at gunpoint at a 
boutique in Medford, Ore. Authorities believe that, too, was Shue's work. 
</P>
<P>
 South in Eureka, Calif., Shue on June 25 used his own credit card at a coffee 
shop. Heading down the coast, he passed through Pismo Beach, where police 
believe he switched license plates with another car, and continued south toward 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 29, he allegedly walked into a Century 21 office in Castaic and 
persuaded real estate agent Paula Harrington, 26, to show him houses in Val 
Verde -- and let him drive there. She and the other agents in the office said 
Shue did nothing to make them suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
 But soon, Harrington recalled, "The gun was in my face and I was on the floor 
tied up." 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later, police found her bound and partially gagged in a Gila Bend, 
Ariz., motel room. Shue, however, had slipped away again. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 5, police say, he held up a woman at a motel in Utah, stealing her ATM 
card. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, Shue's long run ended. Ogden police were called to Ladies of 
Lace at 2 a.m. to kick out a man who was disturbing the peace. Shue gave them a 
fake name, but as they booked him, officers found his real identification. A 
computer check revealed the federal warrants. 
</P>
<P>
 After an extradition hearing there last week, defense attorney Reid Lambert 
described Shue as seeming calm and gentle. "You would be surprised," he said, 
"to learn he has any criminal history."

THIS SLEUTH STALKS THE RARE-BOOK BEAT; FORMER LIBRARIAN HELPS COLLECTORS TRACK 
DOWN OUT-OF-PRINT BOOKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The sleuth receives the call early in the morning and the search begins. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of her rustic home nestled in the foothills, she gathers her clues by 
phone, using anything from a name to a description. Then she narrows her 
choices of places to look. 
</P>
<P>
 Will it be that little bookstore in Chatsworth? Or maybe a shopping center in 
New Jersey? 
</P>
<P>
 Genevieve Krueger is neither a police officer nor an FBI agent, but she is a 
detective of sorts: a book detective. The Sunland woman has dedicated her life 
to searching throughout the country for hard-to-find or rare books for the 
likes of movie studios, book collectors and the few customers who drop by her 
home now and then to browse through her 15,000 book titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, 15,000. Books, books everywhere. In the living room, in the dining room, 
in the hallways. When her kids grew up and moved out, their rooms, too, were 
filled with books. 
</P>
<P>
 In her 17 years in the very "detail-oriented" book-finding business, Krueger 
said, she never has had to advertise her services, depending instead on loyal 
customers and referrals from bookstores. The work is painstaking, frustrating, 
often dusty, but eminently satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
 The 59-year-old former librarian and teacher's assistant specializes in 
finding children's books but said she "can find you anything, even an old car 
manual," all for a small percentage of what the book costs. 
</P>
<P>
 And it isn't just a business for Krueger, it is also a crusade. 
</P>
<P>
 "Books have their own dimension," she said. "The association people have with 
children's books is always good. They trigger feelings in people. It is why 
children should read books." 
</P>
<P>
 Ideally, Krueger starts a search with a book's title, author and publication 
date -- but she rarely has that much to work with. 
</P>
<P>
 "A girl once asked me to find a book with seven crows with seven crowns on 
their heads," Krueger said. "She said it was a big book but didn't have an 
author or title." 
</P>
<P>
 In that case, Krueger set off snooping in Seattle, where she happened to be on 
a business trip with her late husband. She began by pounding the pavement. Her 
first stop: local bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can still see it now," she said, as she sat back in her chair, a faraway 
look in her eyes. "I walked into one store, and I saw a big, green book with 
crows on it right on the shelf and picked it up." 
</P>
<P>
 Mission accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not always that easy, of course. Some searches have taken up to five 
years, and Krueger is proud of a 60% success rate for uncovering rare and 
hard-to-find books. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really is a serendipitous thing when you find the person who has the book 
and is willing to sell it. There are a lot of things that never come through," 
Krueger said. "But those are pretty good odds." 
</P>
<P>
 In the book-sleuthing business, Krueger is part of a small network of people 
who perform searches mostly for individuals, as opposed to book scouts who 
service bookstores. Although many book detectives make use of facsimile 
machines and personal computers, Krueger still does everything manually. 
</P>
<P>
 For more complicated searches, she relies on her secret weapon: Booksellers, a 
national periodical where book buyers and sellers pay to list books they want 
or have. 
</P>
<P>
 Krueger said she has done searches for some of Hollywood's biggest names, 
including Steven Spielberg and Harrison Ford. To protect their privacy, she 
declines to say which books they wanted, but said, "You get to know their 
interests, and it fills out their personality." 
</P>
<P>
 Krueger did divulge that recently she provided producers of a documentary on 
Theodor Geisel (Dr. Seuss) with editions of "Boners," a 1931 cartoon series, 
and some non-children's books written early in the author's career, such as 
"The Seven Lady Godivas," published in 1937, to illustrate his early works. She 
also was asked to review the documentary about the man and his work when it was 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of her quests have no celebrity dazzle, but are no less fulfilling. 
</P>
<P>
 A desperate Reseda woman once called on Krueger for a 1932 copy of "Tale of 
Corally Crothers" by Romney Gay. The woman had just lost both parents and felt 
that the book -- long since lost from her possessions -- was her only tie to 
her family and childhood, Krueger said. 
</P>
<P>
 The small book with simple watercolor sketches tells the story of a young girl 
who is lonesome and packs up her belongings, leaves home and jumps into a book. 
The woman could recite the entire story from memory. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had moved around a lot as a young child and couldn't take many 
possessions with her," Krueger recalled. "She would always take the book with 
her but lost it at boarding school. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I found it, she just cried," Krueger said. "You get a response back, and 
you feel like you are doing something more valuable than just selling 
something." 
</P>
<P>
 A folder on Krueger's table, bulging with thank-you notes from some of her 
clients, shows that if response is a measure of success, she has been a winner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't worry, the shrieks you heard last night were from my husband," a woman 
from Orange County wrote. "You wouldn't think a grown man would be jumping up 
and down for joy but he was! 'Pinto's Journey' (a children's book) is a hit. 
Thanks so much."

TRANSIENT HELD IN STABBING 'JUST SNAPPED' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A transient allegedly said he had "killed an enemy of God" before he was 
arrested on suspicion of knifing an 81-year-old woman as she made him a 
sandwich in her home, her brother said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Shepherd, 32, was arrested Friday after allegedly stabbing Mary Varni in 
the face, neck and chest with a kitchen knife. San Fernando police said Varni 
had let Shepherd into her home and started to make him a meal prior to the 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just snapped. That is the best way to put it," John J. Varni, the woman's 
82-year-old brother and a San Fernando Valley attorney for more than 50 years, 
said Sunday, adding that Shepherd had begun hearing voices recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Varni said Shepherd had performed odd jobs for the past seven years around the 
house Varni shares with his sister on Hagar Street. "He did all the heavy work 
and kept the cars washed up," said Varni, who paid Shepherd a few dollars an 
hour. "But he was acting odd lately." 
</P>
<P>
 Police confirmed that Shepherd has a history of mental illness. He is being 
held in lieu of $500,000 bail and will be arraigned Tuesday for attempted 
murder in Van Nuys Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 After Shepherd allegedly attacked Mary Varni, he went to John Varni's law 
office on Brand Boulevard with blood splattered on his shirt. "There was a 
glare in his eyes," Varni said. "It was like he was looking right through me." 
</P>
<P>
 Varni said he was not immediately alarmed because he had seen blood on 
Shepherd before after he tripped and fell while drunk. But Varni did become 
concerned when Shepherd told him, "I killed an enemy of God." 
</P>
<P>
 As Varni picked up the phone and dialed the closest psychiatric care unit, at 
UCLA-Olive View Medical Center, Shepherd punched him in the face, Varni said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so fast, I didn't even see it," John Varni said. "I fell down behind 
my desk and he started kicking me." 
</P>
<P>
 John Varni said he yelled for his law partner, Albert J. Ghirardelli, in the 
next office and that Shepherd ran from the office. Varni became worried when he 
called home and there was no answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came home and there she was on the floor in the kitchen," he said. "She was 
conscious but had lost a lot of blood." 
</P>
<P>
 He dialed 911 and tended to his sister until paramedics arrived, he said. 
Shepherd soon returned to John Varni's law office and was arrested by police. 
</P>
<P>
 Varni said Shepherd began acting strangely about six months ago, drinking more 
and saying he was hearing voices. He said it was common for Mary Varni to fix 
Shepherd a meal if he was working around the yard. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesperson for Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills said Sunday that 
Mary Varni was in fair condition and "doing very well" after undergoing 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has cuts on her hands from trying to grab the knife," John Varni said, 
shaking his head. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack has left Varni a little less open to strangers and a lot more 
confused. 
</P>
<P>
 "You cannot trust anybody," he said. "You even have to be cautious with people 
that you think you know."

LITERARY SLEUTH; NOVEL STRATEGIES HELP HIRED GUN TRACK DOWN HARD-TO-FIND BOOKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNETTE REGALADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 The sleuth receives the call early in the morning and the search begins. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of her rustic home nestled in the foothills, she gathers her clues by 
phone, using anything from a name to a description. Then she narrows down her 
choices of places to look. 
</P>
<P>
 Will it be that little bookstore in Chatsworth? Or maybe a shopping center in 
New Jersey? 
</P>
<P>
 Genevieve Krueger is not a police officer nor an FBI agent, but she is a 
detective of sorts: a book detective. The Sunland woman has dedicated her life 
to searching for hard-to-find or rare books for the likes of movie studios, 
book collectors and the few customers who drop by her home now and then to 
browse through her 15,000 book titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, 15,000. Books, books everywhere. In the living room, in the dining room, 
in the hallways. When her kids grew up and moved out, their rooms, too, were 
filled with books. 
</P>
<P>
 In her 17 years in the very "detail-oriented" book-finding business, Krueger 
said, she has never had to advertise her services, depending instead on loyal 
customers and referrals from bookstores. The work is painstaking, frustrating, 
often dusty, but eminently satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find books for people who want to read it one more time before they die," 
she said recently, taking a break in her living room amid a maze of 
bookshelves. 
</P>
<P>
 The 59-year-old former librarian and teacher's assistant specializes in 
finding children's books but said she "can find you anything, even an old car 
manual," all for a small percentage of what the book costs. 
</P>
<P>
 And it isn't just a business for Krueger, it is also a crusade. 
</P>
<P>
 "Books have their own dimension," she said. "The association people have with 
children's books is always good. They trigger feelings in people. It is why 
children should read books." 
</P>
<P>
 Ideally, Krueger starts a search with a book's title, author and publication 
date -- but she rarely has that much to work with. 
</P>
<P>
 "A girl once asked me to find a book with seven crows with seven crowns on 
their heads," Krueger said. "She said it was a big book but didn't have an 
author or title." 
</P>
<P>
 In that case, Krueger set off snooping in Seattle, where she happened to be on 
a business trip with her late husband. She began by pounding the pavement. Her 
first stop: local bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can still see it now," she said, as she sat back in her chair, a faraway 
look in her eyes. "I walked into one store and I saw a big, green book with 
crows on it right on the shelf and picked it up." 
</P>
<P>
 Mission accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not always that easy, of course. Some searches have taken up to five 
years and Krueger is proud of a 60% success rate for uncovering rare and 
hard-to-find books. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really is a serendipitous thing when you find the person who has the book 
and is willing to sell it. There are a lot of things that never come through," 
Krueger said. "But those are pretty good odds." 
</P>
<P>
 In the book sleuth business, Krueger is part of a small network of people who 
perform searches mostly for individuals, as opposed to book scouts who service 
bookstores. Only a handful of other book detectives operate in the San Fernando 
Valley, among them Lois Gereghty of North Hills. She has been in the business 
for 23 years and has her own collection of about 10,000 books. 
</P>
<P>
 Gereghty collects books on all topics and said most of her business also comes 
by referral from local bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are long hours," Gereghty said. "I work as long as I can. There is just 
no end to it -- there is always just one more call to make." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Gereghty makes use of a fax and personal computer, Krueger still does 
everything manually. 
</P>
<P>
 The book detectives do most of their business through the mail and by phone. 
Each of them has a sales tax license to sell by mail. Last year, postage cost 
each of the women about $1,700. 
</P>
<P>
 For more complicated searches, Krueger relies on her secret weapon: 
Booksellers, a national periodical where book buyers and sellers pay to list 
books they want or have. 
</P>
<P>
 Krueger said she has done searches for some of Hollywood's biggest names, 
including Steven Spielberg and Harrison Ford. She declines to say which books 
they asked for, but said, "you get to know their interests and it fills out 
their personality." 
</P>
<P>
 Krueger recently provided producers of a documentary on Theodor Geisel (Dr. 
Seuss) with editions of Boners, a 1931 cartoon series, and some adult books 
written early in the author's career, such as "The Seven Lady Godivas," 
published in 1937, to illustrate his early works. She also was asked to review 
the documentary about the man and his work when it was completed.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; DREAM TRIP TO JAPAN COMES TRUE FOR PUPIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fernando Avila could write a book about how badly he wants to visit Japan, but 
after penning an award-winning essay, he doesn't have to. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernando, a student at Willard Intermediate School, recently won first prize 
in a national essay contest, earning a trip to Japan. The 12-year-old is one of 
six students nationwide who won all-expenses paid, 13-day trips that include a 
trip to Tokyo, rides on a bullet train, a visit to a Kabuki theater performance 
and a stay with a Japanese family. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernando, who left for Japan on Sunday, said in an interview Friday that the 
trip is "the best thing that ever happened to me." The youngster won by writing 
one of the winning 300-word essays answering the question, "Why should I be 
chosen to go on the trip?" in a contest for students sponsored by TDK Corp. 
Fernando's essay covered Japanese culture, customs and technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not a lot of kids get this opportunity. But if you really work for it, you 
can accomplish almost anything," he said. "That's what I thought when I won." 
</P>
<P>
 Fernando didn't win the trip without help. Because student contest winners 
need chaperons, their teachers had to write essays answering why they should be 
allowed to accompany them and describe what makes their students especially 
deserving of the trip. The winners were chosen as a team, said Teresa Gertsman, 
Fernando's teacher and new traveling companion. 
</P>
<P>
 Gertsman, 29, said she was ecstatic to learn she would accompany her student, 
whose curiosity and motivation featured prominently in her own essay. "One of 
my biggest points was how tenacious he is. He was so interested in the contest 
that he had his essay done two weeks before the deadline, and I hadn't even 
written mine yet. Every day he was asking me, 'Have you written your essay? 
Have you written your essay?' Plus, he's really, really bright," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernando said he looked forward to representing the United States and learning 
about a culture he finds fascinating. Plus, he said, trips like this one are 
important in fostering cooperation between different societies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's really important to get an idea of how people are in other 
countries and what do they do, so we can know each other and better understand 
each other," he said. JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; 'TOUGH' COPS DOMINATE COMPETITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anaheim Police Officer Alan Roman is almost as modest as he is tough. 
</P>
<P>
 Six months after having his spleen removed, which required 11 days of 
hospitalization including time in the intensive care ward, Roman climbed, ran, 
swan and bench-pressed his way to winning the state title of "Toughest Cop 
Alive." 
</P>
<P>
 "It just happened to be my day, I guess," said Newport Beach resident Roman, 
28, who has been with department three years. "I was absolutely exhausted after 
it was over, and I was surprised at how well I did." 
</P>
<P>
 An annual event, the Toughest Cop Alive competition pits law enforcement 
officers against each other in eight athletic events: the 3-mile run, 20-foot 
rope climb, 100-meter dash, 100-meter swim, shotput, bench-press, pull-ups and 
obstacle course. Roman beat out 15 opponents in the under-200-pound division to 
take the top honor last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as tough, though not quite as modest, are four fellow Anaheim officers 
who walked away with top honors in the team competition. The four officers -- 
Amador Nunez, Rich Estrada, Lorenzo Glenn and Chris Ned -- easily outdistanced 
the closest challenger, a team from the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could have just said my arm hurts and not climbed the rope, and we still 
would have won," said Nunez, 32, who organized the department's team. "I knew 
when we put this team together it was a gold team." 
</P>
<P>
 Each officer competed in two events. Ned, a bodybuilder when not on patrol, 
bench-pressed 450 pounds (first place) and did 36 pull-ups (third place). Ned, 
31, says a typical breakfast during training consists of four eggs, 10 
biscuits, a bowl of oatmeal and fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to giving them bragging rights, the officers say, their athletic 
success has improved their police work. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'm on a foot pursuit or a fight," said Estrada, 29, the team's three-mile 
runner and swimmer, "I'm confident, because I know I have more endurance than 
the average person." 
</P>
<P>
 Because they feel they have little to prove, the officers say they tend to be 
more patient and less frenzied in tense situations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all look good in uniform, and that shows a good command presence," Nunez 
said. "We are less likely to get in a fight. And my stress level is way down." 
</P>
<P>
 The four-man team is hoping to travel to Australia in February for the World 
Police and Fire Games. They say they have the will, but the money is in 
question. The four are determined to raise the funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll wash cars," said Estrada, who has won more than 80 medals -- half of 
them gold -- in triathlon and police competitions. "Whatever it takes to go to 
the world games." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Nunez, who has twice participated in the world event with the Los Angeles 
Police Department: "We'd have an excellent chance of winning." MARTIN MILLER

HIP-HOP YOUTH

<TEXT>
<P>
 Walk into the gym at the San Fernando Valley Boys & Girls Club most weeknights 
this summer and you probably won't hear basketballs thumping across the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll be greeted by the driving sounds of 95 South, a rap group, blaring from 
a radio as 50 sweating boys and girls dance, twist and jump to the music. 
</P>
<P>
 They call themselves the Positive Youngstas. The name is apt. They're young 
and they're definitely trying to do something positive. 
</P>
<P>
 Positive Youngstas are a unique drill team, combining gymnastics, modern 
dance, ballet and jazz, and even traditional drill team moves, to a variety of 
music, including hip-hop, religious and reggae. 
</P>
<P>
 Ranging in age from 7 to 20, they perform at parades, shopping malls, 
ribbon-cutting ceremonies and fashion shows. And they almost always draw a 
crowd, says their equally energetic instructor Vickie Johnson. They even had to 
start their routine over at some competitions because the crowds rushed up for 
a better look, blocking the views of the judges. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the drill team members love to perform, although many confess that 
they do get a little nervous. Says Mahogany Heard, 8: "When there are a lot of 
people dancing and a lot of people watching, it makes us hyped." 
</P>
<P>
 Their uniforms are sweat shirts with the Boys & Girls Club logo on the front 
and distinctive leggings -- one pant leg ankle-length, the other cut above the 
knee. Toiyuan Forte, 14, likes their uniforms because they make the team stand 
out. Dwanda Campbell, 16, who has been part of the drill team for nine years, 
agrees. Most of the other drill teams, she says, "all have on skirts, the same 
thing but different colors." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson has been their instructor for the past six years. She began as a 
part-time paid instructor, but continued on as a volunteer after budget cuts 
eliminated her position two years ago. "I like to see them dance," she says of 
her work. 
</P>
<P>
 If the program didn't exist, Johnson admits, many of the kids probably would 
become bored and be left without an outlet for their energy. The alternative 
might be getting into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson says the kids picked the name Positive Youngstas themselves and also 
help choose the songs and dance routines. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of doing something positive with their energy is a recurring theme 
throughout the group. Their new routine will be to Hammer's "It's All Good." 
They are having bake sales to raise money for new uniforms and plan on putting 
"It's All Good" on the back of their shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 The back of their present uniforms says "Whoot There It Is," a line from a 
popular hip-hop song. Johnson explains the line to mean something you would say 
about something special. "Because they are something special."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; PANEL TO CONSIDER BUILDING ICE RINK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Planning Commission will consider a proposal today to build an ice hockey 
rink at a downtown site. 
</P>
<P>
 The rink, which would serve both as a practice site for the Mighty Ducks 
hockey team and a community youth center, would be built on a three-acre parcel 
at the southwest corner of Lincoln Avenue and Clementine Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks now practice at the Glacial Garden Ice Arena in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is a joint venture involving the Walt Disney Co. and the city of 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed facility would house two ice rinks -- one Olympic size and the 
other National Hockey League size. The facility would also include a retail pro 
shop, an amusement arcade and a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 The public hearing at City Hall begins at 1:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission staff has recommended that the commission approve the 
project. MARTIN MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA / NEWPORT BEACH; SCHOOL BOARD TO VOTE ON 3 NEW 
PRINCIPALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Newport-Mesa Unified School District this summer has had to do something 
extraordinary -- find principals to run three of its four high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Three principal-hopefuls will be introduced Tuesday night to the community and 
the Board of Education, which is scheduled to vote on hiring them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is pretty revolutionary to have (to hire) three out of four high school 
principals in the district" at one time, said Supt. Mac Bernd, adding that 
officials had hoped to have the slots filled before the school year starts in 
August. 
</P>
<P>
 Top district officials last week narrowed the field of candidates to the three 
who will come before the board Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The names of the candidates were withheld by Bernd because they have not 
signed contracts yet and have not been hired. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newport-Mesa district has conducted separate searches this summer to 
replace the outgoing school administrators: Tom Jacobson, who was promoted to 
district director of secondary education from the top post at Corona del Mar 
High School; Frank Infusino, who left Estancia High School to become assistant 
superintendent at the Silver Valley School District near Barstow, and Steve 
Pavich, who left Newport Harbor High School to become principal at Sonora 
Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 In another development, school officials announced that Hazel Rojas, former 
principal at Adams Elementary School in Costa Mesa, who was supposed to take 
over at the Kaiser Primary Center, is leaving the district to become principal 
at a Long Beach elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
 A search to replace Rojas will begin once a search committee is formed, which 
will include parents, Kaiser teachers and classified staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernd expects the district will be able to find a new principal before the 
start of the school year. BOB ELSTON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; MEETING TO FOCUS ON VENDING RESTRICTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From his truck -- literally a grocery store on wheels -- Gabino Aguilar sells 
vegetables, fruits, staples and such ethnic goods as chilies, pinto beans and 
tortillas. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent late afternoon, he parked the truck along the curb on Keelson Lane 
in the Oakview neighborhood, and it was business as usual. 
</P>
<P>
 He had a steady stream of customers, all Latinos who live in the neighborhood, 
which is between Slater and Warner avenues near Beach Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Youngsters bought sodas and candy, while women with children in tow purchased 
jalapeno peppers, onions, tomatoes and bottles of juice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people don't have a ride to go to the store, so they come and buy here," 
Aguilar said, explaining that convenience is one big reason why people buy from 
street vendors. 
</P>
<P>
 Alicia Padilla, who bought a package of tostada shells, said she and her 
family frequently buy goods sold from the trucks that peddle in her 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you need something fast, they're right here and you can buy it," Padilla 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 These shops on wheels, which number around 15 and also include vendors selling 
prepared food such as tacos and burritos, have been commonplace in the 
primarily Latino neighborhood of Oakview in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 But now there is growing concern among some residents that they don't fit in 
the residential area and cause littering, loitering, double-parking and noise. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the City Council tonight is expected to discuss ways to further 
regulate commercial mobile vending and may ask city staff to draft amendments 
to the city's current ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6:30 p.m. meeting is a continuation of the July 5 meeting at which the 
issue was also discussed. 
</P>
<P>
 Once confined largely to the Oakview area, vendors recently expanded into 
neighborhoods north of Warner Avenue, as well as on Amberleaf Circle, off 
Delaware and Main streets, and the area known as Utica-Florida, which is west 
of Beach Boulevard, said Mike Adams, city director of special projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents in these areas, as well as Oakview, say mobile vending is 
harming their neighborhoods, Adams said. And the city staff has met with these 
folks to hear complaints and find solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody agreed that if you have to allow them, then there needs to be 
further regulations," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Kimbrough, a member of the Utica-Florida Task Force, a residents 
group, does not want the vendors encroaching on her neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are concerned because we feel it devalues the property and we cannot see 
that it brings anything to our neighborhood," Kimbrough said. "When they come 
into the neighborhood, they not only have physical pollution, they play Mexican 
music and honk horns to let people know they're there." 
</P>
<P>
 Suggestions for increased regulation include: further limiting hours of 
operation -- vending is now allowed from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.; restricting the 
number of vendors in each neighborhood, and requiring an annual review of 
permits to penalize violators. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; PLAN FOR MULTI-CITY FIRE AGENCY GROWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A plan to transfer control of the Orange County Fire Department from the 
County Board of Supervisors to the cities served by the department is underway. 
</P>
<P>
 Six of the 18 cities have approved a joint-powers agreement to form the Orange 
County Fire Authority, and over the next few weeks 12 more city councils are 
expected to vote on the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos, Mission Viejo, San Clemente, La Palma, Placentia and Yorba Linda 
have approved the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine City Manager Paul Brady said Cypress, Dana Point, Irvine, Laguna Hills, 
Laguna Niguel, Lake Forest, San Juan Capistrano, Seal Beach, Stanton and Tustin 
are all expected to approve the agreement by August. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena Park, which recently voted to contract fire protection services from the 
county department, is also expected to approve the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Villa Park has expressed some reservations about the fire authority, but City 
Manager Fred Maley said he is recommending that the City Council approve the 
agreement when it meets July 26. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire authority is the second attempt by the cities to gain more control 
over how the fire department's $80-million budget is spent. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, an Assembly bill was introduced that would have created a special 
fire district governed equally by the cities and the county, but the bill 
wasn't approved. 
</P>
<P>
 "An equivalent or even better result may be achieved via a joint-powers 
authority," said a report to the Placentia and Yorba Linda city councils. "The 
JPA approach will ensure city control." 
</P>
<P>
 The county must also approve the agreement. Brady said the supervisors are 
expected to do so, especially since the cities have the option of pulling out 
of the county Fire Department and taking much of the budget with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the Board of Supervisors rejects the plan, each of the cities can decide 
to form its own department, or contract with another fire department or even 
form another regional fire department," Brady said. 
</P>
<P>
 One wild card in the effort to create the fire authority is the firefighters 
union. 
</P>
<P>
 Union officials have expressed concern that authority would be transferred 
from the five-member Board of Supervisors to a 17-member fire authority. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Fire Chief Larry Holms, firefighters are primarily concerned 
about losing their jobs and potential cuts in pay and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been a great amount of discussion" about the fire authority, Holms 
said. "The concerns expressed by firefighters revolve around job security and 
the possible impact on (contract) negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
 Holms said he thinks having the cities involved more closely in 
decision-making is a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the department was formed, it was responsible for mostly unincorporated 
area," Holms said. "Now 85% of the service we provide is to cities. It only 
makes sense that there would be a handoff in how the department is 
managed."DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; HOSPITAL AUXILIARY GIVES 32 SCHOLARSHIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 About $38,500 in scholarships was awarded by a local nonprofit group to 32 
South County graduating seniors with ambitions of entering the medical field. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will help support the aspiring medical professionals as they enter 
college next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 About 60 students from seven high schools in the Saddleback Valley applied for 
the scholarship funds, which are donated by a volunteer group associated with 
the Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1973, the Auxiliary Scholarship Committee has raised the funds through 
the sale of flowers, candy and other goods at the hospital's gift shop and 
through donations from doctors and the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Students can apply for scholarships during the first four years of their 
college career. In previous years, as many as half of the scholarship winners 
were already college students. 
</P>
<P>
 Program organizers say the scholarships aren't just for prospective doctors 
and nurses but are aimed at anyone who wants to work in the medical field, from 
physical therapists to veterinarians. 
</P>
<P>
 Winners were chosen on the criteria of grades, financial need, and school and 
community involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Scholarship recipients from Capistrano Valley High School included Erin 
Griswold, Ruchi Mahajan and Christopher Tullar. 
</P>
<P>
 At Dana Hills High School, the winners were Ali Gonili, Karun Grossman, Ellie 
Pavich, Krisianna Trager-Straw and Huy N. Tran. 
</P>
<P>
 From El Toro High, scholarship funds were awarded to Susana Ballesteros, Laura 
Dietz, Lisa DiMenna, Radcliffe Gallardo, Christopher Hass, Candace Howe, 
Christina Nemeth and Pierre Nguyen. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills High recipients included Terri Cho, Bryan Cotta, Jessica Elia, 
Matthew Englhard, Megan Ferrell, Lillian Hsieh, Kristin Laporte, Nicole 
Monastersky, Joanne Park and Samuel Yuhan. 
</P>
<P>
 At Mission Viejo High School, scholarship money was given to Jenny Choi, 
Melissa Melcher, Steven Miller and Heidi Schreiber. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeremy La Motte from San Clemente High School and Anh Bui from Trabuco Hills 
High School were also honored with scholarships.FRANK MESSINA

MAN HELD IN SERIES OF ROBBERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man sought in the nation's longest-running string of bank robberies, many of 
them in Southern California, was arrested over the weekend, eight years after 
authorities say the heists began. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny Madison Williams Jr., 43, and his wife, Carolyn Williams, 34, were 
arrested Saturday in a suburb northeast of here. They were held pending a 
federal court appearance today. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams was sought on a warrant from San Diego. A diary detailing 56 bank 
holdups was found, along with two pistols and various disguises, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal agents called it the longest unsolved serial bank robbery case in the 
FBI's history. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams was sought for investigation in 48 heists in which more than $750,000 
was taken in five states.

2 MEN HELD FOR HAVING PIPE BOMB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies thought they were involved in a routine 
traffic stop early Sunday when they pulled over a 1982 Datsun pickup truck in 
Agoura Hills for allegedly running a stop sign and failing to yield. 
</P>
<P>
 What they found in the cab of the truck, however, was anything but routine: a 
pipe bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's spokeswoman Britta Tubbs said deputies discovered the bomb about 
2:30 a.m. after they stopped the pickup on the westbound Ventura Freeway, west 
of Reyes Adobe Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The sheriff's bomb squad was called, and arson-explosive technicians moved the 
bomb to a remote area, where it was later detonated. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the pickup, John Pellegrino, 25, of Newbury Park and a 
passenger, Scott Serva, 24, of Simi Valley were booked on suspicion of 
possession of an explosive device. They are being held in lieu of $500,000 bail 
each. 
</P>
<P>
 Tubbs said it was not immediately known whether the men gave an explanation 
for allegedly possessing the bomb.

FIRE AT FEED STORE HAY BARN CAUSES $200,000 DAMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A fire swept through a hay barn at a feed and tack store Sunday morning, 
causing about $200,000 in damage to the building and its contents, firefighters 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The blaze was the second in four years to start in the barn at DaMoor's Feed 
and Tack at 1532 Riverside Drive near the Golden State Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could stand a breather," said Roland Davis, whose family has owned the 
store for about eight years. "But it's just a setback. We've been through so 
much, nothing stops us." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said the family also owns a horse boarding and training facility in 
Granada Hills that was threatened by a fire several years ago, but was spared. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, 1990, a fire caused more than $100,000 damage to the Glendale 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, the first company of firefighters arrived shortly after 7 a.m. to 
find the steel and wood barn fully engulfed in flames. Five companies of 
firefighters from Burbank and Glendale fire departments extinguished the fire 
in about 30 minutes, a Glendale Fire Department dispatcher said. 
</P>
<P>
 A firefighter was treated for minor burns at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 No one else was hurt, but the family's 26-pound cat DaPurr that had lived at 
the store for several years died in the fire, Davis said. Two other cats were 
saved. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said there were about 1,100 bales of grass hay inside the barn. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Sunday afternoon, with the smell of smoke still lingering in the air, 
Davis and several family members continued to sell hay from the driveway of the 
store.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; FREE SUMMER MEALS OFFERED TO CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A summer program that provides free meals to poor children has 67 outlets in 
Orange County, and needy parents can learn the site nearest to them by calling 
a toll-free telephone number. 
</P>
<P>
 Youths 18 and younger are eligible for the free breakfasts and lunches.The 
toll-free number is (800) EAT-N-GRO. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no registration required, and all that is needed is to show up and 
get in line and get food," said Annette Jewell, a coordinator for the Orange 
County Community Development Council. "All of the sites provide lunches, and 
some of them provide breakfasts." 
</P>
<P>
 Jewell said the 67 outlets currently helping to distribute free meals in the 
county include churches and city governments, as well as some school districts. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is paid for by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 The program fills a gap created when school meal programs close for the 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Often during the summer, she said, poor parents do not know where they can 
find lunches for their children. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal "Free Summer Food" program helps to solve this problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit Orange County Community Development Council, which has offices 
in Garden Grove and Santa Ana, helps to publicize the free-food program. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real purpose of this (free-food) program is to help children to return to 
school physically and mentally able to grow," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If children are not nourished adequately (during the summer), they are often 
lethargic and not able to concentrate on their studies." 
</P>
<P>
 Jewell urged potential sponsors of additional summer food programs to contact 
her at the Community Development Council, (714) 897-6670, Ext. 1450. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can always use new outlets," she said.BILL BILLITER

 One of the hottest youth sports in the country is coming to Dana Point this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling its new program "Roller Hockey at the Beach," the city recreation 
department will hold sign-ups Thursday for children and adults interested in 
playing and coaching in Dana Point's first roller hockey league. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a big roller hockey mania trend in South County," said Kevin Evans, 
city recreation superintendent. "Roller hockey is huge." 
</P>
<P>
 The organizational meeting will be at 7 p.m. in the Recreation Department 
offices in Del Obispo Community Park, 34052 Del Obispo St., near Pacific Coast 
Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost per player will be $55 for an eight-game regular season plus 
playoffs. The deadline for sign-ups is July 21, and the summer season starts 
July 23 for ages 6 to 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans says he won't be surprised if the league fields up to 50 teams. Games 
will be held in a converted tennis court. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had 15 to 20 phone calls a day about roller hockey," he said. "The 
response has been very good, very steady." 
</P>
<P>
 Other South County programs have seen a large response to roller hockey 
leagues. Programs are being run by the South Coast YMCA and San Juan 
Capistrano. The largest league in the area is operated by the Saddleback Valley 
Unified School District, which has about 800 youths signed up. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Point added its own program because of the demand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just seeing the number of kids playing, unfortunately, on the streets, 
setting up their own games, showed a definite need to organize" the sport in 
Dana Point, Evans said. "I'm very excited about this league." FRANK MESSINA

 Community service groups have until Sept. 1 to submit proposals for $50,000 in 
grants to be awarded by the city this year. All nonprofit groups that provide 
needed services to Mission Viejo residents are eligible for the grants, which 
are awarded quarterly by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Groups do not have to be based in Mission Viejo, but their programs must 
benefit a substantial number of city residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Funding also can be extended to special civic and cultural events. 
</P>
<P>
 Priority is given to organizations that provide services to the largest number 
of Mission Viejo residents and satisfy a social need that would otherwise go 
unfilled. 
</P>
<P>
 Applications are reviewed by city staff, and the City Council decides how the 
grants are awarded. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonprofit groups interested in applying for the community service funds can

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SMOKING BAN MAY BE ADDED TO CITY CODE; LOS ALAMITOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Smoking will not be allowed in virtually all buildings owned or leased by the 
city under an ordinance the City Council will consider today. 
</P>
<P>
 The smoking ban would cover offices, dining areas, meeting places, chambers 
and city-owned or leased vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the strict measure, smoking would be allowed in Rooms A and B in the 
city's Community Center Building during designated hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, smoking is allowed inside private offices of city employees and 
other designated areas, but the ordinance would prohibit smoking altogether, 
except for the two rooms at the Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The smoking ordinance is one of several changes to the city code that council 
members will consider today. 
</P>
<P>
 A consultant hired to review the existing city code has recommended a 
"housekeeping" effort to repeal unnecessary ordinances and clarify some 
seemingly conflicting local laws. Once the housekeeping is completed, the city 
code will be published, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the no-smoking ordinance, the council will consider an 
amendment to an ordinance that would allow City Manager Robert C. Dunek to 
approve contracts of less than $10,000 without consulting the council. BERT

LIBRARY IS READY FOR READERS; EVENT: ABOUT 3,000 PEOPLE TURN OUT FOR THE GRAND 
OPENING OF THE $8.2-MILLION NEWPORT BEACH BRANCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNA CEKOLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Doors of the spacious Newport Beach Central Library had barely opened Sunday 
when fifth-grader Sasha Stanley settled into the corner of the Story Time 
reading room with a stack of books. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the star-filled dome of the room, the Newport Beach girl found a 
peaceful spot to pursue one of her favorite past-times. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love it," Sasha said of the new library. "I just like to spend hours 
reading." 
</P>
<P>
 Sasha, who planned to check out two books from the popular "Sweet Valley High" 
series, wasn't the only one thrilled with the new library. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 3,000 people turned out Sunday for the grand opening of the 
54,000-square-foot Central Library. 
</P>
<P>
 A rainbow-colored arch of balloons, a red carpet and sounds from the El Toro 
Marine Corps Wing Band set the scene for the dedication that included remarks 
from state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach); Jean Kiger, chair of the 
library Board of Trustees; City Manager Kevin J. Murphy; Mayor Clarence J. 
Turner, and Carol A. Hoffman, an executive with the Irvine Co., which donated 
the four-acre site for the library. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when many libraries countywide have reduced hours and are 
contemplating closing because of budget constraints, officials celebrated the 
public-private partnership that created the $8.2-million library. 
</P>
<P>
 The celebration culminated about seven years of planning and fund-raising in 
the city, which boasts the second most used library system, per capita, in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really is an impossible dream come true," City Librarian LaDonna T. 
Kienitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction for the city-owned library, officials said, was made possible by 
a partnership between the city and the nonprofit Newport Beach Public Library 
Foundation, which raised nearly $2 million toward the total from individuals, 
families, corporations, businesses and community groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Stahr, who along with her husband, John, started the foundation five 
years ago, watched happily as visitors streamed into the ocean-view building, 
designed by architects Simon Martin-Vegue Winklestein Morris of San Francisco 
in association with James L. Pirdy of Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's wonderful to see all the people come out and support it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, visitors wasted no time putting the library to use, including Mayor 
Turner and Kiger, who checked out the first books, "America's Outdoor Wonders" 
and "Where the Red Fern Grows," respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening festivities started Saturday night when a crowd of 650 supporters in 
gowns and tuxedos celebrated the opening with a champagne tour that raised 
about $300,000 to support programs and services at the new library. 
</P>
<P>
 "The support from the community has been overwhelming," event Chairwoman 
Barbara Glabman said. "The people of Newport Beach believe in their library and 
support what they believe in." 
</P>
<P>
 Many special events are planned in the coming week to mark the opening of the 
library, at 1000 Avocado Ave. near Pacific Coast Highway and MacArthur 
Boulevard in Newport Beach. The city also has three other branch libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 Designed for a 300,000-piece collection, the Central Library houses current 
fiction and nonfiction books, paperbacks, large print books, books on cassette, 
magazines and sound and video recordings. There is also a meeting room, 
bookstore, children's room, information desk, a business area, reading and 
study rooms, a local history section and an "electronic village," providing 
access to computerized publications and resources.

FBI ARRESTS SUSPECT IN BANK HEISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was always the same. A man would leap the bank counter, confront a teller, 
fire a handgun once or twice into the ceiling and demand money. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, disguised with a false hairpiece, mustache or beard, he fled in a 
waiting car. 
</P>
<P>
 For eight years, the man known as "The Shootist" traveled from bank to bank 
and state to state. Among his targets were banks in Irvine, Laguna Niguel and 
San Juan Capistrano. Once in Mission Viejo, he got $38,000 for a day's work. 
Sometimes, he got nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the weekend, he got caught. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny Madison Williams Jr., 43, also known as Robert James Hall, and his 
wife, Carolyn Williams, 34, also known as Carolyn Hawkins, were arrested 
Saturday at a motel in Bothell, a suburb northeast of Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 They were being held Sunday at the downtown Immigration and Naturalization 
Service lockup pending a federal court appearance Monday, FBI agent Roberta A. 
Burroughs said. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams was sought on a warrant from San Diego. His wife was arrested because 
evidence found in the motel room implicated her in at least some of the 
holdups, Burroughs said. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams made no formal confession but acknowledged responsibility for 56 
holdups going back to July 3, 1986, Burroughs said. 
</P>
<P>
 A diary detailing 56 bank holdups, along with two pistols and various 
disguises, were found in the motel room, Bellevue police Lt. Jack McDonald 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Agents in San Diego and Washington, D.C., verified that it was "the longest 
unsolved serial bank robbery case in the FBI's history," Burroughs said. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams was sought for investigation in 48 heists in which more than $750,000 
was taken in California, Washington, Idaho, Oregon and Texas. He also admitted 
to eight others in which the amounts were not immediately known, Burroughs 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually, we don't have bank robbers out there for eight years," said Jan 
Caldwell, an FBI spokeswoman in San Diego. "That's a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 The arrest resulted from a tip after the robber was featured on a recent 
episode of the TV show "San Diego's Most Wanted," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Burroughs said the biggest theft in which Williams is under investigation was 
of about $38,000 from a First Interstate branch in Mission Viejo.

PLOT IN ANGELS MOVIE HITS CLOSE TO HOME; BASEBALL: CELLULOID TEAM BEARS THE 
SAME LOGO -- AND LOSING WAYS -- AS THE REAL THING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEBE MARTINEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If they were train robbers, they would be known as the gang that couldn't 
shoot straight. 
</P>
<P>
 If they were a political party, they would have fewer wins than the 
Libertarians. 
</P>
<P>
 What they are is a bumbling baseball team calling itself the Angels that has 
more pratfalls than the Three Stooges. The team's last-place standing just 
before the All-Star break doesn't even begin to tell how bad this team really 
is. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for the California Angels baseball club, this "Angels" team is a 
fictional one in a new Disney movie scheduled for release this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for the California Angels, the celluloid version bears an 
uncomfortable resemblance to the real thing. With the All-Star game only two 
days away, the real Angels are in last place, racking up more losses than any 
other American League team. 
</P>
<P>
 In the movies, happy endings are guaranteed. And in this comedy, titled 
"Angels In The Outfield," a band of celestial beings with golden halos arrive 
to lead the hapless team to a miracle finish.  
</P>
<P>
 In real life, the players know that it takes more than a wing and a prayer to 
win. But that doesn't mean they can't believe in miracles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being in last place, it would be nice for someone to come down and help us 
out," Angels outfielder Jim Edmonds says. 
</P>
<P>
 Utility player Rex Hudler chuckles when he hears the story line of the movie. 
"That's going right along with our season. It's beautiful. I think it's great. 
There is a good chance that a miracle could happen," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be nice to have that miracle happen," agrees designated hitter Chili 
Davis, the team's only representative in the All-Star game. "I would like 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 But after watching a special screening of the film last week, 14-year-old Joey 
McKnight, a California Angels fan from Fountain Valley, walked out of the 
theater sadly shaking his head. "It would never happen." 
</P>
<P>
 In the original version of the movie released in 1951, when there was no 
California Angels baseball club, it was the Pittsburgh Pirates that were 
heavenly blessed. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though it now seems like a natural progression to have angels work 
miracles on the Angels, a source close to the team says he cannot believe the 
club allowed its logo to be used in the new film. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why would they want their name associated with it?" says the official, who 
agreed to talk if his name was not revealed. "The team in the movie was in last 
place. . . . Unfortunately, it rings so true to real life." 
</P>
<P>
 Except for the team's name and -- well, OK, its losing record -- California 
Angels President Richard Brown is quick to point out that the dissimilarities 
between the players and the actors are much greater than the likenesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, the fictitious team plays under a Big A with a halo, wears the same 
uniform, and is owned by a character who dons a cowboy hat like California 
Angels owner Gene Autry. 
</P>
<P>
 And yes, Brown admits, he is "still hoping for divine intervention" to get the 
team out of the basement. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike the group of misfits in the film, the California Angels really are 
not that bad, Brown says, adding that the team was given a basic outline of the 
plot but did not have prior script approval. 
</P>
<P>
 One character in the movie flexes his muscles during the playing of the "Star 
Spangled Banner," and a teammate consults a "magic 8-ball" to tell him whether 
they will win that day. The ball answers "no" and "maybe." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think (the fictional club) would have gotten to the minor leagues, 
much less the major league," Brown says. "At the outset of the movie, they were 
terrible!" 
</P>
<P>
 Nor does the real team have an overweight catcher who pounds his chest as he 
rounds the bases, Brown adds, nor an over-the-hill pitcher, nor a hot-tempered 
manager who communicates with profanity and fisticuffs. 
</P>
<P>
 So why go along with the movie project? 
</P>
<P>
 There are several reasons, those involved in the project say: 
</P>
<P>
 First, it's a good "kid's movie" with a common theme: Guardian angels can 
guide you, but it's up to you to believe in yourself to win. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, having existed in the shadow of the Dodgers, the Angels organization 
hopes the movie boosts the team's popularity, just as the films "Major League" 
and "Major League 2" gave the Cleveland Indians a national identity. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never really gone all the way (to win the pennant)," Davis says. "The 
Indians got more recognition nationwide, and maybe this movie will help the 
Angels players and organization be more recognizable." 
</P>
<P>
 There also was some financial reward. An undisclosed fee paid by the film's 
producers to use the team logo went directly to Major League Baseball 
Properties to be split among the 28 clubs in the league. Brown did not know how 
much would be returned to the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Anaheim made about $24,000 for two days of shooting crowd scenes 
at Anaheim Stadium, including the night that former Texas Rangers pitcher Nolan 
Ryan made his final appearance in Anaheim before retiring. Most of the filming 
actually occurred at the Oakland Coliseum because the Anaheim field was being 
used by the Los Angeles Rams -- another team in need of miracles. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, the Angels say they hope the movie teaches fans not to give up 
on the team. 
</P>
<P>
 In the movie, "there were a couple of kids who were absolutely loyal to the 
Angels, whether they played well or didn't. . . . Fans should be good fans, in 
good weather or in bad weather," Brown says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like people to go and enjoy the movie and realize there's an Angels 
professional club -- not the one on which the movie is based -- that has the 
same logo and same uniforms . . . to come see the real Angels," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe, he says, Angels fans will copy the fans in the movie who provided 
inspiration for their team at a critical point in a game by rising from their 
seats and flapping their arms like angels' wings. 
</P>
<P>
 Two die-hard Angels fans, Rachel and Scott Irving of Lake Forest, became 
believers of miracles after viewing the movie. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could happen," Rachel Irving says. "We will all cross our fingers and say 
our prayers." 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, some of the Angels players say they swear off superstitions 
because they only add to the pressures of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hudler says he has a couple of "angels" he calls on to help the team win. 
</P>
<P>
 "I call on (pitcher) Mark Langston to get that slider over the plate when it's 
three (balls) and two (strikes), with two outs. That's the Angel I call out 
for," he says. "I also call for the beautiful Chili Davis to go ahead and get 
that run home."

RESIDENCE DAMAGED IN FIRE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A two-story house in Valencia sustained $300,000 in damage after a fire broke 
out on the second floor, county fire officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Sue Pearson, 54, was in her home in the 24500 block of Farrow Drive 
Saturday afternoon when she smelled smoke.The odor became stronger and she saw 
smoke outside her rear window. When she walked outside the house, she saw that 
smoke was coming from her roof, and called firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 Five engine companies from the Los Angeles County Fire Department responded 
and brought the fire under control in about 30 minutes. Neither Pearson nor any 
firefighters were injured. 
</P>
<P>
 The roof of the house was destroyed and the second floor sustained major 
damage, fire officials said. Damage to the structure and its contents was 
estimated at $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of the fire is still under investigation.

2 YOUTHS JAILED IN CAR THEFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two teen-agers were arrested on suspicion of car theft after a short pursuit 
in Lancaster on Sunday morning, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Harris, 18, and a 16-year-old were traveling in a stolen 1985 Cadillac 
near 10th Street East and Avenue I about 10:15 a.m. when sheriff's deputies 
attempted to stop them, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies chased the car for about two minutes, but called off the chase to 
avoid injury when the suspects sped into a residential neighborhood. The car 
was spotted several minutes later and the suspects were arrested, deputies 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies found no weapons, but recovered two screwdrivers and pawn slips from 
the car, which deputies say might have been used in burglaries.

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 29-year-old Fullerton man was killed in a fiery crash during his first solo 
flight in an ultralight aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside County coroner's investigators identified the victim as Robert 
Mitchel Whitman.He was the only one aboard the craft during the Sunday morning 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Sgt. Craig Petree said officers went to the Perris Valley Ultralight 
Airpark and found a two-seat aircraft engulfed in flames. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters extinguished the flames but were unable to save the pilot. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitman had recently completed ultralight flight training, Petree said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Aviation Administration was notified, but the agency does not 
investigate ultralight crashes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers believed the accident could have been caused by pilot error. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultralights are open-frame aircraft with overhead wings similar to those of a 
hang-glider.

BLAME

<P>
 Why did it happen? 
</P>
<P>
 Why did Germany, the defending world champion, fall? 
</P>
<P>
 Was it, as Coach Berti Vogts insists, the result of only two errors? Or was 
there something deeper behind Sunday's 2-1 quarterfinal loss to Bulgaria in 
front of a stunned crowd of 72,416 at Giants Stadium? 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, the Germans were to blame for Andreas Moeller's stupid foul on 
Hristo Stoitchkov, barely outside the penalty area. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, the Germans were to blame for building a wall that failed to stop 
Stoitchkov's subsequent free kick. The wall was big enough, it just was not 
mobile enough. The players, fearing a deflection, failed to leap high enough to 
block the immaculate shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, the Germans were to blame a short while later when Zlatko Iankov's 
cross was powered past goalkeeper Bodo Illgner by an excellent header from 
Yordan Letchkov. They should never have allowed the much shorter Thomas 
Haessler to be left alone to guard Letchkov, no matter how competent a player 
Haessler is. 
</P>
<P>
 Those were the two errors to which Vogts pointed: the non-jumping wall and the 
mismatch of Haessler against Letchkov. That he would single them out is only 
natural, because neither mistake could be laid at his door. They were decisions 
the players had to make. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, Vogts was saying: Don't blame me, I'm only the coach. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were other factors in Sunday's defeat to which Vogts could have 
pointed but did not. 
</P>
<P>
 He was handicapped, for instance, by the unavailability of Matthias Sammer, 
who had played exceptionally well in the tournament but was lost to injury. It 
turned out to be a crucial loss. Vogts' choice of starters was further limited 
by the absence of Stefan Effenberg, whom he had sent home for insulting the 
fans; and Mario Basler, who returned to Germany to be with his wife, who was 
having difficulty with her pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
 So Germany's bench was not deep enough. The talent was not there to step in 
when needed, and for that Vogts must bear at least a share of the blame. He 
selected the team. 
</P>
<P>
 To his credit, he did not blame the referee, Colombia's Jose Torres Cadena, 
for disallowing the goal that would have put Germany ahead, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can discuss this forever," he said, "but we have to accept the referee's 
decision, and we have accepted it." 
</P>
<P>
 He could hardly have done otherwise, considering that Germany benefited from 
an earlier bad refereeing decision in its second-round victory over Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
 So now Vogts and his players will be flying back to Germany, where a hostile 
reception is likely. Some will retire from the national team. Whether Vogts, 
who won the World Cup as a player in 1974, will stay on as coach is debatable. 
</P>
<P>
 All of his predecessors won either the World Cup, the European Championship or 
both. Vogts' Germany was beaten by upstart Denmark in the final of the 1992 
European Championship in Gothenburg, Sweden. And now there is this startling 
loss to unheralded Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
 History could have been made had Germany won this World Cup. Vogts would have 
joined Brazil's Mario Zagalo and Germany's Franz Beckenbauer as only the third 
person to win the World Cup as a player and as a coach. 
</P>
<P>
 That won't happen now. 
</P>
<P>
 German captain Lothar Matthaus, who on Sunday played in a record-tying 21st 
World Cup game, could have broken that record on Wednesday. Had Germany won the 
tournament, he could also have become the first player in history to captain 
two World Cup-winning teams. 
</P>
<P>
 That won't happen now. 
</P>
<P>
 Juergen Klinsmann, had he scored one more goal, could have tied Russia's Oleg 
Salenko for the scoring lead and perhaps gone on to win the title. 
</P>
<P>
 That won't happen now. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Germany will have to go through post-tournament analysis and begin 
building a team capable of winning the 1996 European Championship in England 
and qualifying for the 1998 World Cup in France. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, Germany qualified automatically as the defending champion. That, in 
the long run, might have been its undoing. 
</P>
<P>
 That and a Bulgarian team that refused to accept defeat.

MIKE DOWNEY: WORLD CUP USA '94 / QUARTERFINALS; JUST AN OLD SWEDE SONG TO THEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 I stand outside Stanford Stadium after one of the most suspenseful climaxes to 
a soccer game in this or any country, Sweden having just driven a stake through 
Romania's heart. Flaxen-haired schoolgirls in green-and-yellow gym clothes go 
skipping along the pathway, arm in arm, forming a chorus line and singing as 
loudly as they know how. I recognize the melody. 
</P>
<P>
 "We love you, Swe-e-den!  
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, yes, we do!  
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, Sweden!  
</P>
<P>
 "We love you!" I interrupt one to ask: "Which part of Sweden are you from?" 
</P>
<P>
 Henriette Madsen, 18, who is visiting America with her Skovlunde teammates and 
playing in a football tournament in Sunnyvale, Calif., could not look much 
happier as she gives me an answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Denmark," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Cup. It brings neighbors together. 
</P>
<P>
 Too bad there could not have been two winners of Sunday's game here, for 
Romanians also merit serenades from surrounding nations. To lose the way they 
did, with a penalty kick by Miodrag Belodedici swatted away like an insect, had 
to be particularly painful, as was evident in the voice of Romania's coach, 
Anghel Iordanescu, when he said of the sport he adores that it "has no mercy." 
</P>
<P>
 Romanian roulette. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what it became in the end. 
</P>
<P>
 "You live and die with one boot of the ball. (The penalty kick) is like 
roulette," agreed Romania's great player, Gheorghe Hagi. "It is not a matter of 
experience or skill. It is just plain roulette. I don't like roulette." 
</P>
<P>
 So, rather than going 400 miles to Los Angeles to continue playing and to 
visit his cousin's pizzeria, Hagi must go some 8,000 miles to his people back 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 Going back will be an even greater ordeal for Belodedici, shooter of the 
fateful roulette ball, who in December of 1988 sought political asylum in 
Yugoslavia while visiting his mother's family on a tourist visa. For more than 
three years he was banished from the national team, and not until April, 1992, 
was he invited to don a Romania jersey again. 
</P>
<P>
 Prone on the lawn of Palo Alto, he and most of his teammates wept and clutched 
their faces until coaches and opponents came to offer them comfort. They would 
not be proceeding to Pasadena. They would not be training to play Brazil. Their 
World Cup had come to a sudden and terrible end. For a Romanian, there was 
sadness back home from the ports of the Black Sea to the banks of the blue 
Danube. 
</P>
<P>
 And for a Swede? 
</P>
<P>
 How sweet it is. 
</P>
<P>
 Said the winning coach, Tommy Svensson: "To be playing Brazil, in Pasadena, in 
Los Angeles, that is a great thing for a football player from Sweden." 
</P>
<P>
 The teams played a 1-1 tie in the first round, but this is a rematch 36 years 
in the making -- a chance to finally redeem Sweden's 5-2 defeat to Brazil in 
the 1958 World Cup championship game, played in Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
 Scandinavia holds its breath. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of a dream," Sweden midfielder Kennet Andersson said. "I can't 
explain it in English. I don't think I can explain it in Swedish, either." 
</P>
<P>
 So, I go looking for other Swedes. Maybe one of them can. 
</P>
<P>
 Celebrating the victory, wearing yellow Viking helmets with the longest horns 
this side of Thor, are three happy guys from the town of Lidhoping. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicklas Andersson, 23, says he sees no reason that Sweden could not overcome 
Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have 11 men and we have 11 men," he says. "Why not?" 
</P>
<P>
 Nodding their horns in agreement are Per Wernersson, 27, and Niklas Ivenholt, 
26. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look," Wernersson says, taking off his helmet and pointing to a darker color 
beneath its peeling yellow paint. "Underneath, it turns to gold." 
</P>
<P>
 Meaning there is a great reward in the end if Sweden can just keep chipping 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 "And even Danes will be cheering for the Swedes?" I turn to the Danish 
students to ask. 
</P>
<P>
 Henriette Madsen's teammates gather around to shout: 
</P>
<P>
 "Ya! Sure!" 
</P>
<P>
 "And now Sweden will win the World Cup?" I ask. 
</P>
<P>
 And together as one, the Danish students shout: 
</P>
<P>
 "No! Brazil!" 
</P>
<P>
 And they laugh and the men from Sweden loudly disagree.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / QUARTERFINALS; HAGI STANDS TALL AMID TEARS; SOCCER: WHILE 
TEAMMATES WAIL, HE WAXES PHILOSOPHICAL ABOUT THE NATURE OF ROMANIA'S 
PENALTY-KICK LOSS TO SWEDEN IN QUARTERFINALS. 
</P>

<P>
 As usual, Romanian midfielder Gheorghe Hagi was his own man on all fronts 
Sunday in the World Cup quarterfinals. Others may be laughing and he frowns. 
Even on the field, he sometimes appears to be playing his own game. 
</P>
<P>
 In defeat, there was a trail of Romanian tears along the sideline at Stanford 
Stadium and in the middle of the field where the players gathered to watch 
defender Miodrag Belodedici's final futile penalty kick. 
</P>
<P>
 And Hagi? 
</P>
<P>
 He looked like he was arguing with some assistant coach or team official in 
the moments after Sweden's victory, 5-4, on penalty kicks after overtime ended 
in a 2-2 tie. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have any tears," Hagi said. 
</P>
<P>
 He spoke for himself. Hagi may be the best player to come out of Romania and 
the captain of the national team, but he certainly could not have been more 
wrong about the mood of his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 Swedish goalkeeper Thomas Ravelli said that he spotted Romanian goalkeeper 
Florin Prunea crying when it was over. Ravelli noticed most of the Romanians 
were crying. Belodedici was the first player off the field. 
</P>
<P>
 But all the tears started even before the Swedish celebration. Romanian 
defender Dan Petrescu could have made it 4-3 on the penalty kicks, but he was 
robbed by Ravelli, who made an astonishing save, batting the ball away with his 
right hand. Ravelli said Petrescu started crying right after he missed. 
Midfielder Ionut Lupescu came over and patted him on the head. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagi was the only Romanian player composed enough to spend any amount of time 
talking about the loss with the media. (Belodedici came out for a moment, 
saying: "It was a very hard game. Romania could have won if it was stronger at 
the end." Then he slipped back into the safety of the dressing room.) 
</P>
<P>
 Losing on penalty kicks can't be getting any easier for the Romanians. For the 
second consecutive World Cup, they have exited after penalty kicks. In 1990, it 
was against Ireland, in the second round. Then it was 5-4. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could not play this game forever," Romanian Coach Anghel Iordanescu said. 
"A decision had to be made, and this was the penalty kick. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could not say we were at a disadvantage. Maybe this was our fate. This 
time, we could have been the winners, too. But soccer has no mercy." 
</P>
<P>
 Hagi spoke about the fickle nature of free kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Soccer is like roulette," he said. "It is not a matter of experience or 
skills. It's just plain roulette. That's why I've never played roulette in my 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have almost felt better to have lost in 90 minutes than to lose on 
the final kick of the day."  
</P>
<P>
 But the game unraveled before the penalty kicks. The Romanians were within 
five minutes of reaching the semifinals against Brazil when Swedish midfielder 
Kennet Andersson tied it, 2-2, on a header in overtime in the 115th minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to sit on their lead cost the Romanians. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were times when they tried to keep the result as is and probably 
exaggerated it," Iordanescu said. "That's where they made a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Swedish defender Roland Nilsson: "I thought they were acting as if they 
had already won the game before the referee called time." 
</P>
<P>
 So much for slow-down soccer. The Romanians weren't quite sure what they 
wanted to do. Iordanescu wanted to keep them from flying too high. When they 
wanted to slow down, it cost them. 
</P>
<P>
 There were mixed feelings of pride, disappointment and missed opportunities. 
Hagi had wanted to show the world he was on equal footing with the likes of 
Romario and Bebeto. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Hagi, who is 29, refused to speculate about his future when asked 
whether he would be back in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know what will happen tomorrow," he said, smiling. Final Kicks 
</P>
<P>
 A look at the sequence of penalty kicks following overtime in Sweden's victory 
over Romania:

WORLD CUP USA '94 / QUARTERFINALS; THERE ONCE WAS A MAN NAMED RAVELLI . . . ; 
SWEDEN: GOALKEEPER'S PERFORMANCE AGAINST ROMANIAN PENALTY KICKS SEEMS LIKE THE 
STUFF OF LEGENDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The biographies of players prepared for the media before the World Cup 
revealed that Sweden's goalkeeper, Thomas Ravelli, likes poetry. That was news 
to the people who gather the news in Sweden.  
</P>
<P>
 "I would think he would be the last one on the team who likes poetry," a 
soccer writer from Stockholm said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 But whether or not Ravelli will read them, there were many poems being written 
about him after his performance in the quarterfinal game against Romania at 
Stanford Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Ravelli was poetry in no motion. 
</P>
<P>
 He said later that he was heeding the advice of teammate Tomas Brolin, who 
took him aside and counseled him before the penalty kick shootout that was 
required to determine the winner after the 30-minute overtime ended at 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tomas told me to just stand on my feet in the middle of the goal for as long 
as I could before each kick," Ravelli said. "He said that the longer the 
goalkeeper stands in the middle, the more nervous the shooter is because he has 
to choose whether to kick to the right or the left." 
</P>
<P>
 Brolin, one of Sweden's sharpest shooters, would know. But it was interesting 
that he, at 24, would give advice to Ravelli, who will turn 35 next month. The 
most experienced goalkeeper in the World Cup, he tied Sweden's record for 
international appearances with his 115th Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 This, however, was the most important moment in the most important game he had 
ever played, and he would listen to anyone who might be able to help him. 
</P>
<P>
 So he planted himself on his line, like one of Joyce Kilmer's favorite 
subjects. Surely, Ravelli has read him. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after the first three Romanians chosen to take penalty kicks put the ball 
into the net, Ravelli refused to commit himself before the shooters did. His 
patience finally prevailed when the fourth Romanian, Dan Petrescu, went right. 
Ravelli leaped in the same direction, getting one hand on the ball and batting 
it away. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading, 4-3, in the shootout, Ravelli had his first chance to win the game 
for Sweden when he faced the final Romanian of the shootout's first round, Ilie 
Dumitrescu.  
</P>
<P>
 They had words earlier in the game, when Dumitrescu appeared to take a dive in 
the box and Ravelli ordered him to clear out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure he understood my English," Ravelli said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dumitrescu understood that he was being yelled at by the Swedish goalkeeper 
and spit at his feet. 
</P>
<P>
 When Dumitrescu was true with his penalty kick in the shootout, he charged 
toward the goalkeeper, shouting what Ravelli presumed to be trash talk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't understand Romanian," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That sent the shootout into its second round, the one that can end in sudden 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the way it ended for Romania. 
</P>
<P>
 After Sweden's Henrik Larsson scored, the pressure was on Romania's Miodrag 
Belodedici. 
</P>
<P>
 It showed. Hesitating before approaching the ball, he did not hit it with all 
of his power. Again diving to his left, Ravelli made the save that won the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he was very nervous," Ravelli said of Belodedici. "It's a lot of 
pressure to take the penalty in the kind of game we played today. Any player 
must have a lot of mental strength to take those kinds of shots." 
</P>
<P>
 And what of Ravelli's nerves? 
</P>
<P>
 "The goalkeeper has everything to win and nothing to lose," he said. "If I 
don't stop any penalties at all, I'm not going to be the goat in the 
newspapers." 
</P>
<P>
 One thing everyone is sure of is that Ravelli does read the Swedish 
newspapers. Before the World Cup, he was not particularly enjoying what they 
had to say about him.  
</P>
<P>
 If there had been another capable goalkeeper in Sweden, they would have 
preferred that Coach Tommy Svensson use him. But there wasn't. So Ravelli and 
the Swedish media were stuck with each other. One recent news conference 
deteriorated into a shouting match between them. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone, even his critics, agrees now that he has earned the last word. He 
can even have an entire verse.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / QUARTERFINALS; BULGARIANS MAKE CASE THAT IMAGE ISN'T 
EVERYTHING; SOCCER: FIRST-TIME SEMIFINALISTS NO LONGER CONSIDERED THE LITTLE 
GUYS WHO CAN'T. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bulgaria, as this World Cup opened, was a categorizer's spectacle. Location: 
Nowhere. Soccer: No name. World Cup prospects: No How. 
</P>
<P>
 Not fair, of course, or even accurate as it turns out, but soccer writers 
cultivate a certain sardonic edge, and Eastern Europe has limited fame in this 
arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Then on Sunday, in a historic display of Balkan bravura, Bulgaria vaulted into 
the semifinals of the world's favorite sporting event. 
</P>
<P>
 That came to everybody's astonishment. Bulgaria is a longshot, representing a 
poor country and a long way from home. Its American odyssey is an adventure in 
improbability. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Germans were very good. But still, God is Bulgarian," joked Hristo 
Stoitchkov, who scored Bulgaria's first goal. 
</P>
<P>
 With a lifetime World Cup record of 0-10-6 in five appearances, Bulgaria 
qualified against the odds for this year's tournament. It took come-from-behind 
finishes to squeak past Israel and France. 
</P>
<P>
 Once qualified, the players rebelled, demanding bonuses unimaginable for an 
agricultural nation of 8.7 million wrestling with the aftermath of failed 
communism. 
</P>
<P>
 Peace was made with the players, 13 of whom play in rich western Europe 
leagues, but then the American Embassy in the Bulgarian capital of Sofia put 
out the unwelcome mat. 
</P>
<P>
 "The embassy rejected about 90% of visa requests from Bulgarian journalists. 
They saw everybody as a potential illegal immigrant," said Vasell Kolev of the 
sports newspaper Meridian Match. "Only after newspapers protested did they 
relent." 
</P>
<P>
 Bulgaria opened badly against Nigeria, losing, 3-0, but shut out hapless 
Greece and a Maradona-less Argentina to qualify for the second round. Still, 
Bulgaria appeared to escape to the quarterfinals less on its own merit than 
because of Mexico's collapse in second-round penalty kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 Bulgarian print reporters in the Meadowlands press box Sunday -- 
dutifully possessing visas and anachronistically without computers -- seemed 
more awed by Bulgaria's very presence in a quarterfinal than at its prospects 
against defending champion Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Merely advancing to the quarterfinals triggered bigger street celebrations in 
Bulgaria than the collapse of communism. But everybody in Sofia understood that 
West Germany and its united successor had played 17 consecutive World Cup games 
without a loss. 
</P>
<P>
 When Germany took a 1-0 lead minutes after halftime, it seemed as if Bulgaria 
had gone as far as it would go: Germany was 9-1 in quarterfinal games and 
hadn't lost one since 1962. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not Italy. We are Bulgaria, a small country, not a giant. We never 
expected to reach this far," apologized Kolev, a student of Bulgarian philology 
at the University of Sofia. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Bulgarian coolly hammered home one second-half goal, then another, 
silencing a pro-German stadium and striking Kolev and his friends first 
speechless, then teary. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made two serious mistakes and they punished us for them. They deserved to 
win," German Coach Berti Vogts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Bulgarian Coach Dimitar Penev: "The pressure is great when playing a 
great team like Germany, but most of our players were not scared. As we go to 
the semifinal, perhaps people will look at us in a different way." 
</P>
<P>
 No one had confidence enough to have ordered champagne, but euphoria flowed as 
freely as disbelief among the victorious players. 
</P>
<P>
 "The facts are clear. This is Bulgaria's finest victory, its finest moment," 
said Yordan Letchkov, who scored the winning goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid dressing room jubilation, phones rang. The president of Bulgaria called 
to say he's flying in for Wednesday's semifinal against Italy. The prime 
minister called. Letchkov's agent called to report a postgame overture from a 
team in the Italian League. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the greatest success of my career and the greatest moment of my life, 
right up there with the birth of my two children," goalkeeper Borislav Mihaylov 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bulgaria will go into the game with Italy as the pronounced underdog, but in a 
real sense the underdogs are already winners in this World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps the world will realize that we have classy soccer players in 
Bulgaria," said Stoitchkov, on a day of national athletic pride that will long 
echo across the Balkans.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / QUARTERFINALS; COMMENTARY; STOITCHKOV HAS HIS ACT TOGETHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL DWYRE, TIMES SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Soccer hero Hristo Stoitchkov of Bulgaria was destined to come to Hollywood. 
For a man whose first name translates to "Christ" in Bulgarian, it will be a 
match made in heaven. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoitchkov, you see, is not only a world-class player and a driving force 
behind his team's stunning march into the semifinals of the World Cup. He is 
also prime star material, with a face that could play nicely on the silver 
screen and an act that could do the same on the cocktail party circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoitchkov will be arriving on the West Coast this week, after he and his band 
of Bulgarians settle the issue against Italy here Wednesday of who plays in the 
final Sunday and who is in the third-place game Saturday at the Rose Bowl. 
Whatever the outcome, Stoitchkov will be coming, and it's conceivable that the 
greeting party at LAX will include somebody from the William Morris Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 If Stoitchkov played tennis, he would be Andre Agassi. Right now, his image 
may not be everything, but it is heading toward matinee idol. 
</P>
<P>
 He is 28 years old, one of two star scorers for FC Barcelona of the Spanish 
League -- the other is Brazil's Romario -- and was runner-up in 1992 for 
European player of the year. Barcelona bought him four years ago for $4 
million, and the price to acquire him now would be perhaps triple that. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with all that going for him, his role in Bulgaria's shocking success in 
the World Cup has elevated him to international sports superstar status. The 
Bulgarians seemed to be headed for a tidy 1-0 defeat at the hands of the 
powerful defending champion Germans here Sunday. As always, Germany played 
efficiently, if unspectacularly, and Bulgaria's runs up and down the field 
seemed to be merely the chase of an unrealistic dream. 
</P>
<P>
 But then Stoitchkov, awarded a direct free kick just outside the penalty area 
when Andreas Moeller fouled him, cranked a left-footed shot over Germany's wall 
and inside the near post in the 76th minute. Three minutes later, before the 
shocked Germans had recovered, Bulgaria's Yordan Letchkov took a perfect pass 
and headed in another goal. Suddenly, the biggest upset of the tournament, and 
one of the biggest ever, had been achieved. 
</P>
<P>
 And who was front and center on the stage afterward? Stoitchkov, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 He met the press in baseball cap and smile, dark eyes darting about, rugged 
unshaved look intact. He kidded about his quote after the Mexico game in which 
he had said that God was a Bulgarian, and he said that, even though the Germans 
were a very good team, that God still was a Bulgarian. And he said, sincerity 
oozing, that when things were going badly in the first half and the Germans 
were dominating, he thought about his daughter Mijaela's sixth birthday Sunday 
and remembered the good times with her and his family in Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
 In victory, Stoitchkov was gracious. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked about the yellow card he received over a foul, he said, "The 
referee was right. I tried to argue, but I realized that he is the referee and 
he has the right to make that decision." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked about the game-long marking efforts of Germany's Juergen Kohler, he 
replied, "I think Kohler is one of the best defenders in all of football, and I 
would like to congratulate him because, in 90 minutes, he only made one small 
foul on me." 
</P>
<P>
 But with Stoitchkov, the image being presented and reality aren't always quite 
the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Banned for life by the Bulgarians at age 19 for his part in a brawl during the 
Bulgarian Cup final, Stoitchkov was paroled quickly and has had a long history 
of confrontations with referees ever since. Two years ago, he stomped so hard 
on a referee's foot that it brought on a two-month ban from the Spanish League. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sunday's game, Kohler actually did such a solid job of guarding Stoitchkov 
one-on-one that Stoitchkov's only three chances at the goal were on free kicks. 
The statistics sheet showed Stoitchkov with no other chances, inside or outside 
the penalty area. Kohler's defense was so effective that Stoitchkov jawed and 
yelled at him frequently and spent much of the game crabbing openly at his 
teammates for not getting him the ball more. 
</P>
<P>
 But when it was over, Stoitchkov led the team in hugs. When they somehow 
gathered up the delirious Bulgarians for an on-field group celebration shot, 
Stoitchkov was second-row center, arms raised in celebration. Finally, the 
Bulgarians marched off, and Stoitchkov led again, arm in arm with the same 
teammates he had spent three hours berating. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood will love this guy.

RAIDERS START WITH ONLY ONE PICK; PRO FOOTBALL: CAMP OPENS WITHOUT FIVE OF SIX 
SELECTIONS; MONTOYA EXPECTED TO RETURN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Several players expected to report did not, one player not expected to report 
apparently will and one player not expected to be much of a factor at all has 
been given new life. 
</P>
<P>
 On opening day of the Raiders' training camp, all of the action took place in 
the coaches' offices where depth charts and salary negotiations were the order 
of business. 
</P>
<P>
 The action on the field begins this morning with the start of two-a-day 
workouts for the team's new faces and selected veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 Missing, however, will be five of the club's six draft choices, none of whom 
have signed. Only linebacker Rob Holmberg, the team's final 1994 pick, has 
signed. The seventh-round selection out of Penn State will be on the field 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 No serious problems are anticipated with the other five since the total amount 
the Raiders can spend on rookies this season under league rules is $1.7 
million. And with other salary cap considerations to worry about, they might 
not even go that high. 
</P>
<P>
 As the No. 1 pick, linebacker Rob Fredrickson is expected to receive somewhere 
between 40% and 60% of the allowable total. 
</P>
<P>
 Once that happens, the others should fall in line. The Raiders hope to have 
them all in uniform this week. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the veterans are due to report. Guard Max Montoya, thought to have 
retired after last season, is expected to be among them. 
</P>
<P>
 That's certainly not what the Raiders thought when they signed free agent 
guard Kevin Gogan away from the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expect to see him on Friday," said Coach Art Shell of the 38-year-old 
Montoya, a 15-year veteran. "I think the wife and kids are probably kicking him 
out. He can still play. He can still help us." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he didn't help as much as expected last season at tailback, Nick Bell 
is back at a new position, getting a tryout at tight end. Last year's starter, 
Ethan Horton, left to join the Washington Redskins.

SCOTT IS HAVING DIFFICULTY GETTING ACCLIMATED; TENNIS: FORMER CORONA DEL MAR, 
ARIZONA STANDOUT FINDS LOSING, SATELLITE TOUR A BIT ROUGH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 As Danielle Scott sat and recalled some of the more bizarre stops on her world 
tennis tour, you could almost hear the Grateful Dead's "Truckin' " playing in 
the background: Lately, it occurs to me what a long , strange trip it's been.  
</P>
<P>
 Scott's latest trip, to San Luis Potosi, Mexico, was undoubtedly her strangest 
in two years on the women's satellite tour, the minor leagues of the main tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get sent to these God-awful little towns, where people are lying dead on 
the street," Scott said with almost an embarrassing chuckle. "It's near 
nowhere. It's in the middle of the desert. We have to take Aero Mar, this 
little eight-seater propeller plane to get there. 
</P>
<P>
 "The place is hickville, a total dump and it's in the altitude. We play with 
pressure-less tennis balls. It's windy and these pressure-less tennis balls 
just fly everywhere. You hit the ball and it hits the fence, and you're like, 
'Oh my gosh, where's the beach?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Scott, who graduated from Corona del Mar High in 1988, said the air quality 
can make three-set matches seem like a death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really bad," she said. "It's about 20 times worse than L.A. San Luis 
Potosi is surrounded by mountains, so it all just sticks in there." 
</P>
<P>
 But Scott didn't stick long. She lost in the first round at San Luis Potosi. 
The more she thought about how that sounded, the more embarrassed she became. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't put that in there," she said, laughing. "I don't want everyone to know 
I lost in the first round." 
</P>
<P>
 Though the setting was plusher and the air a little cleaner, Scott's 
second-round loss at the posh Rancho San Clemente Tennis & Fitness Club wasn't 
any prettier than her San Luis Potosi defeat. A two-time All-American at 
Arizona, Scott's loss here came Friday in a pre-qualifying tournament of the 
Toshiba Tennis Classic in La Costa to Cecelia Ampuero of Newport Beach, 7-5, 
2-6, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott, who was seeded fourth here, was hoping a victory in the Opportunity 
tournament would earn her a wild card into the main draw at La Costa, which 
will be Aug. 1-7. But a quarterfinal defeat to an unseeded player probably 
won't score many points with tournament director Jane Stratton. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh well, there's always Evansville, Ind., next week and Salsbury, Md. and 
Stratton Mountain, Vt., after that. 
</P>
<P>
 After two years on tour, all of Scott's stops add to . . . a big ranking of 
300 on the WTA computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it really worth it? 
</P>
<P>
 "I love it," she said. "You just travel around with your friends. You get to 
experience traveling around the world, speaking different languages, and 
playing tennis, which is my favorite thing to do. It's competing, which I love 
to do, and you're earning a living. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love it. I really do. If I'm cooped up in an office all day, I'd go crazy. 
I mean I've traveled to nice places too."  
</P>
<P>
 Scott has been to Manhattan Beach, Quebec City, Hong Kong, Jamaica, the 
Bahamas, the Dominican Republic, France, St. Simons Islands, Australia and New 
Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been around," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Scott doesn't start winning soon, she won't be around much longer. The 
gravy train -- Scott's parents -- could come to a grinding halt by September. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since my parents are sponsoring me, it's kind of rough on them," said Scott, 
who was The Times Orange County high school player of the year in 1988. "I told 
them if I don't start making money before the U.S. Open and getting my ranking 
up higher, then I have to go out and get a real job. Which I don't want to do, 
but . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 So even though the final stretch drive didn't get off to the greatest start in 
San Clemente, Scott is confident she will still be playing in the fall. She 
recently completed two weeks of intense training with her coach, Bob Robles, in 
Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been working on my ground strokes and coming to the net," she said. "I 
think I've dramatically improved. I just have to go out and prove it now."

 There is a book that may never be written but has what seems the perfect 
title. It's about life with the Harlem Globetrotters and other teams of that 
ilk. The title, says Cypress' Mark Shannon, is "The Road Scholars." 
</P>
<P>
 It may never come to fruition because the collaborators don't want to name 
names, and tell-all books are all the rage. Publishers want it, friendships be 
damned. 
</P>
<P>
 But the prospective storytellers -- Meadowlark Lemon, Curly Neal, Shannon, 
Harlem Legends road manager Joe Albanese and director of marketing George Lemon 
(Meadowlark's oldest son) -- are holding strong to their convictions. 
</P>
<P>
 So Shannon's stories come without names, gleaned from years of life on the 
road in cosmopolitan cities and hellholes, in front of rude fans in the South 
and Northeast, in front of thousands, and one time, in front of four -- Saudi 
Arabia's King Fahd, two princes and a dignitary. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of stereotypes out there, and I saw a lot of stereotypes on 
the road," said Shannon, a traveling referee, "and the more I see it, the more 
I started to believe it. . . . There's a reason there are those stereotypes. It 
doesn't mean everyone in the South is a redneck or everyone in the North is 
rude, but they certainly exist." 
</P>
<P>
 His travels have taken him worldwide. He once officiated a game between 
national teams from Iran and Iraq while the two nations were at war. 
</P>
<P>
 And Americans repeatedly were threatened while in Sweden, after the U.S. 
attack on Libya. The team's tour was canceled for fear of retaliatory action 
and their hotel reservations were canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone felt sorry for us," Shannon said, "but nobody wanted to take us in, 
either." 
</P>
<P>
 It provided a real education for Shannon, a Cypress resident who grew up in 
Huntington Beach and graduated from Marina High, Golden West College and Long 
Beach State. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to be your own man on the road," Shannon said. "At the time, I was 
23 years old, still living at home, and I had to do my own laundry, make my own 
travel arrangements, everything. I really grew up and learned a whole lot. Now 
I do all our laundry and house cleaning. But I was really naive about the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon, 33, who regularly officiates high school games in Orange County, 
began umpiring Little League when he was 11 in exchange for hot dogs and soda. 
Then came recreation departments and school districts. And when he finally got 
his big chance, he was practically an overnight sensation, running the gamut 
from Little League to high school to pro basketball in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 He was assigned to do a couple of NBA exhibition games in 1985. After his 
second game, he was approached by the Globetrotters, who offered to more than 
double what would have been his NBA salary had he been one of two new officials 
selected to do 40 NBA games and 40 Continental Basketball Assn. games. Shannon 
was among six officials being considered for the 40-40 contract, but he chose 
to go the Globetrotting route. Shannon was scheduled to go to Australia with 
the Globetrotters' international unit, but instead, one of the other two 
Globetrotter teams was sent. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next day, Meadowlark Lemon said, 'How'd you like to run with me?' " 
Shannon said. 
</P>
<P>
 So Shannon joined Meadowlark's Shooting Stars -- which included Pete Maravich, 
Wilt Chamberlain and Neal -- that served as a White House ambassadorial team to 
Nancy Reagan's "Just Say No" campaign against drugs until 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Shooting Stars, Shannon saw the country and has developed a name for 
himself as one of the top comedic referees available to the myriad of comic 
teams, such as the Harlem Ambassadors, Harlem Clowns, Harlem All-Stars, Harlem 
Road Kings, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he used to travel 10 months of the year, he now travels only three, 
working as an independent contractor and calling his own shots. The biggest 
reason is because he and his wife, Jami -- the girls' softball coach at Los 
Alamitos -- have a 1-year-old son, Austin. 
</P>
<P>
 But his love of officiating still keeps him hopping. For example, in 
mid-March, he officiated seven games in eight days for four comedic teams. 
After officiating girls' high school basketball Friday at Marina High, a boys' 
game Saturday afternoon at Artesia, he spent Saturday night and Sunday 
afternoon with the Harlem Ambassadors in Pleasanton. He topped off the weekend 
with a girls' game Sunday night at Century High. During that three-day span, 
his pay was between $15 and $1,500 per game. And when there is an A-list 
occasion -- television or investor dates -- Shannon can almost name his price 
-- between $5,000 and $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
 While on the road, players often have turned to Shannon for levity. His role 
during much of his early years was that of prankster, as well as officiating 
and doing some marketing work. As such, he was privy to what happens off the 
court, which is much more interesting than what happens on it. 
</P>
<P>
 * Shannon and the team bus driver would take photos of women in the stands, 
then send photos and fake fan mail to the young, often gullible players on the 
team, who went to addresses that weren't inhabited by the person in the 
picture. 
</P>
<P>
 * A day manager once told the team it could use the hotel Jacuzzi after hours, 
but the night manager told them they couldn't. So players rebelled. They 
thought about putting goldfish in the spa, but decided against it when they 
considered the goldfish might die. They considered soap, but finally settled on 
Jell-O, which they managed to settle -- it took all the boxes from the local 
store. Neither day nor night manager found that funny. 
</P>
<P>
 * Players were sent to press conferences and television interviews that didn't 
exist. 
</P>
<P>
 * Prospective players were told they needed to supply certain samples for 
their team physical. And when those players showed up with those samples in tow 
-- urine, semen and fecal -- everyone had a good laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone who had a joke played on them was usually either naive, gullible or 
not very well liked," Shannon said. "And a lot of times, there would be six or 
seven paybacks before you found out who got you in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon, himself, was the victim one time while ESPN was filming a segment in 
Alaska. The players were taken on dog sled rides, but Shannon was given a 
special lead dog -- one in heat. He was led on a wild ride into the middle of 
nowhere, crashing into a snowbank and then watched the trail dogs have their 
way with the lead dog. Of course, players were watching -- and laughing -- back 
in the monitor room. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wouldn't have been so bad," Shannon said, "if the wind chill hadn't made 
it 20 below."

MIKE PENNER: DARK DAY FOR WORLD CUP IS A GOOD DAY FOR A BASEBALL GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Baseball All-Star game: Scheduled for Tuesday night in Pittsburgh, and it 
should get a fair share of the U.S. television-viewing audience. Tuesday is a 
rest day in the World Cup. Semifinals aren't until the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 Chili Davis: That one team/one All-Star rep rule -- what can you do about it? 
So it means Ricky Bones goes with a 7-6 record because Milwaukee has to send 
someone. So it means Kevin Mitchell gets to complain because the Cincinnati 
Reds landed only two invitations and not a half-dozen. Occasionally, it works 
the other way, too -- and Chili certainly has the numbers (.339, 16 home runs, 
61 runs batted in) even if he lacks the support. Let him go, let him take a few 
cuts, let him enjoy himself, for crying out loud. The man has enough misery 
awaiting him when he gets back from three-day leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Gene Mauch: The Little General always did cut through the garbage and strike 
at the heart of the matter. And he speaks the naked truth when decrying the 
four white flags currently flying over the stadiums in Anaheim, Arlington, 
Tex., Oakland and Seattle. "There isn't one team in that whole division that 
seems to have a personality," Mauch points out. Amen to that. Although the 
Angels used to have one. Had one up until May 17. Then they fired him. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Lasorda: His team lost more than 90 games in 1992. So did Buck Rodgers'. 
During the last two years, Lasorda lost a son. Rodgers almost lost his life. 
Lasorda's bosses stayed with him through these on-field and off-the-field 
crises, kept patient, didn't wring their hands over a "loss of fire in the 
belly" -- and now, Lasorda has his team in first place, five games up at the 
break. In case we needed any reminder why the Dodgers are the Dodgers and the 
Angels remain the Angels, there it is. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Williams: He's done it with the volume turned way down, leaving the din 
to Ken Griffey Jr. and Frank Thomas, but he, too, is drawing a bead on Roger 
Maris' home-run record. Remember when hair fell out of Maris' head in clumps as 
the pressure of chasing Ruth overwhelmed him? That won't be a problem for 
Williams. He has no more hair to lose. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Maris: With any amount of luck, he could slip from first to fourth on 
the single-season home run leader board, just like that. Repeat after me: The 
Ball Is Not Juiced. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball realignment: The old way, one division race would be over by now with 
another quickly headed in the same direction; the Expos would be blowing out 
the NL East by 9 1/2 games and the White Sox would be 6 1/2 games up in the AL 
West -- 15 1/2 ahead of the last-place Angels. The new way might have thrown 
the AL West to the dogs, but at the same time, nine teams in the American 
League and six in the National enter the second half with legitimate claims to 
the term "playoff contender." So if you're asking if the baseball owners did 
the smart thing when they voted to realign, the answer is yes. That's one. 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Sampras: Excuse him and his forehand from any further "Death of Tennis" 
essays. When you win Wimbledon back-to-back, you officially are not a part of 
the problem. Still, what I wouldn't give for one more fortnight of McEnroe 
postmatch press conferences. Sampras, Ivanisevic, Courier, Chang -- there are 
still some bodies who can play a good game. But who out there can talk one? 
</P>
<P>
 Martina Navratilova: Well, she could, but now all she's saying is goodby. When 
she finally walks away, that's it for the Mac-Chrissie-Connors-Martina Golden 
Age. Can anything save us from the Ice Age? Maybe Mary Pierce, maybe Lindsay 
Davenport. Or maybe Sampras hires a joke writer. When Andre Agassi is your 
leading source for "color," your sport needs a teleprompter. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweden 5, Romania 4 in penalty kicks: How many ABC executives were 
administered smelling salts after that one? Romania wins there, after 
Bulgaria's ambush of Germany, and the World Cup final would have been two 
upsets away from being overrun by Kremenlievs, Tzvetanovs and Dumistrescus. 
Don't get me wrong; a Romania-Bulgaria title match would have had the Black Sea 
jumping. (Go you Balkans!) Just the same, ABC probably prefers televising its 
very expensive World Cup final across Neosoccerland without the aid of Eastern 
bloc topography maps and pronunciation tables. Got to tread lightly here. 
Americans are just starting to get the hang of Romario, Baggio and Bebeto. 
Don't go throwing Hristo and Miodrag at them now. 
</P>
<P>
 Spain: Soccer team almost reaches the Cup final four. Tennis players named 
Conchita Martinez, Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario and Sergi Bruguera win titles at the 
French Open and Wimbledon. Olympics of '92 were among the best ever. What more 
could a sporting nation ask for? OK, besides the return of the Barcelona 
Dragons? 
</P>
<P>
 Penalty kicks: There has to be a better way. Suppose the NFL decided tie games 
with a field-goal kicking contest. Suppose the NBA decided tie games at the 
free throw line. Suppose the NHL decided tie games by having five skaters a 
side go one-and-one against the goalie, firing pucks at the net as if they were 
dice on a craps table and calling it a "shootout." What, you think the NHL is 
stark raving nuts? 
</P>
<P>
 Penalty kicks II: A friend of mine does suggest a better way. After 90 
minutes, pull a player from both teams and play 15 minutes, 10-on-10. Still 
tied after that, pull another player and play 15 more minutes. And so on, until 
you're left with either a winner or the goalkeepers going one-on-one, trading 
punts from box to box. Something for the MLS to consider. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy-Brazil: The soccer final ABC really wants. And it would be a sight -- 
Italians fainting in the street, Brazilians crying uncontrollably in front of 
the television. Valium, the official snack food of the 1994 World Cup 
championship.

KIM'S DEATH, G-7 MEETING LIKELY TO HIT TOKYO STOCKS; MARKETS: SOME PREDICT A 
300-POINT DROP. DOLLAR RESUMES ITS FALL AFTER INDUSTRIAL NATIONS SHOW NO SIGNS 
OF A RESCUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stocks are expected to decline today in Tokyo following the death of North 
Korea's leader and a disappointing meeting of the Group of Seven nations this 
weekend that yielded little support for the sagging dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 After leaders of the world's major industrial countries failed to come to its 
rescue, the dollar resumed its decline against the yen. The dollar opened at 
98.30 yen on the Tokyo foreign exchange market today, down 0.23 from Friday's 
close. 
</P>
<P>
 But the market's focus today in Japan is likely to be on Friday's death of 
82-year-old North Korean President Kim Il Sung. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important news, obviously, is North Korea," said David Harris, a 
Japanese equity salesman at Barclays de Zoete Wedd. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that this does create uncertainty is not good for the market at all, 
and with the stronger yen today, I think we could see this trading down 300 
points," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim died just two weeks before a historic summit with South Korean President 
Kim Young Sam aimed at paving the way for increased economic ties on the 
peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 While tension over North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons development program 
has led to a stronger dollar in the past, currency traders in Tokyo expect any 
rebound in the dollar to be limited. That's because any gains will be met with 
more dollar selling by Japanese exporters to repatriate profits earned 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 A weaker dollar typically is bad news for stocks because a stronger yen cuts 
into profits at Japan's big-name exporters and makes fixed asset investments 
such as bonds more attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, share prices declined amid concern that the G-7 nations would do 
little to shore up the dollar. The benchmark Nikkei 225-stock average dropped 
93.51 points to 20,526.51. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the weekend, the G-7 nations showed restraint in supporting a stronger 
U.S. currency. The countries' finance ministers said a further weakening of the 
dollar against the yen and European currencies is "not desirable," but they 
failed to announce a joint plan to defend the greenback.  
</P>
<P>
 In company news, the Japanese government has decided to comply with a U.S. 
request that Japan submit "voluntary" measures to increase overseas procurement 
by Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp., the Nihon Keizai newspaper said Sunday. 
Japanese trade negotiators have been resisting the U.S. government's request to 
do so, citing NTT as a private company. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's major trading companies plan to set up holding companies in China as 
part of their efforts to increase direct investment in the country, the Nihon 
Keizai newspaper said. Mitsubishi Corp. has filed a request with the government 
for permission to set up such a company in Shanghai. Mitsui & Co. is 
considering a similar move in Beijing. Itochu Corp. set up a holding company in 
Beijing last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Toyota Motor Corp., the largest Japanese car maker, will start operation of 
its new plant in Australia on July 18, the Nihon Keizai newspaper said. The 
plant, located in a suburb of Melbourne, will supply cars for export to Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's major steelmakers are reducing the number of engineers by attrition 
and transfer to affiliates as part of their cost-cutting efforts, the Nihon 
Keizai newspaper said. Nippon Steel Corp. the world's largest steelmaker, will 
cut the number of engineers by 30% to 40% from the current level, the paper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nikkei stock index futures for June delivery fell 130 points to 20,620 in 
Osaka and declined 130 points to 20,620 in Singapore.

UNIVERSITY TO GET KEATING CASE PAPERS; COURT: PUBLIC WILL HAVE ACCESS TO MANY 
DOCUMENTS FROM CIVIL SUITS IN THE LINCOLN S&L SCANDAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge has ordered that videotaped depositions and transcripts from 
now-closed civil cases against convicted Lincoln Savings & Loan operator 
Charles H. Keating Jr. be given to Arizona State University for public use. 
</P>
<P>
 However, U.S. District Judge Richard M. Bilby also directed that some of the 
material -- much of it pertaining to former Keating co-defendants in the civil 
litigation -- may be restricted for up to 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Bilby's order, signed Wednesday, won't allow public access for a year to the 
depositions of employees of three accounting firms that at one time were 
defendants in the class-action suit. 
</P>
<P>
 It also said any accounting firm specifically objecting to disclosure of a 
deposition based on competitive information or trade secrets must file a motion 
within a year designating what part of the transcript it wants held from 
release until January, 2004. 
</P>
<P>
 The one-page order also said researchers would be limited to viewing 
videotapes in the library and could not copy or show them outside the 
university until after January, 2004. 
</P>
<P>
 The material has been sealed from public view under a court order. 
</P>
<P>
 The earliest any of the material will be available will be Jan. 2, said Edward 
Oetting, director of the university's department of archives and manuscripts in 
Tempe. 
</P>
<P>
 "This material is a very good picture of business activities in the Southwest 
in the 1980s, and I think that in terms of the development and business 
practices, this will be very important material historically," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 20,000 small investors, most of them elderly Southern Californians, 
lost more than $285 million in April, 1989, when Keating's American Continental 
Corp. in Phoenix collapsed along with its primary subsidiary, Irvine-based 
Lincoln Savings. 
</P>
<P>
 Lincoln's failure is the nation's second-costliest, leaving taxpayers with a 
$3.4 billion cleanup bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, the investors won a jury verdict against Keating and several 
cohorts that Bilby later reduced to $1.5 billion, including a $1-billion 
judgment against Keating. But none of that award is expected to be paid because 
the defendants who remained in the litigation are broke or bankrupt. Keating is 
serving more than 12 years in prison on state and federal convictions for 
defrauding investors and looting the thrift. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, investors have received nearly 70 cents on the dollar from 
settlements with three major accounting firms, five law firms and more than 90 
other professionals and associates who helped Keating. 
</P>
<P>
 The professional firms were accused of having conspired with Keating to make 
his companies appear financially healthy to fool regulators and allow the 
continued sale of the risky bonds issued by American Continental and sold 
mainly in Lincoln branches. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that remaining issues in the litigation have been resolved, Bilby sought 
to preserve what he considers a historical record. Several firms objected to 
releasing the videotaped depositions and transcripts on grounds that 
reputations would be harmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Bilby said trade secrets and competitive information about how the accounting 
firms performed audits or other business procedures deserve protection. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he said, concerns relating to possible embarrassment from disclosure 
of someone's deposition testimony "is outweighed by the public's right to know 
about the events relating to the collapse of American Continental Corp. and 
Lincoln Savings & Loan." 
</P>
<P>
 The collection will include 80 bankers' boxes of deposition transcripts and 
exhibits and about nine more of trial and hearing transcripts. Most of the 
depositions were videotaped. There are nearly 3,000 boxes of other documents in 
the American Continental Corporation Record Collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Bilby won support for his order from an unlikely source: Keating himself. The 
70-year-old former real estate developer and financier urged the release of the 
information because he believes the public deserves an opportunity to see the 
federal "lies and outrageous claims." Keating has maintained that he is a 
victim of overzealous regulators with a vendetta against him.

JAZZ THAT CHANGES TEXTURE WITHOUT RESORTING TO IMPROVISATION; COMPOSITION: JOEY 
SELLERS' QUARTET PLAYS STANDARDS IN A WAY THAT GIVES THEM NEW FERVOR, WITH A 
NOD TO CHAMBER MUSIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Joey Sellers abhors the routine, relishes the unconventional. That's why when 
he leads his jazz quartet, he rarely follows the usual pattern that's called 
"head-solos-head," where the musicians play a song's melody ("head"), then 
offer improvised solos, then close with the melody once again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see our quartet as being in a chamber-esque sort of mode," Sellers said . 
"We break things down within a set, within a song, changing colors, textures." 
</P>
<P>
 Sellers, 32, a trombonist and composer who also leads an 11-piece ensemble, 
performs tonight with saxophonist Tony Malaby, bassist Trey Henry and drummer 
Billy Mintz at System M in Long Beach. He defines the band both by what it is 
and by what it is not. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not a hard-bop band," he says, referring to the bluesy, hard-driving 
kinds of bands led by the late drummer Art Blakey. "Overall, we take a much 
more delicate approach, though subtle and delicate doesn't mean it's not 
intense. We'll open up and fly, really stretch. Still, the kind of music we're 
playing is much more delicate." 
</P>
<P>
 Characteristic of the band's atypical musical stance, Sellers says, is its 
approach to the old standard "My Heart Belongs to Daddy."  
</P>
<P>
 "The trombone might start with a rhythmic vamp, then the tenor sax plays the 
melody alone," without the bass and drums, he says in an afternoon conversation 
at a reporter's home in Los Angeles. "Then the bass comes in, but playing 
another melody line, so now there are three lines happening simultaneously, 
with the trombone and bass not in their traditional roles." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The quartet also plays Sellers' originals, which, he says, chart the delicate 
course "between freedom and structure." 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to have places within a chart for free playing, but I don't want to sit 
through an evening of free playing," he says. "But once a piece has a focused 
direction, that's the structure."

 Pieces by the trailblazing, avant-garde alto saxophonist Ornette Coleman, whom 
the trombonist called one of his favorite composers, inevitably show up in a 
Sellers small band performance.  
</P>
<P>
 "We play 'Una Muy Bonita,' 'Blues Connotation,' 'Congeniality.' From a 
compositional standpoint, these tunes of Ornette's are little perfect gems," he 
said. "The direction we take might be considered more a stretch than Ornette's, 
though it's hard to think of that. The goal of an Ornette piece is to keep the 
improvising section related to the compositional gem." 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman is also noted for such classics as "King Porter Stomp" and "Wolverine 
Blues." "I think of Ornette as being like Jelly Roll Morton," Sellers said. 
"Jelly Roll wrote perfect pieces that were orchestrally sound, and that were 
over in 3 1/2 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 Sellers is a native of Phoenix. He took up the trombone in grammar school and 
began his arranging career in the fifth grade, when he reworked a version of a 
Dixieland tune for the school small band. "We performed it on a concert and it 
sounded great," he remembers. 
</P>
<P>
 The composer, who lives in Long Beach, now has completed more than 100 
originals. Many of these have been for his 11-piece band, the Joey Sellers Jazz 
Aggregation, which has recorded two albums for the Nine Winds label: 1990's 
"Something for Nothing" and "Pastels, Ashes," released early this year. And 
while he gets a reasonable number of commissions -- he recently wrote six 
pieces that were recorded by the St. Louis Brass Quintet -- Sellers has for 10 
years made his living playing trombone in the Side Street Strutters, a 
Dixieland band that performs five days a week on the French Market stage in 
Disneyland's New Orleans Square. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, too, Sellers -- the band's musical director -- puts his distinctive mark 
on the music. "Some of the charts sound a little twisted," he says. "Yes, we 
play the regular tunes like 'Alexander's Ragtime Band' and 'Honeysuckle Rose,' 
but we also drop in something like 'Jelly Roll' by Charles Mingus." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That band is composed of colleagues Sellers met while studying music education 
at Arizona State University in the late 1980s. Asked if it was fun, he replied: 
"After 10 years, fun is not the right word. It's entertainment more than 
creativity, and I wish I could do more creative things." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he's not for a moment considering a change of occupation. "From music I 
get that feeling I had when I was 13 and smelled a girl's cheap perfume and 
knew I wanted to ask for her phone number, but knew I was too nervous," he 
says. "But I asked her out anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 * Joey Sellers' Jazz Quartet, with Tony Malaby, plays tonight, 8 to 11, at 
System M, 213A Pine Ave., Long Beach. (310) 435-2525.

FED UP WITH YOUR INNER CHILD?; BOOKS: BARBARA GRAHAM THINKS THE SELF-HELP 
SOCIETY SHOULD LIGHTEN UP. HENCE, HER SATIRICAL LOOK AT NEW-AGE CULTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MONA GABLE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Let's see now. You've gotten in touch with your shadow, but it keeps 
abandoning you.  
</P>
<P>
 You've reclaimed your inner child, but your inner mom is still nagging you.  
</P>
<P>
 You've done so many past lives workshops you don't know whether you're Anne 
Boleyn or Eleanor Roosevelt or Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Before you start shrieking your truth, is it possible, just possible, you've 
been overdoing the self-help thing? That your quest to become whole has become, 
well . . . an addiction? Consider these warning signs from Barbara Graham's 
book, "Women Who Run With the Poodles," published in June by Avon: 
</P>
<P>
 1. You think shopping is a disease. 
</P>
<P>
 2. You've fallen head over heels in love with yourself and think you make the 
cutest couple. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Most of the time you feel like a she-criminal for being too fat, short, 
smart for your own good, stupid, tall, beautiful, ugly for words. (Fill in the 
blank.) 
</P>
<P>
 4. You're sure happiness is just a Sex-for-One, Ecstatic-Shaman or 
Hugging-Your-Inner-Werewolf workshop away.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing you can do that's OK anymore," says Graham, a 46-year-old 
playwright and writer from New York, whose essays and articles have appeared in 
magazines from Self to New Age Journal. "Everything is a disease. You've got to 
exercise, you've got to go to yoga, you've got to have a low-fat diet. You have 
to go to a weekend workshop. Everybody's running around telling us what's wrong 
with us."  
</P>
<P>
 "Poodles" is a satirical look at what Graham calls "the New-Age 
psychoculture." For women who have had enough, Graham offers her own brand of 
self-help in chapters such as "Reclaiming Your Sacred Inner Bitch" and "Killing 
the Inner Nazi."  
</P>
<P>
 Need to get a handle on that inner Nazi? Here's a sample question from 
Graham's little quiz to see who's in charge:  
</P>
<P>
 When Mel Gibson got married, did you A) feel really bummed and rejected 
because you knew that if only you had visualized yourself married to Mel, today 
you would be the much-envied Mrs. G? B) think the reason he didn't marry any of 
your friends either is because they're lousy at visualizing too? C) consider 
that one reason Mel married the woman he did was because he had actually met 
her?  
</P>
<P>
 If you answered anything but C you've got a problem.  
</P>
<P>
 "Poodles" has been excerpted in People and reviewed in Entertainment Weekly, 
and Graham has been appearing on dozens of morning radio and TV talk shows. 
With an initial first run of nearly 40,000 copies, the book is expected to go 
into a second printing soon.  
</P>
<P>
 Graham conceived "Poodles" as a serious antidote to New-Age excesses -- "these 
wailing weekends at airport Holiday Inns." 
</P>
<P>
 She has done most of the things she parodies in her book -- yoga, dream 
workshops, growth workshops. She's always been interested in self-exploration 
and the spiritual.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so much a product of the '60s," the former hippie says. "I feel I was one 
of those people searching for the cosmic big bang of healing. Then one day I 
realized there was no big bang of healing."  
</P>
<P>
 Graham, in Los Angeles on a national book tour, is sitting in a posh suite at 
the Beverly Prescott Hotel. Dressed in a pale green T-shirt, khaki slacks and 
very expensive Joan and David suede flats, her short hair cut stylishly, she 
looks nothing like her previous counterculture self. Pinned to her jacket lapel 
is a poodle decorated with tiny rhinestones, made by a cousin for her book 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
 So why poodles and not, say, Persian cats? She offers this explanation: 
"Poodles are descended from wolves, but they progress. They know the importance 
of a good haircut."  
</P>
<P>
 "Poodles" was channeled by Ethel, a lounge singer in Atlantis 50,000 years 
ago, she goes on. "When I finished a chapter, I never knew what I was going to 
write next. My only explanation is Ethel."  
</P>
<P>
 What drove Graham over the edge into clarity and the book was one more 
workshop, she says. In the winter of '93, on a story assignment for Self, 
Graham attended a past lives workshop.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was like a scene out of Marat/de Sade. There were 26 people, and we split 
into pairs, and we're all supposed to relive a death. There's all these people 
lying on the floor, screaming and wailing. On one side this woman is being 
gang-raped by a pack of 15th-Century infidels. Then across the room a man is 
vomiting into a white plastic grocery bag. I was in medieval England, about to 
be hung. 
</P>
<P>
 "The woman who's leading me is much more caught up in my story than I am. And 
she's supposed to be leading me but she's weeping hysterically." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the guide was so overcome by emotion she had to be relieved by an 
assistant. "It was ludicrous," Graham says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Graham came up with her title while joking with an editor from HarperCollins 
San Francisco, home to many New-Age authors, about Clarissa Pinkola Estes' 
best-selling 1992 book, "Women Who Run With the Wolves." Graham didn't have a 
book in mind, but when the editor asked Graham to submit a proposal, she did, 
and the book was signed. 
</P>
<P>
 According to one source at the publisher, when Estes learned about the title 
of Graham's book, she put in an angry call to Tom Grady, HarperCollins San 
Francisco's publisher. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon the publishing house was flooded with faxes and phone calls from some of 
its feminist authors. In a voice mail message to one staffer, a writer accused 
"Poodles" of "undoing the 20 years of work we've spent trying to empower 
women." 
</P>
<P>
 Deena Metzger, a Los Angeles therapist and prominent Harper San Francisco 
author, was one of the protesters. She says Graham not only ridicules Estes' 
book, but women in general. 
</P>
<P>
 "You take that title, and you go from wolves to poodles, implying dogs that 
are very far from wild, that are denied their essential nature in the interest 
of fashion, you are then talking about women who are the same." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think every movement needs humor," says Peggy Taylor, editor of the New Age 
Journal, whose magazine ran a story on the "Poodle" controversy in its June 
issue. "What I like about Barbara's book is it's not mean humor. She's done all 
this stuff. She's adding some levity to the crazy trips we all go on."  
</P>
<P>
 But Harper San Francisco apparently didn't see the levity. Under pressure from 
what a staffer calls "the PC police" and threats that some women authors might 
bolt, the publisher demanded that Graham change the title. Graham refused, and 
Avon snapped up "Poodles" soon after. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Grady nor Estes will discuss the affair. Estes' agent, Ned Leavitt, 
says he has nothing to say beyond what he'd told New Age Journal, which is 
this: "Why not satirize someone whose work is truly harmful instead of publicly 
making fun of a valuable healer like Dr. Estes, whose work needs and deserves 
our support?"  
</P>
<P>
 The flap has only fueled publicity for Graham's book. "Clarissa and I have 
become like the Tonya and Nancy of the New Age, only I'm not sure who's who," 
Graham says. 
</P>
<P>
 But Graham is upset by the negative reaction from Estes and other spirituality 
authors, whose work she respects. "I see this as a trickster book," she says, 
referring to an archetype in Native American culture, which Estes and many 
others revere. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're losing sight of the role of the trickster, who keeps things from 
getting too sanctimonious."  
</P>
<P>
 For all its excesses, "the New-Age psychoculture is very valuable. I have 
personally benefited from it enormously," she says. "My book is trying to get 
across a message that, run with the wolves, bleat with the sheep, but also 
value yourself the way you are." 
</P>
<P>
 'I'm so much a product of the '60s. I feel I was one of those people searching 
for the cosmic big bang of healing. Then one day I realized there was no big 
bang of healing.'

COMMITMENTS; ADVICE IS ALL IN HOW YOU GIVE IT; WE ALL FEEL THE URGE TO ADVISE.

 Suspecting her husband of having an affair, a woman confided in her friend, 
Judye Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds, who has been happily married for 10 years and wanted to help, 
suggested Bible readings and an appointment with a particular marriage 
counselor. 
</P>
<P>
 But because of the deeply personal nature of the problem, Reynolds, of Mission 
Hills, said she didn't give her friend advice, only suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
 To Reynolds, a computer instructor at Glendale Community College, there's a 
difference. Advice, she said, involves telling someone how to fix their 
problem. A suggestion is softer, less direct, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever its form, advice is given so freely so often that many people don't 
even realize how automatically they offer it, experts say. People seem driven 
to make things better for both altruistic and selfish reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Advice can range from "the mildest suggestions to the most insistent command," 
said Gerald Goodman, UCLA psychology professor and author of the "Talk Book: 
The Intimate Science of Communicating in Close Relationships" (Rodale Press, 
1988.) 
</P>
<P>
 Advice can be as cautious as "Shouldn't you be resting that foot?" or as 
direct as "Keep your voice down; the baby is sleeping." People in intimate 
relationships can successfully use authoritative commands -- such as "stretch 
before you run" -- that they would never use in a casual chat with a neighbor, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although advice may be worth what you pay for it, most counsel is given free 
to family and friends and to a lesser extent to colleagues and strangers, 
Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Topping the list of motivators for giving guidance is the desire to help 
someone, he added. The advice, although perhaps presumptuous, is still sincere. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds said her heart is in the right place when she gives advice. "If 
someone seems desperate, I feel awful leaving him hanging when I have an idea. 
. . . It's out of love; not a busybody-ness," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Suggestions can also be driven by a desire to advance one's agenda, rather 
than improve someone else's lot. Although not necessarily mean-spirited, these 
recommendations are always selfish. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Garner, president and founder of a Santa Ana-based mortgage brokerage 
firm, said he is regularly offered advice by salespeople. 
</P>
<P>
 It "is probably self-serving," he said, especially in matters of pay raises. 
Still, he will not automatically dismiss it. "That doesn't mean it doesn't 
warrant looking into," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Busy people sometimes offer quick but unsatisfying suggestions, especially in 
dealings with acquaintances and co-workers, Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Picture this, he said: You're on your way down the hall at the office when a 
colleague stops to chat. He says he is worried about his taxes. You suggest he 
read a book on income taxes, promise to do lunch and head off. 
</P>
<P>
 The motive for superficial pieces of wisdom is to avoid dealing with a serious 
complaint and still appear courteous. The adviser may be rushed or emotionally 
unable to deal with a painful story, Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Giving advice can be ego boosting, allowing someone to feel smart and 
important. One way people can experience their importance is vicariously 
through listening to call-in radio shows and reading columns in newspapers or 
magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives the (reader) an opportunity to put himself in the position of the 
advice-giver," said psychologist Leslie Maxson, who has a practice in Glendale 
and writes the "Can We Talk?" advice column in L.A. Parent magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly readers and listeners also want to gain information and be assured 
that their problems aren't so bad -- but the real joy is in second-guessing the 
expert. In mentally drawing on their experiences to aid the helpless caller or 
writer, people can confirm that they know more than both the questioner and the 
adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 And on subjects about which people are truly knowledgeable, few can resist 
being the adviser, Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Goodman acknowledged that as a former race car driver, he must tell 
people how to drive. "I can't resist advising people on the best way to 
negotiate a corner or the best way to time gear shifts. The urge to advise is 
so strong that I'll create a scene and become obnoxious."

CAN THIS MARRIAGE BE SAVED?: HER OBESITY MASKS THE REAL ISSUES FOR COUPLE

<P>
 Michelle is certain that Eric, her husband of 10 years, is going to leave her. 
"He says he loves me," the 35-year-old civil engineer says, "but I know he 
doesn't mean it. And it's all because I'm too fat." 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle never dreamed that anyone would fall in love with an ugly, overweight 
girl like her. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother convinced me of that. And she would hit me or scream at me whenever 
I didn't do something right." 
</P>
<P>
 Miserable at home -- her father, whom she adored, pretended not to notice -- 
Michelle buried herself in books. She met Eric in a college physics lab and 
fell instantly in love with the shy, soft-spoken young man who really seemed to 
care about her. 
</P>
<P>
 But in all the time they've been married, she says, he has never stopped 
criticizing her weight. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's always suggesting some new book or diet. He makes me nuts." 
</P>
<P>
 What hurts the most is that Eric doesn't want to spend time with her anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "After work, he heads straight to the gym to play basketball, and he doesn't 
get home before 10 p.m." 
</P>
<P>
 On the rare nights that they're home together, she reports, he sits on the 
couch and watches TV -- just like his father did. If she goes over to sit next 
to him to cuddle, he gets up and walks into the other room. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pretty soon," Michelle adds, "he'll fall in love with some waif-like, 
19-year-old who worships him and leave me for good." 
</P>
<P>
 Eric, 37, an executive with a paper company, can't believe the way his wife 
misinterprets everything. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, I can't get this woman to believe that I love her," he says with a 
sigh. "Yes, I want her to lose weight, but the reason I talk to her about her 
diet and tell her what to eat and urge her to exercise is not because I think 
she's ugly. It's unhealthy to be as heavy as she is -- pure and simple. I 
haven't asked her to wear a bikini or to win an Olympic medal. The only thing I 
have ever asked is that she lose a little weight. Why can't she do that?" 
</P>
<P>
 Eric admits, though, that he finds Michelle's neediness hard to handle. 
</P>
<P>
 "She smothers me," he says. "I can't go to the bathroom for five minutes to 
take out my contact lenses without her saying, 'Eric, Eric, where are you?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Nor does he much appreciate the way he says she exaggerates. 
</P>
<P>
 "She makes it sound as if I'm out all the time. That's not true. I play 
basketball twice a week for two hours tops," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look," he adds, "I'm not the lovey-dovey type -- my family was much more 
reserved than hers. We certainly never screamed at each other in the way she 
screams at me." 
</P>
<P>
 Eric wants to stay married, but the more Michelle tries to pull him closer, 
the faster he runs the other way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although on the surface this couple is fighting about Michelle's weight 
problem, we believed that issue was a red herring," say Evelyn Moschetta and 
Paul Moschetta, a New York counseling team. 
</P>
<P>
 Many times, the ostensible reason a couple will come to counseling masks 
another underlying issue. True, Michelle needs to consult a weight-loss 
specialist, but that's not a marital problem. Michelle and Eric need to 
concentrate on reconciling their very different emotional styles. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle is outgoing, demonstrative and desperate for affection. When she 
senses any distance from Eric, she grows anxious. She eats, and she clings to 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric is the epitome of the rational man. Raised in an orderly, undemonstrative 
household, where independence was valued, he recoils from his wife's 
dependency. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, in his home people rarely raised their voices. When his wife 
speaks angrily, his emotional hot button is pushed, and he withdraws. 
</P>
<P>
 Our relationship with our mate often triggers emotions that hark back to 
childhood. How can you determine each other's hot buttons? 
</P>
<P>
 Think about what each of you needs most in a relationship -- and what 
frightens you the most. Share your thoughts with your spouse, and then look for 
ways to meet your own and each other's needs. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, aware that she is too attached to Eric, Michelle can make plans 
to see friends or go to a movie on the nights he plays ball. 
</P>
<P>
 If Eric knows that when he closes off from his wife she panics, he can offer 
small, consistent signs of affection -- a quick call from work, a hug on the 
way out the door -- to let her know how much he does love her.

COMMITMENTS; IN A RELATIONSHIP, BEING EQUAL HAS NO PEER

<P>
 Think of marriage as a deep, irreplaceable friendship. 
</P>
<P>
 It is truly intimate because so much, from child rearing to managing money, is 
shared equally. Partners communicate well and treat each other respectfully. 
</P>
<P>
 "People think about it as wonderland -- that it's a concept but not a 
reality," said sociologist Pepper Schwartz. Sad, said Schwartz, who studied 
couples who have that kind of relationship for her new book, "Peer Marriage" 
(Free Press). 
</P>
<P>
 "It's extremely possible, and extremely important, both as aspiration and 
achievement. But if they don't believe they can do it, of course they're not 
going to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz, a professor of sociology at the University of Washington, began her 
study of "peer marriages" from a large study of American couples she 
collaborated on more than 10 years ago. She went back to examine the 
relationships of egalitarian couples and to study others. She also drew upon 
her own experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Most marriages fit into Schwartz's categories of traditional or "near-peer," 
the latter being couples who say they want an egalitarian relationship, yet are 
stuck in gender-role stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Near-peers say, 'Yeah, we believe in equality, and if we could do it, we 
would,' " Schwartz said in an interview. "If you ask them, 'Well then, why 
don't you do it?' the two things they always say are the things traditional 
people believe in. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first is that they are investing in his career. . . . They want to 
maximize income, or don't want to endanger it," and so they put the man's job 
first. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, "they both believe in the female ownership of children" -- the mother is 
presumed to be the primary parent. 
</P>
<P>
 Couples who settle for inequality are far more likely to be miserable -- and 
to divorce, Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a lot of traditional and near-peer marriages, I see women who are 
frustrated with less male involvement. There are times when they're 
overwhelmed, there are times when they really need him, want him to care, and 
he doesn't. He's uninvolved or unavailable. Sooner or later, that's more than a 
small thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Many men, she said, "are bored with their wives, bored with their marriages. . 
. . What happens in a lot of marriages is there's nothing to talk about except 
their general regard for each other and their general desire to be in a family 
together. But there's no content. They're not doing enough together." 
</P>
<P>
 Peer couples spend time together on mutual interests, which cements the 
relationship further. They find the time to be together that other couples 
don't -- partly by refusing to sacrifice their relationship by always putting 
kids first. 
</P>
<P>
 To create peer marriages, Schwartz found that couples: 
</P>
<P>
 * Carefully plot their work lives. They consider how a job will fit with their 
personal lives. Jobs that require endless hours at the office, or lengthy or 
unpredictable absences, are out. Money can't be everything. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most important is to be honest about what the job means and what is necessary 
for personal fulfillment," Schwartz writes. "Then negotiation is possible." 
</P>
<P>
 * Manage finances so that neither partner feels dependent on the other. Larger 
resources are pooled, but no one has to get permission for personal spending. 
</P>
<P>
 * Have mutual goals -- such as buying a house or early retirement -- that 
individuals contribute to but both profit from. 
</P>
<P>
 * Make clear by their actions that they are equal parents. 
</P>
<P>
 * Treat each other respectfully. They find that "treating the spouse no worse 
than a best friend has a continually civilizing effect," Schwartz writes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Figure out a system to divide household chores and responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dedicate energy to keeping their erotic life interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 Couples who create a marriage of equals often do so because they hated earlier 
relationships, Schwartz said. It isn't necessary to go through that to figure 
out how to have a satisfying marriage, she pointed out: "You don't have to 
savage the first 10 years."

COMMITMENTS; GUIDNCE ON GIVING COUNSEL

 Before giving advice, find out what the person has tried or thought of in 
solving the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Assume that the advisee has thought about the situation, tried something and 
has more ideas. Consider him the authority on his situation. "It's annoying to 
be offered problem-solving methods that have already been tried and discarded," 
said Gerald Goodman, UCLA psychology professor. 
</P>
<P>
 * Show empathy. Try to tune into the other person's experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 Psychologist Leslie Maxson said that in answering letters for an advice column 
in L.A. Parent magazine, she tries to put herself in the writer's shoes: "I try 
to imagine as well as I can what position the person is in, what their life 
situation is." Only then does she draw on her experiences and training to offer 
ideas. A good practice to use in person, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 * Show respect. Don't be judgmental or self-righteous. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more respect you can use in giving advice, the more likely the person 
will be able to hear what you're saying," Maxson said. "If you add a twist of 
morality, there is a tendency for the listener to ignore it." 
</P>
<P>
 * Be sensitive to whether the person will be interested in your input. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe he or she is just looking for a sympathetic ear. Check before plowing 
ahead with good advice. Judye Reynolds of Mission Hills said in the early years 
of her marriage that husband Larry charged in with advice "like a knight in 
shining armor" at the slightest mention of any problem. Having been reminded 
many times, Larry Reynolds now asks his wife: "Do you want my advice or is it a 
listening thing?" 
</P>
<P>
 * When asked, tell what worked for you. 
</P>
<P>
 One of most effective ways to make suggestions, Goodman said, is to share how 
you solved a similar problem. Through a story, you can offer a tested solution 
without being pushy.  
</P>
<P>
 When asked for advice, Robert Garner of Irvine prefers to share his 
experiences. As president and founder of a mortgage brokerage firm, Garner said 
he doesn't have the background to tell people how to solve their personal 
problems. With an employee or casual friend, Garner may even mask his personal 
story with an opener like "a friend of mine. . . ." PAULA LYNN PARKS

FIRST PERSON: TRIP TO MALL BRINGS ANTI-SEMITISM TOO CLOSE TO HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA HEIMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I've always thought of myself as an enlightened woman. I'm well-traveled and 
well-read. I watch "Oprah" and "Meet the Press." In an abstract sense, I was 
aware of the many forms of hate and prejudice in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 But I wasn't prepared when I experienced that hate firsthand -- not in a 
"Geraldo!" episode about skinheads, but at a local mall. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a busy shopping day, and my friend and I were having coffee outside a 
store. A paunchy man with curly red hair approached us, hawking discount 
tickets to a comedy club. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, thanks," I said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, thinking I would give the guy a chance, I agreed to look at the 
red-and-white sheets of tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Never mind," I said, after a quick glance. 
</P>
<P>
 The man squinted down at me. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you from New York?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No." 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you Jewish?" he queried, a sneer beginning to spread across his face. 
</P>
<P>
 "What does that have to do with anything?" I felt my body tense up. 
</P>
<P>
 "You Jews never want to pay for anything." 
</P>
<P>
 I felt as if I had been punched in the stomach. I stared at him, speechless. 
He grabbed the tickets and strutted away. I watched him through a haze of 
passing shoppers until he stood, laughing with his associate and looking at me. 
</P>
<P>
 I wanted to do something, to retaliate, to wipe the smirk off his face. But I 
felt completely impotent. Even as the tears welled up, I found myself trying to 
downplay the incident to my non-Jewish friend, as if it were no big deal. 
</P>
<P>
 I even felt embarrassed -- an emotion I didn't understand. I am open about my 
Judaism and proud of it. But that man's comment made me feel like there was 
something wrong with me. My friend wanted to confront the perpetrator, but I 
persuaded him not to. I just wanted to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 That night, I told a Jewish friend about the incident. He has recounted many 
stories of his own anti-Semitic experiences -- of being chased down the streets 
of New York, his pursuers screaming, "Heil Hitler"; of being threatened and 
even beaten up on subways because he wears a yarmulke identifying him as 
Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to expect this kind of thing," he said. "It's everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 In my head, I've known it's there. I know about the history of persecution of 
Jews. I know about the Holocaust. I read about the growth of world 
anti-Semitism, and I've seen the anti-Semitic leaflets that have been 
distributed at local high schools recently. But it wasn't entirely real to me 
until that day. 
</P>
<P>
 I know what happened to me is minor, that many people are verbally and 
physically assaulted daily because of their race or religion. But that 
hate-filled slur, delivered so casually, leveled me. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe I should consider myself lucky that I have lived 26 years free of the 
effects of anti-Semitism. I maintained a naive, childlike illusion that no one 
could hate me just because I'm Jewish. I'm a nice person, a contributing member 
of society. How could anyone hate or judge me without even knowing me? 
</P>
<P>
 I now know differently. 
</P>
<P>
 Later that week, I decided to phone the comedy club the man represented. I 
recounted the incident to the manger, who apologized. But something had changed 
in me. I didn't trust his apology. Maybe he was sincere, or perhaps, I thought, 
he was just afraid of losing business, of getting a bad reputation. It's not 
politically correct nowadays to be anti-Semitic -- at least not openly. 
</P>
<P>
 He gave me the name of the promotional company he said was responsible for the 
mall vendors. I spoke with the president of that company, who was very nice and 
equally apologetic. He said the employee had been "bawled out." 
</P>
<P>
 But I had the same eerie, mistrustful feeling after speaking with this man. 
Was he really sorry? Or was he mouthing all the right words, while thinking: 
"Those Jews always cause so much trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 "I should have him come clean your house or wash your car," he said, 
half-jokingly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want him anywhere near my house or my car. Send him to the Museum of 
Tolerance or to 'Schindler's List,' " I responded. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, I know the man who offended me in the mall is set in his 
feeling about Jews -- and probably about African Americans, Latinos and 
everyone else who is not like him. We are them . He can blame us for his 
problems. And he probably has a family and friends who feel the same way. No 
movie or museum will change their minds. 
</P>
<P>
 How many other people harbor similar feelings but never express them, I 
wondered. For weeks after that incident I walked around looking at co-workers, 
people I passed on the street, sales clerks at stores, thinking: Who hates me 
because I'm Jewish? Who thinks I'm cheap, or manipulative, or trying to take 
over the world because I'm Jewish? 
</P>
<P>
 I suddenly felt hyper-aware of my actions, as if any annoying thing that I did 
might be attributed to the fact that I'm Jewish. I felt a huge responsibility 
for my behavior, that now everything I do reflects not just me, but a whole 
race of people. 
</P>
<P>
 The intensity of those feelings has passed, and I am no longer overcome with 
distrust and fear. But I am cynical. And I think it's better that way. 
</P>
<P>
 In my head, I've known it's there. I know about the history of persecution of 
Jews. I know about the Holocaust. I read about the growth of world 
anti-Semitism, and I've seen the anti-Semitic leaflets that have been 
distributed at local high schools recently. But it wasn't entirely real to me 
until that day.

UNMEMORABLE SONGS MAKE FOR A MEMORABLE EVENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first rule for singer-songwriters is to send 'em home humming. 
</P>
<P>
 David Wilcox is an exception. The Ohio-bred, North Carolina-based folk-pop 
performer isn't exactly a tin ear, but he seldom hits upon a melody that will 
come back to a listener unbidden and start buzzing around the brain like some 
ornery housefly. 
</P>
<P>
 What Wilcox offers is a package of interlocking elements that work. The tunes 
may not be memorable, but they are attractive in the moment he sings them. The 
music propels lyrics that are invariably intelligent and ambitious in their 
psychological realism and willingness to take on the big existential questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Factor in a strong acoustic guitar technique that eschews simplistic strumming 
in favor of expressive finger-picking in a variety of tunings, and a pleasant 
voice that sounds like a more insistent, fuller-bodied James Taylor, and you 
have a solid solo-acoustic performer who will make his way even if he doesn't 
serve ear candy. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one song Wilcox sang Saturday night for a large and enraptured Coach 
House crowd sounded like a hit. That's because it was a hit: "Missing You," the 
John Waite chart-topper from 1984. Wilcox made it the last of the two dozen 
songs he sang (just as it ends his current album, "Big Horizon"). It was an 
anticlimactic add-on, just as it is on the album. "Missing You" may have one of 
those buzz-the-brain melodies, but it's a dumb song of the formulaic 
I'm-heartbroken-but-I-won't-admit-it mold. 
</P>
<P>
 In singing it, Wilcox mustered a convincing measure of anguish. But by the 
time he got around to "Missing You," it seemed like a bit of slumming: he 
already had explored heartbreak (and recovery therefrom) far more insightfully 
in his own songs. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilcox's best songs distill bits of recognizable experience. In "Language of 
the Heart," a love affair begins with a luminous moment of erotic passion, only 
to become clouded by misread signals. In the Springsteenian scenario of 
"Saturday They'll All Be Back Again," small-town youth feel the tug of some 
dimly understood inner calling that makes them tear at the too-thin fabric of 
their lives. These were just two of many strong examples of song craft that 
turned up in Wilcox's 100-minute show. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Wilcox slips as a writer, it's usually because he gets carried away with 
metaphors and grand concepts. Suddenly the drawn-from-life characters and 
situations that vitalize his good songs disappear, and he slips into 
pop-psychological preachments on the need to keep striving and hoping in the 
face of life's blows. That tendency toward the big statement crops up more 
often on "Big Horizon" than on its two precursors,given songs like "That's What 
the Lonely Is For," "Farthest Shore" and "Make It Look Easy," all of them 
life-lessons rather than capsules of lived life. 
</P>
<P>
 While Wilcox is always on the lookout for reason to hope, he is no Pollyanna. 
Still, he doesn't probe as deeply into the shadows as such masters as Richard 
Thompson and John Hiatt.  
</P>
<P>
 Wilcox didn't play one of his most memorable songs, "Chet Baker's Unsung Swan 
Song," in which he imagines the jazz player's last moments before a suicide 
leap. That one gives despair its due -- always a good idea for artists who want 
to take recovery as their theme. An honest assessment can emphasize 
hopefulness, but it must first acknowledge that some people just wind up as 
hopeless casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilcox's key themes may be serious, but he had no problem infusing the evening 
with a good number of lighthearted diversions. Like James Taylor, Wilcox brings 
in songs with bluesy inflections and old-line rock 'n' roll rhythms to offset 
the fervent cast of the main body of his work. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't go in for light, off-the-cuff gab and spontaneous interaction with 
fans, devices used by many an accomplished solo performer to loosen up a crowd 
(judging from the robust cheering that greeted Wilcox from the start, no 
loosening was required for the near-capacity Coach House crowd). But humor was 
a major part of the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Comical novelty songs cropped up regularly -- "Blow 'Em Away," about a guy who 
responds murderously to murderous traffic, naturally got the biggest roars from 
a Southern California crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The most interesting departure was an odd new song, set to a mysterious, 
gleaming Irish jig guitar accompaniment, that opened with the line "After your 
orgasm, the world is a different place." It proceeded to treat sex as both a 
mystical transformation and a source of tongue-in-cheek humor. In a good, 
unusual touch, Wilcox introduced several numbers by reciting Ogden Nash-style 
comic verses that obliquely touched on the theme of the song to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilcox included a good chunk of new and unfamiliar material. A song apparently 
titled "Spin" was so new that he sang it with a lyric sheet balanced 
precariously on top of his guitar. It likened love to a circus ride that leaves 
you dizzy -- not the most original conceit, perhaps, but the tune had more pop 
pith than is typical for Wilcox. Maybe he'll find that missing humability 
factor yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's hope he also holds onto the other admirable qualities that made this a 
diverse and diverting show even without the kinds of melodies that keep on 
playing in your head.

PCS TAP INTO HOLLYWOOD'S STORY LINE; CD-ROM SYSTEM GIVES AUDIENCE AN 
INTERACTIVE ROLE IN PLOTTING MOVIES, BUT IS IT REALLY DRAMA? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE DUTKA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Wednesday -- 27 years after a cumbersome two-projector system allowed the 
audience to vote on the ending of a movie at the Montreal Expo's Czech Pavilion 
-- the interactive CD-ROM version of a feature film will premiere at the 
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
 Digitized images of Margot Kidder, Brian Keith and Russell Means in "Under a 
Killing Moon" propel the action on 25 17-inch screens as viewers make choices 
by computer. Tapping into the increased storage capacity of CD-ROMs (each of 
which stores the equivalent of 300,000 typewritten pages or 1,100 floppy 
discs), the $2.5-million adventure-mystery thrusts people into a 3-D "virtual 
world" in which they search for clues and influence the course of dialogue and 
narrative. Though the picture image has yet to equal videotape quality, it's a 
cut above the computer imagery of the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "Technology is now powerful enough so we can show 'acting' instead of 
cartoons," says Chris Jones, executive vice president of the Salt Lake 
City-based Access Software, which produced the project, scheduled for an August 
release at video, computer and retail stores at a suggested price of $99. 
"We're crossing the line from video games into interactive movies that can be 
serious contenders in the entertainment marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While some still fail to see the distinction between an "interactive movie" 
and a technologically sophisticated video game, the premiere does testify to 
the increasing cross-pollination between the Silicon Valley and Hollywood -- 
two parties bonded by commercial symbiosis. The video-game industry milks the 
recognition value of movies such as "Aladdin" and "Jurassic Park" by offering 
these blockbusters on a CD-ROM format. Feature filmmakers -- as well as the 
unions and agencies representing them -- are looking to the new technology to 
extend the bounds of traditional movie-making and provide new sources of 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the 1990s version of the 1848 Gold Rush," says Michael Prohaska, senior 
administrator of the Screen Actors Guild's year-old Industrial and Interactive 
Contracts Division. "No one knows if there's a future there. But everyone's 
panning for gold." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Clint Eastwood announced that he would team up to develop a CD-ROM 
on his life and career, citing the potential of the medium to "entertain and 
inform." Chuck Norris is beginning production on the first of three live-action 
video games lined up in a multimillion-dollar deal, following Steven Seagal, 
who licensed his name and likeness for use in an original CD-ROM project. And, 
taking a cue from Sylvester Stallone and Wesley Snipes, who shot extra scenes 
for a "Demolition Man" video game, filmmakers are now trying to amass this 
footage during regular production schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 On the studio front, Viacom New Media is releasing video game versions of 
Paramount Television's "Star Trek: Deep Space Nine" and the short-lived 
"Viper." And other entertainment giants such as Sony, Walt Disney and Time 
Warner have set up interactive divisions in-house. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of creative people -- directors, actors, musicians, writers -- are 
interested in working in the medium," says Dan Adler, a Creative Artists agent 
specializing in new media. "Though there's always some resistance to change, as 
artists they're intrigued by the promise of another canvas on which to work." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the new technology also poses a new set of creative challenges. 
Shooting actors individually against a "blue screen" -- a process through which 
characters can be superimposed on a variety of backgrounds -- can be 
painstaking and static. 
</P>
<P>
 And recording "conversation trees" -- multiple versions of scenes to permit 
for a variety of interactive choices -- works against continuity and character 
development.  
</P>
<P>
 Margot Kidder, best known as Lois Lane in the "Superman" movies, says she 
spent six months just learning how to block and move. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really wasn't acting," she maintains. "I felt like a frog leaping over 
moats in those video games since everything was motivated by computer logic. 
Interactive movies are a fascinating way of working without compromising your 
morality while you wait for parts that appeal on an artistic level. But they 
have too many variables to correspond to the age-old rules of 'drama.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Others in the industry agree, insisting that the "stop-start" nature of the 
format interrupts the flow and that the public prefers its entertainment 
spoon-fed. Involving people in video games is well and good, the argument goes, 
but movies necessitate a suspension of belief. 
</P>
<P>
 "People want to be told stories . . . not create them," says a leading 
developer of entertainment software. "Even writers find the creative process to 
be work. When was the last time you read an interactive novel? Technology can't 
create new behavior. It just allows existing behavior to happen more readily." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Zito, president of the San Mateo-based Digital Pictures, acknowledges the 
hurdles but cautions against judging a product in its infancy. Since 1987, he's 
produced 18 interactive movies and, in five years, he predicts, we'll be seeing 
interactive news broadcasts, game shows and soap operas as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Comparing an interactive movie to a linear one is like comparing 'The Kiss' 
-- one of Thomas Edison's first films -- to 'Sleepless in Seattle,' " says 
Zito, whose outfit just signed contracts with the Directors Guild and SAG. 
"When CD-ROM hardware becomes more available, our budgets will go up and we'll 
attract A-list talent. For now, though, we can't spend more than $2 million to 
$3 million -- the price of a TV movie -- on a project if we're interested in 
making a profit." 
</P>
<P>
 The challenge, according to SAG, is helping the fledgling industry to fly 
while protecting the legal and financial interests of its membership. No 
likenesses can be used without authorization. Actors must command a decent 
wage. Currently, the contract specifies that a performer gets $485 for an 
eight-hour day plus 12.65% for pension and health benefits. As the industry 
matures, the union suggests, residuals and royalties based on unit sales should 
be part of the package. 
</P>
<P>
 In part, the growth of the market is linked to CD-ROM hardware, currently 
available in 3% to 4% of American homes -- far behind the 62% that subscribe to 
cable and the 77% that own VCRs. Still, industry analysts expect the number to 
soar now that the cost of upgrading a computer with a sound board and CD-ROM 
drive is less than $200 (down from over $1,000 three years ago) and the 
hardware is included in most new computers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly twice as many American households had CD-ROMs this year compared to 
1993, according to the market research firm Dataquest. That figure should more 
than double by 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 "The technology is changing every day -- and that's what's scary," says Frank 
Loverme, executive director of CD-ROM sales at WEA Manufacturing, a Time Warner 
company. "Five years from now, watching 'Under a Killing Moon' will look like 
'Superman' in the '50s. Part of the frontier mentality is that no one knows 
what's going on. There are no rules. No one is sharing information. Everyone 
has his own agenda -- and the person who guesses right will win." 
</P>
<P>
 "Killing Moon's" Chris Jones is optimistic, nonetheless. "Sure it's a bit of a 
high-wire act, but much less so than when we started two years ago," he says. 
"We threw out the floppy (disc), closed our eyes, and bet that (CD-ROM) 
technology would drive the marketplace. It was the smartest thing we could have 
done."

 With the historic Pasadena Playhouse in financial straits, the Pasadena City 
Council will vote tonight on whether to loan $200,000 to the theater company. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, as expected, the cash will ensure that the musical "Heartbeats" 
opens as planned on Sunday and will keep the Playhouse going until subscription 
renewals for the soon-to-be-announced winter/spring season begin to arrive 
later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The Playhouse already has received half of the loan on an emergency basis, in 
an action authorized by Pasadena City Manager Philip A. Hawkey in response to 
actions taken by the City Council in a closed session on June 27. Hawkey and 
other city officials praised the Playhouse in glowing terms last week, 
emphasizing its importance to their city and especially to a 16-block 
redevelopment area to be called the Playhouse District. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Playhouse owner David Houk said he hopes the subscriber base at the Playhouse 
will return to 20,000 from the current 16,000 by the time "Heartbeats" closes 
on Aug. 21. In conjunction with cost cutbacks -- 44 out of 130 employees of 
Houk's management company, Theatre Corp. of America, were recently laid off -- 
this anticipated growth could restore a measure of stability to the Playhouse. 
A new restaurant, Critixx, which is renting space on the north side of the 
Playhouse, may provide additional revenue and customers. 
</P>
<P>
 In his loan request, Houk blamed the current crisis on reduced ticket sales 
because of the recession and the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no complaints about the shows" that have been presented recently, he 
added in an interview. He acknowledged that the rapid expansion of his 
company's touring programs contributed to the cash crunch -- before most of the 
tours were abruptly aborted in May -- but he expressed confidence that 
amortizing production costs through tours will eventually pay off. 
</P>
<P>
 Houk has long steered clear of government assistance. For now, "he changed his 
mind," said city manager Hawkey. "I admire his vision. But that vision has cost 
him millions of dollars. His theory has yet to be proven." 
</P>
<P>
 But Houk denied that he had changed his mind. He's opposed to government 
grants, but not necessarily to loans, he said. He wouldn't say what 
circumstances might induce him to ask for further government aid. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange for its 7.5%-interest loan -- on which payments are deferred until 
Jan. 1 -- the city gets a fourth deed of trust on the Playhouse property. The 
city will supervise the spending of its money via Rick Barr, manager of the 
Pasadena Civic Auditorium. The city agency that operates the Civic Auditorium 
is providing half of the loan money, with the other half coming from the 
Downtown Redevelopment Project. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Looking beyond the bandage provided by the city loan, Houk said the long-term 
solution to the Playhouse's financial woes lies in a restructuring of the 
complicated legal relationship between the Playhouse and the city. City 
officials are working on this project now, confirmed Hawkey, who predicted that 
the process would take at least six months. 
</P>
<P>
 The restructuring would enable the revenues from Playhouse productions to go 
to Houk's management company, Theatre Corp. of America, rather than first 
passing through the nonprofit Pasadena Playhouse State Theatre organization -- 
which would become simply a support group. Houk said this arrangement would 
clarify the profit/nonprofit mix under which the Playhouse operates and enable 
him to attract more private investment in the Theatre Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, "every show will have to make money," Hawkey said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're always in that position," Houk said, "but it's impossible to do. That's 
why I need to restructure. We're hanging on until I can accomplish that." 
</P>
<P>
 After "Heartbeats," the next show scheduled to face this kind of do-or-die 
challenge has been changed. L.A.-based Mary Hanes' "The Crimson Thread" -- a 
story of three generations of Irish immigrant sisters -- will replace "The 
Titans," a new play about the Kennedy family, in the season's Sept. 9-Oct. 23 
slot. 
</P>
<P>
 Playhouse Executive Director Lars Hansen said the switch isn't primarily for 
cost-cutting reasons, although "The Crimson Thread" will feature a cast of 
three, compared to the five required for "The Titans." Rather, Hansen felt "The 
Titans" wasn't ready and that it might have been inappropriate to present it so 
soon after the death of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.

HOWARD ROSENBERG / TELEVISION: LIMBAUGH DEVOTEES RUSH TO HIS DEFENSE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dittoheads (as Rush Limbaugh disciples call themselves) unite!  
</P>
<P>
 The old mailbag is bulging with comments -- overwhelmingly critical -- about 
recent columns concerning radio/TV personality Rush Limbaugh. The first column 
faulted Limbaugh for mocking the pain of a lobster that was sliced open and 
pan-fried alive during a "Today" show cooking segment.  
</P>
<P>
 Ridiculing his self-anointment as a one-man truth squad, the second column 
drew largely from an extensive list of Limbaugh "whoppers" compiled by Fairness 
& Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR), a New York media watchdog far to the left of 
Limbaugh's rabid conservatism.  
</P>
<P>
 As these letters show, the source of the biggest whoppers is in dispute.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I am neither a dittohead nor an apologist for Rush Limbaugh. I am a man of my 
own wit, with which I take aim at your article. Of the eight bulleted Limbaugh 
items you cite that included a FAIR rebuttal, I would take issue with FAIR on 
four of them. Hmmm, I believe that gives you about the same percentage of 
accuracy, in my book, as Limbaugh, according to your own "truth-o-meter," that 
is. 
</P>
<P>
 The first three are mainly contextual issues and matters of convenient 
interpretation. They are nothing compared to the total misinformation FAIR 
rendered on President James Madison. 
</P>
<P>
 Rush: We have staked the future . . . upon the capacity of each and all of us 
to govern ourselves, to control ourselves, to sustain ourselves according to 
the Ten Commandments of God. 
</P>
<P>
 FAIR quoted an associate editor of "The Madison Papers" as saying this is 
"entirely inconsistent with everything we know about Madison's views on 
religion and government." 
</P>
<P>
 This is revisionism at its worst. Here (as quoted in "The Myth of Separation" 
by David Barton) is precisely what Madison said: "We have staked the whole 
future of American civilization, not upon the power of government, far from it. 
We have staked the future of all of our political institutions upon the 
capacity of mankind for self government; upon the capacity of each and all of 
us to govern ourselves, to control ourselves, to sustain ourselves according to 
the Ten Commandments of God."

 On the assumption that you selected the most telling points published by FAIR, 
it is obvious that if these are their most powerful points, they don't got 
nuttin'. Could the L.A. Times pass such a fine-toothed-comb test? NBC News? CBS 
or ABC or CNN?

 Eat your heart out. Why don't you and Clinton get your own radio show and stop 
harassing Rush? You liberals have Michael Jackson, Jerry Brown, public radio, 
Don Imus, plus many others. So stop your whining. With all the lies you and 
your paper and the liberal media have told us, along with the Clintons, there 
wouldn't be enough trees in America to publish them all!

 You characterized as "crude" and "low burlesque" Rush Limbaugh's segment on 
the lobster cooking. You described the lobster as "poor" and cited experts on 
invertebrates in relating that ". . . lobsters are complex creatures that have 
a brain and sensitivity to pain." 
</P>
<P>
 You obviously missed Limbaugh's point. Pre-born babies -- "fetuses" in 
pro-abortion terms -- are also complex creatures that have a brain and 
sensitivity to pain. Limbaugh's point was to make us ask ourselves why we care 
that a " . . . live lobster had its tail cut off and its body slit opened 
before being sauteed -- still writhing . . . " and we care not that thousands 
of pre-born children endure much more agonizing and painful deaths every day in 
the legal abortion slaughterhouses in this country.

</P>
<P>
 I can't see anything dangerous about Limbaugh, but he does represent something 
dangerous. This is the Butt-head notion that cruelty is funny, clever, witty or 
chic. Limbaugh's gloating over the lobster was of a piece with his taunting of 
River Phoenix's parents over the death of their son. 
</P>
<P>
 Ganging up and picking on a person or animal that is vulnerable in some way, 
and enjoying its pain, is not unusual in children. Perhaps it's curiosity or a 
way to exercise power over something. However, most of us grow out of it, as we 
develop some imagination and useful skills. 
</P>
<P>
 It's predictable that some of the verbal hatred leads to action -- to 
assaults, harassment and housing or job discrimination. Our century shows that 
things can get much worse without the traditional values of kindness, 
compassion and fairness. If ridicule of these values is seen as evidence of wit 
or originality, we may be in trouble. This is the danger Limbaugh represents.

<P>
 My strong disagreements with him aside, one of the things Limbaugh is 
absolutely correct on is the issue of so-called animal "rights," especially 
when it comes to animals we consume as food. I am Homo sapiens. My species 
climbed to the top of the food chain over all other inferior species. I eat 
other inferior species. I do not take delight in the suffering of other 
species, but I, like Limbaugh, do take immense delight in skewering 
self-loathing humans who choose to value all other life above that of the human 
race. Neither he nor I are laughing at the "suffering" of a lobster; rather, we 
are chuckling at the folly of a group of people we believe to be idiots.

 Lobsters and other animals are killed for our eating pleasure. They just don't 
die and automatically jump onto our plates when we are ready to eat them. If 
you don't like it, stick to your veggies, but don't criticize us for not 
wanting to live like you. Over 22 million listeners would consider you and not 
Rush Limbaugh the "slabhead" here.

THEATER REVIEW; 'TWELFTH NIGHT' THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For Shakespearean directors, "Twelfth Night" is one big sandbox play -- go in 
your corner and mold it into any shape or size you wish. That, along with its 
obvious attraction as one of Shakespeare's finer marriages of tomfoolery and 
romance, is a major reason why "Twelfth Night" pops up so often. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially this summer, where it's popping up all over: two weeks ago at 
Shakespeare Festival/LA's Japanese Gardens space, this week at San Diego's Old 
Globe, and last week at Chapman University's Waltmar Theatre care of 
Shakespeare Orange County. Under Carl Reggiardo's direction, Shakespeare O.C.'s 
production is the only indoor staging of the three, but it feels expansive 
enough in the large Waltmar space. 
</P>
<P>
 Reggiardo, finding this a big enough sandbox to play in, has molded his very 
own "Twelfth Night," happily stealing from Lewis Carroll's "Alice" books. The 
idea is that the land of Ilyria, on which Viola (Kamella Tate) is shipwrecked 
in "Twelfth Night," is like the Looking Glass world into which Alice drops in 
the Carroll books. Maybe, it's suggested deep between the lines, the Victorian 
Carroll happily stole his inspiration from Elizabethan Shakespeare. Both works 
are about the perils felt by young women in a strange land filled with goofy 
characters who talk artful nonsense. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But directors' concepts can be curious, to use Alice's favorite word; the more 
they take hold, the more one can begin to doubt the connection. Most of the 
characters here are visually tied to a Looking Glass character. Lovelorn Olivia 
(Pauline Maranian), the countess who swoons for male servant Cesario (who is 
actually Viola in disguise), wears a headdress reminiscent of Carroll's the 
Duchess. The pompous, self-loving Malvolio (Wayne Alexander) wears a wig shaped 
like rabbit's ears -- the White Rabbit. Sir Toby Belch (Daniel Bryan Cartmell) 
has some of Humpty Dumpty's portliness, and likes to sit on a wall. Court 
jester Feste (Michael Nehring) resembles, first, the Mad Hatter, then the 
Caterpillar as he curls up in a corner smoking a pipe. 
</P>
<P>
 The tie-in begins to fray, though, with the costumes themselves (expertly 
crafted by Cathy Crane-McCoy). While Carroll was satirizing the British royal 
state and the Victorian one in particular, the costumes and Suzie Goff's set 
(though cleverly sprinkled with hearts and artificial facades) fix things in 
the Mediterranean Renaissance, where mercurial passions can create potentially 
strange bedfellows. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, this "Alice" connection is only skin deep. It isn't Viola who thinks 
the Ilyrians are mad, but her long-lost twin brother, Sebastian (Michael 
Strickland, who doesn't effectively twin with Tate). Belch is no hapless Humpty 
Dumpty, but a wily plotter of mischief. Malvolio is never late for a very 
important date, but just a fool-in-the-making. 
</P>
<P>
 Put this business aside, though, and you have a very nicely read "Twelfth 
Night" which tends to balance the play's loving and clowning better than many 
other versions. There could be far more sparks between Viola and Olivia, though 
Tate gets funnier as her Viola realizes the trap she's set for herself. 
Reggiardo's Duke and Alexander's Malvolio are cleverly mirrored here, more in 
love with the idea of being desired than with the one (Olivia) they each 
believe is desiring them. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing can be done to shorten the painfully drawn-out, mischievous torture of 
Malvolio, but the plotters are a funny bunch: Cartmell's Belch suggests a 
legitimate power-seeker who took the wrong career track and John Shouse's Sir 
Andrew is modestly understated, while Nehring milks every moment of Feste's 
punning and singing. 
</P>
<P>
 Concepts, like sandbox castles, have a way of eroding. Long after the "Alice" 
echoes have faded, it's the confidence of Reggiardo's cast steering through 
"Twelfth Night's" many moods that remains. 
</P>

'GUMP' AND 'KING' TAKE LION'S SHARE OF TICKETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID J. FOX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was another busy summer weekend at the movies, especially at theaters 
showing Paramount Pictures' "Forrest Gump" or Walt Disney Pictures' "The Lion 
King." Those two films accounted for about 50% of tickets sold on the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Barry London, Paramount president of worldwide distribution, 
estimated the Friday-through-Sunday gross for "Forrest Gump," which stars Tom 
Hanks, would be $24 million from 1,595 theaters, making it the weekend leader 
in the competitive summer movie field. Added to grosses for "Gump" preview 
showings on Wednesday and Thursday, the cumulative box-office total climbs to 
an impressive $32 million in its first five days. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, "Lion King" apparently slipped from first place to No. 2 in its 
fourth weekend of release. Disney reported a probable weekend gross of $23 
million on 2,565 screens and a total gross to date of $135 million. A large 
portion of that total is made up of receipts from lower-cost children's 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Final weekend box-office figures will be released today. 
</P>
<P>
 The results for "Gump" were achieved despite its 2-hour and 20-minute running 
time, which reduces the number of times the film can be shown daily. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's certainly off to a very impressive start," said John Krier, president of 
the box-office tracking firm Exhibitor Relations Co. Krier compared the film's 
opening grosses to last summer's second-highest-grossing film, "The Fugitive," 
which collected $23.7 million its first weekend. This summer, only "The 
Flintstones" and "The Lion King" have had higher opening weekend grosses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gump," directed by Robert E. Zemeckis, is a romantic fable that focuses on 
the ideas and emotions of a simpleton, played by Hanks. 
</P>
<P>
 The "other half" of the weekend's business included two action films: 
Third-ranked "Speed" took in $7.8 million in its fifth week and $85 million to 
date, and fourth-ranked "Blown Away," with a weekend gross of $5.8 million and 
an overall gross after two weekends of $19 million. "The Shadow" was fifth, 
with a weekend gross of $5.5 million; "I Love Trouble" took in $5.2 million and 
has $17.4 million in the bank. Other weekend estimates: "Wolf," $4.4 million 
and $55 million to date; "Baby's Day Out, " $2.8 million and $8.4 million 
total; "Wyatt Earp," $2.7 million and $19 million overall; and "The 
Flintstones," $2.7 million for the weekend and a $116.7 million total.

COUNTERPUNCH : WE HAVEN'T SEEN IT ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HOLLAND, Randy Holland is a television writer and independent 
filmmaker in Los Angeles. His film, The Fire This Time, is now being shown at 
the Sunset 5 Saturdays-Sundays at 11 a.m. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On April 29, the second anniversary of the civil unrest here in L.A., my film 
"The Fire This Time," a documentary chronicling the history of this event, 
opened. The day before, Calendar ran a front-page article about the movie. A 
companion article was headlined "Networks Steering Clear of TV Projects on the 
L.A. Riots." This is true in the case of my film, which has been shunned by PBS 
and other networks, despite critical acclaim and national awards.  
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to explain network mentality, David Link's Counterpunch ("Why 
Dramatize When We Were All Eyewitnesses?," Calendar, June 6) would have us 
believe "we have already seen the most dramatic events the riots had to offer." 
</P>
<P>
 But, in truth, have we? During the monumental TV blitzkrieg of the L.A. 
unrest, I didn't hear one story about the National Guardsman whom police said 
they caught on Wilshire Boulevard with the makings of Molotov cocktails in his 
car. 
</P>
<P>
 There was precious little on television about historic events of great import 
like the Watts uprising of 1965. Nothing about the FBI's destruction of the 
Black Panthers in the late '60s. I didn't hear one word about the sabotage and 
burning of the Watts Writers Workshop in the '70s. Nothing about the 
evisceration of self-empowerment programs that left a vacuum of leadership, 
producing today's street gangs. All these were contributing elements, and 
well-documented links in a chain that predestined the '92 rioting. Why do the 
networks refuse to illuminate this history? 
</P>
<P>
 The history of what happened to our city goes back far. Go back to 1850 when 
fugitive blacks began coming to L.A., back to the 1890s when an embryonic 
ghetto sprang up on Central Avenue, back to redlining by banks and insurance 
companies that continues to this day. Take a look at the type of health care 
urban residents have access to. Take a look at the schools. Take a trip to the 
Nickerson Gardens housing project. Look at 85% of the people sitting around 
without jobs, while on a nearby freeway project the government employed people 
from out of state.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So much history, so much pain, so much sabotage and indifference has gone into 
creating the firebed of the recent disturbance that it is a monumental denial 
for Link and others to think they have "seen the most dramatic events the riot 
has to offer." Trust me, folks, we saw just the horns on the beast. The riot 
was a tragedy in the most poetic sense -- it was horrific and it was 
heartbreaking. These are the elements of great drama. Link, along with the 
networks, thinks action is what makes drama compelling. This view is shoved 
down our throats every day. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In bygone eras, wiser minds like Aristotle and James Joyce believed that 
terror without pity was hollow, and produced no catharsis. It was the 
catharsis, they believed -- the purging of pain, anger and confusion -- that 
allowed a healing after the event, whether it was the Peloponnesian War or 
Finnegan's wake.  
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, we have not yet had our healing here in L.A. And it's an old 
and festering wound. A gaping rent in our inescapably collective soul that's 
been bleeding since 1965 and before. We never had a healing after the '65 
riots. We had promises and denial. We had the failed "25 Year Plan," the 
equivalent of present-day "Rebuild L.A.," which seems to be on the same track 
to nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Television, in refusing to examine the deep and complex history, and the real 
issues involved in the riot, is part of this failure. PBS especially is part of 
this failure. This is why Alec Baldwin will host the "Banned by PBS Film 
Festival" in the fall, of which "The Fire This Time" will be a part. The city's 
problems, which are the world's problems, will not just go away -- no matter 
how hard we wish them to. Now is the time we must, collectively, take a very 
real look at the problems of our city. It has been the role of the media 
throughout history, whether via quill and ink or video camera, to chronicle 
tragedy and effect catharsis. 
</P>
<P>
 To quote James Baldwin: "If we do not falter in our duty now, we may be able, 
handful that we are, to end the racial nightmare and achieve our country and 
change the history of the world. If we do not now dare everything, the 
fulfillment of that prophecy re-created from the Bible in song by a slave, is 
upon us: 'God gave Noah the rainbow sign/No more water, the fire next time!' "

SCREENING ROOM: GAY, LESBIAN FEST OFFERS VARIED FILMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles International Gay & Lesbian Film & Video Festival, which 
continues through Sunday at the Directors Guild, 7920 Sunset Blvd., offers such 
a wide variety of programs that no one could hope to see them all. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the hottest tickets are Gregg Araki's "Totally F***ed Up" (Tuesday at 7 
p.m.), a wry study of alienated gay and lesbian teens -- and the no-budget 
filmmaker's most mature work to date -- and John N. Smith's highly praised 
"Boys of St. Vincent" (Wednesday at 7:30), a two-part, four-hour Canadian TV 
film based on an actual incident of sexual and physical abuse on the part of a 
priest running an orphanage. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all the films and videos were available for advance screening but among 
those previewed are a number of winners. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Mueller's "World and Time Enough" (tonight at 9) is a bit awkward and 
callow in places but on the whole is an engaging look at two young lovers -- 
Mark (Matt Guidry), a fiery conceptual sculptor and activist who is 
HIV-positive, and Joey (Gregory G. Giles), an HIV-negative trash collector who 
tends to keep much of what he finds. The Minneapolis-based Mueller calls his 
film "the first X-Generation romantic comedy from America's heartland." But for 
all its whimsical touches, it deals seriously with gays' longing for family 
ties despite brutally alienating experiences. Mueller makes us aware of how 
omnipresent memories of childhood can be. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of the strongest, most accomplished films in the festival is Maria Luisa 
Bemberg's "I, the Worst of All" (Thursday at 9 p.m.) in which a radiant 
Assumpta Serna plays the aristocratic 17th-Century Mexican poet and cloistered 
nun, Juana Inez de la Cruz, whose brilliance and beauty attract the new 
vicereine (the equally stunning Dominique Sanda), but whose outspoken ways 
inevitably invoke the wrath of church officialdom. 
</P>
<P>
 Isaac Julien's "A Darker Side of Black" (Saturday at 4 p.m.) is an incisive 
and disturbing study of the homophobia that has been emerging in gangsta rap 
and reggae, starting with Jamaican musician Buju Banton's 1992 "Boom Bye Bye," 
which called for the shooting of all gays and lesbians. The talented maker of 
"Looking for Langston" and "Young Soul Rebels" does not merely expose and 
protest this trend, but looks for its historic roots in slavery, colonialism, 
chronic poverty and ignorance. Banton and his successors resort to religion to 
justify their homophobia; Julien also makes clear that much of this music is 
also exceedingly demeaning to all women -- straight or gay. 
</P>
<P>
 New Zealand filmmakers Stewart Main and Peter Wells have more than met the 
tricky challenge of pulling off all-stops-out deliberate high camp with their 
gorgeous and outrageous "Desperate Remedies" (Saturday at 9 p.m.), a lurid 
Victorian tale of lust and power, set in stunningly stylized period settings 
wherein everyone is scheming away beneath a facade of propriety. The central 
figure is the regal Dorothea (Jennifer Ward-Lealand), an ambitious shopkeeper 
in a fictional colonial town who is determined to save her addicted sister from 
her dope-dealing lover, and who is adored by her beautiful companion (Lisa 
Chappell). "La Forza del Destino" appropriately appears on the soundtrack. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday afternoon brings two affecting -- and effective -- AIDS documentaries. 
Manhattan-based Gregg Bordowitz's "Fast Trip, Long Drop" (2 p.m.) is a video 
diary, spanning several years and recording the filmmaker's blunt and honest 
attempt to deal with his HIV status and eventual AIDS diagnosis. Bordowitz 
makes good use of parade and demonstration footage, skits and some amazing 
archival footage of daredevil stunts. Juan Botas' "One Foot on a Banana Peel, 
the Other Foot in the Grave" (4 p.m.) records the interaction between a group 
of men, including himself, who receive medication regularly together at a 
Greenwich Village physician's office/clinic. What emerges is a portrait of 
quiet heroism as these men sustain each other in the face of deteriorating 
health and, in some cases, imminent death.

DANCE; JAZZ TAP ENSEMBLE SHINES IN POLISHED 'SUMMER NIGHTS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five distinctive dancers and four musicians who effortlessly blend make up the 
current Jazz Tap Ensemble, a local performing institution that took over the 
John Anson Ford Amphitheatre in Hollywood over the weekend for a series of 
events, including a polished "Summer Nights" program on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, Sam Weber and Derick Grant provided examples of show-stopping tap 
bravura: Weber in the brilliantly complex playoffs with the band in "Oleo," 
Grant in the explosive, unpredictable athleticism of "Drums" and his sections 
of "Taxi." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the major novelty of the evening may have been the experiments in tap 
partnering that Lynn Dally wove into her new group showcase, "Oracle." Instead 
of the usual side-by-side duets, this fluid quintet boasted balletic 
finger-turns and even something that looked like a supported tap-pirouette. And 
although she minimized her own dancing here, Dally managed to find stylish 
opportunities for everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 Dormeshia Sumbry, the tap historian of the group, offered "Ladybird," a new 
arrangement of choreography by the late Eddie Brown -- not as splashy as her 
Bill "Bojangles" Robinson reconstruction, perhaps, but full of nonchalant 
intricacies. 
</P>
<P>
 Lainie Manning needed to tone down the audience-courting cuteness of her new 
"Swingin' " solo, but technical skill and musicality marked her dancing 
throughout. 
</P>
<P>
 Dally's dark, turbulent " 'Round Midnight" solo was listed as a local 
premiere, although Dally solos with the same title -- to the same Thelonious 
Monk score -- have frequently turned up on Jazz Tap programs for nearly 10 
years now. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides accompanying the tapping, musicians Doug Walter, Eric Ajaye, Jerry 
Kalaf and Stacy Rowles performed pieces by Kalaf and Rowles' father (Jimmy 
Rowles) with great suavity. LEWIS SEGAL

POP; IKE TURNER RELIES ON HITS OF THE PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE APPLEFORD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The last decade has been one Ike Turner would rather forget. The rock 'n' roll 
pioneer was busted for cocaine possession, lost his Inglewood sound studio in a 
fire, was portrayed as a spouse abuser in a popular film, and has watched 
ex-wife Tina's career flourish while his own has faded from view. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame member emerged from his obscurity like a blast 
from another era on Friday at the House of Blues, with singing-dancing Ikettes 
and a horn section that included players from the old Ike & Tina days. The new 
Ike Turner Revue was a high-energy re-creation of the '60s and '70s, and on 
Friday it limited its repertoire almost entirely to songs popular then. 
</P>
<P>
 The club was virtually full, with both young and older fans, for 90 minutes of 
aging rock and R&B standards, from "Knock on Wood" to the Beatles' "Come 
Together." The performances ranged from the occasionally tentative to heights 
so spectacular that Turner's lost years seemed even more tragic. 
</P>
<P>
 But the song list seemed to trap the guitarist-bandleader in the past. A few 
newer titles -- maybe by the likes of Prince or Lenny Kravitz, whose works are 
rooted in the rock and R&B tradition Turner helped create -- would have blended 
easily into his show while updating it. 
</P>
<P>
 This rare appearance also had Turner repeating another old habit: stepping 
back most of the time to spotlight the vocals of his Ikettes. But the show was 
often at its most moving when Turner took a blues-rock guitar solo. His lead 
playing was Turner's best, most distinctive asset, and may offer the most 
direct route to reasserting himself on the pop scene of the '90s. STEVE 
APPLEFORD

COUNTERPUNCH: PUT THE ACCENT ON DIVERSITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PERSIS KHAMBATTA, Persis Khambatta has starred in 15 motion pictures, 
including Star Trek and Megaforce, and has appeared in several TV movies and on 
numerous TV episodes. She lives in Hollywood. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On June 25, I was awakened by a telephone call from a friend telling me to 
read Page 14 of the Calendar section. Someone I did not know -- a Michael Stein 
-- had mentioned my name in a sweet letter he had written wondering why 
actresses with "foreign" accents have consistently been ignored in Hollywood -- 
Greta Garbo and Sophia Loren being exceptions ("Accent on U.S. Stars," 
Calendar). 
</P>
<P>
 I had to smile when I read the letter. He understands. And then my life in 
Hollywood flashed before my eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 I was brought to Hollywood by Gene Roddenberry and Michael Eisner, chosen from 
600 hopefuls to star in the original "Star Trek" motion picture. The success of 
the film, coupled with the allure that I had shaved my head for the role, put a 
spotlight on me.  
</P>
<P>
 I was asked to be a presenter at the Academy Awards. I was invited to the 
A-list parties; whisked to the best tables at the "power" restaurants. I had a 
growing career as a model and an actress in London -- I had starred opposite 
Michael Caine and Sidney Poitier in "The Wilby Conspiracy" -- but everyone told 
me to stay in Hollywood. This was the place, they said, and I could have a big 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What they failed to mention was that no one would quite know what to do with 
me. I knew I was not about to displace Florence Henderson as the mother of the 
"Brady Bunch," but America is a polyglot of accents, faces and backgrounds.  
</P>
<P>
 When I went to apply for a driver's license I had the choice of taking the 
test in 49 different languages. I chose English. In Bombay, where I am from, 
English is the language that cuts through all barriers. 
</P>
<P>
 Casting directors asked me if I spoke Spanish, and I was considered for many 
Latino parts. I was asked if I could speak French. I learned German in 24 hours 
for my starring role in "Nighthawks." But when a role for an Indian became 
available in the miniseries "Far Pavilions," it went to a U.S.-born and bred, 
blue-eyed and accent-less actress because she was "more American." 
</P>
<P>
 I still haven't figured out that logic. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixty years ago, Merle Oberon had to hide the fact that her mother was Indian 
lest it ruin her career. Forty years ago, CBS almost didn't buy a TV pilot 
because they said no one would believe the red-haired "all-American" female 
star was married to a Cuban. That series was, of course, "I Love Lucy," and 
lucky for the world, Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after I arrived in Hollywood, I married an American man. I got to know 
the culture and the people. That marriage did not work out, but a subsequent 
one brought me to Des Moines, where I lived in the heartland for several years 
before returning to Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I love America. I eagerly became a citizen. I have no bitterness toward those 
casting directors who dismissed me because of my accent, nor toward the 
producers and directors who wanted to cast me but thought the audience wouldn't 
accept my accent. I think they're selling their audience short.  
</P>
<P>
 People want good stories, good entertainment and, yes, pretty faces. They 
don't seem to mind that Rick was in love with a woman with an accent in 
"Casablanca." I'll bet once the story and the characters hooked them, they 
didn't even hear her accent. 
</P>
<P>
 It's tough to make it as an actor, tougher still to make it as an actress -- 
the Screen Actors Guild is eager to provide the statistics to verify the 
latter. Statistics also tell us that as much as 50% of the gross revenues of 
all motion pictures now comes from foreign sales. They don't seem to mind 
American accents. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood's trepidation with accents has become not just an archaic attitude, 
but an albatross limiting the textural realism today's directors, writers and 
producers crave. When I saw Isabella Rossellini -- a second-generation 
Hollywood actress with an accent -- portraying Jeff Bridges' wife in 
"Fearless," I thought perhaps we've made a little movement in the right 
direction.  
</P>
<P>
 There are many of us -- trained, seasoned actresses -- available to continue 
the broadening of our American tapestry.

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; FEINSTEIN TAPS INTO SONGS WITH TELLING VERSATILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael Feinstein's sometimes quixotic campaign to honor the Great American 
Song was in full swing at the Greek Theatre Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quixotic" because Feinstein, for all his growing popularity, still hasn't 
tapped into the younger audience the way Tony Bennett has in recent years. And 
"swing" because the accompaniment was provided by Bill Elliott -- another 
artist captivated by a past era -- and his Swing Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 The Feinstein-Elliott blend turned out to be a good mix. Both are enormously 
respectful of the songs of the pre-World War II period, and both view the 
music, correctly, as a rich and fertile treasure. 
</P>
<P>
 But Feinstein is not a nostalgia act. Despite his encyclopedic familiarity 
with Irving Berlin and, especially, the Gershwins, a large part of his appeal, 
particularly apparent in his solo numbers for voice and piano, is his 
versatility with a wide range of material. Always capable of coming up with an 
obscure humorous ditty -- "In Bermuda in Sweet Onion Time" was one -- he 
balanced his entertaining between-song patter with a gorgeous collection of 
Harry Warren love songs ("You're My Everything," "September Song," "The More I 
See You," etc.), a few pieces from his "Forever" album and some flag-wavers 
with the Elliott Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps predictably, Feinstein peaked in a climactic Gershwin medley: "Love Is 
Sweeping the Country," "Embraceable You," "They Can't Take That Away From Me," 
and the tune that has become a virtual signature number, "S'Wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 The Elliott Orchestra opened the evening with a hard-driving set that made a 
persuasive argument for the bandleader's assertion that swing music is alive 
and well. Attractive as the new arrangements were, however, the group's most 
telling numbers were a couple of songs in which a four-voice ensemble, 
Vocalworks, and singer Amy Weston, sounding strikingly like her mother, Jo 
Stafford, conjured up the sound and the substance of the '40s. DON HECKMAN

JAZZ REVIEW; GELLER'S SAX PEELS AWAY THE YEARS WITH FIRE, POISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a world obsessed with youth and all its accouterments, alto saxophonist 
Herb Geller stands as a splendid object lesson. The man is 66 and he pretty 
much looks his age, but he continues to play with the fire and poise that 
marked his art when he was in his 20s. 
</P>
<P>
 Working with a stellar back-up trio, Geller -- an L.A. native who has resided 
in Hamburg, Germany, since the mid-1960s -- delivered an impassioned first set 
on Friday at the Jazz Bakery. 
</P>
<P>
 His sound was like a mango: juicy and moist at the edges but with a hard pit 
at the center. His lines, emanating from a be-bop base, were mixed: Some 
careened up and down, some had a hard rhythmic chop, some were serene and 
glassy. 
</P>
<P>
 While there were wonderful moments in such numbers as the speedy "Birdland 
Stomp" and the sashaying "Stars in My Eyes," Geller's tour de force was "Come 
Rain or Come Shine." He took the Harold Arlen standard at a medium clip and 
squeezed blues essence out of it as if it were a wet towel. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth Price added color to the set when she sang the lyrics she wrote to Al 
Cohn's zesty "High on You," then delivered "The Underdog," creating emotion as 
she went from high to deep notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Ranier (piano), John Leitham (bass) and Paul Kreibach (drums) gave Geller 
easy-chair support, and Ranier dropped in several solos that epitomized grace 
and invention. ZAN STEWART

MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS; MOVIES, MUSIC MELD AT THE BOWL

<TEXT>
<P>
 Twice over the weekend, Hollywood Bowl hosted an evening of music from stage 
and screen -- simultaneously. Onstage, the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra was in full 
force. On the jumbo screen over the stage, various film clips -- from "Bride of 
Frankenstein" to "Ben Hur" -- unreeled, with and without benefit of a live 
orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a "A Night Out at the Movies," a program devoted to science fiction and 
MGM material, and an innocuous dose of culture lite was enjoyed by all. Even 
the usual aeronautical intrusions were complementary. On Friday, only one plane 
passed over during the low introductory drone of "Thus Spake Zarathustra," 
providing a tidy fourth interval overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 Maestro John Mauceri led his charges crisply and provided affable emcee patter 
to compensate for the orchestra's skimpy, irrelevant program notes. Oddly, it 
was also a shamelessly nostalgic program. Apart from Jerry Goldsmith's "Star 
Trek V" fanfare -- and that adapted from older music -- nothing from the last 
quarter-century of film music was played. Highlights included Arthur Bliss's 
mercurial score for "Things to Come" and Miklos Rosza's heroic "Ben Hur" 
overture. 
</P>
<P>
 It is still a wide-open question as to whether the use of existing classical 
music in films has served to elevate and popularize those sources or exploit 
and sully them. Did Oliver Stone besmirch the integrity of Samuel Barber in 
"Platoon"? 
</P>
<P>
 More to the point of this program, did Stanley Kubrick compromise the musical 
intent of Richard Strauss and Gyorgy Ligeti by using their music so integrally 
in "2001: A Space Odyssey"? It's a nagging question. Then again, under what 
other pretext could we hope to hear Ligeti's beautiful micro-tonal smears in 
the Hollywood Bowl -- the most musical moment in the program? The Kubrick 
segment of the program ended with a teasing snippet of Alex North's unused, 
distinctly Straussian score for "2001," recently unearthed and released on CD. 
</P>
<P>
 A moving real time vs. reel time transition came as the orchestra slid into a 
dance segment from "Brigadoon." Later, the orchestra stirred up dreamy delirium 
for the scene in "Wizard of Oz" when Dorothy deplanes from Kansas to Oz, and 
the film shifts from black and white to color. 
</P>
<P>
 As an encore: more blasts from the past via Mark Shaiman's music for "That's 
Entertainment III" -- a splash of pure movie-medley froth to send the crowd out 
into the night of real time Hollywood.

MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS; CARVER CONDUCTS CLASSICS AT THE FORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Conductor Lucinda Carver and the Los Angeles Mozart Orchestra are becoming 
reliable providers of alert, bright music-making. These virtues were again 
evident and only slightly dimmed by the encroaching cool evening air Friday at 
John Anson Ford Amphitheatre in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Carver led a program of music by Cimarosa, Mozart and Haydn. She opened with a 
sparkling account of the rarely played and unjustly neglected Overture to 
Cimarosa's "I Traci Amanti" and closed with a spirited reading of Haydn's also 
less-encountered Symphony No. 59 ("Fire"). 
</P>
<P>
 In between, she offered a lyric reading of the Divertimento in D, K. 136, and 
two arias by Mozart -- "A questo seno . . . Or che il cielo," K. 374, and "Voi 
avete un cor fedele," K. 217, with soloist Camille King. These were the same 
arias sung by a different soloist with the ensemble at the Wilshire-Ebell 
Theatre in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Insofar as can be judged by hearing it in an outdoor setting, King possesses a 
sweet, small and focused soprano, one that remained even throughout the range 
except toward the top, but which did not appear to bloom. She was alert to the 
text, but her florid singing ascended from a wobbly base. 
</P>
<P>
 Carver provided lapidary accompaniment. Yet with programming such as this, as 
well as the early Divertimento, it remains an open and tantalizing question as 
to what extent she can tap into Mozart's darker expressivity. 
</P>
<P>
 The orchestra played with incisive rhythms and tight ensemble, the strings 
encountering fewer pitch problems than might be expected in the cool outdoors.

MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS; GAY MEN'S CHORUS OFFERS 'STONEWALL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There were moments during the 15th anniversary celebration of the Gay Men's 
Chorus of Los Angeles when ideal music for ideal performers met ideal audience. 
Enthusiasm runneth over and belief abounded. 
</P>
<P>
 The concert, at the Alex Theater in Glendale Saturday night, featured 
cherished short pieces from the group's past and a Southern California premiere 
of a new work co-commissioned by the chorus to commemorate the Stonewall riots 
of 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Bourland's "Flashpoint/Stonewall," with text by John Hall, was the main 
event of the evening. Written in a mixture of pop styles, the six-movement 
38-minute work is really a piece of musical theater, with costumes, 
choreography, solos, duets, choruses, even lighting effects and dramatic 
situations. 
</P>
<P>
 Strongest musically were the numbers using solo singers, the second movement 
"DreamDrag," a blend of Kurt Weill and the Association vamped stylishly by 
Craig Wheeler (in drag), and the fourth movement, "The Parade," a naive waltz 
in which a young man suddenly and touchingly discovers his place in society. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, Bourland's music relies heavily upon Leonard Bernstein and solidly 
enough, though the sheer amount of text to be got through makes it less 
musically interesting. The instrumental accompaniment of three synthesizers, 
drums and bass sounded rudimentary. Conductor Jon Bailey led an assured and 
robust performance that combined the Los Angeles chorus with the visiting Gay 
Men's Chorus of Washington, though the large forces (more than 200) could prove 
unwieldy at quicker tempos. 
</P>
<P>
 Before an enjoyable set by the Washington chorus, the local ensemble offered 
an exceptionally executed opening group, tight in ensemble, sensitive in 
phrasing and dynamics, clear in enunciation. Indeed, in its fraternal humor and 
earnest anthems, this seemed like glee club singing at its best. TIMOTHY MANGAN

MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS; 'PRIME MOVES' SERIES MOVES ON TO CALTECH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Presenting every kind of modern dance from a reconstructed 50-year-old solo to 
new works flirting alternately with the commercial world and the avant-garde, 
the "Prime Moves" series moved to Caltech's Ramo Auditorium on Friday with a 
six-part program. 
</P>
<P>
 Hae Kyung Lee's striking "Distant Voices" found Claudia Lopez dancing in slow 
motion on one side of the stage while James Kelly twitched and flailed at high 
speed on the other. Though they never noticed one another, their simultaneous 
solos frequently intersected: Lopez and Kelly would look up at the same time or 
reach out or touch their bodies in unison, even if otherwise isolated. 
</P>
<P>
 Also linking and engulfing their actions: enough fog or smoke to be actionable 
under the state's new smoke-in-the-workplace regulations. As it billowed into 
the front rows, it nearly left this observer breathless, but its constant 
motion did allow Stephen Bennett's lighting effects to emerge as equal to 
choreography and performance in the pictorial impact of the piece. 
</P>
<P>
 A revision of Stephanie Gilliland's "Swoon" again found four dancers 
collapsing onto one another in many, many different ways as they moved around 
and over a central platform. The climactic acceleration, physical daring and 
use of women to support their partners emerged with greater force on Friday 
than in the work's premiere a year ago -- but the intimate Ramo Auditorium also 
served the choreography better than the original outdoor venue. 
</P>
<P>
 Frit and Frat Fuller's new "Listen to the Rhythm" for their KIN Dance Company 
explored racism using the classic American image of neighbors divided by a 
picket fence. The initial confrontations of the six-man cast proved purposeful 
and often imaginative, but the conflict resolved itself with ridiculous ease. 
Moreover, the notion that racial violence breeds tolerance may need rethinking. 
More on target: the Fullers' high-energy, all-male showpiece "Stomp" from 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously reviewed pieces also included Jane Dudley's 1944 character study 
"Cante Flamenco," danced with impressive authority by Bonnie Oda Homsey of Los 
Angeles Dance Theatre, plus Winifred R. Harris' recent "And Through Their Eyes 
I See," splendidly performed by five women from her Between Lines company.

TV REVIEW; EVERS ODYSSEY ENDS IN 'SOUTHERN JUSTICE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On June 12, 1963, black civil rights crusader Medgar Evers was fatally shot in 
the back by a sniper near his Mississippi home. Only this year, though, was 
now-elderly white supremacist Byron De La Beckwith convicted of murdering 
Evers, a field secretary for the NAACP. 
</P>
<P>
 The Evers story and the long, frustrating odyssey preceding the conviction of 
Beckwith -- whose previous two trials for the slaying ended in hung all-white 
juries -- make for a gripping hour of television in "Southern Justice: The 
Murder of Medgar Evers." Written and stylishly directed by talented BBC 
documentary filmmaker Christopher Olgiati, it airs at 10 tonight on HBO, 
tracing the converging paths of victim and assassin in the compelling manner of 
a shadowy suspense story. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors reopened the case four years ago after press reports of new 
evidence of jury tampering in Beckwith's previous trials. After a third jury 
(of eight blacks and four whites) came in with a guilty verdict 30 years later, 
Evers' widow, Myrlie, shouted jubilantly: "Medgar, I've gone the last mile of 
the way." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Beckwith has always denied being the one who picked off the 
37-year-old Evers with an Enfield hunting rifle, he never hid his joy over the 
murder of the civil rights leader. "No one has heard a lot of Martin Luther 
King since they put him in a coffin," he tells Olgiati in a 1991 interview. 
"Well, same thing with Medgar." 
</P>
<P>
 Through newsreel footage and clearly labeled re-enactments, the program 
artfully rewinds history to a time when, as narrator Julian Bond notes, the 
"currency of Mississippi was racial hatred." In the process, we see the civil 
rights activism -- his probes of murder and mayhem against blacks -- that made 
Evers so threatening to Mississippi's institutionalized racism. And Beckwith's 
first trial is especially well staged here, becoming a sort of mini-docudrama 
within a documentary. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although haunted by Evers, "Southern Justice" is less about a single man than 
Southern apartheid and the age that nourished it. Even with Myrlie Evers' 
acting as an eloquent surrogate for her dead husband, we learn much less about 
Medgar Evers, ironically, than about the man sentenced to life imprisonment for 
shooting him in the back. In fact, it's Beckwith's racist rhetoric, spoken just 
three years ago, that echoes the past most chillingly. As if exhumed from a 
graveyard of segregation, he reeks of hatred, ignorance and violence, his words 
smelling like embers from infinite burning crosses. 
</P>
<P>
 When spotting Beckwith at his third trial, Myrlie Evers "had this urge to be 
very primitive and attack," she recalls tonight. Now there is no need, for the 
ranting old racist impales himself on his own words. He calls blacks beasts. 
Yet the comparison on the screen -- between him and Medgar and Myrlie Evers -- 
speaks for itself. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Southern Justice: The Murder of Medgar Evers" airs tonight at 10:05 on HBO.

TV REVIEW; 'MOON SHOT' DETAILS APOLLO ADVENTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you have a sense of deja vu during the two-part, four-hour "Moon Shot" on 
TBS, it's probably because you saw Philip Kaufman's deliciously irreverent 
movie "The Right Stuff," based on Tom Wolfe's book about the Mercury 
astronauts. Both films tend to magnetize your eye, as if you're seeing the 
daring '60s U.S. space project for the first time, and both are told from the 
astronauts' point of view. The point of view in "Moon Shot" is specifically 
test pilot-turned-spaceman Deke Slayton's, and it freely blends a Wisconsin 
farm boy's crudeness with a military man's sense of profound mission. 
</P>
<P>
 This story is wrapped together in such a compelling package by 
producer-director Kirk Wolfinger that the post-moon shot generation might 
rightly wonder why U.S. manned space exploration was grounded after its 
greatest successes. Veteran astronauts Alan Shepard, Jim Lovell, Scott 
Carpenter and Stu Roosa wonder aloud too. The adventure depicted in "Moon Shot" 
may have been propelled by the Cold War competition with the Soviet Union, but 
it also may mark the last time American technology is driven by a purely 
American romance of exploration. 
</P>
<P>
 This is why Slayton (whose words are spoken in narrator Barry Corbin's wry, 
gravelly drawl) is the ideal voice for the adventure. The test pilots picked by 
NASA for the Mercury mission were high-tech rough riders, and tended to buck 
authority when they felt like it. Not all of the Mercury men were Slayton's 
kind of tough breed, though, and he describes a deep internal competition as 
strong as the Soviet rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Like "The Right Stuff," "Moon Shot" becomes very special stuff as it reveals 
the personal dramas behind the carefully designed public relations facade: How 
John Glenn's squeaky-clean image bugged some of the guys; how Gus Grissom's 
near-fatal Mercury landing dogged him until his tragic death on the Apollo 
launch pad; how Frank Borman's wife planned his funeral without letting him 
know; how many of the men hung around and slept with astronaut groupies; how 
Wally Schirra brazenly disobeyed orders during the Apollo 7 flight (and how it 
led him to do a commercial for Actifed). 
</P>
<P>
 While "Moon Shot" disturbs the heroic image of astronauts with plenty of 
glimpses of their all-too-human flaws, another program on the first American 
with lunar dreams -- the Disney Channel's "A Moon Man From Massachusetts: The 
Robert Goddard Story" -- is plain old bland TV biography. Goddard developed the 
first liquid-fueled rockets and the engineering that permitted space rocketry, 
and his story has some of the hubris described in "Moon Shot." But here, the 
most excitement comes from Goddard's problems with Nazi spies gaining access to 
his rocket plans; the real excitement of the Goddard story -- in stretching the 
bounds of physics and the imagination -- never comes across. 
</P>
<P>
 "Moon Shot" airs on TBS at 7:05 p.m. tonight and Wednesday. "A Moon Man From 
Massachusetts" airs 9 p.m. Tuesday on the Disney Channel.

DIRK VAN ZYL; HEART TRANSPLANT RECIPIENT LIVED RECORD 23 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dirk van Zyl, 68, who lived a record 23 years after one of the first heart 
transplants. Van Zyl received a new heart in 1971 in the sixth transplant 
operation performed by the pioneering surgeon, Christiaan Barnard.During the 
surgery, Van Zyl's ailing heart stopped beating, prompting the anesthetist to 
say he was dead. But Barnard revived him and completed the transplant. Van Zyl 
received the heart of a man who died in a fall from a tree. Although chances of 
long-term survival after such operations have remained about 50-50, Van Zyl 
continually encouraged patients who were offered a new heart. "If you don't go 
for the transplant," he said in 1992, "there is no chance." About 3,500 heart 
transplants are now performed each year, mostly in the United States. The 
survival rate for the first year exceeds 90%. On Wednesday in Cape Town, South 
Africa, after a stroke.

STREET SMART: MULTI-COUNTY SERVICE NOW PROVIDES RIDE-SHARING INFORMATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLINE LEMKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 For years I've heard the messages save energy, stop pollution, ride-share. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, 1993, I began working in Fountain Valley. From the time I accepted 
the job offer, I began actively searching for a car pool. I contacted the 
Orange County Transportation Authority, and was told it was unable to find a 
match for me. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked them to try harder. An extended search turned up three names. Alas, 
one listed a bogus telephone number, another was on maternity leave (and has 
since moved), and the third was working at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Six months later, I contacted OCTA again. Any updates? After waiting for a 
month for their computer to come back on line, I was given the disappointing 
news that there were still no matches for me. 
</P>
<P>
 One questions just how extensive the ride-share database really is, and how 
much of an effort OCTA is making to build it up, especially since I have much 
too much company going south on the Costa Mesa Freeway each morning and even 
more going home in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Marlene Eckert 
</P>
<P>
 Orange 
</P>
<P>
 It's too bad all your previous efforts were for naught. Would you be willing 
to try one more time? 
</P>
<P>
 OCTA has stopped providing ride-share networking for Orange County and turned 
the job over to Commuter Transportation Services, a multi-county operation that 
has in its database about 95,000 people from Los Angeles, Riverside and Orange 
counties. Their number is (800) COMMUTE. 
</P>
<P>
 John Standiford of OCTA says public transportation may be an option to you if 
car pooling does not work out. In Orange, OCTA has three major park-and-ride 
locations for bus service and seven bus lines that serve the whole city, he 
said. To get anywhere in Fountain Valley from Orange, it would take at most two 
buses on one transfer, he said. Five of the seven bus lines in Orange have bike 
racks if you cycle part of the way to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 When will there be a transition from the northbound Costa Mesa Freeway to the 
southbound Corona del Mar Freeway? It appears that there is already a provision 
for it.  
</P>
<P>
 Phil Salisbury 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
 A northbound Costa Mesa Freeway connector to the southbound Corona del Mar 
Freeway is currently being designed by the city of Costa Mesa and Caltrans, 
said Rose Orem, a Caltrans spokeswoman. Construction should begin by the fall 
of 1995 and last about nine months, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The $1.5-million project is being funded by the Transportation Corridor 
Agencies and Costa Mesa, Orem said. The return connector is not planned now 
because of cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Expansion of the El Toro Y, that infamous interchange of Interstate 5 and the 
San Diego Freeway, appears to be moving right along. But when I'm driving north 
from San Clemente to Irvine in the mornings the real traffic snarls seem to 
occur before the Y, from the El Toro Road exit south, and immediately after the 
transition to the San Diego Freeway, where it's bumper-to-bumper through 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic often flows freely through the Y itself. Why is that? 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Nelson 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente 
</P>
<P>
 Getting through the actual Y interchange may seem like a piece of cake 
sometimes because of all the jams south and north of it. Here's what John 
Standiford, a spokesman for the Orange County Transportation Authority, had to 
say: 
</P>
<P>
 Construction surrounding the interchange project is one reason for congestion 
south of the Y. Fifteen miles of car pool lanes are being added to I-5 from the 
Y to Pacific Coast Highway in Dana Point, and improvements are being made to 
several ramps and auxiliary lanes, particularly around Crown Valley Parkway and 
Alicia Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
 Another delay south of the Y is caused around El Toro Road when cars begin to 
merge to get to the Y, Standiford said. The improvement project is designed to 
help eliminate much of the weaving and lane changing now required of motorists. 
</P>
<P>
 The project will be finished in the summer of 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheer traffic volume accounts for congestion south and north too. More people 
drive out of South County than the freeway can efficiently handle. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic snarls occur on the northbound San Diego Freeway because more drivers 
use it to get to work and stores. While I-5 is used more as a through-route to 
Los Angeles, right now it also bogs down because of numerous construction 
projects.

GEORGE RAMOS: SEARCHING FOR THE BROWN MESSIAH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The search for the Brown Messiah in South-Central Los Angeles is in full 
swing. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a quest Latino leaders say is necessary to help the growing -- yet 
largely immigrant and powerless -- Latino population there. Without home-grown 
talent, the mainstream leaders of Latino L.A. fear this part of their community 
may never come of age. Since Latinos are half of the population and 70% of the 
enrollment in public schools in South-Central, it's a reasonable concern. 
</P>
<P>
 With identifying such leaders as a priority, I dub any promising Latino I meet 
from south of the Santa Monica Freeway as a messiah -- a person capable of 
leading Latinos to the promised land. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know when the Brown Messiah -- or the next Gloria Molina or Cesar 
Chavez -- will appear, but I met a lot of likely candidates last Friday at 
Edwin Markham Middle School in Watts. 
</P>
<P>
 Their names are Magdalena Buenrostro, Gregoria Marcial, Maria Uc, Paula 
Amaral, Soledad Andrade, Martha E. Obregon, Raquel Alama, Leticia F. Verduzco, 
Rosa and Alfredo Mendoza, Carolina Colmenares, Angela Pacheco, Josefina 
Beatriz, Maria Aguilar, Angela Mendoza, Maria Gaciola and Sonia Morningstar. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They are some of about 50 Latino parents in Watts who have graduated from a 
unique leadership program sponsored by the nation's leading Latino civil rights 
organization, the Los Angeles-based Mexican American Legal Defense and 
Educational Fund.  
</P>
<P>
 The program, at the start of a five-year run in South-Central, is aimed at 
nurturing future leaders. It is designed not only to teach parents how to help 
their children cope in school; it's also aimed at teaching the parents about 
political power, how to build community-based groups to help themselves and how 
to relate to African Americans, who have a long history in South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a strategy MALDEF has tried elsewhere, in places like Detroit and El 
Paso, Tex., with some success. In four months' worth of classes, the 
South-Central parents were taught about power and how to use it -- whether the 
concern was the quality of schools or drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
 MALDEF president and general counsel Antonia Hernandez laid out the challenge 
for these prospective messiahs when she spoke to them in Spanish at Markham: 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to tell you it's going to be easy. It's not, but it is 
possible. I'm a daughter of immigrants. I know how difficult life is here. . . 
. You have a responsibility to your children and to your community. If you 
don't have your papers (legalizing U.S. residency), get them. If you are legal, 
become a U.S. citizen. If you are a citizen, vote." 
</P>
<P>
 That's a tall order, because others have tried to tap into the area's growing 
Latino population. Many have failed, but a few, like the Coro Foundation, have 
turned out future leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 One future messiah may be Arturo Ybarra, who is with the Watts/Century Latino 
Organization. Trained by Coro at San Miguel Roman Catholic Church in Watts, 
Ybarra has helped organize activities that involve Latinos and their black 
neighbors. One such event is the annual Cinco de Mayo parade. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arturo doesn't spout the nationalistic 'Chicano Power' line," says East L.A. 
activist Lydia Lopez. "He builds coalitions. He understands the new-world 
leadership in this patch of geography called South-Central L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in their Sunday best, the future messiahs I met at Markham had a lot 
in common. Nearly all of them were from Mexico. They spoke virtually no English 
despite having spent an average of 12 years in this country. Many of them don't 
have their own transportation. At one time, they felt powerless, unable to 
speak out about what concerned them in South-Central. They were afraid to ask 
for little things, like interpreters at school meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Not anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 They say they're ready to take on City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are parents who are willing to fight for this community," says Sonia 
Morningstar, looking at her fellow messiahs. "I am a grandmother, and I want to 
fight too." 
</P>
<P>
 Many were afraid to go out at night. They were naturally fearful of area 
street gangs, but they also were scared of the police. "I don't know them," one 
of them admitted. 
</P>
<P>
 Though still a bit tentative about speaking in public, they say they're ready 
now to speak to Police Chief Willie Williams himself. 
</P>
<P>
 They also say they're ready for the next two steps in the training -- learning 
English and becoming U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 I knew the search was over when one of the women, who asked for my business 
card, said she was about to have some of her own printed up. "I'll send you one 
soon," she promised.

 "I come to Uptown because I like to sit out in the sunshine and watch people 
interact. I work for Family Services counseling agency, so knowing what's going 
on is real important.You get a cross-section. Everybody wanders through Uptown 
in the course of the day. People talk to me and it gives me an idea of what 
they need, especially in relationship to their family. I like the flowers and 
trees and there are little alcoves that have benches. I go to the book stores 
and I like to walk through all the little antique shops. Central Park is really 
pretty -- it has an old fashioned look. One of the things I like about Whittier 
is you almost feel like you've stepped back into a different time -- more like 
the 1940s and '50s. The pace is a lot slower." -- KATHRYN SAMPSON, counselor at 
Family Services, Whittier When Whittier suffered more than $100 million in 
damages in the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake, the historic central business 
and residential district of Uptown was hardest hit. A Citizen's Advisory 
Committee oversaw development of a Specific Plan that became a vision for 
rebuilding Uptown. An active business association and adoption of an Earthquake 
Recovery Redevelopment Project Area became important factors working toward 
achieving the vision. Seven years later rebuilding continues. Plywood only 
screens a few empty lots. Pedestrians flock to Uptown in increasing numbers and 
streets are lively into the evening. For information call (310) 696-2662.

AMNESTY: ORGANIZATION OF HOPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Americans take their freedom for granted: They hear a joke about President 
Clinton and Congress and they laugh. But in many other countries, as Amnesty 
International, the human rights watchdog, points out in its annual report, 
jokes about national leaders are no laughing matter. A wrong word about an 
official can result in prison, or worse. 
</P>
<P>
 The London-based Amnesty International is an invaluable resource for those who 
care about human rights. Though it depends on the targets of oppressive 
governments for much of its information, its reports are considered highly 
credible. Perhaps most significant of all its noteworthy work is the annual 
report, which proves a general picture of state cruelty and oppression the 
world over. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the worst trouble spots are in the headlines. Haiti, Rwanda and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, not surprisingly, made the list of countries where politics 
motivates killings, torture and imprisonment without benefit of trial. 
</P>
<P>
 In Haiti, Amnesty depended largely on the neutral reports of observers from 
the United Nations and the Organization of American States to document numerous 
executions of supporters of exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 In Rwanda, Amnesty reported "systematic and unprovoked killings of the Tutsi 
minority," in the strife that broke out in April and noted the threat of the 
massacres spreading to neighboring Burundi. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bosnia-Herzegovina, politics motivated hundreds of "deliberate and 
arbitrary killings" according to Amnesty, which attributed blame to "all 
sides." 
</P>
<P>
 Amnesty is particularly valuable because it is even-handed. It notes 
atrocities of oppression by both right-wing and left-wing regimes. And no 
region of the world is unblemished, according to Amnesty's 1994 survey of 151 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1961, more than a million volunteers have worked for Amnesty 
International, helping in various ways to fight the execution, imprisonment and 
torture of people solely because of their beliefs, religion, race, gender, 
ethnic origin or politics. 
</P>
<P>
 This Amnesty army is essential. If such evils are made known, perhaps they 
will not go unpunished; the world will respond with action rather than 
rhetoric. That at any rate is the hope.

WILL UNITED BUYOUT GET OFF THE GROUND?; EMPLOYEE OWNERS: SKEPTICS SAY THEY'LL 
PAD BENEFITS AND SKIMP ON CAPITAL INVESTMENT, BUT EXPERIENCE TELLS OTHERWISE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER MACKIN, Christopher Mackin is the president of Ownership 
Associates Inc. of Cambridge, Mass, an employee-ownership consulting firm. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Tuesday, shareholders of United Airlines are scheduled to vote to approve 
or reject an employee buyout of their corporation. The transaction has 
attracted a great deal of attention both because of its size -- it would be the 
largest employee-owned company in history -- and its structure -- a majority of 
its stock would be held by workers who are also members of labor unions. The 
novelty of the proposed United arrangements has begun to provoke considerable 
attention.  
</P>
<P>
 Lee Iaccoca is one prominent skeptic. In a recent Business Week article, he is 
quoted as saying, "Somebody's crazy. It can't work . . . what do you think will 
happen when it's a choice between employee benefits and capital investment?" 
Iaccoca's skepticism needs to be taken seriously. But it also overlooks certain 
details. The United transaction has been carefully structured to include an 
independent board of directors, composed of respected financial and business 
professionals like Paul Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, 
and Joseph Vittoria, chief executive officer of Avis, perhaps the most 
prominent and successful employee-owned company to date. Even in later years, 
however, when workers at United may come to exercise increased influence over 
the composition of the United board, that influence will not necessarily 
translate into unrealistic wage and benefit demands. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence from the existing employee-owned corporate sector, in fact, points in 
another direction. Experience shows that most employees, but particularly 
mid-career worker/owners who are counting on continued employment at a viable 
company, actually serve as an internal check against those who would use 
ownership to raid the treasury. Employee owners do not typically suffer from 
the "short-termism" associated with management of most publicly traded 
companies. Research also shows that if ownership is intelligently used by 
company management as a foundation to help launch sincere efforts at 
participation, employee-owned companies can enjoy clear and significant 
productivity and profitability improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiscal conservatism on the part of workers is not restricted to the 
collective-bargaining table. At a recent employee ownership conference, 
Vittoria spoke of a new practice Avis has instituted, allowing employees at its 
rental facilities (as opposed to customer-service professionals at 
headquarters) to dispense vouchers for complimentary rentals to customers who 
have experienced problems with Avis' service. At first, many in management 
feared that the workers would give away the store. The results are in. Avis 
employees, with their share value in mind, dispense fewer complimentary 
vouchers than their counterparts at headquarters. However, because employees 
respond on the spot to actual problems, the company continues to maintain the 
highest levels of overall customer satisfaction in its history. 
</P>
<P>
 The financial side of the Avis story is also compelling. Since the 1988 sale 
to its employees, shares of Avis' privately held stock have appreciated in 
value 344% -- from $5.22 per share to a current $17.96. Something unusual is 
going on here. 
</P>
<P>
 Often associated in the public mind with distress buyouts of rusting steel 
mills (many of which have actually turned successful), employee ownership is 
making inroads into key sectors of the American economy. As a result of 
elaborate, tax-advantaged legislative architecture for employee stock-ownership 
plans, or ESOPs, more than 10,000 companies now count their employees as 
substantial shareholders. In about 2,000, employees hold a majority stake. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the success stories, in a transaction as large and complex as United's 
there should be plenty of room for caution. Culture change, a notoriously slow 
process in itself, needs to take place at all levels within the new United, 
including within each of its unions. Adversarialism at the bargaining table 
needs to be replaced by open debate about the costs and benefits of various 
strategic options. The focus of debate needs to be external, toward the market, 
not just internal, toward one another.  
</P>
<P>
 The factors in need of change at United are the same one hears at every 
conference on the future of the American workplace. Add to those factors the 
challenge of sorting out the meaning of shared ownership and it is easy to 
conclude that the needed changes will be difficult to achieve. Why should the 
new United fare any differently than other corporations attempting cultural 
change? The answer is fairly straightforward. The incentives are rational. At 
the new United, the majority share of the fruits of collaborative effort will 
be shared with those who do the collaborating -- the employee owners. And 
Iaccoca notwithstanding, employees are smart enough to understand the long-term 
potential of employee ownership.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; SHARING THE OTHER NIXON TAPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard Nixon wove many a tangled web in his lengthy and controversial career. 
One of his unintended legacies has the National Archives in the uncomfortable 
position of keeping research material secret. It's a federal agency that should 
be dedicated to preserving the nation's history for the public. 
</P>
<P>
 The centerpiece of a dispute between the National Archives and Nixon's alma 
mater, Whittier College, is the availability of audiotapes. 
</P>
<P>
 After Nixon became President in 1969, Whittier was chosen as the site of his 
presidential library. A Whittier professor interviewed relatives, friends and 
neighbors concerning the years 1913 to 1946 (a period ending just before the 
start of his political career) for an oral history. A foundation was 
established to raise funds for the library but found the task impossible after 
Nixon resigned the presidency in disgrace due to the Watergate scandal, in 
which an entirely different set of tapes played a key role. 
</P>
<P>
 As the foundation folded, it deeded the tapes to some future Nixon 
presidential library, and the National Archives took them for safekeeping. They 
now reside in the archives' branch in the Orange County community of Laguna 
Niguel. Much other Nixon material there has been available to the public, but 
not the Whittier tapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace opened in Yorba Linda four 
years ago, the National Archives contended that it was not a real presidential 
library because it did not control the presidential papers and was not 
administered by the archives. Whittier College contends the tapes should be 
made public. 
</P>
<P>
 At the very least, the Nixon library should have copies provided by the 
archives. As Stephen Ambrose's masterful three-volume biography of Nixon 
demonstrated, historians have no dearth of materials on the man, before, during 
and after his presidency. Yet every bit helps. Insights and remembrances from 
those who knew him form parts of the mosaic of history. 
</P>
<P>
 At Nixon's funeral in Yorba Linda in April, President Clinton urged that his 
predecessor be judged on "his entire life and career." The National Archives 
should help historians in furthering that goal.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / QUARTERFINALS; SWEDEN'S BEST SHOT PUTS ROMANIA OUT; SOCCER: 
TENACIOUS BATTLE ENDS IN 2-2 TIE. SWEDEN WINS ON PENALTY KICKS, 5-4, TO ADVANCE 
TO SEMIFINAL. 
</P>

<P>
 Soccer has no mercy. 
</P>
<P>
 Romanian Coach Anghel Iordanescu said it and who could argue? The game doesn't 
care who it strings along and who it uses up. Soccer gives no thought to 
expectations or hopes or promises. The game dashes all that. The game always 
wins, and it is only for one team to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweden did that Sunday, defeating Romania, 5-4 on penalty kicks after 
regulation ended in a 1-1 tie and a 30-minute overtime ended 2-2. It was not a 
match that either team won so much as endured, Sweden all the more as it played 
a man short for the bulk of the overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweden was rewarded for its perseverance and advances further than it has 
since 1958, when it lost to Brazil in the World Cup championship game. Sweden 
will play Brazil again, Wednesday at the Rose Bowl, in the semifinal. The teams 
will reprise their meeting from the first round, which ended in a 1-1 tie. 
</P>
<P>
 For Romania, too, the echoes resonate: It is the second consecutive World Cup 
in which the team was ousted on penalty kicks -- the sport's cruelest solution. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a heart-attack game," Iordanescu said, and, indeed, his team 
succumbed. Despite Sweden's obvious intention to never stop working, and the 
fact that Sweden scored first, Romanian players betrayed an arrogance that 
seemed to indicate that no matter the circumstances the team expected to win. 
</P>
<P>
 There were high expectations before the game that both teams would offer an 
attacking, creative show. However, a header by Sweden's Martin Dahlin that hit 
the post in the fourth minute was the sum total of either team's offensive 
production in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 So unappealing was the play that the crowd of 81,715 in Stanford Stadium spent 
much of the first half perfecting the wave while Romania incessantly backpassed 
the ball from its midfield to its defense, until, finally, goalkeeper Florin 
Prunea gathered the ball and booted it forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Romania's much-vaunted counterattack never materialized as Sweden -- which was 
reticent to attack -- never offered the opportunity. Romania's puzzle: How to 
counterattack a team that doesn't attack? 
</P>
<P>
 Sweden had worked through a puzzle of its own, solving a tenacious Romanian 
defense. Swedish Coach Tommy Svensson said that during the week's closed 
practices the team drilled on the set play off a free kick that led to Sweden's 
first goal. 
</P>
<P>
 It was suggested by Tomas Brolin, who learned it from his Italian club team, 
Parma. Svensson liked the play and said he'd remember it. During Sunday's game, 
he reminded Brolin to try it. 
</P>
<P>
 It worked perfectly because Romania failed to cover its left side on the free 
kick. Sweden's Stefan Schwarz stood in front of the ball and pushed it to Hakan 
Mild. When Mild got the ball, Brolin broke toward the goal, around the wall of 
Romanian players, took a pass that left him alone against Prunea and scored. 
</P>
<P>
 That goal in the 79th minute might have been enough if not for Florin 
Raducioiu. He and Romania's other top offensive players, Gheorghe Hagi and Ilie 
Dumitrescu, had been thwarted by Sweden for most of the game. The trio teamed 
for Romania's tying goal off a free kick in the 89th minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagi slid the ball to Dumitrescu who gave it back to Hagi. Hagi's powerful 
left-footed shot ricocheted off Sweden's wall and Raducioiu picked it up and 
scored. 
</P>
<P>
 Raducioiu gave Romania the lead in overtime when the Swedes couldn't clear a 
ball near the top of the box. Raducioiu slammed his shot home in the 101st 
minute and Sweden was in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Romania's task should have been to sit on its lead, but to do that it would 
have been necessary to keep the ball. It didn't. Sweden stepped up its attack 
and the tireless Brolin appeared to be everywhere on the field, intent on 
winning the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it was 2-1 for us and we had seven or eight more minutes, there were 
times when the players tried to keep the result as is, and probably exaggerated 
it," Iordanescu said. "That's why they made a mistake. What I asked for them in 
the last minutes of the game was to possess the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Sweden struck quickly. Roland Nilsson lofted a high cross to Kennet Andersson. 
The 6-foot-4 forward was unchallenged in the penalty area and outjumped Prunea, 
heading the ball into the net virtually out of the goalkeeper's hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of their players just stood there like they were waiting for the 
goalkeeper to take it," Andersson. "They just stood there and watched." 
</P>
<P>
 What Romania saw was its hopes slipping and the inevitability of the dreaded 
penalty kick shootout.  
</P>
<P>
 It is an odd and dramatically different way to end a soccer match. As the 
players from both teams flopped on the grass to watch, five players from each 
team were designated to take the kick from the penalty spot, 12 yards from the 
goalkeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweden went first and started badly. Mild's shot flew over the crossbar. After 
that, each player, in turn, made his shot until Dan Petrescu's shot was parried 
by Swedish goalkeeper Thomas Ravelli. Ravelli allowed himself a pump of his 
fist and Sweden had remained even at 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
 The score was 4-4 after five shots each and, in keeping with the game's mood, 
even the shootout went into sudden death.  
</P>
<P>
 Sweden's Henrik Larsson went first and his curling shot hit the back of the 
net. 
</P>
<P>
 Solemnly, Miodrag Belodedici walked forward to place the ball on the penalty 
spot and stepped back to face Ravelli. The Romanian hesitated, then strode 
forward, striking the ball sharply to the right. Ravelli had guessed as much 
and his diving save ended the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe there was mercy on the day. The game was over.

RECORD'S WORSE, BUT DODGERS FEEL BETTER; BASEBALL: THEY LOSE TO METS, 5-1, AND 
FALL TO 46-42, COMPARED WITH 47-41 LAST SEASON. BUT NOW THEY ARE IN FIRST 
PLACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dodger executive Fred Claire has been criticized and his manager, Tom Lasorda, 
has been said to be past his prime. But as the Dodgers head into the All-Star 
break, they are sitting atop the National League West, a position they have 
held for 56 days. 
</P>
<P>
 After a season of abysmal play and another of boredom, Claire and Lasorda's 
players have brought excitement and respect back to Dodger Stadium for the 
first time in two seasons. Fans no longer need the wave or beach balls to 
maintain their interest and a seldom-changed lineup has made the player's names 
as common as the Union 76 ball. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sunday's 5-1 loss to the New York Mets at Dodger Stadium pointed out a 
glaring inconsistency. If this team is better than last season's, how come its 
record is worse?  
</P>
<P>
 "Going by records doesn't indicate anything," Lasorda said. "I don't care 
about the record, I care about the club." 
</P>
<P>
 After 88 games, the Dodgers have a 46-42 record compared with 47-41 last 
season. In any other division except the American League West, they would be in 
third place, but the Dodgers lead the National League West by five games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we are better because we are not looking around for what we need, we 
know our potential is in the locker room," pitcher Orel Hershiser said. "We 
have confidence, we know we have the ability. Last year, we were looking around 
to see what changes were going to be made." 
</P>
<P>
 This Dodger team has had 20 comeback victories, has hit 91 home runs, fifth 
best in the league, and has reserves who lead the league with a .311 batting 
average. All but one of its starting pitchers have winning records and they 
rank third in the league with a 3.90 earned-run average. The Dodgers' defense 
has been above average, improved with the addition of shortstop Rafael 
Bournigal and right fielder Raul Mondesi. 
</P>
<P>
 But even though the bullpen has improved considerably of late, with Todd 
Worrell leading the way, it has blown 17 of 32 save opportunities, and has the 
fewest saves in the league, 15. The Dodgers have played a league-leading 41 
one-run games, in which they have a 23-18 record. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know why we don't have a better record, because of the fact of the games 
that we lost when we were ahead, but by the same token, there are games we have 
won when we have been behind," Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I say overall, we have a better team than last year." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodger youth, as well as the veterans, have responded to a period of 
rebuilding that Claire says he is committed to, without compromising winning. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a situation Lasorda excels at. There are skeptics of Lasorda, but it 
would be difficult to find a manager who works more with players. He toils 
endlessly, throwing curveballs and instructing any player who shows up for 
early batting practice. This season, most of them have. 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda and Claire point to the addition of Mondesi, who has a batting average 
of .320, 15 home runs and 13 outfield assists. They talk about Tim Wallach's 18 
home runs and 56 RBIs -- last season he drove in 62. 
</P>
<P>
 They have a superstar in Mike Piazza, whose .325 average, 21 home runs and 76 
RBIs could make a season. And Worrell has five saves and a 2.23 ERA since 
coming off the disabled list May 23. Hitting instructor Reggie Smith has made a 
huge impact as has the quiet leadership of Bill Russell. 
</P>
<P>
 But the general attitude is that while the Dodgers are happy to be in first 
place, they are not satisfied. The players believe they have yet to reach their 
potential. 
</P>
<P>
 Claire, who sent Jose Offerman to triple-A in mid-season and brought up 
Bournigal, says he will still look to the farm system first for any changes, 
but it is clear the club is still not satisfied with the bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to play better, we have won a few games over .500, but it's not what 
our lead is, it's how we relate to .500," Claire said. "We were .500 last year, 
but we should be better for the reasons I cited." 
</P>
<P>
 It was one of the team's young pitchers, Ismael Valdes, who contributed to 
Sunday's loss with his first bad outing. He gave up three runs, including two 
homers in the eighth inning. Pedro Astacio (6-6) had given up two runs in the 
second inning, and held the Mets to a total of two hits until he left the game 
after seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers couldn't do much of anything against Bret Saberhagan (10-5), who 
in eight innings gave up six hits and an unearned run after Brett Butler 
tripled and scored on a wild throw in the third inning.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / QUARTERFINALS; GERMANS HISTORIC LOSERS IN THIS BATTLE OF 
THE BULG; SOCCER: BULGARIA'S TWO QUICK GOALS TURN THINGS AROUND TO KNOCK OUT 
DEFENDING CHAMPION, 2-1. 
</P>

<P>
 Some ran in wild circles. Others danced toward the stands. Still others fell 
to their knees. 
</P>
<P>
 But before departing hushed Giants Stadium on Sunday afternoon, members of the 
Bulgarian soccer team returned to each other. 
</P>
<P>
 On the spot where Yordan Letchkov etched himself into a nation's memory with 
one twitch of the head, they draped their weary bodies together for a most 
unusual team photograph. 
</P>
<P>
 Some were shirtless. Several were bruised or blood-stained. All were 
screaming. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, everybody. Smile , and say history.  
</P>
<P>
 What could not happen in our lifetime had just occurred in a span of four 
minutes. That was all Bulgaria needed to overcome a 1-0 deficit and defeat 
defending champion Germany, 2-1, in a World Cup quarterfinal before 72,416 at 
Giants Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, and the Rhine just dried up, Mercedes-Benz have stopped selling, and 
somebody rebuilt the Wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "A catastrophe," German midfielder Matthias Sammer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no explanation," teammate Guido Buchwald said. 
</P>
<P>
 There is one if you believe Bulgarian star Hristo Stoitchkov, who tied the 
game with an amazing free kick goal in the 76th minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Three minutes later, Letchkov took advantage of a five-inch height advantage 
over 5-foot-5 defender Thomas Haessler with a game-winning header that found 
the back of the net from 14 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I am sure that God is a Bulgarian," Stoitchkov said. 
</P>
<P>
 Either that, or He has a good sense of the dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
 Before this tournament, Bulgaria had never won a World Cup game. Germany had 
won three World Cup championships and 42 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Bulgaria needed an upset of two-time champion Argentina to advance past the 
first round. It needed penalty kicks to defeat Mexico in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 Germany, in cruising through four tournament games without a loss, seemingly 
needed only to show up. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Germans prepared for this game by working in the midwest humidity of 
Chicago, the Bulgarians spent most of the previous two days in their New Jersey 
hotel swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "We needed to get relaxed, you know?" midfielder Zlatko Iankov said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who still do not believe what happened can sympathize with Martin 
Wagner, the German defender who left Sunday's game with a head injury in the 
59th minute. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Germany led, 1-0. Wagner was led to the locker room, where he lay 
on a trainer's table, dizzy, for nearly a half hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then a teammate walked in and said we had just lost," Wagner said. "I jumped 
up and said, 'You're kidding me! I can't believe this! What happened? Why did 
this happen?' " 
</P>
<P>
 What happened was that Stoitchkov and Letchkov scored their brilliant goals 
within six minutes of an apparent game-clinching German goal by Rudi Voeller 
that was nullified because he was ruled offside. 
</P>
<P>
 Why it happened is something that will be debated in Munich for years, 
although it was obvious the Germans' uninspired style wilted under a constant 
charge from the overmatched but relentless Bulgarians. 
</P>
<P>
 What happens now is, Bulgaria advances to the semifinals here Wednesday 
against Italy, another three time champion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can we beat Italy? Who knows?" Iankov said, giggling. "Why not?" 
</P>
<P>
 Such is the attitude of the Bulgarians, whose eccentricities provided a marked 
difference from their victims Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in defeat, the Germans could find no emotion. They walked calmly from the 
field, then sat in the locker room staring at each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing was said; there was no anger, no crying," defender Thomas Strunz 
said. "We thought advancing would be no problem. Maybe we had too much 
self-confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulgarians, meanwhile, celebrated not by drinking champagne, but whiskey. 
</P>
<P>
 Their coach, Dimitar Penev, is a stocky, good-natured man whose untucked shirt 
and dirty socks remind one of an auto mechanic. 
</P>
<P>
 Their chief of security carries not a gun, but a toy stuffed lion. Svetla 
Gosteva-Ivanova walks around the field before each game and touches the field 
with the lion for good luck. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she was hired not because she understands security, but because she 
speaks English. 
</P>
<P>
 "This team really doesn't have security problems," she admitted. 
</P>
<P>
 And Sunday's Bulgarian hero? He fits right in. 
</P>
<P>
 While other teams can boast players whose hair is styled into everything from 
dreadlocks to Goldilocks, Letchkov is the tourney's only player who is bald on 
top. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have cold curls," he said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 He appeared just cold when he tripped German star Juergen Klinsmann in the 
penalty area in the 48th minute. Lothar Matthaeus converted the penalty kick to 
give Germany a 1-0 lead and loads of confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Their swagger increased in the 73rd minute when Andreas Moeller hit the post 
with a shot that bounced in front to Voeller, who kicked it into the net. 
</P>
<P>
 The German celebration lasted about two seconds, as referee Jose Torres Cadena 
of Colombia ruled that both Voeller and Klinsmann were offside when Moeller had 
taken his shot. 
</P>
<P>
 If Moeller had scored, that goal would have counted because Voeller and 
Klinsmann did not gain advantage from the infraction. But when the ball hit the 
post, the offside infraction was ruled in effect. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a complicated ruling, but the Germans understood it, and did not 
complain. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, "We thought we were in control," forward Stefan Kuntz said. "We 
thought nothing could stop us." 
</P>
<P>
 Then Stoitchkov, after being fouled by Moeller, took his free kick from 25 
yards, deftly putting the ball over the German wall and into the right corner 
of the net. 
</P>
<P>
 "So then, we thought we would go into overtime," Kuntz said. 
</P>
<P>
 They thought wrong. Streaking down the middle of the field, Letchkov took a 
pass from Zlatko Iankov and headed it past stunned German goalkeeper Bodo 
Illgner. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is too much excitement, too much happiness," defender Tsanko Tzvetanov 
said breathlessly. 
</P>
<P>
 And too much for the once larger-than-life Germans to believe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything for Germany now is this big," Kuntz said softly. 
</P>
<P>
 He was holding out his thumb and index finger. They were inches apart.

MORNING BRIEFING: MERE MENTION OF HIS NAME DRAWS RAVES

<P>
 Something wonderful and terrific is breaking out in Durham, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Why, it's Wonderful Terrific Monds III, from Ft. Pierce, Fla., a 21-year-old 
outfielder who has, well, made quite a name for himself in the Atlanta Braves' 
farm system. 
</P>
<P>
 Monds, called Wonder for short, was a 50th-round draft pick in 1993. He 
recently was promoted from Macon to the Braves' higher single-A team at Durham 
after batting .275 with four home runs and 18 runs batted in at Macon. 
</P>
<P>
 This means Macon is down to one great name. Monds left behind a 1992 
eighth-round draft choice and 20-year-old right-handed pitcher with a 3-1 
record and 2.76 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
 His name is Maurice Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: What do Karch Kiraly, Randy Stoklos, Kent Steffes and Sinjin 
Smith, the top four all-time money winners on the Miller Lite/AVP pro beach 
volleyball tour, have in common? 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, say, can you Zee?What's going on in Valencia? First, Valencia Country Club 
member Jim Larocca has a five-day golf outing with some buddies -- in Malaysia, 
an 18,000-mile round trip. Then, member Jeff Zee and guest Rocky Haserjian play 
81 holes in one day. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason? "It was my birthday," Zee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Culture down set point:  
</P>
<P>
 Strawberries and cream are a Wimbledon tradition, right? But at this summer's 
Wimbledon, hungry tennis fans flocked to the concession stands for something 
new -- strawberries and yogurt. 
</P>
<P>
 This reaction is from the Fly column in The Sporting News: "Martina is leaving 
just in time." 
</P>
<P>
 They were rabid fans: From The Good Doctor in Inside Sports: "At their annual 
convention in Chicago, who did all of the top mascots from sports ask to see? 
Robin Ventura, Pet Detective." 
</P>
<P>
 Tee it up: For what it's worth, three early college football magazines are out 
with poll predictions. Athlon has USC No. 14 and UCLA No. 19, Inside Sports has 
UCLA No. 12 and USC No. 19, and Street and Smith's has USC No. 11 and UCLA No. 
17. 
</P>
<P>
 Mascot update: The firing of Houston Rocket mascot Turbo last week in a 
front-office purge by owner Les Alexander that claimed 12 represented the 
second mascot termination this NBA season.

 In May, the SuperSonics fired Squatch. Otherwise known as John Sweeney, 
Squatch is a former Arizona State gymnast, as is Jerry Burrell, the former 
Turbo. Actually, three other former ASU gymnasts are still employed as NBA 
mascots: the Gorilla in Phoenix, Hugo the Hornet in Charlotte and Boomer in 
Indianapolis.

 It's time for mid-term report cards. . . .

 Dodger batting: B. Starting pitching: C+. Relief pitching: D. Fielding: C. . .

</P>
<P>
 Angel batting: D. Starting pitching: D. Relief pitching: D. Fielding: C+. . .

<P>
 I can't get it straight from week to week. Does Todd Worrell think he's being 
asked by Tom Lasorda to pitch too many innings or too few? . . . 
</P>
<P>
 If the Dodgers aren't going to recall Jose Offerman during the remainder of 
the season, they should trade him. Rafael Bournigal, 28, looks like the 
shortstop of the present and future. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The best thing about the slick-fielding Bournigal as a hitter is that he makes 
contact, having struck out only twice in 41 at-bats. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants showed how desperate they are by rushing Darryl Strawberry into the 
starting lineup. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Raul Mondesi's major league numbers are a lot better than his Pacific Coast 
League numbers last year. He batted .280, hit 12 home runs and had 65 runs 
batted in during 110 games for Albuquerque. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Mondesi credits Dodger Coach Manny Mota for helping him become a better 
opposite-field hitter. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Last year at the All-Star break, the Dodgers were 46-41, tied for third in the 
NL West, and 12 games out of the lead. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels were 43-43, tied for fourth in the AL West, and two games out. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the best jobs in the National League is being done by Houston Astros 
rookie Manager Terry Collins. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Dodger reliever Ismael Valdes, 20, is the youngest player in the National 
League and Seattle shortstop Alex Rodriguez, 18, the youngest in the American. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago White Sox first baseman Frank Thomas has a substantial lead in the 
most underrated offensive category -- runs scored. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 One of the most remarkable performances of the year was that of Kim Williams, 
who finished in a tie for 10th place in the Jamie Farr Toledo LPGA Classic 
despite playing with a bullet lodged in her rib cage after a shooting a week 
ago Saturday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The only athletes ever to appear on the cover of Time, Newsweek and Sports 
Illustrated the same week have been Muhammad Ali, Billie Jean King, Joe Namath, 
Secretariat, Nadia Comaneci, Mary Lou Retton and, last month, O.J. Simpson. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's hope that the new $4.8 million scoreboards at the Coliseum will have 
game clocks that work. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Hardy, who was Coliseum general manager for 13 years, will be honored by 
the Orange County Sports Assn. at its newsmakers' luncheon Tuesday at the 
Anaheim Stadium Club and be inducted into the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame Aug. 11. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 Hardy promoted the first football games at Anaheim Stadium -- a doubleheader 
featuring the San Diego Chargers-Kansas City Chiefs and the Oakland 
Raiders-Boston Patriots in 1966. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Lukas appears to have another exceptional 2-year-old filly in Serena's 
World, who won the six-furlong Landaluce on Saturday at Hollywood Park and 
looks as though she will be able to handle a distance. . . . 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Madonna will make her long-anticipated coaching debut July 31 at the Forum 
when she matches strategy against Arsenio Hall during the Magic Johnson charity 
basketball game. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers will play one-fourth as many games in Japan as in Anaheim next 
season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Of 20 USC freshman football recruits, only Marlin Carey and Antoine Simpson 
haven't met school entrance requirements. Both met NCAA requirements, which are 
lower than USC's. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 ABC studio host Jim McKay to Alexi Lalas after the U.S. defender wouldn't make 
a prediction on the Brazil-Netherlands game: "What do you think you're here 
for?" . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't realize quite how Americanized the World Cup had become until a beach 
ball was thrown onto the field during the Bulgaria-Germany game Sunday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Sweden is trying to pull off its biggest upset in the United States since 
Ingemar Johansson knocked out Floyd Patterson in the third round on June 26, 
1959, to win the heavyweight championship. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Look for an announcement soon that the Michael Moorer-George Foreman 
heavyweight title fight has been signed for Nov. 5 at the MGM Grand Garden. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 Officiating at the wedding of Top Rank Inc. vice-president Dan Goossen and 
Debbie Luery on Saturday at Bally's Las Vegas, boxing referee and Nevada 
Superior Court judge Mills Lane concluded, "I now pronounce you man and wife. 
Let's get it on!"

 "Seldom has a team, so thoroughly outplayed for so much of a match, made such 
vigorous complaint with so little cause. Brazil is deservedly in the World Cup 
semifinals and Holland should keep quiet, go home, reread the laws of the game 
and reflect on whether or not it had done enough to create a better fate for 
itself. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "When Bebeto put Brazil ahead, 2-0, at the Cotton Bowl, Holland had created a 
single scoring chance in the previous hour to Brazil's half-dozen, never mind 
another six Brazilian half-chances. Holland then spent almost two minutes 
protesting to Rodrigo Badilla, the Costa Rican referee, that the fact that 
Romario, walking away from a position three yards offside and back toward his 
half, with his head down, should have disqualified the goal. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Holland should have followed the old, old lesson: play to the whistle."

 Gary Lineker, a former English star who plays in Japan, told the Observer in 
London that Japanese audiences were not dismayed because Japan failed to 
qualify for the World Cup finals in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "It had completely the opposite effect," Lineker said. "Practically overnight, 
football went from a novelty, boom sport to a national obsession. Qualifying 
for the next World Cup immediately became a priority. What they had discovered 
was the patriotic fervor that, with the dubious exception of war, only football 
-- and in particular the World Cup -- can generate. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "The real talk, though, is not just of USA '94 but the possibilities of Japan 
(playing host to the event in) 2002."

 Six days before the World Cup opened, Sweden and Romania played a tuneup at 
Trabuco Hills High in Mission Viejo. Gheorghe Hagi scored with 15 minutes to 
play to lead Romania in a 1-1 tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Little did the players and coaches know that almost a month later they would 
be playing again for the right to play Brazil in Wednesday's semifinal at the 
Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing on a warm afternoon before almost 3,000 in June, the teams looked as 
if they were sparring instead of pressuring. During one point in the first 
half, Hagi stopped running toward a ball, turned to the Romanian contingent 
that was yelling at him and shouted back. The crowd laughed. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweden's only draw since then was in Group B play against Brazil, its next 
opponent. ELLIOTT ALMOND

patting themselves on the back right about now.

 They were among the few "experts" who predicted success for Bulgaria, which on 
Sunday upset Germany, 2-1, to advance to the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "With its good organization and its fabulous offensive potential, it could 
very well be one of the surprises of this World Cup," Onze declared. HELENE

Serb soldiers celebrated news of Bulgaria's victory. 
</P>

 The Serbs, who have surrounded the Bosnian capital since April of 1992, share 
linguistic, religious and ethnic ties with Bulgaria and are generally hostile 
toward Germany, against whom they fought in World War II.

 A bit more surprising was the announcement from goalkeeper Bodo Illgner that

</P>
<P>
 An angry German Coach Vogts expected Illgner to keep the news a secret for 
now.

<P>
 "He told me in the cabin (locker room) that he was retiring, but he was only 
going to tell me and not announce it," Vogts said. "Then I come out of the

 "Whether the consequences of America's creditable showing in this World Cup 
turn out to be important or trivial, lasting or fleeting, here and now there is 
an obligation to recognize the admirable qualities of the players who produced 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The natural tendency is to lunge into predictions about the impact their 
achievements will have on the future of professional football in the U.S.A. 
But, since such forecasts are invalidated by the scarcity of reliable evidence, 
it makes sense to remember that sport has less to do with expansionist dreams 
and commercial projections than with the celebration of the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was certainly 'a moment,' prolonged and exhilarating, that the U.S. team 
created. If it had accomplished no more than the silencing of a lot of smart 
mouths from coast to coast, the marginalizing of all those tiresome, insular 
cynics who sought to portray football as a pastime for adolescent girls that 
might contaminate the manhood of the nation, it would deserve widespread 
gratitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "But what they did out on the field had a much more positive dimension. They 
played with such honesty and seriousness of purpose, with such a strong and 
integrated spirit, that ultimately their efforts were not merely impressive but 
enough to evoke an emotional warmth -- and not only from their countrymen. . .

 In reflecting on the precarious finances of the Bulgarian team: 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a country that has qualified for six of the nine World Cup finals 
since 1962, though it had never won a match before this year's competition and 
was on the fringes of bankruptcy before securing passage to America. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sadder stories become less painful with each odds-bucking victory.Few 
Bulgarians will care to reflect that when he asked if he could travel last year 
to examine his foreign-based players, Coach Dimitar Penev was told he would 
have to buy a rucksack and stick out his thumb if he was to get past the 
Bulgarian border. Now his team is in the heart of preppy America walking down a 
cultural catwalk with the world championship looking into view. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'This is a beautiful stadium,' Penev said when he first saw the great 
shimmering arena shared by the New York Giants and Jets. 'I wish we could take 
it home with us.' "

 Germany's quarterfinal loss to Bulgaria surprised a lot of people -- including

 In preparing a seating chart for reporters covering Wednesday's semifinal game 
at Giants Stadium, they allotted a large block of seats for German reporters. 
Seems they have a lot of empty seats now, with Germany out of the tournament 
and the Bulgarian press corps consisting of only 36. HELENE ELLIOTT

 On the Brazil-Holland game Saturday: "The match will go down as a classic, if 
only for that second half. Had they opened up from the beginning, it could well 
have been one of the greatest matches in World Cup history."

 It was an emotional, and obviously confusing, time for Coach Javier Clemente 
of Spain, as he met the press a few minutes after his team lost to Italy, 2-1, 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 He was asked about a late injury to one of his players, a broken nose caused 
by an Italian elbow. 
</P>
<P>
 Who was hurt? 
</P>
<P>
 "It was Cassetas," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Luis Enrique. There is no "Cassetas" on Spain's team. BILL DWYRE
