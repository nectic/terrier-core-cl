 SURF'S UP: Orange County will be the world's surfing capital for the next two 
weeks, starting with the 13th Op Pro championships Tuesday through Sunday at 
the Huntington Beach Pier. The event has launched many toward stardom -- former 
world champion Kelly Slater of Cocoa Beach, Fla., capped his amateur career by 
winning there in 1989. . . . Slater has since won as a pro all over the world, 
but something's missing. "I've always wanted to win a major contest here in 
Huntington," said Slater, a former resident. "I've won some contests here, but 
never a big one." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. OPEN: The inaugural U.S. Open of Surfing Aug. 2-7 at Huntington Beach -- 
the first Assn. of Surfing Professionals' world tour event on the U.S. mainland 
since 1991 -- will bring together the sport's top men and women. But the format 
makes it possible for an unknown to surprise. The main competition will be 
one-on-one and single-elimination, giving everyone a chance to be a hero. . . . 
"In 20 minutes, you never know what could happen," said champion U.S. 
longboarder Joey Hawkins. "It's reduced to a battle for the waves." 
</P>
<P>
 TWICE AS NICE: Tandem surfing is an almost-forgotten art that combines 
gymnastics with wave-riding. Steve and Bari Boehne of Dana Point have been 
surfing together since the '60s and still teach others. . . . One early 
maneuver was "shooting the pier." Steve lifted Bari over his head, turned her 
parallel to the board while surfing through the pier's pilings, then they rode 
out the wave. "Two hundred people would watch from the pier, screaming and 
hollering as we came to it," Bari said. "Then they'd all run to the other side 
to see if we made it out." 
</P>
<P>
 WEARING WELL: Southern California is a center of the surf wear industry. 
Surfers Vinnie de la Pena and Shaine Lavoie started San Juan Capistrano-based 
Ezekiel two years ago with $50,000. They've since added outerwear companies and 
have projected sales of $1.5 million this year. "In specialty retail accounts, 
international is based off the Southern California image," de la Pena said. "If 
you make it here, you have a really good chance of becoming successful 
internationally."

 HELP WANTED: Since the Ventura County chapter of the Red Cross began its 
fund-raising drive to aid Rwandan refugees six weeks ago, only one check has 
arrived . . . for $40. "Normally, the typical response to international 
emergencies is a few thousand dollars," said chapter Director Brian E. Bolton. 
In part, he thinks, people feel overwhelmed by the enormity of the African 
crisis. "I compare it to all the people in Ventura County leaving and walking 
into Santa Barbara, and having no way to feed them," Bolton said. Donations can 
be sent to Rwanda Relief c/o American Red Cross, P.O. Box 5850, Ventura, Calif. 
93005-5850.

 HOME IMPROVEMENT: Speaking of humanitarian efforts . . . about 30 Simi Valley 
residents recently returned from Bud, W. Va., where they helped repair the 
homes of needy families as part of the Appalachian Service Project. The group 
of volunteers, ranging in age from 13 to 74, raised $29,000 to pay their own 
expenses. They did everything from roof to plumbing repairs. Said one 
volunteer: "The goal of the project was to make homes warmer, safer and drier." 
</P>
<P>
 OFF THE AIR: KDSK is Ventura County's only public access radio station. And 
its days are numbered (B6) . . . . Ventura County Cablevision, which transmits 
the station's programming, has decided to pull the plug on KDSK. . . . During 
its 10-year run, the nonprofit station has given many would-be disc jockeys a 
chance to ride the airwaves for free. Said disc-jockey Derek Underhill: "It's a 
small-town radio station with a small-town feeling. It would be a shame to let 
it die." 
</P>
<P>
 PAYING TRIBUTE: In memory of her late son, Richard, Carolyn Adams purchased 
for $100 an inscription on a plaque at the Ventura Pier (B1) . . . . Money 
collected from inscriptions continues to trickle in for a fund to keep the pier 
in good repair. "When you have someone and you love them and you lose them," 
said Adams, "the worst fear you have is that people will forget about him."

ASSAD SEES LITTLE PROGRESS IN ISRAEL TALKS

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Hafez Assad said Sunday he is uncertain whether peace with Israel 
can be achieved this year and that efforts by the United States to revive 
Syrian-Israeli talks have made little progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking after talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Assad said peace 
talks between Syria and Israel are still at an "exploratory stage." 
</P>
<P>
 Mubarak, who was in Damascus to try to help break a deadlock in the 
negotiations, left for home after two sessions of talks with Assad. 
</P>
<P>
 Assad praised efforts by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher to revive 
the Syrian-Israeli talks but said no tangible progress has been made. 
</P>
<P>
 Success in the Syrian-Israeli negotiations would remove the biggest obstacle 
to peace in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel has offered a staged pullout from the Golan Heights over eight years in 
return for normal ties with Damascus; Syria has said withdrawal should precede 
discussion of future ties.

MTA BUS STRIKE STILL THREATENED TODAY; TRANSIT: DRIVERS UNION TENTATIVELY OKS A 
CONTRACT BUT WAS TO STOP WORK AT MIDNIGHT IN SUPPORT OF CLERKS AND MECHANICS IF 
THEY FAILED TO REACH AN AGREEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Although the drivers union reached a tentative contract settlement Sunday, 
clerks and mechanics for Los Angeles County's Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority were still poised to strike at 12:01 a.m. today, and the drivers 
union said it would honor their picket lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations continued late Sunday. The labor dispute could strand 1.2 million 
riders and create a traffic Sig-Alert for everybody else. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be the first shutdown of the nation's second-largest transit system 
since 1982, when drivers walked off their job for five days, and provide a 
double whammy to bus and train riders who two weeks ago were hit with a fare 
increase. There was a 68-day walkout in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations continued Sunday evening at a Burbank hotel. Contracts between 
unions representing 6,500 bus and train drivers, mechanics and clerks expired 
June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson could seek a court order imposing a 60-day cooling-off period 
to delay a strike, but Wilson spokesman Paul Kranhold said Sunday that the 
governor will not intervene. 
</P>
<P>
 A Wilson aide pointed out that both Democrats and Republicans on the MTA board 
had unanimously asked Wilson not to intercede, in an apparent tactic to 
pressure the unions to reach a settlement. The bus drivers union has asked 
Wilson to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
 But it also benefits Wilson politically not to intervene, transit officials 
said. For the governor, it would be better to have a strike now rather than 
closer to the November election, when it would be fresher in voters' minds. 
Wilson has said that he is concerned that delaying a strike until September 
would hit students returning to school. 
</P>
<P>
 In the event of a strike, MTA plans to operate about 300 buses on the 30 
busiest routes -- a mix of MTA buses operated by non-union workers and yellow 
school buses driven by drivers from private companies. (Usually, the MTA 
operates 1,900 buses on 200 routes.) MTA is paying $160,000 a day to contract 
with two private bus companies. Service on the Blue Line and the Red Line 
subway would continue. Bus and train service would operate only from 6 a.m. to 
6 p.m. weekdays. 
</P>
<P>
 The fare on MTA buses and the Metro Blue Line would be 50 cents during a 
strike, with no transfers. Elderly and disabled would pay 25 cents. Fare on the 
Red Line would remain 25 cents. No fee would be charged to board the private 
school buses during at least the first week of the walkout. Once fare boxes 
were installed, the fares would be the same as other strike fares. 
</P>
<P>
 "Driver qualifications and maintenance standards for MTA buses and trains 
during a strike will not be compromised," said Franklin White, MTA's chief 
executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, MTA replacement drivers would be supervisors who once drove buses. 
But the MTA is training other workers to drive buses if the strike drags on. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike transit workers in some East Coast cities, California bus and train 
operators are not prohibited from striking. 
</P>
<P>
 A strike would not include the Metrolink commuter rail or municipal or private 
operators such as the Los Angeles city commuter express and DASH shuttle buses, 
the Long Beach, Montebello and Santa Monica municipal lines and Foothill 
Transit. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink plans to increase train service in the event of a strike. And 
officials plan to modify the routes of the DASH shuttle and commuter express 
lines to link up to MTA buses in the event of a strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Yates, head of the Los Angeles Department of Transportation, said he 
will be monitoring traffic conditions on a computer in City Hall and assign 500 
traffic control officers as needed to congested intersections. A special team 
of traffic engineers, who put together traffic-easing measures during the 1984 
Olympics and January earthquake, also was standing by. 
</P>
<P>
 The transit workers were set to strike last Monday but delayed the walkout for 
a week after Mayor Richard Riordan and other top transit officials agreed to 
meet with union leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 The big sticking point has been proposed changes in work rules and 
contracting. The agency wants to turn over some bus lines to private operators, 
cut back on drivers' overtime and reduce the MTA contribution to health 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Union members say contracting will eliminate some jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Information is available to commuters at 1-800-COMMUTE. For Metrolink: 
1-800-371-LINK.

TB: IT'S BACK, IT'S VIRULENT, IT'S TROUBLE; TIME TO RETURN TO OPTION OF 
MANDATORY ANNUAL SCHOOL TESTS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As recently as two decades ago, children attending public school in California 
were required to line up and receive a tuberculin skin test from the school 
nurse or other public-health official every year. The purpose of the dull, and 
at times slightly painful, exercise was simple: to control and ultimately 
eliminate tuberculosis, a centuries-old global scourge that slowly, corrosively 
and painfully snuffs out human life by ravaging the lungs. 
</P>
<P>
 ONCE UNDER CONTROL: For a time, those and other efforts to control TB -- 
through frequent screenings and, when necessary, immediate, aggressive and 
sustained treatment -- resulted in a dramatic reduction in the disease -- not 
only in the state of California, but across the nation. Health statistics bore 
that out. By 1985, TB fell to a historic low of 22,210 U.S. cases from a high 
of 84,000 in the early 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 With the TB threat perceived to be receding, public-health officials 
understandably turned their attention and resources to other health problems, 
most notably the emerging AIDS epidemic. Most schools, too, began to loosen 
standards, dropping school-based testing requirements and opting instead for 
proof of a TB test from a child's personal physician upon his or her initial 
enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, while most everyone was looking the other way, TB flared anew in 
urban areas among addicts, the homeless, AIDS patients and immigrant 
populations. But in marked contrast to TB cases of yore, traditionally treated 
with a combination of medicines, a growing number of these new patients were 
afflicted with TB strains that resist all the usual drugs. Yet, despite these 
alarming new strains and the fact that these days 3 million people around the 
world die annually of the disease, the United States has been slow to recognize 
the return of this villain. 
</P>
<P>
 ON THE UPSURGE: Nowhere is that truer than in California, which leads the 
nation in TB with one out every five cases. It's particularly evident here in 
Southern California, where state officials have now officially confirmed the 
largest-ever reported outbreak of drug-resistant tuberculosis at a U.S. high 
school. The affected students attend La Quinta High in Westminster, where, 
since September, 1993, nearly 300 students have tested positive for TB, with 
more than 80 exposed to the drug-resistant strains. Seventeen have developed 
active TB cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Centers for Disease Control concluded that the outbreak began with 
the failure of a private physician to recognize, properly treat and immediately 
report a La Quinta student who developed a drug-resistant strain of TB and was 
contagious for more than a year. For their part, and to their credit, Orange 
County health officials responded to contain the outbreak at La Quinta High 
once they understood its magnitude. 
</P>
<P>
 But this case raises disturbing questions about how prepared California school 
districts are to react to -- or better yet preempt -- TB. A TB-mitigation plan 
for California schools is conspicuously absent from the state's Strategic Plan 
for Tuberculosis Control and Elimination. 
</P>
<P>
 REGAINING CONTROL: Sending county, state or federal health officials out to a 
school after an outbreak is too late. And merely asking kids to take one TB 
test -- when they can be so easily exposed any time after that -- is too 
little. State officials need to conduct an urgent cost/benefit analysis on a 
program that would return to the days of yearly TB tests in schools. That 
approach worked then; it can work now.

INHERENT ILLOGIC OF 'DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thanks to the Navy, the utter vacuity of the new "don't ask, don't tell" 
policy on homosexuals in the military is now apparent for all to see. A few 
days ago, naval boards of inquiry recommended cashiering two officers and an 
enlisted man who declared their homosexuality. The most notable was Lt. Tracy 
W. Thorne. The Navy did not ask, but he told -- in a big way, on the national 
ABC "Nightline" show. So now this 27-year-old bombardier with an excellent 
military record is suddenly considered unfit for service. He plans to appeal to 
federal court. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the Clinton Administration is in the awkward position of having to tell 
judges that homosexuals should be dismissed -- the exact opposite of Clinton's 
campaign pledge to abolish the ban. This absurd position was a predictable 
result of the commander in chief's caving in to the military brass and 
congressional doubters. 
</P>
<P>
 Under this policy, homosexual orientation per se is not a bar to service. But 
disclosing one's homosexuality is considered presumptive evidence of a 
"propensity" for homosexual conduct, which is grounds for dismissal. It is on 
this slippery slope of vague legalisms that gay service people are supposed to 
conduct their daily lives. In essence, then, "don't ask, don't tell" means no 
change from the old policy. And indeed, many military commanders are proving 
themselves just as ruthless as ever in cleansing the ranks of gay and lesbian 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 The courts have traditionally deferred to the military in such matters. But 
that is changing. Federal District Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr. of Los Angeles has 
ordered the Navy to retain Petty Officer V. Keith Meinhold; the government 
appealed and a ruling is expected soon from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. 
In Seattle last month, Federal District Judge Thomas S. Zilly, a Reagan 
appointee, ordered the National Guard to reinstate Col. Margarethe Cammermeyer, 
a highly decorated nurse. 
</P>
<P>
 Last November, a three-judge appeals panel in Washington ruled that the Naval 
Academy had unconstitutionally denied a commission to Midshipman Joseph C. 
Steffan; in May the full 11-judge bench heard the case. And in April, six gay 
service people mounted the first outright challenge to the new Clinton policy 
in Federal court in Brooklyn and won an initial victory from Judge Eugene H. 
Nickerson, who issued a preliminary injunction forbidding the military from 
discharging or investigating the six while the suit was pending. 
</P>
<P>
 In this and other cases, the gay sailors and soldiers continue to serve 
without any apparent deterioration of unit morale and cohesion, the chief 
reason given for barring homosexuals. It is now more likely than ever that the 
issue will be appealed to the Supreme Court. We hope that the court will have 
the courage that President Clinton lacked and bring an end to this absurd 
policy that both caters to base prejudices and denies the United States the 
services of many capable and loyal citizens.

LIBRARIES GET A RENEWED SHELF LIFE; DETERMINED FRIENDS SERVE NOTICE THAT THEY 
WON'T GIVE UP WITHOUT A FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The last few years have witnessed the depressing sight of cash-starved public 
libraries dropping magazine subscriptions and cutting back on book purchases. 
Worse, they have reduced hours as well, sometimes whole days: All 27 Orange 
County-run libraries are shut on Fridays; 10 Los Angeles County-run libraries 
have closed completely. 
</P>
<P>
 But anyone concerned that the public does not care for these buildings that 
provide intellectual nourishment, and sometimes even serve as day-care centers 
for latchkey kids, should take heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends of libraries are stepping forward in various places. Last week Los 
Angeles County supervisors tentatively endorsed a worthwhile proposal to raise 
$30 million annually by taxing property owners in areas covered by the county 
library district. Library officials realize that they will have to lobby the 
public for support, but they should be encouraged by similar campaigns waged 
successfully in Altadena and South Pasadena last month and in Pasadena last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Three thousand people showed up this month for the opening of Newport Beach's 
new, $8.2-million central library, a well-buffed jewel that sparkled in the 
sun. Moreover, just days before the ribbon-cutting in Newport Beach, the Laguna 
Beach library reopened to appreciative readers after a $500,000 face-lift that 
closed the county-run building for more than two months. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newport Beach opening was the culmination of seven years of planning, 
evidence that elected officials could display foresight and leadership. The 
bulk of the funds for the building came from bonds authorized by the taxpayers; 
businesses, community groups and individuals chipped in nearly $2 million. The 
Irvine Co. donated the site. It was a good example of the public-private 
partnership that Orange County has displayed a number of times, one worth 
imitating elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach is a wealthy community, but it has been affected as other cities 
in Southern California by the recession. The library budget has been cut by 
7.5% this year; the branch libraries that were open 65 hours a week two years 
ago were open 54 hours a week last year and 45 hours a week this year. All the 
more reason to celebrate the new library, which replaced a smaller facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Public libraries provide the space and tools that feed the imagination and 
encourage hope for better days. While they have fallen on hard times, the 
festivities and ballot box wins provide promise for the future.

DONNA SHALALA

<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "The Instant Formula for Poverty," editorial, July 16: 
</P>
<P>
 It's laughable that we're revisiting the Murphy Brown controversy again and 
giving time to book-shill (and possible presidential shill) Dan Quayle, who was 
rightly lambasted for blaming a national problem on a fictional character. What 
Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala said in comment to a 
ridiculous question was the safe political answer which, rightly or wrongly, 
has become obligatory. 
</P>
<P>
 But what is amazing is that you and Dan Quayle keep focusing on this issue of 
marriage, which, if one looks closer at Shalala's comments, seems to obfuscate 
the real cause of the problem. "Approximately 80% of the children born to teen 
parents who dropped out of high school and did not marry are poor." She further 
cites "8% of the children born to married high school graduates . . . are 
poor." Do you really think that not having said "I do" had more influence on 
these people's economic status than not finishing high school?  
</P>
<P>
 The answer isn't a moral crusade that can't possibly be legislated. To 
paraphrase the President's campaign theme: It's education, stupid! We can't 
find a husband for every unwed mother but we can help those that need to get 
educated and thereby get jobs.

 One of the few items standing between pregnancy and Mother Nature's creative

Shalala's hope of abstinence (July 15), with or without Murphy Brown as role 
model, is one of a dreamer. JACK BRUKMAN

DEBATE OVER HEALTH CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My brother broke his leg two weeks ago. The doctor at the hospital he was 
taken to refused to treat him for nine hours, made him sit in a hallway without 
the benefit of pain medication and then berated him for being so stupid as to 
not have health insurance. The way I see it, this doctor was not a 
"professional dedicated to patients' well-being" (letter, July 19), he was 
solely interested in whether or not my brother had money.

 My brother was admitted to County-USC in need of surgery. I wonder if this

given my brother the care he needed, no, deserved.

 We don't have a health-care crisis in this country, we have a health-care 
disgrace. It's about time that insurance companies own up to their part in this

 Patrick Buchanan says President Clinton's policies may just succeed in 
destroying the Democratic Party's hold on Catholics (Column Right, July 17). My 
Catholic family and I left the Democratic Party 20 years ago when it became the 
Democratic Abortion Party. 
</P>
<P>
 However, one doesn't have to be a Catholic to recognize that abortion is the 
killing of a life -- the life of a tiny baby girl or boy whose own heart began 
beating 18-25 days after it was conceived; 40 days after conception, the child 
had detectable brain waves. By the time that little girl or boy reaches the 
average age for an abortion, all its body systems are working and it is able to 
perform a variety of activities. 
</P>
<P>
 It is indeed an American tragedy that the Democratic Party continues to reject 
the right of life for the defenseless unborn child.

 It's interesting that Buchanan, in his usual tirades against homosexuals and 
abortion, would use President Kennedy's 1960 victory as an example. During that 
election, Kennedy had to broaden his appeal in order to silence critics who 
felt that the election of a Catholic into the White House would make the U.S. 
subject to papal edicts. 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't it ironic that as the religious right encroaches into our government, 
those critics would be proved correct some 30 years later. Vatican forces have 
organized special-interest groups, both foreign and domestic, intent on 
influencing U.S. policy to reflect the Pope's will. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even as Catholics and other Christians mobilize into a political force, 
they seem to have forgotten that being in the political spotlight has its barbs 
as well. Buchanan whines about so-called "Catholic bashing," yet feels that the 
church is above reproach when it campaigns to treat gays and women as 
second-class citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Buchanan should remember that we live in a democratic society, and 
that criticism of political ideals is not just limited to the most 
self-righteous among us.

 Hooray for the Dole/Packwood and Senate Finance Committee health proposals 
that don't mandate participation but do require affordable insurance be made 
available for those with pre-existing conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 If this passes I'm going to wait until I'm sick and then buy my health 
insurance! 
</P>
<P>
 If only we could have the same reforms for auto, fire, earthquake and life 
insurance. Follow the logic: Let's eliminate death as a pre-existing condition 
that denies life insurance!

 It is most interesting that when the Catholic bishops came out against 
coverage of reproductive health in the national health plan, it was front-page 
news (July 14). But the formation of a coalition of religious leaders to oppose 
the invocation of God "to assert the moral superiority of one group of people 
over another" is relegated to the back pages (July 15). I guess those who 
support religious freedom aren't very newsworthy.

DORNAN QUOTATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Allow me a few comments on yet another Times election-year hit piece of 
selected liberal quotations from my 33 years in the public eye (" 'Shut Up' Not 
in Dornan's Vocabulary," July 15). 
</P>
<P>
 First, for the past 33 years I have made my living by speaking on the record, 
first as a talk-show guest, then host, then commentator, then producer-host 
(television and radio), and then as an eight-time elected federal official. And 
in all that time and with all those millions of words The Times can only find a 
couple of one-word misspeaks? That is a darn good record if you ask me. People 
I respect appreciate a straight-from-the-shoulder, no-nonsense, up-front 
fighter. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, the reason people dismissed those slips is that they knew Bob Dornan's 
track record. I marched with Martin Luther King and, at great personal risk, 
registered black voters in the South. I have a record of support for Israel and 
Jewish causes that is second to none -- better, in fact, than many liberal 
Jewish House members. A man is judged by his deeds, not words, and my deeds 
speak volumes. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the vast majority of Americans would agree with the sentiments 
contained in a Dornan quote from eight years ago that Oliver Stone thinks is 
repugnant: "I, personally, can hear a faint bugle call echoing down through 210 
years of American history a challenge. A challenge that calls out to all 
Americans, 'Defend your homeland, defend the West, defend Judeo-Christian 
ethical standards, defend Western civilization, defend liberty.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that some people find that quote offensive says far more about them 
than it does about me. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In Congress, "B-1 Bob" is a "Stealth" with a bad muffler! Loud, ineffective 
and embarrassingly costly. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan is a joke in Washington. He has done zip, nothing, nada . He has used 
every ethnic slur (he thought he could get away with) while representing one of 
the most ethnically diversified districts in the country. He lobbied President 
Bush for the drug czar position. We later find out his wife has been abusing 
drugs for over a decade. (Is it me, or is he brain dead?) 
</P>
<P>
 If you live in Dornan's district and are a registered voter, I'd suggest you 
stop and look in a mirror before going to the polls. Because, if you don't look 
like Rush Limbaugh, Bob Dornan "don't hear you"!

NUCLEAR WEAPONS PORN

<P>
 A July 12 article described the use of computers at the Lawrence Livermore 
National Laboratory "to store and distribute hard-core pornography." It is 
unfortunate that many Americans still have not recognized that the work of the 
nuclear weapons labs in designing, testing and improving nuclear weapons is an 
even more serious form of pornography. What could be more obscene than 
developing weapons that melt eyeballs, cook flesh and incinerate human beings 
-- weapons of mass murder that place the entire human species in danger of 
annihilation?

UNSUNG LIBRARIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Recently I had a phone call from the Hollywood Library. I spoke with the head 
librarian, Noreen Shaw. It seems I had inadvertently left a check in one of the 
books I had returned and Mrs. Shaw was kind enough to call and tell me.It was 
not my first meeting with Mrs. Shaw. She had been good enough to allow me a 
late return on a book I had mislaid after the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 When I came for my check, Mrs. Shaw revealed she was relieved to find it 
wasn't someone who had come to threaten her. I was surprised to discover this 
is a frequent occurrence in the lives of our librarians. However, this did not 
seem to faze Mrs. Shaw in the least. 
</P>
<P>
 I write this letter to salute Mrs. Shaw. She is an unsung hero in a city that 
can use all the heroes it can get. I salute her hard work, her good humor, her 
dedication and simple acts of human kindness. I'm sure there are other Mrs. 
Shaws worthy of similar praise.

PERSPECTIVE ON INTERACTIVE MEDIA; 500 CHANNELS, PROGRAMMED LIVES; WE WILL GAIN 
IN TECHNOLOGY BUT LOSE IN HUMAN CONTACT AND THE COMMONALITY OF OUR CULTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS PALUMBO, Dennis Palumbo, a former Hollywood screenwriter, is a 
psychotherapist in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The communications wave of the future is about to crest: interactive media. We 
hear of 500 channels, total interactive connection between the viewer and 
screen along a superhighway of unparalleled program choices. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of the new technologies see nothing but bounty for the viewer: more 
control over what one watches, and when; true interaction with what's on 
screen, to the point of altering it to taste; education and travel with an 
intimacy and immediacy previously unheard of; push-button voting on political 
and social issues, viewer talk-back during candidate debates. 
</P>
<P>
 I offer, however, three concerns that might invite further debate. 
</P>
<P>
 The first has its roots in my college days in the late 1960s, when every 
communications class was being taught that with the coming of cable, 
programming as we understood it would change forever. Cable would at last 
decentralize the media, and more diverse (non-dominant-culture) opinions and 
programming would be available. With a multitude of channels, advertisers would 
have to split their media budgets into many different small-market pieces, thus 
shaking the capitalist stranglehold on national communications. (This was the 
'60s, remember.) 
</P>
<P>
 Well, this didn't happen. We have cable now, and the promise of 500 channels 
in the future, but communications are no more decentralized than before. In 
fact, media are more corporate and centralized than ever, with us a passive 
audience. A handful of conglomerates controls the technology and its 
distribution in a way similar to 30 years ago. Whether a new channel is 
all-sports, all-rap, all-Republican, all-Spanish or all-evangelical, the parent 
company will be one of that handful. 
</P>
<P>
 But, wait a minute, won't interactive media make us less passive? Only in a 
phantom sense because we'll be primarily interacting conditionally and 
competitively, among a schematic of predetermined options. 
</P>
<P>
 Which brings me to my second point: Real art -- or real entertainment -- 
already interacts with us, and in a much deeper way. It engages our feelings, 
intellect and aesthetic. Moreover, the particularity of the artist's inner 
world is what resonates with us, often at levels outside of our conscious 
awareness. 
</P>
<P>
 Interactive programming, as currently proposed, robs us of the primacy of the 
artist's unconscious -- in the case of TV and film, the experience of that 
special, private space between viewer and viewed. This is a profound loss. The 
more specific and personal a detail in character or story, the more powerfully 
its impact generalizes out to the audience. (The specifics of Rocky Balboa's 
life in the first "Rocky" film were shared by few in the audience, I'm sure, 
but everyone understood what he meant by "going the distance." 
</P>
<P>
 Admittedly, my feelings about this are influenced by my own career as a writer 
and my belief in the personal, unalloyed vision necessary for the writer to 
speak to the audience's issues. 
</P>
<P>
 (Or, put another way: If a camel is a horse designed by committee, watching a 
program co-created by its own viewers will be a particularly bumpy ride.) 
</P>
<P>
 My final concern is grounded in the belief that, if nothing else, we all have 
a shared history based on the TV pictures of the past years common to all 
Americans. A national memory shadowed by the same video images of Lucille Ball 
and Edward R. Murrow, the moon landing and the Mod Squad, Melrose Place and the 
nightmare-in-slow-motion that was Dallas in '63. 
</P>
<P>
 With the advent of the new technologies, this shared history is threatened. If 
we all control our screens, if we can program what we watch and when for the 
sake of convenience, we lose this common experience in our culture. 
</P>
<P>
 The great danger of the 500-channel, interactive superhighway of the 
communications web is that the community of the culture goes underground. And 
therefore, our sense of fragmentation is augmented even more; our sense of 
remove from the greater whole is enhanced. Ultimately, the more connected by 
screens -- and only by screen -- we become, the more fictionalized our 
experience. Already I know people having love affairs through E-mail, spared 
the messiness of real human contact. 
</P>
<P>
 The interactive promise, whether you're a big-game hunter in the virtual 
reality of Africa or just an average Joe in the throes of a torrid affair with 
Madonna, is that such fantasies can be explored while being controlled. A real 
relationship -- whether with a rhino or a pop star -- cannot. From this 
perspective, a controlled experience, rather than being limitless, can be seen 
to be limited. In the final analysis, "a planned world," writes John Fowles, 
"is a dead world." 
</P>
<P>
 Like most people, I'm as much intrigued and awed by the communications 
technology to come as I am dismayed and suspicious. And as a therapist, many of 
whose clients are and will be in the vanguard of the new media, I'm curious as 
to what effect these interactive technologies will have on the ways families 
communicate, children are educated and people see themselves as citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 But, in the end, I hope we'll cling more to the raw materials of authentic 
experience, to the interactive technique known as a human encounter. As poet 
Gary Snyder wrote, "A hand that can push a button will never know what else a 
hand can do."

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; WILD, WITTY YARN ABOUT THE DEATH OF GOD; TOWING JEHOVAH BY 
JAMES MORROW ; HARCOURT BRACE $23.95, 327 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 God is dead. 
</P>
<P>
 People used to say that a lot in the 1950s. Academic types, French 
existentialists. 
</P>
<P>
 I was just a kid. I didn't know whether they meant that there had been a God 
once and he had gone poof! or that he hadn't ever existed and it was our naive 
belief in him that had died. 
</P>
<P>
 I still don't. Back then, I wasn't sure they knew. They seemed to mean it both 
ways at once, which was logically impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 In fiction, necessarily, the idea was less abstract, more corporeal. Philip 
Wylie, the once-famous author of "A Generation of Vipers," wrote a story about 
an angel who fatally crash-lands on Earth like a space shuttle with faulty 
O-rings. Tom Robbins' first novel, "Another Roadside Attraction," had the 
Catholic Church concealing a 2,000-year-old secret -- the unresurrected body of 
Christ -- in the Vatican basement. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it's James Morrow's turn. In "Towing Jehovah," the veteran science-fiction 
writer ("Only Begotten Daughter," "City of Truth") has God die and fall into 
the Atlantic Ocean. The Angel Raphael, wasting away like the rest of the 
heavenly host of "terminal empathy," enlists a disgraced supertanker captain, 
Anthony Van Horne, to tow the two-mile-long corpse to an Arctic tomb before it 
rots or is eaten by sharks. 
</P>
<P>
 The expedition is underwritten by the Holy See, which hopes that salvageable 
neurons remain flickering in God's brain. Otherwise, the Church would just as 
soon pour crude oil over the embarrassing remains and set them afire -- hardly 
what the angels had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 In this satire of Western culture both sacred and profane, Van Horne must 
contend with more than hurricanes, icebergs and bad dreams. His ship runs 
aground on an uncharted island. His crew mutinies. The Vatican sends out an 
armed vessel to intercept him, captained by the stern father who hasn't spoken 
to Van Horne in years. 
</P>
<P>
 There's worse. Cassie Fowler, a castaway Van Horne picks up at St. Paul's 
Rocks, is a feminist and rationalist. God's death is no consolation to her; she 
is horrified to discover that he did exist, and that he was, after all, the 
white-bearded "God of Western patriarchy." No less than the Church, she wants 
to get rid of the corpse. 
</P>
<P>
 More happens in "Towing Jehovah" than can be summarized here. Morrow makes it 
happen with Vonnegutian verve and wit and an enviable expertise in fields 
ranging from seamanship to junk food to Bob Hope routines to theology. He 
echoes the Bible, Shakespeare ("The Tempest"), Dostoevski and Cecil B. DeMille. 
His exploration of "theo-thanatology" touches all the bases: 
</P>
<P>
 Does God's absence give humankind the amoral and terrible freedom that Ivan 
Karamazov envisaged? Are there really no atheists in foxholes? Can religion 
continue to flourish without God? Can quarter-pounders with cheese replace 
communion wafers? 
</P>
<P>
 Only twice in this wild yarn do we pause in doubt. The first is when the 
island, studded with pagan ruins, rises from the sea to intercept the ship. We 
drift away from both God and Van Horne then; we pass from a semi-realistic 
world in which one incredible thing has happened into a world in which 
unbridled magic begins to lose its value. 
</P>
<P>
 The second is at the end, when the issues Morrow has raised grumble and 
subside, like lions too sleepy and overfed to eat the lambs they lie among. 
This is where he parts company from Vonnegut, whose every book is haunted by 
the night he spent in Slaughterhouse-5 while the bombs fell overhead on 
Dresden, and from those postwar existentialists, who were driven to their 
conclusions -- however ambiguous -- by genuine horrors. They cared. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes this novel so buoyant and, ultimately, a little disappointing, is 
that Morrow doesn't care as much.

EXPO ROOKIE HAS DODGERS WAVING A WHITE FLAG, 7-4; BASEBALL: RONDELL WHITE, WHO 
HAD MADE 10 STARTS, DRIVES IN ALL OF HIS TEAM'S RUNS AS L.A. LOSES FIFTH IN A 
ROW.

<P>
 Rookie Rondell White turned a rare start into a one-man show. 
</P>
<P>
 White drove in all seven Montreal runs with a homer, double and two singles as 
the Expos beat the fading Dodgers, 7-4, on Sunday for their sixth consecutive 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll probably never do that again, so I really should appreciate it," White 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "With people on base, I tend to concentrate more," he said. "After I got my 
first hit, I started to relax. After my second hit, everything was a bonus." 
</P>
<P>
 The Expos swept the three-game series and improved to 60-37, the best record 
in the NL. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers, leading the NL West, lost their fifth in a row. They dropped to 
2-8 on a trip that concludes with a three-game series at Candlestick Park 
against Darryl Strawberry and the San Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 White went four for five, striking out once with the bases loaded. The 
22-year-old left fielder had made only 10 starts this season and was batting 
.255 with four RBIs in 51 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've only been in three games since the break, but this should carry me for a 
while," White said. 
</P>
<P>
 White had a run-scoring single in the first inning. He connected for his first 
homer of the year, a three-run shot, for a 4-1 lead in the third. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fifth, White delivered a two-run double that chased Kevin Gross (7-7). 
White came up with the bases loaded in the sixth, but struck out against Roger 
McDowell. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too bad circumstances don't allow a man like that to play every day," 
Expo Manager Felipe Alou said, "but he will next year. Somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 The three batters ahead of White set him up nicely. Rookie Cliff Floyd went 
four for four with a walk, Moises Alou had three hits and Darrin Fletcher had 
two hits. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'll probably remember this day for the rest of his life," Dodger Manager 
Tom Lasorda said of White. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Karros and Mitch Webster hit consecutive homers against Kirk Rueter (6-2) 
in the fourth, cutting the Dodgers' deficit to 4-3. It was Karros' first homer 
in 146 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
 Rueter gave up three runs in five innings and won his third consecutive start. 
John Wetteland got four outs for his 18th save, giving up a pinch-hit homer by 
Chris Gwynn in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 Gross gave up six runs and 11 hits in four innings. He is winless in his last 
five starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal ran its home record to 25-5 against the Dodgers since 1990. The Expos 
finished 9-3 against the Dodgers overall this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be all right, we're just not doing anything much right now," Webster 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers loaded the bases with none out in the first but got only one run 
as Tim Wallach grounded into a double play. Catcher Mike Piazza's botched play 
during a rundown in the first led to Montreal's first run.

THE NBA / MARK HEISLER; ARE CLIPPERS DOOMED TO REPEATING HISTORY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Let us review the names of the great ex-Clippers of the last 15 months: Larry 
Brown, Ken Norman, Danny Manning, Mark Jackson, Dominque Wilkins. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Because it's as easy to spot Amelia Earhart as a Clipper official these days, 
and because the Clippers haven't bothered to explain what they're doing, as a 
public service we'll step in. 
</P>
<P>
 They're starting over. 
</P>
<P>
 How else to explain their latest decision, letting Wilkins walk? 
</P>
<P>
 There are several reasons why the Clippers haven't said what they're doing: 1) 
They're embarrassed because observers have been predicting this for years; 2) 
They don't like to appear in public; 3) They're busy not hiring a coach, and 4) 
They might not have realized it yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Since time is of the essence and they need to start thinking of marketing 
themes for next season, here are some suggestions: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rebuilding: No One Does It the Way We Do. 
</P>
<P>
 -- This Time We'll Get It Right. 
</P>
<P>
 -- So You Think You Can Coach in the NBA? Win Our Door Prize and See. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Come See Lamond Murray, Eric Piatkowski, Pooh Richardson, Stanley Roberts 
and the Exciting Young Clips (While They're Still Here) in Our 
Soon-to-be-Announced New Arena (Wherever). 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the Clippers have chosen the correct course of action, although they 
would have been better off if they had chosen it in February when they selected 
Wilkins over the other packages offered for Manning. They concede they knew 
what Wilkins wanted -- $21 million over three years -- and they must have known 
his age -- 34 -- but they made the deal anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only that, they claimed to be unanimous in the decision. Owner Donald T. 
Sterling branded reports that he had cast the deciding vote "lies." 
</P>
<P>
 Six months later, needing only to come up with $12 million to beat the Boston 
Celtics' offer, they passed. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, they were swamped with bids for Manning. For example, the 
Portland Trail Blazers offered Harvey Grant and James Robinson, and the Orlando 
Magic offered Dennis Scott, Anthony Avent and two No. 1 picks. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, for the Clippers' six-year investment in Manning, whom they attained 
after drawing the lucky ball in the 1988 lottery, they have nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 They're going to have to hire someone to take charge of these kids, so in a 
few days, weeks or months, they'll announce a new coach for the next 18 months 
or so. Last season, it took 62 days to find Bobby Weiss. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, they're up to 70 days. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is easy to account for. 
</P>
<P>
 Each time a vacancy occurs, Sterling dreams of landing a big-timer. This time, 
he reportedly came up with two mega-biggies, Pat Riley and Larry Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Dreams are nice, but Sterling is delusional (See: We're Going to Get Danny to 
Stay, the fantasy he clung to for years). The only way Sterling could get Riley 
or Brown would be to give them his franchise -- a good idea, but another 
delusion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, of course, deny interest in either. However, they actually 
announced they wanted Riley a year ago and this time the New York Knicks took 
it seriously enough to give him an extension. The Indiana Pacers took the 
rumbles about Brown seriously enough to call the Clippers and tell them if they 
had any thought of Brown returning, forget it. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Elgin Baylor, vice president of basketball operations, has the task 
of finding candidates who are actually interested. 
</P>
<P>
 The names emerging are Randy Pfund (nice guy, known locally, could do a good 
job in a rebuilding program with proper support); Bill Fitch (a good man but a 
hard man, would need plenty of support, would actually be better running the 
organization); and Bill Musselman (what are they, crazy?) 
</P>
<P>
 Then Baylor has to wait two months until Sterling realizes this won't be the 
year they land the elephant and reconciles himself to accepting whomever. 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, it's a hollow exercise. It doesn't matter whom they hire. They had 
fine young players and at least one outstanding coach and look where it got 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is the front office, where Sterling must fire Baylor (so far 
Sterling has contented himself with firing coaches) or give him real power (a 
longshot); must reassign surrogate son and executive vice president Andy Roeser 
to the Sterling Corporation, where he'd be out of harm's way (longer shot); 
then must sit back and let his pros run the show (off the board). 
</P>
<P>
 You've already seen what will happen otherwise. It's called Clipper history.

 Wangila Napunyi, a 1988 Olympic boxing gold medalist from Kenya, remained in 
critical condition in Las Vegas with a head injury suffered during a fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Napunyi was fighting David Gonzales of Houston in a scheduled 10-round 
welterweight match Friday night at the Aladdin Hotel when the referee stopped 
the bout, won by Gonzales. Napunyi later collapsed in his dressing room. 
</P>
<P>
 Albert Capanna, who performed surgery on Napunyi at University Medical Center, 
said "He is not getting any better. . . . It doesn't look really good. That 
doesn't mean it can't get better."

DANCE REVIEW; 'KALEIDOSCOPE': THE SHOWCASE IS THE THING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It has been a long time since anyone really believed that "Dance Kaleidoscope" 
presents the best of Southern California dance. Indeed, the six or seven most 
celebrated local companies no longer seek to appear in this annual showcase 
series, and the emerging rebels of the community are increasingly unwelcome to 
a selection panel dominated by academics. 
</P>
<P>
 No, in its six years at Cal State Los Angeles, "Dance Kaleidoscope" has become 
a kind of trade show: the place where isolated local artists and their 
followers can gain a sense of what others have been doing for the past 12 
months and perhaps even achieve a fleeting sense of connection. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly "Kaleidoscope" looms large in the Southland's dance consciousness. 
You may create exciting work for sellout crowds elsewhere (Jacques Heim, for 
example) but remain something of a non-person to your colleagues if you're 
rejected here. Or you can become a "Kaleidoscope" fixture and somehow matter in 
the local firmament even if nobody ever sees you anyplace else (Patricia 
Sandback, among others). 
</P>
<P>
 The opening of "Dance Kaleidoscope '94," at the State Playhouse on Friday 
raised the usual questions about the selection process. (For starters, how many 
judges on the 11-member panel actually attend local dance events on a regular 
basis?) 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the 10 pieces on Program A seemed chosen for craftsmanship rather than 
originality, and a sense of the unique dangers and tensions of living in this 
place at this moment seldom intruded on the well-made etudes on view. Instead, 
the subject of relationships emerged as the preoccupation of nearly half the 
artists. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Umbrellas," for instance, mimes Keith Berger and Sharon Diskin (a.k.a. the 
Chameleons) offered a neatly performed, coy skit about two commuters blown 
together and then apart by a capricious storm. Nothing Shields and Yarnell 
couldn't have done in the mid-'70s -- and nothing worth remembering now. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, "Pedestals and Precipices" found modern dancers Phyllis Gomer and 
Clyde Howell (the Bridge Dance Theatre) dutifully executing a clenched, 
marriage-is-hell duet on boxes and chairs accompanied by an insidious and far 
more compelling sound score (based on newspaper personal ads) by Becky Allen. 
</P>
<P>
 Also outclassed by the accompaniment: Jean Isaacs' "Women's Songs," performed 
to records by Tori Amos and Annie Lennox. Strongly danced by the choreographer, 
the twisty, turbulent opening solo provided nothing more than a kind of 
generalized gloss on Amos, while the pileup of grotesqueries in Isaacs' duet 
with Ricardo Peralta never grew trenchant enough to savage the sentimentality 
of Lennox's hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Gilbert's very accomplished musicianship also nearly upstaged Heidi 
Duckler's solo "Mr. Westinghouse," a wry satire on domesticity danced atop, 
around and sometimes inside an old refrigerator. (Kids: Do NOT try this at 
home.) However, Judith Lieff's gymnastic skill and mastery of the mock tragic 
helped keep this latest Collage Dance Theatre vehicle full of surprises. 
</P>
<P>
 Best of the family-values repertory on Friday: Blue Palm's ecstatic and nearly 
danceless "Pour Madeleine," in which Jacqueline Planeix and Tom Crocker 
none-too-convincingly summarized the terrors of approaching parenthood -- and 
then introduced the sunny, 10-month-old Madeleine McLeod Planeix-Crocker to 
prove they were wrong, wrong, wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Two works previously -- and enthusiastically -- reviewed in these pages 
dominated the abstract or postmodern half of the program. Much more powerfully 
performed than at its premiere, Stephanie Gilliland's quintet "The Men's Piece" 
celebrated male bonding and athleticism but added a potent infusion of 
emotional sensitivity and sensuous self-awareness. 
</P>
<P>
 Danced outdoors on the plaza at intermission, Mehmet Sander's familiar ramp 
sextet, "Obtuse Space," looked freshly dangerous in its full-force body slams, 
and newly miraculous in its successful defiance of gravity. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, the program's most original piece may have been Dawn Stoppiello's 
solo "In Plane" for Troika Ranch. Wearing a transmitter that reportedly 
converted her motion into sound and lighting effects, she interacted with video 
images of herself in intriguing live-versus-tape duets. On video, you can 
eliminate movement transitions by cutting directly from one position to another 
-- and Stoppiello did just that, artfully synchronizing the edited tape with 
her smoother onstage performance of the same passages. 
</P>
<P>
 Lit from below, Lisa K. Lock writhed strikingly on a tabletop to a mixture of 
pounding rhythms and static in "Within." However, her spotlighted sculptural 
solo scarcely began to evoke "all the violence and unwritten laws of a society 
which can be limiting to an individual's growth" outlined in her program note. 
</P>
<P>
 Gestural signals and cycles of high-speed lifts unified Patricia Sandback's 
cool, athletic showpiece "Trio," arguably as backdated in style as the 
Chameleons' character mime in "Umbrellas" but carefully structured -- and 
sharply performed -- by Tonnie Haig, Tye Gillespie and David Boyd. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps because most of the dancers are used to intimate studio spaces, few of 
the pieces on Friday were projected at optimum scale in terms of energy or 
emotion. With four programs left to go in the series (two of them at the John 
Anson Ford Amphitheatre), it would be very, very helpful if all the 
participants looked on "Dance Kaleidoscope" as a great personal opportunity 
instead of some pro forma pass-fail assignment. Some artists would have killed 
for this chance. Don't make us wish they had.

LOOKING FOR SOME FLAIR IN 'FASHION' AT THE ALEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE WINER, TIMES THEATER CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is fashion an "agreement between certain persons to live without their souls?" 
Or is it "what puts ginger into the meatloaf of life?" 
</P>
<P>
 The revised 1974 musical now at the Alex Theatre raises this question. If 
you're looking for an answer, best go to Barney's. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beverly Hills Women's Dramatic Society has gathered -- in sequins, no less 
-- in a posh drawing room to rehearse a new musical based on an 1845 social 
satire by Anna Cora Mowatt. The women play all the parts, but in this 
production they make an exception for their ascotted director, who plays the 
piece's villain, Count Jolimaitre (Frank Ferrante). Why, I'm not sure. 
</P>
<P>
 Their show opens with a social victory we assume this group can relate to: a 
lady has landed a rich husband. In the first, catchy tune, the chorus at first 
whispers what will become a joyous refrain: "Charge it . . . to Mrs. Anthony 
Tiffany!"  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the parallels between Beverly Hills and the world of Mrs. Anthony 
Tiffany are too obvious to belabor, and that is why "Fashion's" book 
writer/director Anthony Stimac provides no link between them. 
</P>
<P>
 Cut to 20 years later, and the very grand Mrs. Anthony Tiffany (Mary Jo 
Catlett) still cannot pronounce conservatoire , despite a French maid (she 
nails "err," though). To her infinite delight, her sultry daughter, Seraphina, 
(Jenifer Chatfield) is being wooed by the Count (hiss!), an obvious cad and 
impostor. Of course, Mrs. Tiffany's thirst for fashion has ruined the financial 
affairs of Mr. Tiffany (Christina Saffran), who pins his hopes for Seraphina on 
an extortionist who could save his ruined estate. Add to this an innocent 
orphan (sung by the powerhouse of virtuous sopranos, Dale Kristien), a 
mysterious benefactor, several servants and a colonel, and you've got a 
houseful of cliches on which to build a musical.  
</P>
<P>
 A show within a show is usually a good idea, particularly if it's a musical 
put on by amateurs -- this mitigates any amateurishness in the acting or 
dancing. It can't help, however, a paper-thin book, which never even attempts 
to provide a runway from which the songs can take flight.  
</P>
<P>
 Charming, featherweight musicals, such as "Crazy for You," or "Me and My 
Girl," require an embrace of their frivolity and a semblance of real, human 
emotion on which to hang a pretty ballad. "Fashion's" frivolity is a clumsy, 
winking one, and the show has no emotion to spare for its stock characters. 
When a mysterious, elderly gentleman named Trueman (Henriette Valor) sings "A 
Life Without Her" for his lost grandchild, one can only think, "Who are you and 
why are you telling me this?"  
</P>
<P>
 Under Stimac's direction, the acting ranges from terrible to solid, with good 
performances by Saffran, who has a bright voice, Chatfield, funny as a spoiled 
girl who keeps her motivation to herself, and Kristien, who has that orphan 
thing down right. She's Lillian Gish with a set of pipes. Frank Ferrante is 
still playing Groucho (as he did in the shows "Groucho: A Life in Revue" and 
"Animal Crackers"), and that makes as much sense as anything else onstage here. 
</P>
<P>
 The pleasant score has lyrics by Steve Brown (we'll forgive him the line about 
the meatloaf, which may be a parody of a Jerry Herman lyric in "Mame") and 
music by Herman's longtime musical director, Don Pippin. (Perhaps 
unconsciously, Pippin fudges his bio a bit by leaving out the words as musical 
director and making it sound as if he wrote "A Chorus Line," "Oliver!," and 
several other shows.)  
</P>
<P>
 Lauren Bacall, Alexis Smith and Nancy Wilson have each worn Neil Bieff's 
clothes, but if the costumer had put them all onstage together, they would have 
clashed. He adorns this cast of nine variously sized ladies in an array of 
lengths, styles and colored sequins (why are they wearing sequins to a 
rehearsal, even in Beverly Hills?) that jangles the nerves. 
</P>
<P>
 Some might say it's better not to ask niggling questions about a show designed 
only to give a little pleasure. (Why is the French maid dancing with the guests 
during the grand-ball scene, anyway?) But the best-made pieces of fluff, those 
worth adoring and seeing again, stand up to their own logic, however slim. 
"Fashion" is a copy of the real thing.

 'Hot Zone' in Twilight Zone: The big question in Hollywood this week is 
whether Robert Redford will drop out of the $55-million virus-run-amok movie, 
"Crisis in the Hot Zone." Sources say Redford and screenwriter Paul Attanasio 
("Quiz Show") recently spent three days in Connecticut furiously rewriting and, 
at times, even cutting and pasting a revised script together. The 20th Century 
Fox project -- for which Fox is putting up $35 million and director Ridley 
Scott $20 million -- is still without a lead actress. Holly Hunter, once 
rumored to be a front-runner, backed out because there was no finished script, 
and she is now committed to New Regency's "Copycat," which starts in September 
with Sigourney Weaver. Sharon Stone's name has now surfaced for "Hot Zone." 
Meanwhile, Warner Bros. has begun filming its competing virus movie, 
"Outbreak," in Ferndale, Calif. The high-spirited race to be the first studio 
out with a virus thriller has had the rivals taking jabs at each other. Last 
week, an ad appeared in the trades announcing the beginning of filming for 
"Outbreak." It included a photograph of a screaming monkey, which led some in 
Hollywood to joke whether the monkey was really producer Arnold Kopelson or the 
film's star, Dustin Hoffman, "post-virus."

 It's Only a Movie!A medieval battle-scene shot for Mel Gibson's epic film 
"Braveheart" turned into farce when hundreds of overzealous Irish extras 
allegedly battered each other, according to a report in England's Daily Mirror. 
About 500 Irish army reservists ended up hospitalized, most with cuts and 
bruises, after reportedly taking the battle a bit too seriously and hitting 
each other with wooden swords, axes and spears. The $100-million film calls for 
the re-enactment of the 1297 Battle of Stirling in Scotland. POP/ROCK

 Back to Bethel: Bethel '94, one of the two competing concerts celebrating 
Woodstock's 25th anniversary, has announced its lineup. Of the 14 groups signed 
to perform at the concert on Aug. 13 and 14, nine played at the original 1969 
Woodstock festival. Richie Havens, Country Joe, Melanie, John Sebastian, 
Mountain, Canned Heat, Iron Butterfly, Sha Na Na and Blood, Sweat & Tears are 
the returnees. Judy Collins, Fleetwood Mac, Chambers Brothers, Tom Paxton and 
Leon Russell are also set to play on the original Woodstock site, Max Yasgur's 
farm in Bethel, N.Y. Tickets to the event go on sale today through Ticketmaster 
for $94.69, which includes parking, camping and shuttle bus transportation. The 
Woodstock '94 concert is set for the same weekend in the town of Saugerties,

COUNTERPUNCH: MEMO TO HR: SKIP THE SG, TRY THE GP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARRIE-ANNE MOSS, Carrie-Anne Moss plays Carrie Spencer on Models Inc. A 
model before becoming an actress, she has had roles on various TV series. She 
also sings, dances and recently appeared on stage in Outward Bound at the 
Hudson Theater. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I would like to suggest, respectfully, that TV columnist Howard Rosenberg is 
mixing his abbreviated metaphors'Models Inc.' Perfect for SGTV," Calendar, July 
6). 
</P>
<P>
 To account for his admittedly having been entertained by the opening 90-minute 
episode of "Models Inc.," he invents the label SG -- Super Garbage. It somehow 
excuses his having had a good time unseemly for his journalistic peerage. 
</P>
<P>
 Please, Mr. Rosenberg, don't let your guilt carry you away. Don't waste a 
perfectly good abbreviation on a popular entertainment like "Models Inc." If 
you are going to coin as powerful a designation as SG, let it at least apply to 
the very evident Super Garbage of television, the PPV (pay-per-voyeurism) 
tabloid press that corrupts both the minds of its viewers and the justice of 
the American courts with its pocketbook seduction of secrets and fabrications 
of any sell-all personality associated, however remotely, with the 
flavor-of-the-month sensation currently being exploited. 
</P>
<P>
 Wouldn't a catch-phrase as indelible and captivating as Super Garbage fit 
better on the true dumpster journalism that is fouling our channels? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If Rosenberg really wants to get to the abbreviated truth of what made him 
confess that he found "Models Inc." "endearing" or "amusing," despite his 
disapproval, how about trying GP? That's Guilty Pleasures, of course. It's a 
very flexible abbreviation because what might be a GP (Guilty Pleasure) for an 
astute Pulitzer Prize winner like Rosenberg may well be an antithetical GP 
(Guilt less Pleasure) to an untrained TV viewer. 
</P>
<P>
 Why doesn't he break down and admit that entertainment is not that shameful 
after all? If it can suspend people from their daily worries, remove them from 
the soul-searing concerns of feeding a family, divert them from that pile of 
bills, why waste a dandy label like SG? Let the SGs fall where they should. And 
admit that entertainment is one of the things the entertainment business is all 
about.

COUNTERPUNCH: IT'S HIGH TIME A CHANNEL TARGETS WOMEN OF THE '90S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN PETERS, Joan Peters hosts and produces The Joan Peters Show, a public 
access television support group for people like herself who are struggling with 
their weight. The show airs on West Valley CableVision Fridays at 9 p.m. and at 
different times on Century Cable and Beverly Hills TV. She has a Master of Fine 
Arts degree from UCLA in Motion Picture/Television Screenwriting.

<TEXT>
<P>
 If men invented television, it was the women who were at home watching it -- 
certainly during the daytime hours in the '50s when the majority of mothers 
were supposedly baking cakes and taking care of the kiddies. It was not until 
the '80s (thanks to Phil Donahue, Oprah Winfrey, Sally Jessy Raphael and a slew 
of other talk show personae), that we discovered that dear old mom was, excuse 
the catchall phrase, "dysfunctional." The poor woman was either drinking 
herself into a tizzy, having a nervous breakdown or cheating on that knight in 
shining armor that she married, the workaholic dad. 
</P>
<P>
 You remember that out-of- touch man who left the house in the A.M. to return 
late in the P.M. having as little interaction with his children as possible. 
The "emotionally distant dad" is the way psychologists explain him on talk 
shows, or the "absent father" -- the guy who went out to buy a pack of 
cigarettes and returned 20 years later when the kids were grown -- or if dad 
was close, then he was too close. He molested his children and threatened to 
kill the family dog if anyone snitched. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, thanks to talk shows we all now know that there was no escaping the 
"truth" -- we all grew up in dysfunctional families. But the people who knew it 
first were women. Why? Because before women were into equality and working 
outside the home, they had seemingly fewer places to go outside of the grocery 
store, the park with the kids or the mall. Many women turned to television for 
their daily dose of entertainment and escape. Women didn't hear it through the 
grapevine; they saw it on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 So what could be more appropriate for the '90s than a women's channel? 
Lifetime cable-TV network came up with this gem -- a women's targeted audience. 
("All Things to All Women?" Calendar, June 4). 
</P>
<P>
 If I am at all indicative of women audiences, I'm going to have my television 
or VCR tuned into Lifetime. Women have always been the mainstream of television 
viewers. They are hungry for a network of their own, targeted at their own 
interest. Lifetime is smart to offer a smorgasbord of women-targeted programs. 
When this TV network starts churning out hits, and it eventually will, it's 
going to set the whole television industry spinning on its heels. Want to bet 
the networks and syndicates will all be scrambling to rethink their 
programming? 
</P>
<P>
 My only question is what has taken the powers that be in television so long to 
figure out a women's-targeted channel? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As a woman, I am part of that "51% of the country" that Lifetime programming 
Vice President Peggy Allen was referring to when she said: "You can't do one 
kind of programming for them. We have to reflect the diversity of women's 
interests." 
</P>
<P>
 That diversity is precisely what ultimately is going to set Lifetime apart 
from its competition and put it on the cutting edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Conventional talk shows normally cover a garden variety of subjects throughout 
the week. Lifetime is redefining the talk-show format by breaking with 
tradition and zeroing in on talk shows that focus on specific themes. Normally 
these very types of programs are rejected, mistakenly perceived as having too 
limited an audience appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Lifetime should be applauded for catering to more diverse women's programming, 
for their innovation and risk taking -- but most of all, Lifetime should be 
commended for its mature understanding that, although a program may indeed hold 
a more limited audience appeal, there still may be a real need in the lives of 
their viewing audience for just such a show.

WEEKEND REVIEWS; THEATER; PADUA FESTIVAL: A LOVELY MADNESS OF UNUSUAL PLAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE WINER, TIMES THEATER CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Padua Hills Playwrights Festival leads theatergoers on an elaborate, adult 
treasure-hunt through the grounds of Woodbury University, where the festival 
has resurfaced after a two-year absence. Whether its stage is a road, a hill or 
a pavement behind a building, each of the four eccentric short plays in the A 
Series feels like found art, and their eccentricities sometimes deepen into 
mystery when an actor appears from behind a shrub or when the wind participates 
in an actress's hair. 
</P>
<P>
 Playwrights direct their own work at Padua, which, when it works, is an 
intense experience, like hearing Stephen Sondheim sing "Anyone Can Whistle" or 
T.S. Eliot read "The Waste Land." It works here. 
</P>
<P>
 As its title suggests, "Terra Incognita" by Maria Irene Fornes uses its site 
in strange and inventive ways. In Spain, three American tourists pause to 
exchange curious opinions and argue about the nature of perception, the meaning 
of Edward Albee's "The Zoo Story" and the Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 They sit across a narrow road from the audience at the bottom of a little 
hill. Sometimes they drive by in a car, on a road at the top of the hill. Also 
on that hill sits a man on a bench (hello, Albee!) who is obsessed by what the 
Spaniards did to the Indians, which eerily echoes the news from Rwanda. Also, a 
foul-smelling lunatic wanders in, bursting with information about the way 
different civilizations have conceived the shape of the world. These are 
strange happenings in a strange place, reminiscent of a Paul Bowles novel, but 
warmer, and with more connection between the characters.  
</P>
<P>
 Then again, if you've ever wanted to see three insane women in wedding dresses 
and tennis shoes stand on a faraway hill screaming, "Francoise!," then don't 
miss John O'Keefe's "Disgrace." O'Keefe depicts a bizarre picnic, undertaken by 
three women who have all slept with, and probably killed, the aforementioned 
Francoise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Disgrace" is actually the playwright's expression of awe and fear in the face 
of Woman, whether statuesque and passionate (Denise Poirier), short and comic 
(Susan Van Allen) or so sex-crazed and whacked-out that her Linda Blair 
imitation goes almost unnoticed (Dahlia Wilde). O'Keefe paints traditional 
female foibles in primary colors, such as when Poirier screams, "You screwed my 
lover!" and then sinks to her knees, wailing, "I'm gonna get in trouble 'cause 
I got mad!" Although it could be called "Thelma, Thelma and Louise," "Disgrace" 
is a complete original. 
</P>
<P>
 The first show in the A Series, Neena Beber's "Failure to Thrive," dissects a 
remarkably bad but not loveless marriage by two people who seem to have removed 
themselves from society. 
</P>
<P>
 He's obsessed with the behavior of the roseate spoonbill -- did you know that 
they separate from the flock only when sick? She thinks that Disney World is 
"whole, foreign countries," while he sees it as a place "about the failure of 
imagination." He speaks into a microphone at a podium; she hardly ever looks at 
him but does take the mike to give a lecture on his shortcomings -- failure to 
provide shampoo is particularly held against him. Their adopted daughter simply 
wants to go to New Zealand, and who can blame her? While you wouldn't want to 
be inside this household, Beber has made it fun to observe. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, John Steppling's "Understanding the Dead" is a story about some lost 
souls living in a remote corner of India, in a dirty, smelly town that for some 
reason a hotel chain called the Conroy Group has decided to open to tourism. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Americans who have fled into obscurity there take jobs as a maitre d' and 
an exotic dancer. As a dancer with severe stomach cramps, Priscilla Harris 
performs a little masterwork. Also, the playwright, John O'Keefe, is funny as 
the smarmy developer of tourism.  
</P>
<P>
 Other standouts: Kimberly Flynn is a delicate philosopher in "Terra 
Incognita," Jessica Hecht has a hilarious way of pausing as if to say something 
earth-shattering and then . . . nothing, in "Failure to Thrive," and the aptly 
named Dahlia Wilde is a first-class nut in "Disgrace."  
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in the chill several minutes after midnight, watching the fourth play 
of the evening, a theatergoer may feel the improbability of these strange plays 
and their stranger locations. That improbability -- and the unpredictability of 
the works on display -- is the Padua experience. This festival is not meant to 
be an actor's audition for Hollywood casting directors, although that may 
happen. Padua is about the art of writing short plays. The thought that this 
almost totally noncommercial form holds on with so much heart is warming as the 
chill sets in, and we watch Steppling's band of assorted runaway lunatics and 
lost souls in India. For the assorted runaway lunatics and lost souls in the 
audience, it's a lovely madness.

WEEKEND REVIEWS; POP; YOAKAM LETS TUNES TALK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dwight Yoakam shakes and swings a bit behind his guitar, but he's no dancer, 
shouter, acrobat or macho man. His country contemporaries in Nashville can have 
all that.At the Glen Helen Blockbuster Pavilion on Saturday, Yoakam was 
confident enough to let his music and his forlorn whine stand alone. 
</P>
<P>
 That music is rooted in the rawest of country traditions (Bakersfield's Buck 
Owens, Merle Haggard, et al.), but it's aggressively contemporary without 
pandering to fleeting pop trends. It attracted a broad mix of fans: urban 
cowboys waltzing their dates up and down the aisles, graying C&W veterans, 
drunken frat boys and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Yoakam remained a down-to-earth presence (even in ridiculously tight leather 
pants), singing tales of heartache and loss with a jolt of musical 
experimentation. His vaguely psychedelic ballad "A Thousand Miles From Nowhere" 
recalled Roy Orbison's more contemplative side, and his early days on the L.A. 
club scene emerged in "Long White Cadillac," the Blasters' ode to Hank 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 If Yoakam's measured delivery provided the night's emotional foundation, the 
adrenaline came from his longtime guitarist (and record producer) Pete 
Anderson's country-rock flourishes, reverb and other atmospherics. They stood 
as near-equal partners on stage, a collaboration that's gone from 
traditionalism to pushing country music's boundaries without abandoning its 
soul.STEVE APPLEFORD

COUNTERPUNCH: HAVE WE PUSHED MOVIE REALISM TOO FAR? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERALD SCHILLER, Gerald Schiller has written feature film scripts and 
written and directed documentaries, educational films and promotional videos. 
He lives in Newbury Park, where he is working on his second mystery novel. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kenneth Turan's recent comment on the reissue of "Easy Rider" and "Dr. 
Strangelove" justly praises these two films as quintessential representatives 
of the 1960s ("How We've Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Reissue," 
Calendar, June 10). Though each film, in its own way, takes a rather stylized 
view of its subject matter (one the omnipresent fear of the bomb, the other a 
view of an independent subculture), there remains in each a basic realism that 
effectively touched audiences of the time -- and still does today. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, these reissues also serve to remind us of how different movies 
used to be. Watch a Los Angeles Times promo film shown in movie theaters that 
demonstrates the work of the film industry's Foley Artists. In the brief clip 
we watch them add sound effects to films -- not trying to duplicate what 
something really sounds like, but using a variety of materials and devices to 
heighten the effect -- to go beyond mere realism. 
</P>
<P>
 This little segment seems to illustrate exactly what our films have become. In 
the almost 50 years that I've been an avid moviegoer, I've seen an evolution of 
films from the romantic, stylized views of reality depicted in the '40s and 
'50s, through the brief flirting with realism that came in the '60s and '70s, 
and now to what I call the hyper-realism of the '80s and '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 Think back to the action films of the past and the bloodless deaths in the 
Westerns and war films made in the '40s and '50s. Even so-called "message" 
pictures ("The Big Carnival," "The Snake Pit," "Gentleman's Agreement") pulled 
their punches, followed the strictures of the Production Code and, generally, 
punished the bad and rewarded the just. 
</P>
<P>
 The advent of the realistic pictures of the '60s broke down the barriers of 
the restrictive code that had held the film world in check for so many years. 
This was the decade of "The Wild Bunch" and "Midnight Cowboy" -- as well as 
"Dr. Strangelove" and "Easy Rider." Then we saw the blood, were introduced to 
the anti-hero, the prostitute and witnessed the violence. But apparently it 
wasn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Film ratings came into being but even the ratings changed with the times. 
Twenty years ago the "F" word meant an automatic "R." Not today. So did nudity 
and so did excessive violence. No more. 
</P>
<P>
 But now we've gone far beyond realism. Special effects experts, skillful sound 
designers and the magic of computer technology all work toward pushing the 
bounds of realism. Every car that crashes has to explode (real cars rarely 
explode), movie gunshots resonate far beyond the real sound of a bullet, 
explosions dramatically roar with smoke and fire that far exceeds the real 
thing, and blood spurts from wounds with the projectile force of Old Faithful. 
</P>
<P>
 Have our films now created a hyper-realism that mere reality can no longer 
compete with? Is reality too tame for the youth of today? Audiences have always 
responded to what they saw on the screen. When Gable took off his shirt in "It 
Happened One Night" and revealed no undershirt, sales of underwear dropped. 
When Superman leaped from a window, several children -- disastrously -- tried 
to emulate this feat. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this new hyper-realism making our young people drive faster, aspire to 
greater thrills, push the bounds of excitement, even (perhaps) desire to get 
their hands on an automatic weapon? What will be the next step in film 
evolution? And -- perhaps more important -- how will this next step affect 
future generations?

MUSIC REVIEWS; BRIGHT GERSHWIN AT BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bright colors filled eyes and ears at the "Grand Gershwin" program presented 
by the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra and soloists three times over the weekend at 
the outdoor amphitheatre. At the Friday opening, conductor John Mauceri acted 
as emcee, chief musical juggler and mediator of quickish tempos.  
</P>
<P>
 Aurally, the glare came from the primary colors in Robert Russell Bennett's 
song-filled suite, "Gershwin in Hollywood," the evening's overture, and from 
pianist John Bayless' re-thought and high-energy reading of "Rhapsody in Blue." 
</P>
<P>
 Visually, the brightness in the second half -- devoted to excerpts from "Porgy 
and Bess" -- concentrated in summery formals worn by sopranos Patricia 
Baskerville and Wilhelmenia Fernandez -- the former in hot-pink, the latter in 
a floral print topped by a sherbet-green jacket. The male vocalists, Gregg 
Baker and Curtis Rayam, like the members of the Bowl Orchestra and the 
assisting William Grant Still Chorale, sported black formal wear. 
</P>
<P>
 No sense of ritual or habit marred these proceedings, despite the familiarity 
of the repertory. Mauceri seemed to be taking fresh stock of this music 
(including a rare ballet sequence from the 1937 film, "Shall We Dance"); he 
coaxed fluent performances from all forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Though his appearance -- with strawberry-red hair and with real jewels 
attached to his ear and clothing -- threatened to overpower his music-making, 
pianist Bayless nonetheless brought to the Rhapsody genuine stylishness, nearly 
infallible pianistic dexterity and a strong personality. This was no dutiful 
run-through of a well-known piece; this was a quirkily phrased, musically 
renewed consideration of its materials.  
</P>
<P>
 Singing "Summertime" and "My Man's Gone Now," Baskerville's impassioned 
performances and vocal heft overshadowed the more brief, less distinctive 
contributions by the vocally assured Fernandez (as Bess). Baker brought to 
Porgy's utterances a virile authority, strong top notes and admirable vocal 
coloration. Rayam's crisp enunciation and projected sense of character proved 
irresistible.

MUSIC REVIEWS; EARLY ROSSINI AT THE FORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES * "The Silken Ladder" will be repeated Wednesday and Saturday 
at 8 p.m. at the John Anson Ford Amphitheatre, 2580 Cahuenga Blvd. $20 and $25. 
Information: (213) 466-1767. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rossini wrote "La Scala de Seta" ("The Silken Ladder"), a sparkling farce, 
when he was 20. It was the third of five comic works he composed for Antonio 
Cera and the San Moise theater in Venice.Audiences considered the music 
inferior to "L'Inganno Felice," its immediate predecessor, however, and the 
opera virtually disappeared from the repertory, although the overture survived 
as an effervescent concert piece. 
</P>
<P>
 The ensembles turned out to be the only sparkling moments in the Los Angeles 
Music Theatre Company production sung in English on Saturday at the John Anson 
Ford Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the reason lay in David Anglin's surprisingly slow-paced conducting of 
the underpowered orchestra. Anglin treated the arias as if they could bear 
weighty expression. They could not. He generally let pacing falter, although he 
picked up tempos in the ensembles. He also provided accompaniment for the 
recitatives on an almost soundless fortepiano. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet few of the principals rose to the bel-canto challenges, either. Jessica 
Siena brought a thin, sweet, sometimes wiry soprano to the central role of 
Giulia. As her husband incognito, Dorvil, Beau Palmer provided a slender and 
variable tenor. The secondary lovers, Lucilla and Blansac, were sung capably by 
Teresa Brown and Michael Daniels. Roberto Perlas Gomez made a vocally smooth 
and bland servant Germano. 
</P>
<P>
 Geoffrey Dunn was credited for the English translation, which was clear, if 
clumsy and cute in its rhyme patterns. Lin White directed traffic with 
spiritless efficiency. Ed Brown created the functional set design.CHRIS PASLES

JEFF HAMILTON'S TRIO: THE BEAT DRUMS ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Why do drummers want to become bandleaders? 
</P>
<P>
 The appearance of Jeff Hamilton's Trio at the Jazz Bakery on Friday offered 
another reminder of a question for which no satisfactory answer has yet been 
found. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the three main elements in jazz performance -- melody, harmony and rhythm 
-- the drummer must defer to another player to furnish the first two. True, 
many drummers have led their own groups with great success, but often with 
essential help from their sidemen. 
</P>
<P>
 The case of Hamilton is puzzling. Here is a superb artist who, in partnership 
with the bassist John Clayton, has led one of the Southland's best big bands. 
As an orchestral drummer, he maintained a supple beat under the band; as leader 
of a trio at the Bakery, he too often played over the group, occasionally 
leaving the admirable pianist Larry Fuller semi-audible. Jesse Yusef Murphy was 
more fortunate; during one or two of his splendid bass solos, Hamilton switched 
from sticks to brushes or laid out altogether.  
</P>
<P>
 Playing tunes from their CD "Hamilton Time," the threesome achieved some 
moments of quiet, chordal beauty, as in Murphy's gently persuasive "Blues for 
You." Hamilton's high points were his flamboyant solos and a breakneck 
treatment of the old Woody Herman hit "Apple Honey." 
</P>
<P>
 Pianist Fuller took the chief honors in an elegant version of Leonard 
Bernstein's "Somewhere." With all due respect to Hamilton, this group would 
have worked better as the Larry Fuller Trio.  
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton has earned a well-deserved reputation in settings that have not 
called for his services as a major-domo. One can only hope that he has not 
permanently given up that subservient but significant role.LEONARD FEATHER

KINA FINDS THE RIGHT BLEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SNOWDEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Okinawan singer Shoukichi Kina was impressive in his L.A. debut at downtown's 
California Plaza on Friday night, moving a crowd largely unfamiliar with his 
music from curious appreciation to an enthusiastic embrace by the end of his 
90-minute set. 
</P>
<P>
 Kina, whose pioneering sound blends traditional folk material with Western 
elements and electric instruments, stressed the traditional side early.He 
played his amplified sanshin (a three-stringed, banjo-like instrument) against 
the high harmonies of three female backing singers that at first sounded too 
giddy for Western ears to take seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 The set gathered momentum behind the expert delivery and superb dynamics of 
Kina's seven-piece band Champloose -- the name translates as "all mixed 
together," and two songs featuring guest Ry Cooder's bottleneck guitar were 
just that. The first sounded like a double-time, bluegrass take on a spaghetti 
Western theme, while Cooder's sweet solo gave a ballad the flavor of that 
purest of folk styles, Okinawan cantina music. 
</P>
<P>
 Kina's engagingly crazed charisma took over during a closing string of 
up-tempo, bouncy pop tunes. Three people turned the wading pool in front of the 
stage into an impromptu splash pit, and Kina dedicated the first encore to a 
couple celebrating its 50th wedding anniversary, who danced at center stage as 
audience members skipped exuberantly among the musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe giddy isn't such a bad word after all. DON SNOWDEN

 BOOM: No wonder there are no more orange groves in the San Fernando Valley. 
Since 1960, the population of the Valley has more than doubled, going from 
700,000 to 1.6 million in 1990, the year of the last federal census. Will the 
tough Southern California recession mean the trend will reverse? We'll have to 
wait for the year 2000 and the next official census to find out for sure. 
</P>
<P>
 FOREVER FOR SALE: Has a for-sale sign been in front of your house so long that 
you've begun to consider it a lawn ornament? You are not alone. (B1) . . . The 
recession might be on the wane in the rest of the country, but it is still hard 
to sell a house in the San Fernando Valley. Just ask Darrel and Carol Swendener 
of Northridge . They've been trying for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 NORTH COUNTY MINIBOOM: The Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys were hit hard by 
the local recession, especially in their once-booming housing markets. But 
these areas seem poised to bounce back quicker than the San Fernando Valley. 
(B1) . . . Aerospace jobs have been gained, not lost, up here and tax revenues 
are being generated by bustling shopping areas. 
</P>
<P>
 CALTRANS ANONYMOUS: Everyone knows about the occasional delays due to 
construction on parts of the freeways that were badly damaged by the January 
earthquake. But what about all those other freeway areas where Caltrans seems 
to have had an almost ongoing presence in the last few months? (B1) . . . Odds 
are, these unheralded workers are smoothing out the many portions of the 
freeways not critically damaged but badly roughed up by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 BUNGEE MADNESS: You might be grief-stricken to hear that if you didn't bungee 
jump over the weekend at the San Fernando Valley Fair, it was your last chance 
to do so at this year's fair. (B16) . . . The four-day fair, attended by about 
51,000 people, came to an end Sunday. Population Boom

SHELTERS FOR DISADVANTAGED AROUSE FIERCE OPPOSITION; CONFLICT: CLASS PREJUDICE, 
FEAR FUEL PROTESTS, ADVOCATES CONTEND. HOMEOWNERS SAY SECURITY CONCERNS ARE 
VALID. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After seven long years of battle that left hard feelings on both sides, the 
Episcopal Services Alliance finally won the go-ahead in 1992 to open Orange 
County's first shelter for mentally ill homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
 Beacon House, a remodeled three-bedroom home, is set to open in Orange in 
mid-August, but some homeless advocates say there's little cause for 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the restrictions placed on the project by the county, "all you're 
talking about after seven years is 12 beds," said Tim Shaw, executive director 
of the Orange County Homeless Issues Task Force. "It's sad." 
</P>
<P>
 Community opposition to the idea was fierce. What if a child were molested by 
one of "these people," cried angry residents of the middle-class Orange 
neighborhood where the home was proposed. What about the homeless shelter 
nearby, where derelicts accosted the bereaved on their way to the funeral home? 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, social service groups say, Beacon House's bittersweet victory 
was an isolated success. Just about any time nonprofit agencies try to open a 
shelter for battered women, homeless people or abused children they continue to 
encounter a firestorm of neighborhood opposition, the unabated Not in My Back 
Yard (NIMBY) syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the renewed public awareness of domestic violence sparked by the 
O.J. Simpson case, social services officials lament that the NIMBY phenomenon 
is as strong as ever -- fueled by class prejudice and fears about declining 
property values. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the unknown that's fearful to everybody," said Carol Williams, executive 
director of Interval House Crisis Shelters, which succeeded in opening a home 
for battered women in Seal Beach 15 years ago. "If the group that's coming in 
can tell people what the shelter is and what it will really be like, the fear 
will go away." 
</P>
<P>
 But homeowners who don't like the idea of having a shelter next door say it is 
unfair to portray them as selfish and elitist. They insist they do care about 
what happens to the less fortunate -- one of the very reasons, they say, they 
want them to set up shop in other neighborhoods where they can blend in. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent battleground is the Eli Home, a shelter for abused children 
and their mothers in Orange that won President Bush's 338th Point of Light 
award and, just three months ago, a commendation from President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Eli Home officials want to expand and move into an affluent Anaheim Hills 
neighborhood. But their future neighbors aren't rolling out the welcome mat. 
Some have gone so far as to say that those presidential citations aren't worth 
the paper they're written on. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say they were President Bush's 338th Point of Light. So what? They say 
they got a commendation from Bill Clinton. So what?" says Gene Secrest, a 
46-year-old developer and father of two who lives next door to the proposed new 
Eli Home. "Whenever we ask them questions -- like what kinds of security there 
will be at the facility -- we get vague answers." 
</P>
<P>
 For Scott Mather, development director for the St. Vincent de Paul Society, 
arguments against the Eli Home ring hopelessly familiar. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Vincent's plans for a 28-bed home for welfare mothers in La Habra became 
mired in neighborhood opposition for more than five years beginning in 1988. 
The shelter was named Mary's Home after wealthy benefactor Mary Kretschmar, who 
bequeathed the society $250,000, stipulating only that it be used "to help 
somebody." 
</P>
<P>
 During the battle, Mather said, the society had to spend $50,000 on a traffic 
study alone, to prove to city officials that the home would not cause undue 
congestion. Now, officials hope to begin construction late next month) and to 
open the shelter by spring. 
</P>
<P>
 In retrospect, Mather says, St. Vincent de Paul officials should have done 
more to allay their future neighbors' fears and smooth the way for the approval 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 "We kind of forced our way through and just kept coming politically and 
pushing," Mather says. "But you need to spend time in the neighborhood trying 
to talk to people. If you can get the residents on board, it's a lot easier to 
get things done." 
</P>
<P>
 Social services officials say that approach paid off for Regina House -- 
hailed by some as a Cinderella NIMBY story. The multi-service shelter program 
in Santa Ana for homeless women and their children, which opened in April, is 
designed to help the women get back on their feet by teaching them job skills. 
It also offers them and their children counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 "They took a different tack," Shaw said of the Homeless Issues Task Force. 
"They went to the neighborhood association first and listened to their concerns 
about gangs and graffiti. They told them they didn't want gangs and graffiti 
either if they were going to be bringing single moms into the neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 That approach eventually won Regina House the endorsement of the city's 
Planning Commission and the City Council as well as the local neighborhood 
association. The shelter was not an easy sell, said former French Court Assn. 
President Jim Kendrick, but in the end, neighbors realized that there were far 
worse alternatives than the shelter -- such as another overcrowded house. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighbors "decided that we'd rather have something with controls, and with 
those controls we got a really good project," Kendrick said. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike the Eli Home, Regina House is situated in a working-class 
neighborhood, not an affluent one. Social services officials note sadly that 
this factor, more than any other, might have been responsible for the shelter's 
eventual acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Interval House Crisis Shelters tried to open a home for battered 
women 15 years ago in Seal Beach, 400 residents of the well-to-do community 
signed a petition against it. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, Williams, Interval House's executive director, said officials 
decided to start small and win the neighborhood's trust. They avoided the 
city's permit process by opening a shelter for just six people: That enabled 
their neighbors to get comfortable with the idea of a small facility, which was 
later expanded. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eventually, people learned that there were fewer problems at the shelter 
house than at the house down the street where the parents would leave town and 
the kids would throw parties," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Over time, neighborhood residents began volunteering to baby-sit for children 
from the shelter or to bring over meals at Thanksgiving, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors of the proposed Eli Home, which would be located in a well-to-do 
section of Anaheim Hills, have a litany of grievances: The building is too 
small, there would be too much traffic, the home would be too noisy, it 
wouldn't be fair to waive parking requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 They also say the home could attract estranged husbands, endangering other 
residents. Privately, some admit they don't want their children socializing 
with kids from the shelter -- children who have been physically abused and may 
have a host of emotional problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the shelter prohibits its women and children from fraternizing 
with neighbors, many fear those in-house rules are unrealistic and likely to be 
broken. 
</P>
<P>
 Executive Director Lorri Galloway of the Eli Home believes those arguments are 
merely a smoke screen concealing deep-seated prejudices against poor people. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like, 'This does not belong in our sweet little rural atmosphere,' " 
Galloway said. "They feel it's someone else's problem and someone else needs to 
handle it." 
</P>
<P>
 But Bob Averill, who lives down the street, says that's simply not true. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're concerned about the risks to the residents living in the shelter," said 
the 59-year-old retired engineer. "The top priority is for it to be a safe 
house, but that house is a blight on the neighborhood, and it sticks out from 
all the others on the block." 
</P>
<P>
 Robin, a 37-year-old woman who once sought emergency shelter at the Eli Home 
in Orange with her three young children, says neighbors' fears are unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lived there for a month, and I never felt unsafe," said Robin, who asked to 
be identified only by her first name. "It was such a big help. After going 
through such a traumatic experience, we were given a room and treated just like 
family." 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission has already approved the shelter in a 6-0 vote. The 
two sides will square off again when the City Council meets Aug. 2 to consider 
the Eli Home's plan to renovate the building.

CALIFORNIANS VIEWED ASKANCE IN PRESCOTT; MIGRATION: HUBER CASE REKINDLES 
NO-GROWTH SENTIMENT. SOME FEAR GOLDEN STATE 'SUBURB.' 
</P>

<P>
 Hotel desk clerk Katie Wintrol sees them nearly every day. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving vans, station wagons and pickups -- all overloaded with furniture, 
housewares, parents and kids -- pull into the Best Western for a night or two 
of lodging before the families put down roots in this picturesque mountain 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 The only problem Wintrol sees is that most of these vehicles parked in her lot 
are coming from the same place: California. 
</P>
<P>
 "People here just hate Californians," she said. "People are worried." 
</P>
<P>
 The sentiment, similar to the aversions shared in Seattle and Portland toward 
Golden Staters, has been part of this town's undercurrent for years. But 
nothing in recent months has done more to rekindle that feeling than the 
discovery of Denise Huber's frozen body in the back of a stolen rental truck 
parked in the driveway of a former Californian. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's your murder and you should take it back," bartender Alan Buller barked 
recently to a California visitor to Prescott's famed Whiskey Row. "That guy 
just hauled her over here from California. We have our own troubles here, but 
killing people and putting them in a freezer is something else." 
</P>
<P>
 One local judge recalled sharing the road with one of Prescott's newcomers 
while returning home from a recent trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like something right out of the Beverly Hillbillies," he said of the 
ramshackle vehicle. "There were clothes hanging out the back. I remember 
thinking, 'Please don't make the turn at Prescott. Please don't make the turn 
at Prescott.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Sure enough. It turned. 
</P>
<P>
 In a touch of irony, you can get the opposite view from Prescott's mayor, a 
part-time Hollywood actor who dismisses these rumblings as "a load of crap from 
selfish people." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Daiton Rutkowski, who belts out Jimmy Buffett tunes while mixing 
milkshakes at his De Ja Vu soda fountain, said the whining is coming from 
no-growth advocates who have seized on the sensational murder to sound the 
alarm against further migration, especially from California. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole thing has been overblown," the sandy-haired Rutkowski said. "This 
could have happened anywhere. Hell, (Prescott) had a city councilman stand up 
during a public meeting and shoot himself dead. You can't blame that on 
California." 
</P>
<P>
 Rutkowski said Californians are only one category of new arrivals, drawn from 
all parts of big city America -- Miami, Detroit, New York and Washington, D.C. 
-- looking for a utopia in the Old West. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know (neighboring) Prescott Valley used to be called Jackass Flats in the 
old days," the mayor said. "Now all the jackasses down there are from Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, we are getting a lot of people in from California, but these are 
wonderfully talented, upper-class people," he said. "They fit right in here." 
</P>
<P>
 The popular Rutkowski may be the only mayor in 25 years to win reelection 
here, but not all his constituents share his views on Prescott's California 
connection. 
</P>
<P>
 From his courthouse office, Yavapai County Atty. Charles R. Hastings has 
noticed a change that disturbs him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you what," Hastings said, "we're just experiencing a tremendous 
increase in all kinds of crimes, and there are a lot of people moving here from 
California." 
</P>
<P>
 While Hastings won't come right out and say it, Wintrol and others are 
downright blunt in their assessments of how the influx of Californians is 
changing a laid-back lifestyle in the clean air and bright sun around the 
Prescott National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 To locals, many of whom are transplanted Californians themselves, the Golden 
State has become synonymous with rioting, bad cops, skyrocketing real estate, 
gridlock and crime -- especially crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the most popular bumper stickers in town carry a stinging message for 
people arriving from the West Coast: "Prescott used to be a nice place to live 
-- until it became a suburb of California" and "Welcome to Prescott, Calif." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the state's flagship newspaper leaves no question about how Arizonans 
regard their neighbors to the west. Reporting the discovery of Denise Huber's 
body and the arrest of John J. Famalaro, the Arizona Republic carried the 
headlines: "Area gets California's ugliness, too" and "California's ugly side 
robs area's innocence." 
</P>
<P>
 At Sunday church services, visitors from California found themselves at the 
center of a priest's good-natured ribbing, when he invited guests to identify 
their hometowns. "Oakland?" the priest exclaimed when one of several 
Californians called out. "Special blessings!" The congregation laughed. 
</P>
<P>
 On KQNA radio in Prescott Valley, the murder has been getting good play. But 
nobody seems to be happy to host such a grisly event, let alone put up with 
pushy California reporters who have arrived to cover the story. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to characterize his out-of-town competitors, Prescott Daily Courier 
reporter Kevin Sheh told Knox: "I find them to be overbearing. I find them to 
be more aggressive than the local media here." 
</P>
<P>
 Late last week, talk show host Jeff Knox drew comparisons between the Famalaro 
arrest and the flood of media coverage following the arrest of O.J. Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors near the Famalaro home in the Prescott Country Club have complained 
that a television satellite truck has been lighting up their street to do 
reports for the late-evening telecast, disrupting their sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 The whomping sounds of news helicopters have also drowned out their 
front-porch conversations. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Prescott, aggressive behavior is just not appreciated. 
</P>
<P>
 Just ask Bob Kantak, who arrived from Detroit in the late 1970s -- more than 
enough time to be considered acceptable by local standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Kantak generally welcomes outsiders, but becomes quickly disappointed with 
folks who move here and want to remake the place. He hates remarks like, "This 
isn't the way we used to do it back in California." 
</P>
<P>
 "Good ideas are always welcome, but give us a break," said Kantak, who lives 
just outside of town. In his rural area, new arrivals are now talking about 
street lights. 
</P>
<P>
 "Give a small-town atmosphere a chance. Don't try to push (things) down our 
throats," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In brief encounters with some locals -- particularly the no-growthers -- it is 
clear that many wouldn't mind seeing some of the major roads into town blocked 
completely. 
</P>
<P>
 Commenting on a recent Money magazine article that named Prescott as the 
country's No. 1 place to retire, one resident said only half-jokingly, "That 
was one of the worst things ever to happen to Prescott." 
</P>
<P>
 But while no-growthers dislike even migrant retirees and professionals from 
the Golden State, others see worse menace. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking precautions against the negative byproducts of increased population, 
Prescott Peace Justice Robert W. Kuebler Jr. created a fledgling 
gang-suppression task force after a recent trip to California. 
</P>
<P>
 There are only 95 known gang members in the Prescott area, according to 
Sheriff's Department records, and no evidence of a single drive-by shooting 
ever, but authorities feel assured that many local gangsters have ties to 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see it a lot with people (who come to court)," Kuebler said. "I look at 
their backgrounds and see they're from California or from somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Yavapai County Administrator Jim Holst: "Don't get us wrong. We're not 
against growth and people who want to come here and join our community. But we 
just can't let this turn into another Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 But Mayor Rutkowski said those comparisons just can't be supported, yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can tell you honestly that I don't feel much of a difference in walking the 
streets here when there were 6,000 people back in the 1940s than I do today 
with 30,000," the Prescott native said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people don't change, they become boors. It's the same thing with cities 
and towns. If people want some peace and quiet, they can go down the road." 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor admits some worry about a 1,000-unit housing development planned 
down the road, but he is also confident that the city has made sufficient plans 
to accommodate that growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel a real spirit of excitement in the community," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, he said, Prescott has been able to retain the small-town 
feel that has brought people like U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day 
O'Connor to a holiday retreat nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a place where people like Rutkowski, after having a bit too much to 
drink (before he was mayor, of course) can get away with a practical joke. He 
once dropped a dead, flea-bitten beaver on the front counter at police 
headquarters. And never spent a night in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just goes to show you that this town will accept people with independent 
values," he joked. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor said too much attention has been placed on the negative associations 
with California brought on by the recent discovery of Denise Huber's body. 
</P>
<P>
 "An idiot goes nuts, OK. It happens. The guy could just as easily been from 
Missouri. They have weird people there, too, you know. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is still the greatest place on Earth," Rutkowski said, rapping his 
knuckle on the wooden bar at the De Ja Vu. "Right here."

CONGREGATION PRAYS FOR HUBER FAMILY AND JUSTICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The programs handed to members of the Aliso Creek Presbyterian Church each 
Sunday for the past three years asked parishioners to pray for information on 
Denise Huber's whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have that in our bulletin today," Pastor Jack Hafer told the 
congregation Sunday. That prayer has finally been answered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many questions are still unanswered," he said, "but at least this one is." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sunday service was a smaller, more intimate affair than Saturday's public 
memorial ceremony, in which Huber was eulogized before a large gathering of 
friends, family and hundreds of others acquainted with the tragic circumstances 
of her death. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, some among the 200 parishioners wept, and others bowed their heads 
deeply in prayer as the church's pastors referred to Denise Huber in their 
sermons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a tightknit group," said Walt Shepard, another church pastor. "We have 
been through a tremendous week." 
</P>
<P>
 Denise Huber's parents, Ione and Dennis, managed smiles and greeted their 
friends with warm handshakes. They expressed gratitude for the support they 
have received, but the pain and strain of the week's events was evident. 
</P>
<P>
 Several times during the service, Dennis Huber rubbed his eyes and fought back 
tears. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been tough," he said softly. 
</P>
<P>
 And it may not be any easier in the months to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement authorities Sunday continued to investigate Denise Huber's 
death and pursue their case against murder suspect John J. Famalaro. Yavapai 
County Sheriff's Lt. Scott Mascher said authorities expected to know late 
Sunday if blood evidence recovered from a Laguna Hills storage facility matched 
Denise Huber's blood type. He also said a decision on whether to try Famalaro 
in Orange County or Arizona will probably be made this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some incredible things the family still has to go through," said 
Shepard, as he addressed the church members. "The trial is not going to be fun. 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Huber said he realizes that the trial will be difficult to watch, but 
he was relieved to finally know what happened to his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is better to have an answer, even though tough days are ahead," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shepard, who will officiate at funeral services for Denise Huber in South 
Dakota next week, told the congregation to "pray for the family" and to "please 
pray for justice." 
</P>
<P>
 He also told the flock that "closure" in the case did not come when Denise 
Huber's body was found handcuffed in a freezer, stored in a stolen moving truck 
in Dewey, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
 "Closure is not in a freezer. . . It's not in a Ryder truck," he said. 
"Closure is with Jesus." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the ordeal, church members have offered their support to the 
Hubers. Many attended Saturday's memorial service, and some prepared food to be 
served afterward. Shepard said he was "proud of the unity" the church has shown 
in the face of the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides providing moral support, the church has established a Denise Huber 
Memorial Fund that will funnel donations to several charitable causes, yet to 
be selected. Shepard said donations may be sent to the fund at 120 Columbia 
Drive, Suite 100, Aliso Viejo, Calif. 92656.

ISRAEL, JORDAN AGREE ON PLAN TO END STATE OF WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Israel and Jordan will end their technical state of war and lay out plans for 
a normalization of relations at a groundbreaking summit at the White House 
today, according to officials from both countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The declaration of nonbelligerency, drafted in an intense last-minute effort 
Sunday, is to be signed by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Jordan's 
King Hussein. The leaders are scheduled to meet with President Clinton in the 
Oval Office this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Some U.S. officials had said there was some uncertainty about whether the 
declaration would be ready by then. Late Sunday, however, Israeli Foreign 
Minister Shimon Peres confirmed that a declaration is to be signed today. A 
senior Jordanian official confirmed the timing, according to Reuters news 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 Peres said the declaration will be a significant step that could "give 
daylight to peace." But it would fall short of a formal peace treaty, which is 
still at least several months off, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel and neighboring Jordan have not actually fought each other since the 
1967 Arab-Israeli War, but a technical state of war has existed between the two 
nations since 1948. The two countries have quietly cooperated for years on 
border issues and scarce water resources; their state of war has been in name 
only since the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 While relatively anticlimactic following the emotional White House agreement 
between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization in September, today's 
session will still mark an important milestone for both sides. In an event that 
would have been unimaginable just a few years ago, for example, Hussein and 
Rabin will appear together before a joint session of Congress on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 For the United States, the summit should signal the public rehabilitation of 
Jordan as an ally in the wake of the king's controversial decision to support 
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in the Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 It will also give Clinton an opportunity to focus on a foreign policy success 
at a time when his national security team faces criticism on a wide array of 
other fronts, from Haiti to Bosnia-Herzegovina to North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher called today's Israel-Jordan summit 
"both symbolic and a matter of substance," especially in light of the 
Israeli-PLO meeting last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It means that there is an acceptance of Israel and there is an acceptance of 
peace," he said on ABC-TV's "This Week with David Brinkley." "I don't think 
things will ever be the same in the Middle East after these historic events." 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher said he hopes the summit will spur progress in peace talks between 
Israel and longtime foe Syria. Today's meeting comes on the heels of 
Christopher's visits last week to Syria and Israel in which he sought to 
jump-start those complex negotiations. Christopher met again in a closed-door 
session with Rabin on Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The secretary of state said he believes there is now a historic opportunity 
for a regional peace settlement. The "walls are coming down in the Middle East" 
as chilly relations between Israel and its neighbors begin to thaw in the 
post-Cold War world, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Damascus, Syrian President Hafez Assad said Sunday that talks with Israel 
are still at an "exploratory stage." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking after talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Assad said efforts 
by the United States to revive Syrian-Israeli talks have made little progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerusalem has proposed a gradual pullback from the Golan Heights over five to 
eight years if Damascus agrees to full diplomatic ties, open borders and trade. 
But Syria has balked, arguing that Israeli withdrawal from the strategic 
heights must come before Syria moves to recognize Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher cautioned against expectations of rapid movement in the 
Israeli-Syrian negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very intertwined set of negotiations, probably the toughest 
negotiations of all," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But when we see what has happened on the other tracks, I think we have to 
approach this with a sense that the parties are determined to move ahead. I 
think there is a historical moment there for Syria and Israel, and I think that 
they can see on the horizon some of the kind of progress that's been made on 
the other tracks. "

COLUMN ONE; PLAYING TO THE TEEN MARKET; YOUTHS PAID TO REVIEW VIDEO GAMES WIELD 
CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE OVER A $6-BILLION INDUSTRY WHERE SCORING WITH CHILDREN 
IS KEY. BUT SOME OLDER EDITORS ARE SKEPTICAL ABOUT HIRING KIDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY HARMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Glenn Rubenstein's video game review column reaches half a million readers 
each week. His radio show, the one on which he once announced "Sega sucks, and 
their CD games are average," is syndicated in 60 markets. He's recently taken a 
job as executive editor of a start-up magazine called Blast: "I am the head 
guy," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 This head guy just turned 18. But video game executives three times his age 
can't afford to hold that against him. From his home in Petaluma, Calif., where 
he lives with his mom, he's been flown to New York, Los Angeles and Chicago by 
companies seeking praise for their products. An avid gum-chewer emerging from a 
case of adolescent acne, he's already accustomed to limos and luxury hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 Crystal Dynamics has offered to put his image in an upcoming game. Howard 
Lincoln, who is 54 and chairman of the multimillion-dollar Nintendo of America, 
spent a recent Friday evening entertaining the young journalist on a press 
junket to a Seattle Mariners game. 
</P>
<P>
 Nintendo happens to own part of the team, so "We sat in that little box behind 
home plate," Rubenstein recalls. "I even had a Corona!" 
</P>
<P>
 Rubenstein played his first video game at age 4 and started writing reviews 
for the local paper at 14. Now, he is the elder statesman of a pack of teen-age 
reviewers who wield considerable influence over a $6-billion-a-year industry -- 
and get treated accordingly by the industry's most powerful corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 Catering to this crew calls for special measures. When Sega of America offered 
to fly Joel Easley, 16, to Los Angeles for the introduction of its new "Tomcat 
Alley" game last spring, for instance, the Knoxville, Tenn., native -- whose 
column appears in 60 Scripps-Howard newspapers -- said his parents wouldn't let 
him go alone. So the company put up the air fare for his mother, Mary Ellen, 
and got rooms for both of them at the ITT Sheraton in Cerritos. Coming up next: 
a Sega-sponsored trip to Disney World. Joel is trying to arrange some days off 
from school so he can make it. 
</P>
<P>
 Like kids set free after a long day in class, the teen-age press ran rampant 
over last month's Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago, storming the Acclaim 
Entertainment Inc. booth to check out an unfinished version of "Mortal Kombat 
II," demanding to get on the list for the private showing of Nintendo's new 
Ultra 64 machine, scarfing down chocolate-covered strawberries and chugging 
beer at the after-hours parties. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's free food, I'm there, basically," says Sean Pettibone, 17, of 
Troy, Mich., who publishes his own "fanzine" (circulation: 3,000) and 
free-lances for several game magazines. Because the show rules prohibit anyone 
younger than 18 from entering the exhibit hall, "a lot of us are fake I.D.-ing 
it," confided one 15-year-old. "That's off the record!" 
</P>
<P>
 So what if they can't vote? It is, after all, mostly boys ages 8 to 18 who are 
responsible for the video game industry's skyrocketing score in that 
super-realistic game called global capitalism (said by some to be more violent 
even than the best-selling "Mortal Kombat"). It seems only right that their 
generation should help shape public opinion about the products in which they 
invest so much of their time and parents' money. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen crowd is still a minority among the video game press. Rubenstein, who 
keeps close track of his peers' popularity, believes his circulation is the 
largest of the group. But dozens of youthful game connoisseurs write for their 
local papers, publish "fanzines" and post reviews on the global Internet 
computer network. Others free-lance for the big video game magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more than what they write," says one executive. "These are the opinion 
leaders for our industry. They're the first ones on their block to get every 
new game, and the word on the street is very important to us." 
</P>
<P>
 This youth movement is a new phenomenon. Nintendo, which resurrected the video 
game business after Atari flared and faded in the 1970s, didn't come out with 
its first hit until 1984. Sega, whose star character Sonic the Hedgehog now is 
featured in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, wasn't a significant presence 
until a couple of years ago. So only recently have kids weaned on cartridges 
and joysticks reached the age where basic grammar is not a problem. Now, they 
are challenging the turf of older reviewers who still wax nostalgic over "Pong" 
-- the first hit video game, which rose to popularity about the same time as 
disco. 
</P>
<P>
 "All those guys are way too old," says 19-year-old Andrew Cockburn, who edits 
the Agoura Hills-based magazine Diehard Gamefan, of his thirty- and 
fortysomething colleagues. "They're still living in the '80s. And they're not 
gamers, either. They're just editors." 
</P>
<P>
 Forget fast cars, girls and the willingness to perform life-threatening stunts 
to impress your peers. In the video game subculture, machismo is measured 
almost solely on how well you play. If you can't rescue the princess in the 
classic Nintendo game "Super Mario Bros." in 15 minutes flat, you're not a 
"gamer." And it is axiomatic throughout the industry that, as the editor of the 
French magazine Player One puts it: "The younger they are, the better they 
play." 
</P>
<P>
 The rise of the post-"Pong" generation is forcing a reassessment of the "kids" 
among the editors and publishers who must decide whether to hire them -- and 
among the publicity and marketing executives who must wine them and dine them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It definitely makes you feel the age you are, I can say that," sighs Perrin 
Kaplan, 34, corporate communications manager at Nintendo. "You get in these 
situations where you feel like, 'Jeez, I could be your mother.' But you try not 
to think about that because it makes you depressed." 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly, Kaplan and other company officials say fielding calls (sometimes 
dozens a day) from the zealous gang of teens is a refreshing change from 
fending off the cynicism of their more mature elders. Bright and ambitious, 
several of the reviewers are set to graduate early from high school, even as 
they make time for their weekly columns and dozens of hours of game play a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 But dealing with a distinctly juvenile set of guys, many of whom haven't yet 
figured out what to do with their new dose of testosterone, can sometimes be a 
drag. Though no one will talk about it on the record -- lest anyone take 
offense and disparage an upcoming game -- female public relations 
representatives say they sometimes find themselves being asked questions with 
which they are not entirely comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 One time, a group of them discovered they were being "rated" by the teen-agers 
at a press event. "I think for some of these kids, maybe this is their outlet. 
Maybe they're not into girls as much, and their hormones are going overtime," 
observes Melinda Mongelluzzo, product publicity manager for Accolade, a San 
Jose-based video game maker. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, such behavior is not limited to males younger than 21. And it 
certainly won't keep any of the young reviewers off company press lists. 
Nintendo, which for years gave preferential treatment to reviewers at its 
in-house magazine, is making a special effort to reach out to young critics at 
other publications. It's part of an image campaign to gain back market share 
from rival Sega. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are heavily influenced by the opinions of these game reviewers, just like 
Hollywood is by the movie critics," says Lincoln. "One of the things I want to 
do is get to know a lot of people who are in the game-player magazine business, 
have them up to Nintendo and show them we're just like everybody else." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, but aren't some of them a bit, uh, unformed to be levying so much control 
over his business? "I'd rather talk to them than people my own age who believe 
they know something about the video game industry and have never played a 
game," Nintendo's chairman insists. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lincoln is probably just as happy that he wasn't along on a Nintendo 
cross-country publicity tour last summer. Matt Williamson, a 16-year-old 
reviewer from Aurora, Colo., had stayed up for 36 hours playing the adventure 
game "Zelda" on his Gameboy before retiring to a sleeping car. When it was time 
to switch trains, he was nowhere to be found. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubenstein, also on the trip, went around chanting "he's dead, he's dead" 
until the porters broke down the door of Williamson's sleeping car with an ax. 
"I was just sleeping," Williamson recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 If the companies are willing to put up with the vagaries of youth, the same 
cannot be said for certain crusty older editors. They remain skeptical about 
hiring someone who has yet to pass Composition 101, simply because of his 
superior game-playing skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there's an advantage in having a staff full of 15-year-olds, 
and I think the best writers are observably older than 15," says Arnie Katz, 
the 39-year-old editor of Electronic Games. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Semrad, editor of Electronic Gaming Monthly -- one of the largest magazines 
for enthusiasts, with about 350,000 subscribers -- won't say how old he is, 
except that he is over 30. Most of his staffers are in their 20s and 30s: "It's 
a big responsibility to review the games," he says. "We find that it's better 
to have professionals here who sit down, objectively look at the game, and make 
comparisons, rather than a person who might not finish it because he has a 
final exam coming up." 
</P>
<P>
 But Andy Eddy, senior editor at rival Gamepro, based in San Mateo, says he's 
been impressed with the young critics he encounters at press events. "They 
don't have the life experience and some of the social grace, I guess you might 
say," says Eddy. "But they seem to be very focused on what they're doing." 
</P>
<P>
 And the teens do come cheap. Williamson -- who counts among his career 
highlights an interview with the creator of the puzzle game "Tetris" -- 
recently quit writing for the Rocky Mountain News in Denver, in part because he 
says they paid him $50 per column. Joel Easley says he gets $25. Matt 
Neapolitan, 18, who writes for Kids Today, a Gannett publication, gets $55, 
which means he had to save several checks for the Rollerblades he just bought. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's much easier to take advantage of a kid that doesn't know how well he's 
supposed to be paid," notes Williamson, a four-year veteran of the trade. "When 
I started I got $10 or $20 a week, and I thought that was pretty big pay. Then 
someone on the staff told me I was getting ripped off." 
</P>
<P>
 Reviewers' requests for fatter paychecks largely have gone unheeded by their 
publications. But for a dedicated player, access to an unlimited number of new 
games can do a lot to make up for low-ball cash compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Free hardware, free software. You name it, I get it," says Easley, who sent 
his first column to the Knoxville News-Sentinel when his parents told him if he 
was going to play video games all the time he should find a way to pay for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 The most favored reviewers get as many as 20 free games a week, plus a 
multitude of machines to play them on. Which raises the delicate question of 
ethics and young, impressionable minds. When Cockburn met the creator of "Super 
Mario Bros." last month, he dropped to his knees, clasped his hands, and gasped 
"Thank you, Lord, for this day." 
</P>
<P>
 None of the reviewers are too big on "objectivity," but most seem 
constitutionally incapable of softening their criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "BOR-RING," writes USC freshman Anthony Shubert, 19, of an Accolade basketball 
game featuring Charles Barkley. "In all, this game does not really seem like 
anything worth playing. But because I like Sir Charles, I'm giving it a higher 
rating." Shubert's Game Master Journal is distributed over the Internet and the 
first videotaped version is now on sale. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to review only games I liked," says Rubenstein. "But now I review bad 
ones to make people think I'm more credible." 
</P>
<P>
 They've all endured angry phone calls and letters from company officials who 
didn't like their reviews, although most of Easley's correspondence comes from 
adults inquiring about shortcuts to victory. Williamson thinks the most amusing 
letters are from parents asking him if a particular game was a good one for 
their kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the purest of purpose are the teens who publish the fanzines, mostly 
photocopied newsletters with no corporate backing that nonetheless have strong 
followings. They tend to have circulation in the hundreds, they don't get the 
super-deluxe treatment from the game companies, and the biggest issue among 
them is how much funding they're getting from their parents. "With fandom, you 
have nothing to lose," explains Andy Saito, 17, of Toronto. "We say whatever we 
want." 
</P>
<P>
 But fanzine writers, largely on the younger end of the teen scale, are the 
likely Glenn Rubensteins of coming years. Rubenstein already depends on his 
brother, Matt, 13, for a second opinion on games. And he may be moving on to 
bigger and better things. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it wasn't for my brother I couldn't go on," Rubenstein says. "If Blast 
gets really big, I may even let him write my column. But keep my name on it, of 
course." 
</P>
<P>
 For there comes a time when every teen reviewer hits his peak. And, says 
Williamson, it's best to get out while you're young. "I think I was one of the 
better video game reviewers, but now I'm getting older, and I need to pay more 
attention to school and stuff. I guess I'm growing out of it." The Nintendo 
Generation Weighs In 
</P>
<P>
 Teen reviewers hold considerable sway over the $6-million video game industry.

EIGHT YEARS, DESCRIBE NEW RULER AS A METICULOUS PLANNER.

<P>
 North Korea's new leader, Kim Jong Il, is not quite the "madman" portrayed in 
press reports in the West but rather a meticulous planner who executes his 
projects with iron determination, according to South Korea's premier actress 
and film director, who were kidnaped by Kim and held captive for eight years in 
Pyongyang. 
</P>
<P>
 Had he been born to another life instead of being the eldest son of Kim Il 
Sung, the world's longest-reigning dictator until his death earlier this month, 
the younger Kim might have made a great movie producer, Choi Eun Hee and her 
husband, Shin Sang Okk, said in an interview with The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 As experts try to figure out what Kim is really like, negative images persist 
of a man who abuses alcohol and women and is possibly unpredictable enough to 
start a nuclear war. 
</P>
<P>
 The pudgy 52-year-old, who loves movies and the theater as much as his 
Hennessy cognac, was such a devotee of Stalin that he would use "any means" -- 
including the abduction of innocent artists such as themselves -- to fulfill 
his goals, the couple said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Jong Il is suspected to be the mastermind of the 1983 bombing in Burma 
(now Myanmar) that killed more than a dozen South Korean officials and the 1987 
midair bombing of a South Korean airliner that killed all 115 aboard -- to 
frighten people from coming to Seoul during the 1988 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, Choi, 63, and Shin, 67, know the frightening side of Kim -- it was 
on his orders that they were kidnaped to North Korea from Hong Kong six months 
apart in 1978, then not even told for years if the other was alive. 
</P>
<P>
 But while South Korea's most famous movie couple still cringe when recalling 
their captor, they also speak of him without rancor, almost dispassionately, as 
if they were discussing a main character in a movie they were making. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his terrorist past, the Kim Jong Il they knew between 1978 and 1986 
would not start a nuclear war -- because that would amount to a suicide for his 
nation, said Shin, who had many long talks with Kim. "He is not as rash as he 
appears to those who don't know the inner workings of North Korea. North 
Korea's nuclear program is the only bargaining tool he has. He'll use it as a 
tool." 
</P>
<P>
 During the wide-ranging interview in Los Angeles, Choi and Shin provided a 
close-up view of the reclusive North Korean leader about whom little is known 
outside his secretive nation, where a personality cult grew around Kim Il Sung 
that is equivalent to a state religion. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple escaped from their North Korean captors in 1986 and settled two 
years later in the Los Angeles area, living now in Beverly Hills. They became 
U.S. citizens last year and are working on an epic film, "Genghis Khan," which 
they began in North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Their joint memoirs, published in 1988 in Korean and Japanese, sold 300,000 
copies in Japan alone. The fact that they related their experiences, filling 
863 pages, is one reason they do not feel a need merely to demonize their 
onetime captor, they say; getting on in years, they feel there's little time 
left to dwell on the unpleasant past. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, like millions of other Koreans of their generation, having lived 
through brutal Japanese colonial rule, World War II, the Korean War and decades 
of dictatorship, they are numb -- and practiced in a survival technique of 
forgive and forget. 
</P>
<P>
 In this spirit, the couple see their kidnapings as examples of Kim's 
well-planned moves to achieve what he believed was good for his country. As a 
movie buff who recognized the power of the medium, his dream was to create a 
first-class movie industry in his country. To achieve that, he plotted to 
abduct them. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Korea was partitioned at the end of World War II, the Communist regime 
in the North has abducted countless artists, musicians and writers, including 
this century's most famous novelist, Lee Kwang Soo, in an attempt to deplete 
the South's intellectual roster. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you measure Kim Jong Il with Western standards of freedom and human 
rights, he is irrational," said Shin. "On the other hand, if you analyze him in 
the context of Stalinism, he is not crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 "The end justifies the means. Wasn't it Lenin who said it was all right to 
steal for the sake of the revolution?" said Choi. 
</P>
<P>
 From their intimate encounters with him, Choi and Shin are convinced that Kim 
has the ability to assume and retain power over North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 "The so-called North Korean specialists don't know anything," Shin said. 
"They've never met the man." 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to "experts" who have speculated that Kim may not survive beyond the 
next two years because he doesn't have his father's credentials and charisma, 
Shin said: 
</P>
<P>
 "If Kim Jong Il goes, so go all the people around him. Do you think they will 
let that happen? Kim Il Sung didn't groom him to be his heir just because he 
was his son. Kim Il Sung chose him because he knew he was capable." 
</P>
<P>
 The younger Kim has been running day-to-day operations of the Pyongyang 
government for the past 20 years, said Shin, an assessment shared by numerous 
North Korea watchers in South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 During the movie couple's eight years in Pyongyang, they dined with Kim, 
watched movies with him and visited his home -- considered a rare privilege. 
They spent scores of hours discussing movie projects, which Kim considered a 
key to mobilizing his people's support. 
</P>
<P>
 Their bizarre odyssey began when Choi, South Korea's most popular actress 
since World War II, was kidnaped in Hong Kong in January, 1978, in Repulse Bay. 
Out of nowhere, several men appeared, picked Choi up and put her on a freighter 
-- sobbing, screaming and then fainting -- to the North Korean port of Nampo 
near Pyongyang, she wrote in her memoir. 
</P>
<P>
 Several days later, Choi was met at the dock by Kim Jong Il, whose welcoming 
remarks were: "You have suffered a great deal trying to come here. I am Kim 
Jong Il." 
</P>
<P>
 She was driven to one of his villas. For many months, she locked herself in 
the bathroom and cried. Often she ran the faucet full blast to keep her guards 
from hearing her, and called out the names of her two adopted children and 
other family members. Sometimes she felt like she would go crazy, she recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Shin was abducted six months later, after mounting a fruitless search for 
Choi. He, too, was lured to Repulse Bay, bound and anesthetized and taken by 
different boats to Nampo, Shin said. 
</P>
<P>
 For five years Choi and Shin did not know whether the other was alive or in 
North Korea. They were held captive separately until they were reunited on 
March 6, 1983, at a banquet hosted by Kim at Communist Party headquarters in 
Pyongyang. 
</P>
<P>
 Choi was moved from villa to villa, subjected to indoctrination and constantly 
under watch. Shin was held in a political prison for four years, after he twice 
tried to escape in a Mercedes-Benz. 
</P>
<P>
 After the pair were reunited, they plotted their getaway. The only way out was 
to cooperate with Kim, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 18, 1983, Kim hosted a 57th birthday party for Shin. That night Kim 
asked Shin to be his special adviser on motion pictures. Kim asked Shin to 
forgive their "recent difficulties" and admitted his involvement in the 
kidnapings. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim told Shin he wanted to export movies to improve his country's image. 
</P>
<P>
 That very night Shin Film Inc. was created, and two days later the movie 
couple were off to Eastern Europe with diplomatic passports and $3 million to 
make a movie Kim Jong Il wanted completed for his father's birthday, six months 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Jong Il's 15,000 movies, one of the world's largest private collections, 
included all of Shin's films -- more than 100 in all. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kim Jong Il liked both of us -- long before he met us," Shin said. "So did 
Kim Il Sung. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, having won Kim Jong Il's confidence, the two were permitted to travel, 
even to Western Europe, though they were always accompanied by North Korean 
officials. While in Europe, they even held a news conference and said they had 
gone to the North voluntarily, though South Korean officials dismissed that as 
another North Korean propaganda ploy. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple made half a dozen films for North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Their "One-Way Mission" won the best-director award at a 1985 film festival in 
Czechoslovakia. A pleased Kim Jong Il called Choi. "Our country has never won 
an honor like this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, 1986, they were in Vienna on the way to Budapest, where they were 
to begin work on a film about Genghis Khan. Choi and Shin, helped by a Japanese 
journalist they knew, made a daring escape in a taxi, eluding their guards, who 
were in hot pursuit. They dashed into the U.S. Embassy and sought refuge. For 
two years after that they lived in a Washington, D.C., suburb, under the 
protection of U.S. officials until 1988. A furious Kim Jong Il had placed a 
$1-million bounty on them. 
</P>
<P>
 During their stay in Pyongyang, they led a "privileged" life, they 
acknowledged, even during their confinement. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim made sure his aides remembered their birthdays and had appropriate gifts 
delivered to them. 
</P>
<P>
 And whenever Kim called Choi on a special hot-line telephone he had set up to 
talk to her, he was solicitous, always inquiring about her well-being. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking in Korean throughout the interview, but occasionally using English 
words such as "scenario" and "productions," both Choi and Shin said images of 
North Korea in the West are distorted, showing the extremes. They attributed 
this to the tendency of Westerners to focus on what is said as opposed to what 
is left unsaid. 
</P>
<P>
 "For example, all these reports about Kim Jong Il's sexual proclivities and 
eccentricities are exaggerated," said Shin. "I don't think Kim Jong Il 
womanizes any more than other powerful men in the world who can have women at 
their beck and call," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shin said he was impressed by Kim's patience in achieving his projects. "He 
spent five years trying to win me over to his side to make movies," Shin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Physically, the primary thing Choi remembers about Kim Jong Il is his 
"roundness." 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a round face, his eyes are round and big, and he is rotund." 
</P>
<P>
 Kim also had a good sense of humor and laughed easily, she said. Sometimes he 
told self-deprecating jokes about his appearance, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, when Kim visited Choi, he stood at the entrance and as soon as he saw 
her asked: "How do I look?" 
</P>
<P>
 When she hesitated, he grinned and said: "I look nanjaenggi ttong-jjaru, " 
meaning a small sack of excrement, one of the more earthy Korean jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sign of respect, Kim addressed them as sunsaeng (teacher). They, in turn, 
called him "dear leader" or "comrade leader." 
</P>
<P>
 After the couple won the best director award, Kim called Choi. The actress, 
who was working in their studio when Kim phoned, recorded the conversation, a 
copy of which was made available to The Times. The conversation was preserved 
on one of seven tapes they packed in their luggage when they left North Korea 
for the last time. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 10-minute conversation, laced with laughter and jokes, Kim accused her 
and her husband of ignoring him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dear leader, it is I who should say that you have all but forgotten us. We 
hadn't heard from you for so long, we thought we were vanished from your 
universe." 
</P>
<P>
 "Not I, teacher Choi," he said, laughing. "You are the ones who have forgotten 
me. Lately, you don't want to have anything to do with me." 
</P>
<P>
 He inquired about her health, then suggested that she take some time off to 
conserve her energy. Kim asked about Shin, who was making a movie in Beijing at 
the time, and invited them to join him for dinner as soon as he returned. 
</P>
<P>
 "Half of the time, our phone conversations with Kim Jong Il were taken up with 
jokes," said Shin, who too had a hot line to Kim Jong Il during his separate 
confinement. 
</P>
<P>
 One time, as Choi sat in her quarters wallowing in sadness and thinking of her 
children and relatives back home, the phone rang. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Kim. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teacher Choi, it is I, Kim Jong Il. What are you doing right now?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I was reading earlier, but I'm knitting just now," Choi said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be sending a car within the hour. Please come to our home." 
</P>
<P>
 His voice was cheerful and, Choi thought, slightly tipsy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank you so much for the invitation, but what's the occasion?" 
</P>
<P>
 "To tell you the truth, today is my birthday. We haven't prepared anything 
special, but we're having a family get-together. Why don't you come, teacher 
Choi." 
</P>
<P>
 She chose a cobalt blue traditional Korean dress, made from fabric Kim had 
given her. 
</P>
<P>
 The car he sent for her sped across the bridge over the River Taedong, toward 
the eastern section of Pyongyang, past rows of poplar trees, and finally 
stopped in front of an unpretentious one-story house. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim was at the entrance when she arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 He introduced her to his wife, a handsome woman who surprised her, Choi said, 
by wearing a long Western dress instead of the traditional Korean attire most 
women in North Korea wore. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teacher Choi," Kim said, "my wife is just a simple homemaker. Isn't that what 
women should do -- stay home and raise children?" 
</P>
<P>
 She also met his son. He was chubby like his father. 
</P>
<P>
 Choi asked him how old he was. He responded "eight." But when she asked what 
his name was, the boy complained, "Why do you want to know my name?" 
</P>
<P>
 Stroking the boy's head, Kim Jong Il said gently: "When adults ask children 
questions, children are supposed to answer." 
</P>
<P>
 As if to assuage the awkward situation, a young man, who appeared to be the 
boy's tutor, arrived and led the child to play outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, she realized the faux pas she had committed. "Who in North Korea 
would dare ask the name of the grandson of their Great Leader?" she asked 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kim was in a jovial mood that afternoon. He walked around his spacious 
living room with a video camera, capturing the party. Afterward, he played the 
video for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 The picture came out blurry and pink. Everyone laughed about that, including 
Kim. 
</P>
<P>
 The motion picture couple said they believe Kim would have made a fine movie 
producer because of his enormous dedication and meticulousness. 
</P>
<P>
 "We nicknamed him 'micro-manager,' " Choi said. "He pays attention to 
everything. He keeps track of everything. He is simply amazing." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after her capture, Kim had his aides deliver a score of boxes to her 
door. They contained materials for every type of clothing -- from party wear to 
casual wear. Choi had only two pieces of clothing in her shopping bag when she 
was kidnaped. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as he carefully picked gifts for his captives and planned for the 
enhancement of North Korea's film industry, they believe, Kim Jong Il can 
manage his government. The couple advised: "Don't underestimate Kim Jong Il."

'SHORT PAY' REQUESTS RISE IN SLACK HOUSING MARKET; REAL ESTATE: MANY OWNERS ASK 
TO CLOSE OUT MORTGAGES BY PAYING LESS THAN IS OWED. LENDERS USUALLY SAY NO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL A. HILTZIK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Earlier this year John Knott made what he considered "an incredibly reasonable 
proposal" to the mortgage lenders on his West Los Angeles home. 
</P>
<P>
 Desperate to move his family to Nevada after the Jan. 17 earthquake, Knott was 
trapped in a house that was worth less than 75% of what he had paid for it in 
1991 and well below what was still owed on two mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
 His solution: ask his lenders to share the loss by accepting less than they 
were owed to close out the mortgages. By his computations they would suffer a 
combined loss of about $75,000 -- but he would shoulder a personal loss of more 
than $70,000 in equity and cash on the sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Since California law would make it nearly impossible for the lenders to attach 
any of Knott's personal property to cover the mortgage shortfall, he thought 
they would leap at the chance to avoid the even greater losses they would incur 
by foreclosing. 
</P>
<P>
 But both lenders rejected the deal. The finance company holding his first 
mortgage, Knott recalls, "said the only solution acceptable to them was 
foreclosure." 
</P>
<P>
 Knott's experience illustrates a bitter new reality of the Southern California 
real estate market. With thousands of homes now worth far less than their 
mortgage balances because of a four-year fall in housing values, homeowners are 
trying to persuade their lenders to share their losses in what has 
traditionally been the largest and most secure investment any American makes in 
a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing today illustrates the fall of the Southern California housing market 
as vividly as this issue. It has focused attention on a term that was never 
before an important part of the vocabulary of residential real estate here: the 
"short pay," in which a lender agrees to accept less than the outstanding 
balance to settle a mortgage loan when a home is sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Many real estate agents now specialize in negotiating short pays. Banks and 
other lenders have set up special offices to field the requests and have 
re-examined their guidelines in an attempt to better balance the pros and cons 
of accepting such deals rather than foreclosing -- an option that usually 
leaves lenders with larger losses than would granting homeowners relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the beneficiaries of California's inflating housing market, lenders now 
find themselves in the discomfiting position of asking home sellers to write a 
check to unload property that would have sold at a fat profit five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The scale of the problem is hard to gauge because most of the negotiations are 
played out behind closed doors, in intense but secret talks between seller and 
lender. Most homeowners who have successfully negotiated short pays find the 
experience so painful and demeaning that they are loath to talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
 For all that, it is clear that most applicants come away disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 Bankers and realtors alike say short payoffs tend to be accepted only when 
irrefutable and unavoidable hardships make carrying the mortgage nearly 
impossible. These include unemployment, business reverses and unexpected 
medical bills. 
</P>
<P>
 In cases of self-imposed difficulties or mere convenience -- Knott, for 
instance, was not unemployed -- banks will still foreclose rather than let 
homeowners walk away free and clear. 
</P>
<P>
 Many homeowners believe that California law allows them to virtually walk away 
without consequences from a home whose sale won't cover the outstanding 
mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 It is true that under state law the original loan used to buy a home is 
"non-recourse" -- that is, the lender cannot normally attach the borrower's 
personal assets to cover the deficiency. Homeowners generally lose that 
protection, however, for all subsequent loans on the property, such as second 
and third mortgages and refinances of the original loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, even protected borrowers can be penalized in other ways for failing 
to pay a mortgage in full. Foreclosure, a lender's ultimate remedy against the 
holder of an original mortgage, is a black mark on a homeowner's financial 
history that can hamper or prevent the homeowner from getting credit for as 
long as seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to educate my clients nonstop," says Michael Lebecki, a real estate 
agent in the Santa Clarita Valley who says as many as half his clients are now 
seeking such arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 "So many people think they have no responsibility," he says. "But people who 
get short pay agreements from their banks are those with $1,500 left in an 
account to eat with, and that's it. If you're angry because your payments are 
too high, or you can't refinance (because the home's value has fallen below the 
loan balance), or you can't go to a new job, the banks say: 'We're not 
interested,' and they'll foreclose." 
</P>
<P>
 In the last three or four years untold thousands of homeowners in the region 
have been hit by the double whammy of falling home values and high 
unemployment. Los Angeles County lost an estimated 530,000 jobs between July, 
1990, and the end of 1993, while Orange County lost 195,000 jobs, state 
employment officials estimate. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the collapse in home prices has made it difficult or impossible for 
some people to leave the area in search of better jobs without losing most or 
all of the equity in their homes or exposing themselves to foreclosure. 
</P>
<P>
 "During my lifetime we've never had a period (in California) when prices went 
down 30 to 40%, when you have people begging for this kind of relief and you 
also have high unemployment, so they can't ride it out," says Steven Gourley, a 
real estate lawyer in Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of Southland homeowners whose home values are lower than their 
outstanding mortgage balances is hard to calculate. But with prices in Southern 
California having dropped from their 1990 peak by more than 30% in many areas 
(and by 50% or more in some high-priced communities), brokers and bankers 
estimate that the figure may be in the hundreds of thousands. 
</P>
<P>
 Lenders agree that the demand to work out problem loans with strapped and 
trapped homeowners has mushroomed. 
</P>
<P>
 "A few years ago this just wasn't an issue," says Sandra Stewart, president 
and chief operating officer of Home Savings of America's loan service center. 
"Home values were appreciating and if a person got into trouble he could just 
sell the house." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Dorothy Kviberg, a First Interstate Bank vice president and manager of 
its mortgage arm: "One year ago, we'd have one or two requests a month" for 
mortgage-term modifications, short payouts, or agreements to allow a homeowner 
to turn over the property deed in settlement. "A few weeks ago we had 96 calls 
in one week." 
</P>
<P>
 The bank officer who once handled such requests by herself on an occasional 
basis now does it full time, with one assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 Notices of default recorded against houses and condominiums in Los Angeles, 
Orange, San Diego, and Ventura counties rose to a monthly peak of 6,150 this 
past March from 5,548 a year earlier and 4,432 in March, 1992, according to 
Dataquick Information Systems, a La Jolla-based real estate information 
service. In January, 1992, the first month for which Dataquick has figures, the 
number was 3,237. 
</P>
<P>
 Those figures probably understate the trend of mortgage delinquencies in the 
region, according to John Karevoll, Dataquick's financial editor. Lenders are 
allowing borrowers to fall further behind in their payments -- in some cases by 
six or eight months -- before starting the foreclosure process. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three years ago if a homeowner fell behind, a notice of default would be 
filed one month later," Karevoll says. 
</P>
<P>
 Lenders generally regard foreclosure as a last resort because most would 
prefer to avoid adding new properties to portfolios already bursting with 
overvalued homes, condos and office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to go into the business of owning these homes," says Home 
Savings' Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, foreclosure is a costly and time-consuming process, taking at least 
three to four months. What the lender gets at the end of that period is less 
than a prize: a vacant property that must be maintained and secured until sold. 
In most cases the final return is thousands of dollars less than the bank might 
have received in a negotiated short sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Bankers acknowledge that foreclosing rather than negotiating a short payoff 
looks like a money-losing policy in the short term. But they argue that 
maintaining the sanctity of the contract will protect them from bigger losses 
over time. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, they fear that overly liberal short-sale policies would open 
the gates to thousands of customers hoping to walk away from housing 
investments gone sour. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's necessary to recognize there's a problem," says Bud Schmidtbauer, 
regional vice president for quality control and operations for the Federal 
National Mortgage Assn., the government-sponsored mortgage company commonly 
known as Fannie Mae. "But no lender wants to ignite a wholesale write-down. In 
cases where the borrower has a job but he's incurring a loss of value in his 
housing investment, we're not out to hold people harmless from loss in the 
market." 
</P>
<P>
 This aversion to making things too easy is what keeps many lenders from 
accepting deals that look like rational compromises to homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought if we could get the house on the market sooner rather than later it 
would be better for everyone," John Knott says of his stillborn plan to pay off 
his lenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, he offered to continue paying down the mortgages and 
covering taxes on the earthquake-damaged house until it could be sold. He would 
consider turning over an expected insurance payment of $50,000 to $60,000 to 
reduce the shortfalls. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be losing every cent I'd invested in the house," he says, "and some 
more." 
</P>
<P>
 As it happens, changes in the home-mortgage market over the last 20 years -- 
including the role played by agencies such as Fannie Mae itself -- have made it 
more difficult than ever before to work out problem loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, once a bank approves and funds a mortgage, it often sells the loan to 
investors, often through Fannie Mae or other intermediaries. (Fannie Mae will 
buy and package loans up to $203,500 and covering up to 95% of the appraised 
value of a home.) 
</P>
<P>
 The originating bank pockets a fee for servicing the loan -- collecting 
monthly payments, keeping records and pursuing delinquencies. But before it can 
reach agreement with a strapped borrower it must get approval from the loan's 
owner, which may be another bank, an investment house, Fannie Mae, or even an 
individual investor. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, homeowners often find themselves negotiating with bankers who 
have no vested interest in coming to a mutually satisfactory deal. Banking 
professionals say investors who bought mortgages in the secondary market are 
much more rigid about rejecting short-pay agreements than are banks negotiating 
over a loan in their own portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all that, brokers say short sales can be negotiated in many cases -- 
but they are far from routine transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The process is very grueling," says Zizi Pak, a realtor at Prudential Rodeo 
Realty in Beverly Hills who has made short sales something of a specialty. "It 
takes a lot of hard work and a lot of experience. It's not just a case of 
sending in the paperwork and saying OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Borrowers and brokers who have gone through the system say there is little 
point in even beginning the process as long as one's mortgage payments are 
current. Warren Griffin, a Beverly Hills homeowner who completed a short sale, 
says he first had to stop paying his mortgage and go into default "because 
otherwise (the lender) wouldn't even pay attention to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin's case also shows that the size of the shortfall often has very little 
to do with a lender's pliability. The sale of his house was likely to leave his 
mortgage banker $200,000 short. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the degree of hardship that is the key factor in whether a bank will 
accept a short pay, brokers say. "The amount has very little to do with it," 
Lebecki says. "I've had banks be as difficult over $5,000 as $50,000." 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin, who is identified here by a pseudonym because he asked that his real 
name not be used, was facing a critical hardship. 
</P>
<P>
 He showed his bank that the income from his construction company had dwindled 
to practically nothing by February, 1993, when he realized he could no longer 
afford to make the payments on the house. By the time he found a buyer and 
closed the deal in October, the sale price was less than half what he paid for 
the property in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, persuading the lender to accept the short pay still required 
nearly 10 months of negotiation, according to Pak, Griffin's realtor. 
</P>
<P>
 Lenders confronted with short-pay requests sometimes ask for more 
documentation than they did for the original loan: As much as three years' tax 
returns (and permission to retrieve the originals from the Internal Revenue 
Service), pay stubs, business records in the case of self-employed applicants, 
and detailed information about personal assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly, lenders also revisit the original loan application, looking for 
signs that a borrower misrepresented his or her finances at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though they may have no legal recourse against a borrower's personal 
assets, banks are likely to insist that the applicant commit his holdings to 
satisfying as much of the shortfall as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have stocks and bonds," Pak says, "they figure, why should they take a 
short pay?" 
</P>
<P>
 One San Fernando Valley homeowner represented by Gourley was refused a short 
pay even though he was paying mortgages on two homes. One was a Manhattan Beach 
house he bought and moved his family to before selling his original home in 
Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
 He could not afford to make payments on both, but the lender on the Canoga 
Park house decided to foreclose rather than accept a $25,000 shortfall. "The 
bank said it's a hardship, but a self-imposed hardship," said the homeowner, 
who asked to remain unidentified. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Pak's clients lost his bid to avert foreclosure because his lender 
noticed that he had changed professions, opening a retail tile shop after 
losing the job as a research scientist that he had when he obtained the loan. 
The store was not producing enough income to cover the mortgage payments. 
</P>
<P>
 "They asked why he didn't stay in his specialty," she recalls. "I said he 
couldn't find a job in it, but they said he shouldn't have opened a store. So 
they foreclosed and lost $100,000. It was asinine."

COURTHOUSE MAKES BLANKET USE OF JUROR ANONYMITY; JUSTICE: MOVE BY BELLFLOWER 
JUDGE APPARENTLY IS A FIRST IN U.S. HE HOPES TO REDUCE FEAR, BUT SOME CRITICIZE 
ACTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHERINE GEWERTZ, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the five municipal courtrooms in Bellflower, there is no crush of news 
media covering high profile cases. There are no mobsters, drug lords or 
murderers on trial. Here, all the cases involve misdemeanors for crimes such as 
drunk driving, domestic violence and petty theft. 
</P>
<P>
 It is hardly the type of caseload to warrant special protection for jurors. 
But this small gray courthouse may be the only one in the country where every 
juror in every criminal case gets the protective robe of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip K. Mautino, presiding judge of Los Cerritos Municipal Court, started 
the practice in January. He wanted to protect jury members, believing they were 
increasingly uneasy about doing their job in violence-weary Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mautino's courthouse, only the jury clerk knows the names of the jurors. To 
everyone else, panelists are known by the last four digits of their laminated 
juror badges. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, anonymity is rarely used, and usually in cases in which jurors 
could be harassed or threatened, such as trials for the Los Angeles police 
officers accused of beating Rodney King, the federal prosecution of reputed 
Mafia boss John Gotti and the court proceedings against the men accused of 
beating trucker Reginald O. Denny. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think a lot of people are afraid to serve on juries," Mautino said. 
"Jurors can feel intimidated even when there isn't an actual threat. I think 
people would be more relaxed and willing to serve if (anonymity) was used in 
more courts." 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle Municipal Judge Thomas Clark, president of the American Judges Assn., 
said he knows of no other courthouse with a blanket policy of anonymity in 
criminal cases. Neither had any other legal expert interviewed heard of such a 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Mautino's policy comes at a time when American interest in jurors has never 
been more intense. Many sensational trials are now broadcast gavel-to-gavel on 
television. The public and the news media want to know how jurors arrived at 
their decisions in high-profile cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Reaction to the policy in Bellflower has been mixed. 
</P>
<P>
 Rudolph A. Diaz, chairman of the Municipal Court Presiding Judges Assn., was 
pleasantly surprised when told about it. He said many people are reluctant to 
serve on juries, and some have told him they fear being approached at home 
after their case ends. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if it's something that keeps jurors happy, then it's something we 
should try to work out for them," Diaz said. "I don't see how it can harm a 
case. They make better jurors when they are secure, deciding on law and 
evidence rather than in anger or fear." 
</P>
<P>
 But some scholars and lawyers object to blanket anonymity, calling it a 
heavy-handed solution to a problem that isn't that serious. Others believe it's 
an assault on American justice. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like asking for the death penalty for an illegal U-turn," said Abraham 
Abramovsky, a professor at Fordham University's law school in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole reason for juries is that we don't want secrecy clouding our 
judicial arena. If you can't find out who you're dealing with, then what is the 
system for? You lose the reason this country is different than all others. You 
lose a true jury system. And that is too good to lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such criticism, jurors in Bellflower seem to like the protection 
offered by anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 "It made me feel safer," said Jan, a juror in a recent domestic dispute case 
who so appreciated the safety that her anonymity gave her, she declined to have 
her surname used. "I was dealing with a charge connected with a potentially 
violent individual. I kept thinking I was glad he didn't have a lot of 
information about me." 
</P>
<P>
 Deirdre, an alternate juror in that same case, said she was relieved she did 
not have to disclose her name. Two years ago, when she was a juror in a 
carjacking case in Los Angeles, she recalled feeling vulnerable about having to 
state her name in open court. Several of her fellow jurors also felt nervous, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mautino said he first sensed such problems a couple of years ago when his wife 
was a juror in Superior Court. The first night, she took a circuitous two-hour 
route home because she was so nervous, Mautino said. She couldn't discuss it, 
but later he learned she had helped convict a gang member of murder. 
</P>
<P>
 The memory of her fear hung with him. He was appointed to the bench last year, 
and when he became presiding judge this January, he decided to reassure jurors 
in his courthouse however he could. 
</P>
<P>
 Mautino believes that if he were to use anonymous juries only in the rare 
cases where panelists might be threatened or harassed, it could tilt the scale 
toward conviction by subtly implying that the defendant was someone to be 
feared. He reasons that withholding jurors' names in every case, regardless of 
its nature, eliminates that bias. 
</P>
<P>
 Mautino described his policy as an "aggressive interpretation" of a 2-year-old 
section of the state Code of Civil Procedure that affords jurors the 
opportunity to have their names kept secret once a trial is over. He thought it 
was "worthless" to offer protection after jurors' names have been public 
throughout a trial. So he decided to offer it at the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when jurors are anonymous, California law permits attorneys to petition 
the court for their names, addresses and phone numbers once the trial is over 
so that they can be interviewed to develop issues to use on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 David Graeven, a San Francisco jury consultant, said anonymous juries can 
serve a purpose because "anxious jurors are less able to logically follow an 
argument. Anxiety produces loose-cannon jurors who could be more influenced by 
their biases or courtroom drama than by the evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 But Peter G. Keane, chief deputy public defender in San Francisco, says 
hundreds of interviews with jurors during his career have led him to conclude 
they are "no more nervous about serving on a jury than when I started out 26 
years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Keane, who is on the board of governors of the State Bar of California, said 
using anonymous juries without a specific finding of a need for it in each case 
"injects an aura of paranoia" into the system and "smacks of totalitarianism." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's absurd, ludicrous," Keane said. "There's no need for that kind of 
secrecy." 
</P>
<P>
 Alban I. Niles, presiding judge of the Los Angeles Municipal Court, reviewed 
the law upon which Mautino based his policy and said he suspects Mautino may 
have overstepped its intent. It seems clear, Niles said, that the Legislature 
wanted courts to find a "compelling" reason before withholding jurors' names. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure the judge's intentions were good, but I wouldn't recommend that 
practice," Niles said. 
</P>
<P>
 Myrna S. Raeder, professor at Southwestern University School of Law and vice 
chairwoman of the American Bar Assn.'s committee on criminal procedure and 
evidence, said she would be "amazed" if Mautino's policy withstood a legal 
challenge in higher courts. 
</P>
<P>
 State appeals courts have had little opportunity to rule on issues involving 
anonymous juries, legal experts said. But Raeder said federal appeals courts 
have held that judges must have a strong reason to use nameless panels and must 
take steps to make sure the need for anonymity does not prejudice the jury 
against the defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew M. Stein, a defense attorney who often practices in the Bellflower 
court, said he views Mautino as "fair, independent, creative and decisive, 
someone who likes to be on the cutting edge of making improvements." But he 
thinks blanket jury anonymity is excessive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried a death penalty case (in) Downtown (Los Angeles) recently, and they 
didn't have an anonymous jury there," he said. "And here I am in Bellflower, 
representing a prominent surgeon for driving under the influence, and they want 
to use an anonymous jury. My client wasn't a dangerous guy who was some threat 
to the jury. It was ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 Terrence Kirk, an Austin, Tex., attorney who defended Branch Davidian member 
Ruth Riddle before an anonymous jury, rejected the argument that using 
anonymous juries in all cases eliminates the bias against a particular 
defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 "So if you deny the presumption of innocence across the board, then it's not a 
problem?" he said. "That's absurd. It just means the defense suffers in every 
case because it creates the idea that defendants as a class are people to be 
feared." 
</P>
<P>
 Kirk and other defense attorneys said nameless juries put the defense at a 
disadvantage. Despite repeated statements about the presumption of innocence, 
they say, most jurors believe that if a defendant has been charged and brought 
to court, he or she is probably guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense must overcome that prejudice, and using names helps to establish 
rapport during jury selection, Kirk said. Lacking the names creates "an aura of 
depersonalization" that makes it easier for jurors to view the defendant as 
"not really a person," Kirk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Munsterman, director of the nonprofit Center for Jury Studies in 
Washington, D.C., said not knowing jurors' names shouldn't be crucial in 
selecting a fair jury because attorneys can still inquire into aspects of their 
lives that might indicate a bias. Despite that, he said he still had the 
feeling that withholding names creates "this sense that we've lost openness. 
It's an unfortunate sign of the times." 
</P>
<P>
 Other experts agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul F. Rothstein, professor of law at Georgetown University, said once 
jurors' names are hidden, some important and positive pressures are lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "Public scrutiny helps keep everyone open and honest," he said. "You take that 
away, and questions arise about how honest jurors are being. Accountability to 
the community is an important pressure on them to do the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of accountability in the jury system dates back to the 
pre-Revolutionary War era, said Stephen J. Adler, author of a forthcoming book, 
"The Jury: Trial and Error in the American Courtroom." In the late 18th 
Century, it was considered important that jurors be respected community members 
who could return from service and openly "vouch for the integrity of the 
justice system," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there is no express constitutional right of a defendant to know the 
names of jurors passing judgment upon him or her, knowing the names and basic 
information about jurors is "a piece of open-trial philosophy that underlies 
the American tradition," said Julian Eule, associate dean of the UCLA School of 
Law and a constitutional law expert. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the same thinking that created the 6th Amendment (to the Constitution)," 
Eule said. "You have the right to confront your accusers, to have a speedy and 
public trial by an impartial jury. It's only a small step from there to knowing 
who is making the decision."

LEBANON FEARS IT WILL PAY PRICE FOR MIDDLE EAST PEACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 25 commandos crept across a field of grapevines thick with foliage, 
carefully cut the telephone lines to the Dirani house and then burst through 
the front door and rushed into Mustafa Dirani's bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't worry," they told Dirani's screaming wife as she leaped from the bed. 
"We are Israel." 
</P>
<P>
 Dirani's 5-year-old daughter, Tiba, was shoved against the wall. His wife was 
slapped across the jaw. And Dirani, one of Israel's most implacable enemies and 
head of the Iranian-backed Faithful Resistance organization, was sedated, 
handcuffed and led to a helicopter waiting on a nearby hill. No one has seen or 
heard from him since. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than two weeks later, in early June, Israeli warplanes came swooping deep 
into Lebanon in the middle of the night, showering fire and death on a Bekaa 
Valley camp of Hezbollah, a Shiite Muslim resistance group. By morning, 
Hezbollah had 45 new martyrs and hundreds of Lebanese families in the south 
were fleeing from the inevitable drama of rocket fire and mortar retribution 
that would follow. 
</P>
<P>
 As Jordan's King Hussein launches his historic meeting in Washington today 
with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin -- coming on the heels of Palestine 
Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat's recent triumphant return to 
Gaza and the West Bank -- it is easy to assume that the Arab-Israeli conflict 
is drawing to a close. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Lebanon, especially during these last two months, the war is very much 
alive. It is in the arid, stone-strewn valleys of southern Lebanon that Rabin 
and his most serious adversary, Syrian President Hafez Assad, talk to each 
other, miles from the negotiating table, with volleys of mortar fire, bombs and 
tank shells. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Lebanon, firmly lodged inside Syria's protective political embrace, finds 
itself in the middle of an ambitious and faltering post-civil war 
reconstruction with little or no say in ending the crippling proxy war with 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 During U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's latest round of Middle 
East shuttle diplomacy, Beirut was the one capital he didn't visit. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason is painfully clear: With Lebanon's president and prime minister 
traveling to the Syrian capital of Damascus for decisions on everything from 
the anti-Israeli resistance to a media law, why talk in Beirut when the 
decisions are made next door? 
</P>
<P>
 Most worrying of all for the Lebanese is that Syria, granted a virtual free 
hand in Lebanon after its support for the U.S.-led allies in the 1991 Persian 
Gulf War, will seek a permanent role in Lebanon as perhaps the only realistic 
guarantor of security on Israel's border with the tumultuous little nation. If 
Syria finally signs a peace treaty with Israel, will Lebanon be the price? 
</P>
<P>
 "What we fear most is that we're being negotiated between Christopher and 
Assad -- and we're on the menu rather than at the table," said Ghassan Tueni, a 
former Lebanese U.N. ambassador and editor of the independent daily An Nahar. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Lebanese feel they're a dumping pit of all the conflicts and wars and 
revolutions of the past 25 years. They're the only country that wasn't 
officially at war with Israel, that was invaded, that has been the theater of 
any number of Arab wars, and yet today, while peace is being negotiated and 
probably realized on virtually every other front, the only place where there is 
no movement at all is Lebanon," Tueni said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Rafik Hariri has announced Lebanon's determination to continue 
supporting the military resistance against Israel's occupation of a portion of 
southern Lebanon but has otherwise, apparently at Damascus' behest, remained 
silent on the peace overtures evolving around him. 
</P>
<P>
 A peace settlement is vital if Lebanon wants to get on its feet again, and 
peace in Beirut won't come until Damascus is ready. 
</P>
<P>
 But privately, Lebanese officials are concerned that Israel may continue its 
divide-and-conquer strategy, seeking to drive a wedge in the Lebanon-Syria 
alliance by making Lebanon an offer it can't refuse. The Lebanese say both 
Israel and the United States have made no secret of the fact they believe 
Lebanon would be well-served by talking directly to Israeli negotiators and not 
merely through the Syrians. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Americans have been talking about separate peace negotiations for 
Lebanon, and it may be that the Israelis and the Americans are about to make a 
proposal to Lebanon. It could be a problem," said Beirut political analyst 
Adnan Iskander. 
</P>
<P>
 "Suppose the Israelis came with a proposal that Israel will withdraw from the 
territories, subject to certain controls on Hezbollah, U.N. soldiers, whatever. 
Can Lebanon refuse such a proposal?" 
</P>
<P>
 The fact is, Israel and the United States both know that the Lebanese army, 
barely deployed in south Lebanon, has no way of guaranteeing curbs on Hezbollah 
attacks against Israel without Syria's help. And Syria, which has 35,000 troops 
in Lebanon, isn't likely to disarm, or even redeploy, the fundamentalist 
militia unless it gets something in return. 
</P>
<P>
 Hezbollah, for its part, says it has no intention of backing out of its war 
with Israel until Jerusalem agrees to a full and unconditional withdrawal from 
Lebanese territory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't recognize the negotiations, and that's why we cannot pass judgment 
on the peace process. It will not achieve peace, and hopefully we will all live 
to see why," Hezbollah's political chief, Hussein Khalil, said in an interview 
at the organization's headquarters in Beirut's steamy southern suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Hezbollah leaders scoff at threats of a Syrian disarmament of their militia, 
the only remaining band of fanatic warriors still carrying weapons in Lebanon 
after the civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Syrians only made friends with us because we got to a point where we 
could prove ourselves on the ground. We are only fighting in order to liberate 
our country . . . and the Syrians cannot forbid us from executing this right," 
Khalil said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Lebanese are setting their sights on Lebanon's potential role as a 
trading powerhouse in a postwar Middle East as a way out. 
</P>
<P>
 In their view, Lebanon will have to accept a certain period of Syrian 
domination -- perhaps as much as a decade -- as the price for peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Americans would prefer Syria to stay to oversee Lebanon's signing of a 
treaty and the implementation, including the weakening of Hezbollah and making 
sure that all parties go along with the peace," said Paul E. Salem, director of 
the Lebanese Center for Policy Studies. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, he and others say, Syria may well encourage Lebanon to sign a peace 
treaty first, to bear the brunt of the political fallout and allow Syria the 
dignity of being the last to end the Arab war against Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Lebanon, in turn, would be allowed the political cover of Syrian domination. 
"Everybody will know it was not really the Lebanese who signed -- it was really 
the Syrians on our behalf. It helps deflect the political tension, and that's a 
factor for political stability," Salem said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have zero power, and so you might expect that in a zero-sum game we lose 
everything. But that's not reality," he said. "The negotiations are leading 
toward a new Middle East, a Middle East of contacts and relations and networks, 
not a carving up of states. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lebanon will remain a state. Technically, on paper, it will remain 
independent. And gradually, Lebanon will in fact become independent as Syrian 
influence recedes over six or seven years. In this new system, a country like 
Lebanon stands to gain a lot, because Lebanon is one of the only states ready 
now for the new system, in terms of having a political system that is open, a 
free economy, good relations with the West, experience in trading and markets." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Dirani home in the Bekaa Valley town of Ksarnaba, this optimistic talk 
falls on deaf ears. 
</P>
<P>
 Young Tiba, in a pink dress with a flowered barrette holding back her black 
curls, squirmed on her uncle's lap and pointed to the place on her forehead 
where a huge bruise had only begun to disappear. "We want Papa back," was the 
bulk of what she managed to say. 
</P>
<P>
 Dirani's brother, Hussein, stared grimly over the top of Tiba's head. "There 
is a saying we have in the resistance, that death is a habit and martyrdom is a 
joy," he said. "We will keep fighting the Zionist body until we annihilate it."

FEINSTEIN STILL AGONIZING OVER HEALTH CARE VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN TUMULTY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) flipped through the five slim folders on 
her lap, her characteristic composure gave way to exasperation. 
</P>
<P>
 "You try to figure it out!" she exclaimed during an interview in her office 
late last week. "Here's the Mainstream Plan; that's the way it comes. Here's 
Moynihan. Here's all I have from the Finance Committee. Here's Dole." 
</P>
<P>
 Each file contained a few pages summarizing one of the major alternatives that 
will be considered by the Senate when it begins its health care reform debate 
this week or next. The summaries offered few details, no explanation of the 
trade-offs involved, and, more important, no reliable estimates of what they 
would cost. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until yesterday, I didn't have all the plans, even," she added. "You mean, 
we're going to pass something and not know what the long-term costs or 
obligations are?" 
</P>
<P>
 In a matter of days, Feinstein will be asked to cast the most important vote 
of her Senate career: an overhaul of the nation's health care system that could 
be the biggest piece of social legislation since the Great Depression. 
</P>
<P>
 And as important as this decision is to her, it is no less so to President 
Clinton. This will be a battle where every vote counts, and Feinstein's, once 
thought secure, is increasingly in question. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue has preoccupied Congress for almost a year. Four committees produced 
their own versions of the bill, while a fifth gave up entirely. From these 
alternatives, the leaders of both houses are fashioning the legislation that 
they will take to their respective chambers. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the attention health reform has received, the vast majority in 
Congress are legislators such as Feinstein, who do not sit on the committees of 
jurisdiction and therefore have not had to stake out a firm position. They also 
have not been privy to the countless hours of hearings and debate that have 
taken place within the committees. 
</P>
<P>
 With little hard information to go on, Feinstein said she is wary both of the 
Clinton approach and Congress' hurry to pass a bill before the fall elections. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration is "quite genuinely trying to do something that's 
good for the nation. The question is, what sounds good today can be a lemon 10 
years later," she said. "In my opinion, the rush is a mistake, and I don't 
understand it." 
</P>
<P>
 Originally a co-sponsor of the massive health bill that President Clinton 
presented to Congress last fall, Feinstein quietly removed her name from the 
legislation in late May. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't a big deal," she said. "I just wanted the freedom to be able to 
look at other things." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, her possible defection set off alarm bells at the White House and 
among Senate leaders. Feinstein's was one of the votes they had counted on in 
what promises to be a closely fought battle on the Senate floor. Now no one, 
especially the senator herself, seems sure of what she will do. 
</P>
<P>
 But what Feinstein sees as a measure of caution, some Democrats say is a lack 
of political courage. "She's terrified, scared of her own shadow," said one 
senior Democratic aide. 
</P>
<P>
 The pressure is mounting. On Friday, Feinstein was summoned to the White House 
to meet privately with Clinton. First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton also has 
indicated that she would like a one-on-one chat with the senior senator from 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Her California colleague, Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer, is firmly in the 
President's camp. While she would like to see some additional relief for small 
business and more attention to concerns that are particularly California's -- 
such as the medical treatment of illegal immigrants -- Boxer said she has no 
doubt that the time for decision has arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing the Congress likes to do more than anything is nothing," Boxer 
said. "This is the moment, and we should act." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Michael Huffington (R-Santa Barbara), who is challenging Feinstein's bid 
for reelection, has ridiculed her shift on the Clinton plan, noting pointedly 
that it came as her once-commanding lead in the race was collapsing. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a political animal," Huffington said. "Right now, anything she does is 
looked at as being campaign-oriented." 
</P>
<P>
 And although Huffington said he has yet to see a health plan he can support, 
he contended that Feinstein's agonizing is just for show. "I still think she's 
for the Clinton plan, frankly." 
</P>
<P>
 In her rhetoric at least, Feinstein sounds less like Clinton than his chief 
foe, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.). 
</P>
<P>
 Dole, for instance, would agree with this idea: "I'm one who believes we need 
to take this incrementally, if possible." Or: "One of the things bankrupting 
the country is entitlements. This is another huge entitlement." 
</P>
<P>
 Universal coverage, Feinstein said, sounds good as a goal, but is probably one 
the nation cannot afford, particularly if it means everyone having the generous 
package of benefits envisioned under the Clinton bill. 
</P>
<P>
 She is skeptical too that Clinton's proposed price caps on health insurance 
premiums will actually succeed in holding down costs. And she described his 
bill's requirement that employers pay 80% of their workers' health insurance 
premiums -- its primary means of reaching universal coverage -- as "a Big 
Brother mandate." 
</P>
<P>
 Although she has not ruled out supporting some sort of employer mandate, 
Feinstein said she takes seriously the dire projections that Clinton's version 
could cost California as many as 500,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 In a fat binder, Feinstein keeps the individual complaints of California 
companies: a water-conditioning firm in Fullerton that contends the mandate 
would drive it out of business; a Buick dealer in Torrance warning that its 
health costs would rise by 41%; the San Diego Restaurant Assn., which says that 
its members could not support any mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The point is, in California, with an economy just emerging from a major, 
major recession, an 80-20 employer mandate, with the huge number of small 
businesses we have in the state struggling to stay alive, isn't going to fly 
with this senator," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Boxer, on the other hand, insists that studies show any jobs lost in one 
segment of the state's economy will be made up in another. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton plan is more popular in California than in many other states. Its 
main elements have won the support of the California Medical Assn. And a far 
more radical measure -- an initiative calling for a "single payer" system under 
which the government would foot the bill for health care -- will be on the 
November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 With an estimated 6 million of its residents now uninsured, California by some 
measures has more to gain than any other state from universal health coverage.

DISCORD PLAGUES MARRIAGE OF 2 TRANSIT AGENCIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORA ZAMICHOW, This article was reported by Henry Chu, Richard Simon, David 
Willman and Nora Zamichow. It was written by Zamichow.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Unveiled 16 months ago, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority was touted 
as a leaner, smarter bureaucracy -- one that would spend tax dollars more 
wisely and improve the accountability of politicians crafting a costly 
21st-Century transit system. 
</P>
<P>
 It would bring spiffy new rail service to neighborhoods throughout the Los 
Angeles Basin. It would build trolley lines and subways. It would ease traffic 
gridlock and make the air cleaner. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, this mega-transit agency has become mired in disputes and financial 
crisis. A strike, the first in 12 years, began today as mechanics failed to 
reach a contract agreement, and drivers' and clerks' unions agreed to honor 
their picket lines. A recent fare increase -- the first in six years -- caused 
a furor among the county's transit users. Construction of the city's subway -- 
meant to be the crown jewel in a brand-new system -- has been riddled with 
problems. And political turf wars, and budgetary constraints, have impeded the 
development of the ambitious $183-billion, 30-year transportation plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Once dubbed the biggest checkbook in town, the MTA discovered that the 
recession triggered a sharp decline in sales tax revenue. Officials suddenly 
faced a projected $20-billion shortfall, meaning that the blueprint of Los 
Angeles' transit future would have to be honed to more realistic proportions. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with these issues, MTA officials say they have been slow in fully 
merging the county's two former rival transit agencies, the Southern California 
Rapid Transit District and the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA, created by state legislation, was designed to eliminate duplication 
of services and the bickering between agencies. The merger, officials say, has 
resulted in a savings of tens of millions of dollars in the annual $2.9-billion 
budget and the elimination of 515 positions. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bitter rivalry still exists, fueled in part, officials say, by the 
longstanding debate over how to best serve the region's transportation needs: 
by rail or by bus, and what balance to strike between the two modes. 
</P>
<P>
 Bus proponents, including many former officials of the RTD bus agency, say the 
MTA must tend the needs of its 1.2 million bus passengers. Constructing the 
region's rail network has meant stripping funds from the bus system, they say, 
hurting the people who can least afford it. An MTA study indicates that 62% of 
bus riders come from households with incomes of $15,000 or less -- about a 
quarter as much as the average passenger on the Metrolink commuter trains. 
</P>
<P>
 Champions of rail, which include many former county Transportation Commission 
officials, contend that a network of trains, trolleys and subways is imperative 
for a modern transit system. They point out that county voters have passed 
sales tax increases to fund commuter rail construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The two organizations also differed in style. The former RTD was a no-frills 
operation housed on Skid Row. The now-defunct Transportation Commission, lodged 
in a sleek financial district high-rise, used to serve gourmet coffee and 
doughnuts to its staff. Employees of the MTA will remain in these separate 
offices until a new $145-million headquarters is complete in the fall of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's taking a lot longer than I thought it would to consolidate the two 
agencies to get over rivalries, pettiness and backbiting," said Assemblyman 
Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), architect of the merger legislation. "On top of that, 
we have a board that is much more interested in short-term political objectives 
than a long-term comprehensive transportation strategy. . . . Everyone has 
their little project for their own back yard or the special interest they are 
promoting." 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA, the nation's second-largest public transit system, is governed by 13 
board members, whose decisions influence the lives of millions of Los Angeles 
County residents. 
</P>
<P>
 They decide where to build rail lines, and where and when buses run. They 
award hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts -- 1 cent from every dollar 
of sales in the county flows through the agency. And this is not lost on the 
1,068 lobbyists who flock to meetings -- or roughly the same number as are 
registered at the state Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's monthly sessions sometimes take on the anything-goes atmosphere of 
a political carnival, with lobbyists and gadflies trumpeting their causes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This agency is supposed to be a regional transportation agency," said Los 
Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky. "It runs more like a local city 
council with parochial city concerns. Decisions are made like justice was 
enforced in the wild, wild West -- in a shoot-from-the-hip fashion." 
</P>
<P>
 Said County Supervisor Ed Edelman, MTA chairman: "It's a bureaucratic 
nightmare. It's a very difficult animal to try to control and get moving in the 
right direction." 
</P>
<P>
 Political rivalries flourish and grudges linger. Some MTA board members, such 
as County Supervisor Gloria Molina and Los Angeles City Councilman Richard 
Alatorre, rarely speak to each other. The representatives of the outlying 
cities are always wary about losing money to the more politically powerful city 
of Los Angeles, whose mayor, Richard Riordan, sits on the MTA board and 
controls three other seats. 
</P>
<P>
 "People seem to be looking after their own turf rather than the region," said 
a community activist. "The mission of the agency has gotten a little bit lost." 
</P>
<P>
 The result, critics say, is that there has been no change in controversial 
transit policies that will give Los Angeles, for example, an $825-million Green 
Line trolley that stops 1 1/2 miles short of the city's airport. And the San 
Fernando Valley is no closer to getting a rail line than it was several years 
ago under the RTD and Transportation Commission, although officials say that is 
because Valley residents cannot agree on the route and technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were not doing transportation planning effectively, efficiently and 
expeditiously, and we're not doing it now," said Ben Reznik, past board 
chairman of the Valley Industry and Commerce Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA board also has defied the recommendations of its own chief executive 
officer, Franklin White. Last Wednesday, for example, nine of the MTA's 13 
board members rejected White's pleas and voted to spend $123 million -- twice 
what White proposed -- on the planned Pasadena rail line. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the vote, White pointed out that the agency had no funds for the 
project, which is expected to cost $850 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "This organization is broke," he said. "Next year you will not have the money 
to continue the construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "We ought to get back to the sensible policy of spending, which is: Don't 
spend money you don't have." 
</P>
<P>
 In describing the vote on the Pasadena line, MTA board member James Cragin, a 
Gardena city councilman who opposed the expenditure, said: "It reminded me of a 
bunch of hogs running to the trough that doesn't have too many husks left. . . 
. Special interests have taken over the operation of the MTA." 
</P>
<P>
 White's position on the Pasadena line and other projects has often placed him 
at odds with one of the MTA's most powerful board members -- Alatorre, who 
recently stepped down as the agency's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Alatorre has repeatedly voiced frustration at White's insistence on 
re-evaluating the merits of projects that were promised -- but not funded -- by 
the now-defunct county Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "He always has enjoyed trying to revisit things instead of carrying out the 
mandate of the board," Alatorre said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 White countered that he would be derelict if he did not review the worthiness 
of every project. "The 30-year plan that the (Transportation Commission) 
developed was based on a set of financial assumptions which bear no resemblance 
to the fiscal realities in 1994," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 White would like to withhold major funding for proposals such as the Pasadena 
line until his staff completes a detailed assessment this fall of the former 
commission's 30-year plan. 
</P>
<P>
 He also has battled Alatorre and Metro Rail contractors over how best to 
manage the quality and costs of rail construction, which have been under 
investigation by the FBI and the U.S. Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the projects being examined is the Red Line subway, which was built 
before the creation of the MTA. The Times found that parts of the Downtown 
subway were built with concrete walls thinner than specified and that the 
tunnels now have water and gas leaking into them. 
</P>
<P>
 White has confronted contractors and the MTA's consultants over the issue of 
construction quality. Following The Times' accounts last year, he established a 
panel of outside specialists, who recommended extensive repairs to the tunnels. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite these problems, Alatorre has backed a proposal to increase the 
independence of the MTA's rail staff and an advisory board of directors, called 
the Rail Construction Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 White responded in May by calling for dissolving the RCC board and argued that 
increasing the RCC's powers would further fragment the MTA. 
</P>
<P>
 White's supporters say they want him to do more to rein in quality problems 
and costs of construction, construction management and design-engineering. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we've addressed those (types of) problems yet," said Marvin L. 
Holen, an MTA appointee. "The lowering of expectations, with respect to the 
budget, has consumed management's time and energies." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the promise of the MTA was more thoughtful management and improved 
service, some say benefits have yet to trickle down to the people who form the 
backbone of the agency's customer base: 1.2 million daily bus riders, who this 
month were hit with the first fare increase in six years. Beginning Sept. 1, 
the cost of a basic fare will climb 23% -- from $1.10 to $1.35 -- and regular 
monthly passes, essential to many indigent passengers, will no longer be sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Some experts say the 16-month-old merger has actually worked against the bus 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bus constituency lost its voice in this merger," said James Moore, 
associate professor of urban planning and co-director of USC's Center for 
Advanced Transportation Technology. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the MTA has failed to stem the steady decline in bus service over 
the last decade. Ridership has dropped 25% since 1985 -- when fares were 50 
cents. A hundred fewer buses travel the streets today, and many popular lines 
through the central city remain packed with elbow-to-elbow crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles is still leading the nation in passenger load and the number of 
(standing passengers)," Moore said. "We're moving a lot of people, but we've 
got 'em packed in like sardines." 
</P>
<P>
 White denied that bus service is a lower priority. "Remember, the largest 
single component of our employees are those who come from the prior RTD," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's the evidence that (the bus system is) taking the back seat? Most 
people offer the evidence that we've raised the fares," White said. "The fact 
of the matter is, there's never any free lunch." 
</P>
<P>
 He also said the new bus fares will still be comparable with metropolitan 
transit systems nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Safety remains a key concern for riders. Many are irked that the MTA spends 20 
times more for security on rail lines than on buses, even though bus passengers 
outnumber rail passengers 15 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics predict that worsening conditions aboard buses, combined with fare 
increases and service reductions, will further erode ridership. The MTA itself 
expects the latest round of fare increases to chase away another 80,000 bus 
customers a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a vicious cycle," said Chris Niles of the Labor/Community Strategy 
Center, a government watchdog group. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts also contend that the merger, by centralizing operations, has 
rendered the bus system unresponsive to rider demands, preventing innovations. 
The last overhaul of bus routes was a decade ago. Small changes to scheduling 
can take more than a year to implement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of the routes do not serve today's needs," said Jonathan Richmond, who 
teaches transportation planning at UCLA. "You need to reorient many of the 
lines to serve local communities better. . . . Buses go along the main streets 
like Vermont, but we need buses to go into the communities and pick people up 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say it is particularly difficult for cities with new rail lines to 
continue to meet the needs of bus passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal study in 1989 found that of the eight cities that got new rail lines 
within the past 20 years, none could claim unqualified success. Five cities 
reported gains in transit use, but only at significantly greater costs per 
passenger. Overall ridership fell in three cities that scaled back bus service 
to help pay for the new rail projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not to say that rail never works," said Martin Wachs, an urban planning 
professor at UCLA. "In Hong Kong it may be the right choice. In Sao Paulo, it 
may be the right choice. Even in New York, some limited expansions of the rail 
systems may be better than the buses. 
</P>
<P>
 "But in Los Angeles, in more corridors than not, various forms of bus 
transportation prove to be more cost-effective than rail. We have for political 
reasons opted for rail instead of bus." 
</P>
<P>
 The Blue Line trolley, traveling between Long Beach and Los Angeles, currently 
is the workhorse of the MTA's rail program with 37,800 passengers a day. But 
even it commands more than 2 1/2 times the public subsidy per trip than the 
average bus ride ($3.15 versus $1.16). And two-thirds of Blue Line riders are 
"bus refugees," not new transit users who have been pulled out of their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 White, however, said the agency would be shortsighted if it did not consider 
Los Angeles' needs for the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get asked to do two things in this organization. One is to provide 
transportation to today's riders, hopefully with decent, clean, safe service," 
White said. "But we also have to plan for the L.A. of tomorrow." 
</P>

as contract talks ended. B1 Taking a Ride 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a look at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, formed April 1, 
1993, by the merging of Los Angeles' two transportation agencies: the Southern 
California Rapid Transit District and the Los Angeles County Transportation 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 THE PLAYERS: The MTA is governed by a 13-member board, which includes five Los 
Angeles County supervisors, Mayor Richard Riordan and three other L.A. city 
appointees and four representatives from outlying cities. The agency is headed 
by Franklin White, the chief executive officer, selected by the board. 
</P>
<P>
 THE IMPACT: With a $2.9 billion budget, the agency operates the nation's 
second largest bus system, builds rail projects and chooses train and bus 
routes. The MTA also funds car-pool lanes, Metrolink commuter trains, 
dial-a-ride services and allocates money to communities for local shuttles. 
</P>
<P>
 RIDERSHIP: The MTA oversees the buses, trains and trolleys that serve more 
than 1 million passengers every day. In recent years, the agency has increased 
its focus on rail, opening the Blue Line trolley, running between Long Beach 
and downtown Los Angeles, and the Red Line subway.

THE HUBER MUDER CASE; ARIZONA AUTHORITIES AWAITING O.C. LAB RESULTS IN HUBER 
MURDER CASE; INVESTIGATION: MATCHING OF BLOOD WITH SAMPLE TAKEN FROM LAGUNA 
HILLS STORAGE FACILITY COULD HELP DETERMINE WHICH STATE WILL HAVE JURISDICTION. 
</P>

<P>
 Arizona investigators have put off forensic tests while they await the results 
of a critical blood analysis that could help establish whether 23-year-old 
waitress Denise Huber was killed in Orange County or in Arizona, where her body 
was discovered in a freezer chest. 
</P>
<P>
 The blood test could help settle the jurisdictional debate over which state -- 
California or Arizona -- should try John J. Famalaro, the painting contractor 
accused of killing Huber, who vanished three years ago from her crippled car 
along the Corona del Mar freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Yavapai County Sheriff's Lt. Scott Mascher said the unresolved 
jurisdiction matter has prompted Arizona authorities to hold up forensic 
testing, including laboratory work needed to determine whether Huber was 
sexually assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
 Mascher said it was unreasonable and costly to conduct the tests in Arizona if 
the Huber murder trial is eventually shifted to Orange County. Local experts 
would then be expected to travel to Southern California for a trial and 
possibly other hearings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It won't hurt us if we slowly wind down on the forensics, until we determine 
whose jurisdiction it's in," Mascher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona officials expected the blood test to be completed in an Orange County 
crime lab as early as today. 
</P>
<P>
 Lab technicians were trying to determine whether blood from Huber's frozen 
body matches a substance taken from a Laguna Hills storage facility. At the 
time of Huber's disappearance, Famalaro lived in the warehouse, a spacious 
building with wide windows that Sunday were covered with black fabric. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro's defense attorney, Thomas K. Kelly, said Sunday that the blood 
testing would effectively decide the question about where the case would be 
prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the blood in the storage facility matches that of the victim, it would be 
tough to make an argument to try the case in Arizona," Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense attorney said he was awaiting transcripts of Yavapai County Grand 
Jury proceedings to possibly challenge the Arizona murder indictment, should he 
determine that authorities had sufficient evidence to indicate that the death 
occurred in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the prosecution has a difficult case to prove here," Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Costa Mesa Police Department, which is handling the Orange County end of 
the murder probe, declined to comment on the blood test, referring all 
questions on Sunday to the Yavapai County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have agreed that all of the agencies involved are going to allow only 
Yavapai to make statements," said Lt. Ron Smith of the Costa Mesa Police 
Department. "We agree with everything they say, and they have our full 
cooperation." 
</P>
<P>
 Late last week, Dr. Richard Fukumoto, a forensic specialist for the Orange 
County coroner's office, was barred from viewing Huber's body in Arizona. He 
flew back to California on Friday after waiting nearly four hours for 
permission to examine the body. In turning down his request, Arizona officials 
said they had jurisdiction over the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Mascher predicted that the nagging question of territory will be decided by 
week's end. The determining factor could be a match between Huber's blood and 
evidence from the Laguna Hills storage facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Once investigators and prosecutors determine where the case will be tried, 
that state's laboratory will make tests involving the body, a bloodstained 
crowbar and other objects from Famalaro's Arizona home. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Arizona investigators obtained a third search warrant after 
Orange County detectives asked that Famalaro's house be searched for specific 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've asked for a few different things," Mascher said, declining to 
elaborate. "It's a situation like, 'Hey, you guys may want to go back and look 
for this.' Stuff that they realize may be pertinent." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Mascher said local investigators will be checking the flotsam 
of Famalaro's life -- reading his diaries and newspaper clippings, examining 
his videos and audio tapes. He often saved scraps of cartoons, said Mascher. 
</P>
<P>
 "This guy was such a pack rat," he said. "It's really unbelievable what this 
guy has saved and collected." 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona investigators continue to search for other victims, but so far they 
have not turned up any. Authorities still have some names of women they plan to 
search for. A previous hunt for 11 other women whose names turned up in 
Famalaro's home revealed that all were alive and well. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no other suspects, no other victims at this time," Mascher said. 
"Given some of the stuff we've found, some of the evidence we've come across, 
(the possibility of more victims) was something that was always in the back of 
our heads, and we're still looking at it." 
</P>
<P>
 Mascher said he is most eager to learn the results of the forensic tests. A 
key mystery is what happened to Huber between the time of her disappearance and 
the day one week later when Famalaro purchased the freezer from Montgomery 
Ward. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of different theories we're trying to check out," Mascher said. 
"Was she kept alive? Was she killed right away? We need to look at all of 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Mascher said it was probably random chance that led Famalaro to Huber. There 
is no sign that Famalaro was stalking Huber or that he even knew her, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too bad she broke down on the side of the road," he said.

'THAT'S YOUR MURDER,' TOWN TELLS CALIFORNIA; LIFESTYLE: MANY IN PRESCOTT, 
ARIZ., ALREADY WARY OF REFUGEES FROM THE GOLDEN STATE, TURN NASTY BECAUSE OF A 
GRISLY SLAYING WITH ROOTS IN THE SOUTHLAND.

 Hotel desk clerk Katie Wintrol sees it nearly every day. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving vans, station wagons, pickups -- all overloaded with furniture, 
housewares, parents and kids -- pull into the Best Western for a night or two 
of lodging before the families put down roots in this picturesque mountain 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 The only problem, Wintrol says, is that most of the vehicles in her lot are 
coming from the same place: California. 
</P>
<P>
 "People here just hate Californians," she said. "People are worried." 
</P>
<P>
 The sentiment, like the aversions shared by Seattle and Portland, has been 
part of this town's undercurrent for years. But nothing in recent months has 
done more to rekindle it than the discovery of Denise Huber's frozen body in 
the back of a stolen rental truck parked in the driveway of a former 
Californian in nearby Dewey. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's your murder and you should take it back," bartender Alan Buller barked 
recently to a California visitor in Prescott's famed Whiskey Row. "That guy 
just hauled her over here from California. We have our own troubles here, but 
killing people and putting them in a freezer is something else." 
</P>
<P>
 One local judge recalled sharing the road with such a newcomer on the way home 
from a trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like something right out of the 'Beverly Hillbillies,' " he said of 
the ramshackle vehicle. "There were clothes hanging out the back. I remember 
thinking, please don't make the turn at Prescott. Please don't make the turn at 
Prescott." 
</P>
<P>
 It turned. 
</P>
<P>
 Prescott's mayor, a part-time Hollywood actor, dismisses such rumblings as "a 
load of crap from selfish people." 
</P>
<P>
 Daiton Rutkowski, who belts out Jimmy Buffett tunes as he mixes milkshakes at 
his "De Ja Vu" soda fountain, said local no-growth advocates in particular have 
seized on the sensational slaying to sound the alarm against further migration, 
especially from California. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole thing has been overblown," Rutkowski said. "This could have 
happened anywhere. Hell, we (Prescott) had a city councilman stand up during a 
public meeting and shoot himself dead. You can't blame that on California." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, we are getting a lot of people in from California, but these are 
wonderfully talented, upper-class people," he said. "They fit right in here." 
</P>
<P>
 The popular Rutkowski may be the only mayor in 25 years to have won reelection 
here, but not all of his constituents share these views. 
</P>
<P>
 From his courthouse office, Yavapai County Atty. Charles R. Hastings has 
noticed a change that disturbs him. "We're just experiencing a tremendous 
increase in all kinds of crimes, and there are a lot of people moving here from 
California." 
</P>
<P>
 While Hastings won't come right out and say it, others are downright blunt in 
assessing how the influx is changing a laid-back lifestyle in the clean air and 
bright sun. 
</P>
<P>
 To locals -- many of them transplanted Californians themselves -- the Golden 
State has become synonymous with rioting, bad cops, skyrocketing real estate, 
gridlock and crime. Especially crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Popular bumper stickers carry a stinging message: "Prescott used to be a nice 
place to live -- until it became a suburb of California" and "Welcome to 
Prescott, Calif." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the state's flagship newspaper leaves no question about how Arizonans 
regard their neighbors to the west. Reporting the discovery of Huber's body and 
the arrest of John J. Famalaro, the Arizona Republic carried the headlines: 
"Area gets California's ugliness, too" and "California's ugly side robs area's 
innocence." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Kantak came from Detroit to Prescott -- pronounced "PRESkitt" by the 
locals -- in the late 1970s, more than enough time to be considered a native by 
local standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Kantak generally welcomes outsiders, but is soon disappointed with those who 
want to remake the place, uttering remarks such as, "This isn't the way we used 
to do it back in California." 
</P>
<P>
 "Good ideas are always welcome, but give us a break," said Kantak, who lives 
just outside of town. Out his way, new arrivals are now talking about street 
lights. "Give a small-town atmosphere a chance," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some locals make it clear that they wouldn't mind having some major roads into 
town blocked completely. 
</P>
<P>
 Commenting on a recent Money magazine article naming Prescott the country's 
No. 1 place to retire, one resident said only half-jokingly, "That was one of 
the worst things ever to happen to Prescott." 
</P>
<P>
 But if the no-growthers dislike even migrant retirees and professionals from 
the Golden State, others see a different menace. 
</P>
<P>
 After a recent trip to California, Prescott Peace Justice Robert W. Kuebler 
Jr. created a gang suppression task force. Only 95 known gang members are in 
the area, according to sheriff's records, but authorities feel that many have 
ties to Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see it a lot with people (in court)," Kuebler said. "I look at their 
backgrounds and see they're from California or from somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Yavapai County Administrator Jim Holst: "Don't get us wrong. We're not 
against growth and people who want to come here and join our community. But we 
just can't let this turn into another Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Rutkowski said such comparisons can't be supported -- yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can tell you honestly that I don't feel much difference in walking the 
streets here when there were 6,000 people back in the 1940s than I do today 
with 30,000," the Prescott native said. "If people don't change, they become 
boors. It's the same thing with cities and towns. If people want some peace and 
quiet, they can go down the road." 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor admits to some worry over a planned 1,000-unit housing development, 
but is confident that the city is prepared for that growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Too much has been made of the negative California associations since the 
discovery of Huber's body, the mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
 "An idiot goes nuts, OK. It happens. The guy could just as easily been from 
Missouri. They have weird people there too, you know. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is still the greatest place on earth," Rutkowski said, rapping his 
knuckle on the wooden bar at the De Ja Vu. "Right here."

CHOLERA KILLS 40 IN YEMEN; 150 ILL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cholera has killed at least 40 people in Aden, where water shortages after the 
two-month civil war have been made worse by looters who damaged pumping 
equipment, medical experts said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital officials said 150 other cholera cases have been recorded since 
Thursday, two weeks after northern forces pushed southern secessionists out of 
Aden. 
</P>
<P>
 Cholera, transmitted by infected feces, spreads rapidly and can kill its 
victims within hours. More people will be stricken if water service is not 
restored and piles of garbage and debris left from the war are not cleaned up, 
the officials said.

SHIFT SEEN IN ADMINISTRATION'S ASIA POLICIES; PRIORITIES: U.S. TAKES A LESS 
AGGRESSIVE STANCE ON HUMAN RIGHTS, TRADE ISSUES. THE OUTLINED OBJECTIVES HAVE 
BEEN PUT ON HOLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When President Clinton and Secretary of State Warren Christopher took office, 
they announced they would redirect U.S. foreign policy to give top emphasis to 
Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 But 18 months into Clinton's presidency, the Administration is shifting its 
attention elsewhere as its relationship with Asia becomes more a detriment than 
a help to Clinton's political fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration also is quietly reshaping U.S. policy toward Asia in a way 
that de-emphasizes the principal goals -- such as improving human rights and 
reducing the trade deficit with Japan -- that Clinton outlined when he took 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, the effect is a much less assertive -- and, critics say, a much 
weaker -- policy in Asia that is less confrontational toward the established 
order there. 
</P>
<P>
 Having discovered that he lacks the ability to make quick, dramatic changes in 
America's ties with the major Asian powers, Clinton seems to be lowering his 
sights and concentrating on other parts of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every Administration comes to power feeling it has to change something. And 
often, what they feel they have to change doesn't need to be changed," said 
former U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines Nicholas Platt, now president of the 
private, nonprofit Asia Society. "The fact that they are going back to (former 
President George) Bush's policy toward Asia doesn't make them look good. But it 
doesn't make me feel bad." 
</P>
<P>
 When the Assn. of Southeast Asian Nations meets in Bangkok, Thailand, this 
week for its first conference on regional security, the secretary of state will 
be back in Washington working on the Middle East, attending the White House 
meeting between Jordan's King Hussein and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott will stand in for Christopher at the 
Thailand meeting -- characterized as "historic" by U.S. officials -- which will 
also be attended by the Russian and Chinese foreign ministers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talked to him (Christopher) personally. He really was agonized about this," 
Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord said in an interview last week. "And 
it's disappointing. There's no way around that. Having said that, Strobe 
Talbott is an important figure in his own right. He's very close to the 
President. He's obviously highly respected and articulate." 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, former Secretary of State James A. Baker III once raised eyebrows 
by wondering aloud whether he could skip one of ASEAN's annual summer meetings. 
The sessions require an arduous and time-consuming trip across the Pacific, but 
in the end, Baker always felt obliged to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 During Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign and in Christopher's confirmation 
hearings as secretary of state, the two men placed a strong emphasis on the 
importance of reducing the trade deficit with Japan and improving human rights 
in China. Yet over the past 18 months, these objectives have not been achieved. 
</P>
<P>
 The imbalance with Japan is still running at about $60 billion a year, a level 
that Clinton and his top aides branded unacceptable. And the Administration has 
been unable to persuade Japan to negotiate the trade agreements envisioned when 
the President went to Tokyo a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it takes two governments to make a trade deal. U.S. officials now 
point to the past year's political upheaval in Tokyo as a prime cause for the 
inability to make economic progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "No strategy is going to work miracles when they (the Japanese) have four or 
five governments in the course of a year," Lord said. "We really don't feel we 
had a fair test of our approach on the economic issues because of the constant 
changing of the Japanese political leadership." 
</P>
<P>
 But critics say Clinton Administration officials made a strategic error by 
pinning too much of their hopes on the ability of Japan's political leadership 
to effect change. 
</P>
<P>
 "They need to understand that the Japanese prime minister is never able to do 
anything," said Chalmers Johnson, UC San Diego professor emeritus and a veteran 
scholar on Japan. "The Japanese government is a puppet, and they need to talk 
to the puppeteers" -- the career bureaucrats who call the shots for elected 
officials and who have been severely criticized by the Clinton Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "In attacking the Japanese bureaucrats, they displayed unbelievable political 
naivete," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 On human rights, the situation has in some ways become worse, not better. 
Clinton tried linking the renewal of China's trade benefits to improvements in 
human rights, but in May he was forced to back off and renew the benefits after 
admitting progress had been minimal. 
</P>
<P>
 This appears to have emboldened the Chinese leadership into thinking it can 
arrest or imprison its citizens without fear of penalty from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 After 14 years in jail, a prominent Chinese dissident, Wei Jingsheng, was 
freed in September, at a time when Beijing was trying (unsuccessfully, as it 
turned out) to land the Olympic Games for the year 2000. But he was thrown back 
into prison early this year after he met with Clinton's assistant secretary of 
state for human rights, John Shattuck, and he remains there today with the 
charges against him still unspecified. 
</P>
<P>
 Since its decision in May to renew China's trade benefits, the Clinton 
Administration has not mentioned Wei's name publicly. 
</P>
<P>
 Human rights groups tried to pressure the Administration into taking up Wei's 
case at the recent Group of Seven summit of industrialized nations in Naples, 
Italy, hoping for a collective statement on Wei's behalf. But White House 
officials denied the request. 
</P>
<P>
 "From our point of view, this is the worst-case scenario, that the Chinese 
feel there is no price to be paid whatsoever for continued political repression 
in the name of guaranteeing social stability," said Mike Jendrzejczyk, the 
Washington director of Human Rights Watch/Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials say they have raised Wei's case in private talks with their 
Chinese counterparts. Clinton and his aides also insist that they are still 
trying to work on human rights improvements and assert that the 
Administration's China policy should be judged by yardsticks other than human 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't buy the premise of believing that you're going to identify the most 
difficult, tough problems and then judge everything by whether we solve them," 
Lord said. "We will keep after them. But I would point out that there are other 
goals besides human rights." 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's about-face on China has embittered former U.S. officials 
who remember well how Clinton, at the 1992 Democratic Convention, lambasted the 
Bush Administration for "coddling dictators" in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're reversing themselves and restoring a policy that they savaged (Bush 
National Security Adviser Brent) Scowcroft for. And now they're trying to 
present it as a great strategic breakthrough," said James R. Lilley, former 
U.S. ambassador to China. "They can't hide the record of what they stood for 
then and what they stand for now." 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly, the initiative on China policy within the Administration is 
moving to the Defense Department, which has been seeking to upgrade U.S. 
military ties with the People's Liberation Army. 
</P>
<P>
 Adm. Charles R. Larson, commander of U.S. forces in the Pacific, recently 
visited Beijing. The PLA's deputy chief of staff will come to Washington in 
August, and Defense Secretary William J. Perry is expected to travel to Beijing 
this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Human rights groups worry that the Administration's turnabout on China 
foreshadows an even broader retreat for U.S. efforts to promote human rights 
and democracy elsewhere in Asia, such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and 
Myanmar (formerly Burma). 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Clinton issued a strong statement in support of Aung San Suu Kyi, 
the Nobel Peace Prize winner who has been kept under house arrest by military 
officials in Myanmar for five years. "This issue remains a priority for my 
Administration," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 But his Administration seems less willing than ever before to back up such 
statements with tough actions. 
</P>
<P>
 "While important symbolically, calling for Aung San Suu Kyi's release is 
cost-free," Jendrzejczyk said. "That's what human rights has been relegated to 
in Asia. Rhetoric is cheap." 
</P>
<P>
 To some extent, the Administration has been obliged to tone down its policies 
toward China and Japan to win support for its stance against North Korea's 
suspected nuclear weapons program. "We (the United States and China) have 
worked well together on Korea," Lord said. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials are now working hard for change in American policy toward 
smaller countries in the region. For example, Lord has spearheaded improvements 
in ties with Vietnam and New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Administration is also finding that its original human rights and 
trade goals are not so easy to achieve because America's clout in Asia is 
diminishing. 
</P>
<P>
 The state-controlled Chinese news magazine Liaowang gloated last month that 
the policy announced by National Security Adviser Anthony Lake last fall of 
"enlarging" democratic forces around the world had failed. "The U.S. strength 
is not equal to its ambition to seek sole global hegemony," the publication 
said.

SINN FEIN MAKES NO PROMISES ON BRITAIN'S PEACE PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sinn Fein, the political arm of the Irish Republican Army, gave its first 
formal reply to December's Anglo-Irish peace plan Sunday but made no reference 
to a cease-fire in Northern Ireland or ending terrorist violence. 
</P>
<P>
 In closing a party conference in the Irish Republic's County Donegal, Sinn 
Fein leader Gerry Adams declared, "The declaration does not deal adequately 
with some of the core issues, and this is crucial. 
</P>
<P>
 "The declaration is a step in the peace process -- not a solution. We must 
look forward to the next steps." 
</P>
<P>
 December's Downing Street Declaration offered Sinn Fein a seat at the peace 
table if the IRA observes a three-month cease-fire in the province -- which has 
been racked by sectarian violence for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopes had been raised in some quarters that Sinn Fein and Adams might respond 
positively to get peace talks moving; the party and IRA members had been 
"studying" the declaration for seven months. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams told the 800 conference delegates that the IRA would have to make up its 
own mind on the future conduct of the armed campaign against British 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not the IRA," Adams said, "but we have helped to formulate proposals 
which have been enough to move the IRA publicly to say that if the political 
will exists it could provide the basis for peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Adams simply restated previous positions, saying he would like to see a 
"negotiated settlement" so the "people of Ireland can leave conflict behind us 
and build a lasting peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Adams and the IRA insist that the stated goal in negotiations be a united 
Ireland, while the British government says that the future of Ulster still 
rests with a majority of the residents -- and that majority remains Protestant 
unionist. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sinn Fein meeting seemed to retard any progress in the peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
 David Winnick, a Labor member of Parliament and vice chairman of the 
British-Irish Parliamentary Body, said Sunday night that he was "bitterly 
disappointed" by Sinn Fein's response to the Downing Street Declaration. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will obviously mean continued terrorist violence both by the IRA and the 
loyalist murder gangs carrying out tit-for-tat killings," Winnick said.

WASHINGTON OUTLOOK: IMBALANCE OF POWER DEFINES STRUGGLE OVER HEALTH CARE; 
CLINTON NEEDS HELP OF BROAD-BASED MOVEMENTS LIKE LABOR, CIVIL RIGHTS TO COUNTER 
CONSERVATIVE GAINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD BROWNSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If Jimmy Carter had passed labor law reform in 1978, Bill Clinton might have a 
better chance of passing health care reform in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Not many in the Clinton Administration understand that connection, or its 
implication for their agenda. But if Carter had broken the conservative 
filibuster that blocked labor law reform 16 years ago last month, the union 
movement would represent a larger share of the work force today. With more 
workers, the unions would have more clout to invest in the fight for Clinton's 
health care reform when it faces the inevitable conservative filibuster later 
this year in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you had, for instance, a labor movement representing 30% to 35% of the 
(private sector) labor force instead of 12%, that kind of base would be a much 
more potent force in the health care debate, as well as so many other things 
the Administration wants to do," said one ranking Administration official 
sympathetic to this viewpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 As both candidate and President, Clinton has rightly sought to demonstrate his 
independence from labor and other Democratic constituency groups. But those 
well-publicized disputes with labor over the North American Free Trade 
Agreement, or with civil rights organizations over the proposed Racial Justice 
Act, obscure a larger truth. On most issues, especially bread-and-butter 
economic concerns, those groups push in the same direction as a Democratic 
President. On Capitol Hill, he needs them as a counterweight to business and 
the ideological lobbies hostile to activist government. 
</P>
<P>
 The left's weakness leaves Clinton in an exposed position. On almost all 
issues -- from health care to domestic spending -- Clinton has been first over 
the hill, leading the charge for government to take on new responsibilities. 
But it reverses the pattern of history for the President to take the point. In 
previous eras of government activism, the driving force has been not the 
President but broad-based social movements whose insistent demands forced 
Washington to respond. 
</P>
<P>
 Today there's nothing comparable to the progressive and Populist movements at 
the turn of the century that furrowed the ground for the pure food and drug 
acts and the progressive income tax; the incipient labor movement and 
share-the-wealth grass-roots uprisings led by Huey P. Long and Francis V. 
Townsend that helped inspire the Social Security Act in 1935, or the civil 
rights and consumer movements that powered through the anti-discrimination and 
environmental laws that cascaded out of Congress from 1964 through 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question after Clinton's election was what kind of new force was going to 
emerge to push the elected officials and the President, and that hasn't 
happened at any level," one union official says. "The right is on the 
ascendancy, the business community is on the ascendancy, but the progressive 
community is not." 
</P>
<P>
 That imbalance has defined the lobbying struggle over health care. So far the 
decisive thrusts have been the health insurance industry's "Harry and Louise" 
TV ads and the National Federation of Independent Business' ferocious 
mobilization against employer mandates. 
</P>
<P>
 On paper, the forces behind universal health care coverage are formidable: the 
47 organizations allied in the Health Care Reform Project, an umbrella lobbying 
group that claims 65 million members. Last week, the AFL-CIO, the American 
Assn. of Retired Persons and the American Medical Assn. joined for a new push 
behind universal insurance coverage. But they have a lot of ground to make up. 
</P>
<P>
 As in any faltering campaign, that's provoked a lot of finger-pointing. The 
groups blame the White House for an unsteady legislative and communication 
strategy; some labor officials insist it's difficult to motivate the 
rank-and-file behind a President who crossed them on NAFTA and didn't exert 
much energy when the anti-strikebreaker bill quietly died earlier this month in 
the Senate. The White House, and many reform proponents on Capitol Hill, slap 
the groups for focusing too much on their own parochial interests and not 
enough on generating support for an overall package. 
</P>
<P>
 That narrowness of vision points to the left's larger problem. Since the early 
1970s, the left's capacity to mobilize a mass movement has withered; today, 
civil rights groups, consumer organizations and organized labor function more 
as Washington pressure groups than as true conduits to the grass roots. They've 
become more adept at finessing the regulatory process and filing lawsuits than 
reaching a broad public audience. "What's happened to these interest groups is 
what happened to academics: They started to speak only to themselves," one 
senior White House official says. 
</P>
<P>
 Those groups won't fully solve their problems until they rethink their methods 
and agendas. But some in the Administration hope the imbalance in the health 
care fight prompts Clinton to think about what government can do to help renew 
the groups aligned with Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin D. Roosevelt offers the most successful precedent in this century for 
that kind of strategic thinking: By signing the National Labor Relations Act 
that established workers' right to collective bargaining, he jump-started the 
labor movement, which then anchored the Democratic majority for the next 30 
years. Ronald Reagan displayed a similar sense by irrigating Republican 
territories in the South and West with rivers of defense spending. 
</P>
<P>
 There's not as much Clinton can do to directly bolster Democratic-leaning 
groups like consumer organizations or civil rights groups. At most, says one 
White House official, reform of voter registration and campaign finance laws 
can indirectly boost such groups by diminishing the influence of money in 
elections, and increasing the importance of grass-roots organizing. 
</P>
<P>
 For those Democrats interested in an institution-building strategy, the real 
question is whether Clinton can (or should) try to resuscitate labor. There are 
many reasons for labor's long slide over the past 40 years, including its own 
internal ossification, but one key factor has been the inability of the labor 
laws to guarantee a fair fight in organizing campaigns: Since the early 1950s, 
the number of unfair labor practice charges annually filed against employers 
has increased sixfold, while the percentage of union victories in certification 
elections has dropped from about 70% to just under 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 Later this year, an Administration-appointed commission led by former Labor 
Secretary John T. Dunlop is expected to propose labor law reforms that would 
toughen enforcement against businesses that use illegal practices -- such as 
firing workers -- to discourage organizing. Those recommendations will force 
Clinton to confront the basic issue: Would Democrats and the average Americans 
they aim to represent be better off with a stronger labor movement? 
</P>
<P>
 Former Democratic presidential candidates Hubert H. Humphrey or Walter F. 
Mondale would have answered that question without hesitation. But some around 
Clinton are uncertain of organized labor's place in a "New Democrat" Party, or 
for that matter a new workplace of flexible production and joint 
worker-management committees. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor, civil rights and consumer groups harbor comparable doubts about whether 
Clinton is the best the left can hope for in the Oval Office. Each side in this 
argument has legitimate grievances with the other. But the lopsided fight over 
health care suggests that in a fundamentally conservative climate, the first 
priority for Clinton and the Democratic base should be finding ways to more 
effectively bolster each other.

the Progressive Era in the 1990s and the 1910s, the New Deal in the '30s and

responsibilities came from broad-based social movements.

<TEXT>
<P>
 A cultural leader of the Chumash Indians was arrested after he confessed to 
killing his longtime companion, sheriff's officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonio Pina Romero Sr. was booked for investigation of murder and was being 
held without bail Sunday at the county jail in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero, 72, went to a sheriff's substation Friday night and told deputies he 
had just shot Linda K. Patterson, with whom he had three children, according to 
Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Detective Phil Willis. She was slain in their 
car on a remote road. 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson, 35, was a chip counter at the 10-week-old Santa Ynez Indian Casino 
outside Solvang. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero is the historian of the Santa Ynez Indian Reservation and a Chumash 
spiritual adviser. He also is a high-profile advocate of the Chumash culture, 
and taught classes on Chumash traditions for 30 years at museums, camps and 
schools.

TOWN STORE'S SPECIAL IS GRISLY NEWS; MEDIA: RESIDENTS OF HAMLET WITH NO 
NEWSPAPER KEEP ABREAST OF THE HUBER CASE BY WORD OF MOUTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At the Humboldt Market, where the uniform is billed caps and well-worn work 
clothes, the "Septic Tank News" is working overtime, and everyone seems to have 
an opinion about their neighbor up the road who was busted with a woman's body 
stashed in a freezer. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Canning is the self-proclaimed "editor" of the community grapevine that 
serves regulars at the hamlet's general store, where flyers offer deals on 
laying hens and a "really pretty" stud colt. Canning offers verbal dispatches 
to town folk -- who have no local newspaper -- from a battered outdoor table 
while his overweight mut, Azula, wheezes away the hot Southwestern afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
 The murder case against house painter John J. Famalaro is dissected point by 
grisly point with each day's developments. 
</P>
<P>
 "They must think we are stupid or something," Canning remarks to pal Tim 
Cavanaugh, a reserve officer for the Yavapai County Sheriff's Department. "You 
don't keep a body in a freezer plugged into your house unless you know 
something about it. That's crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, boy," says Cavanaugh. "You just don't do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Cavanaugh and the chain-smoking Canning, a reddish-gray beard falling to his 
narrow chest, pick at the case like country prosecutors as customers drop by 
for the latest scoop. 
</P>
<P>
 During breaks from the cash register, the market's owner, Leo Bennett, ambles 
outside to join the conversation, leaning against the front post. "A little 
crazy if you ask me," he says. "Why would anybody want to keep a body that 
long? I think they got a pretty good case." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, resident Cindy Spires was in, saying she couldn't believe Famalaro 
might be the same man who wanted to sell some paint to her uncle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it shook her up," Canning says. 
</P>
<P>
 The discussion turns to the recent invasion of CNN and out-of-state newspaper 
reporters, television satellite trucks and the news helicopters buzzing the 
skies overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you, it's amazing," says Cavanaugh, who helped secure the scene 
around Famalaro's Prescott Country Club home. "There was a fella up there 
living near (Famalaro's) home, who on Sunday didn't seem to know anything about 
the family. Then, on Monday, I see him on the 10 o'clock news and he claimed to 
know everything." 
</P>
<P>
 The Septic Tank News regulars are surprised at the sudden attention to 
violence in their sparsely populated corner of the world. They concede that the 
circumstances surrounding the murder of Denise Huber -- the freezer and the dig 
for possible other victims -- are as sensational as they come. But killings 
around here are more common than people think, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been going on a long time out here," Canning says. "They bring (murder 
victims) out of Phoenix and dump 'em on the side of the road up here all the 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 "Not too far from here, they found a woman's head with a bullet hole in it a 
year ago Halloween."

Q AND A; ESTABLISHING WHEN AND WHERE DENISE HUBER DIED IS CRUCIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Question: When was 23-year-old waitress Denise Huber killed after she vanished 
June 3, 1991, from her crippled car on the Corona del Mar freeway? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Authorities here and in Arizona's Yavapai County are still trying to 
answer that question, which could determine where murder suspect John J. 
Famalaro will face trial. Investigators have collected samples of what appears 
to be blood from a Laguna Hills storage facility where Famalaro was apparently 
living when Huber disappeared. If the samples match Huber's blood, it would 
provide the first evidence that Huber was bludgeoned to death in Orange County. 
Late last week, Arizona officials turned over a sample of Huber's blood to the 
Orange County Sheriff's Department crime lab for tests that might result in a 
match. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Is John J. Famalaro the only suspect in the murder? 
</P>
<P>
 A. There is no evidence that points to any accomplice, police say, but they 
suspect that Famalaro enlisted the help of friends or acquaintances each time 
he had to transport the huge Montgomery Ward freezer that contained the frozen 
corpse of Denise Huber, apparently for nearly three years. Authorities said 
they have not ruled out the possibility that others helped Famalaro conceal 
Huber after her disappearance on June 3, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Is Famalaro suspected of other murders? 
</P>
<P>
 A. After more than a week of investigation, during which police tracked down 
11 women whose names, along with Huber's, were discovered among Famalaro's 
personal effects, Arizona authorities have not linked Famalaro to any other 
unsolved homicides, and are beginning to express doubts that they will. 
Detectives are still holding open the possibility that he was involved in the 
1992 slaying of a Sedona, Ariz., woman shot with a .45-caliber bullet. The 
woman, Anne Hope, disappeared from a local highway, and officials note that 
Famalaro owned a .45-caliber handgun. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Was Huber alive during the nine-day period between her disappearance and 
the date that Famalaro took delivery of the Montgomery Ward freezer chest that 
became her coffin? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Orange County authorities are still investigating the possibility that 
Huber was kept alive before the freezer was purchased, and she was perhaps 
unconscious for a few days after she was bludgeoned in the head. So far, 
authorities say, an autopsy has revealed that the waitress was hit at least 12 
times with a blunt object. It appears that she suffered most of the blows on 
the right side of her head. There was no indication that she had been sexually 
assaulted, but other tests had yet to be performed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Why are the timing and location of Huber's killing critical? 
</P>
<P>
 A. The timing and location of Huber's killing could determine where Famalaro 
will be placed on trial for murder. Orange County authorities have said 
privately they would prefer that the trial be held in Arizona, because it would 
be easier to convict and sentence Famalaro to death under Arizona law. But if 
it is shown that Huber was killed in Orange County, California would have 
jurisdiction. Several noted that it would be difficult to prove any of the 
"special circumstances" -- such as murder by torture or in connection with rape 
or kidnaping -- that warrant the death penalty in California. In contrast, 
Arizona law permits the death penalty if the murder itself is especially 
heinous. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What is the status of the medical examiner's autopsy? 
</P>
<P>
 A. The Yavapai County medical examiner's office is expected to release its 
report on the cause and possible timing of Huber's death sometime this week. 
Famalaro's attorney has hired a private pathologist to examine Huber's corpse 
on Tuesday. The body is expected to be released in time for a funeral the 
following Tuesday in South Dakota, where Huber's grandfather is buried. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What happens next? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Unless jurisdiction passes from Arizona to California, Famalaro, who is 
being held without bail, is scheduled to be formally arraigned on a charge of 
first-degree murder in Yavapai County Superior Court next Monday, and 
prosecutors will have 10 days after that courtroom appearance to notify 
Famalaro whether they intend to seek the death penalty. If Orange County 
authorities think they have sufficient evidence that Huber was killed here, 
they can seek to have Famalaro extradited for prosecution -- a process that 
would require further court hearings in Arizona if Famalaro elected to fight 
extradition.

AGENCY FIGHTS CRITICISM OVER VACCINE-HANDLING; GOVERNMENT: GENERAL SERVICE 
ADMINISTRATION INSISTS IT CAN SHIP DRUGS FOR CHILDREN'S PROGRAM. CLINTON'S PLAN 
ASSAILED BY CONGRESS, MANUFACTURERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Morris Boiman normally spends his time overseeing shipments of toilet paper 
and paper clips to federal office workers. But by a strange quirk of fate, he 
now finds himself serving as a primary defender and architect of one of 
President Clinton's major initiatives: a $500 million-a-year program to 
vaccinate preschool children. 
</P>
<P>
 Boiman, an ebullient ex-taxi driver, was thrust into this unusual role when 
the Clinton Administration made a hotly disputed decision to establish an 
entirely new, government-run vaccine distribution system headquartered in the 
giant government supply depot here in this distant suburb of Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 It might have been seen as a vote of confidence in Boiman and his co-workers 
at the General Services Administration's 3-year-old, state-of-the-art facility 
to be chosen for such an important task. 
</P>
<P>
 But much to their chagrin, it has turned into a public relations nightmare -- 
forcing them to defend their abilities, the reputation of their agency and the 
competence of government bureaucrats in general. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the vaccine program is controversial in large part because of the 
central role being played by GSA, the government supply agency with a 
reputation for fouling up. Just last week, Congress' General Accounting Office 
issued a report questioning the GSA's ability to handle the vaccine 
distribution, and some prominent lawmakers have moved to delay the program past 
its scheduled Oct. 1 start date. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it is not entirely a surprise to GSA employees that some people in 
Washington are questioning their ability to deliver millions of doses of 
precious vaccine to physicians around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Boiman admits that even he was initially daunted by his new assignment. As he 
recalls, "When it was first described to me, I asked, 'How will we ever do it?' 
We didn't know (anything) about handling vaccines." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor do GSA officials deny that they have contributed to the consternation by 
deciding to keep the delicate vaccines in close proximity to rooms where they 
store paint, turpentine and other highly flammable materials. While the vaccine 
will be surrounded by double-thick fire walls, a catastrophe might destroy 
millions of dollars worth of childhood pharmaceuticals. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Boiman and his colleagues are now convinced that they can do the 
job, and they have come to see themselves as pawns in a larger political 
struggle between the Administration and the drug industry. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, GSA has invested $750,000 in storage freezers, a computer and other 
equipment needed for the President's program. The floor of the future vaccine 
department already has been marked to show where new equipment will be placed, 
and officials say they will be ready to begin shipping by mid-September. 
</P>
<P>
 "After all," Boiman said confidently, "this is not rocket science. It is not 
difficult. We can do it." 
</P>
<P>
 The attention focused on GSA is understandable, considering that the Vaccines 
for Children program was Clinton's first major domestic policy initiative, and 
because the health of many preschool children hangs in the balance. Some 
states, such as California, will depend exclusively on the Burlington facility 
for giving children free or low-cost vaccinations against such diseases as 
polio, measles, mumps, diphtheria and whooping cough. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the President's program, the government is expanding the existing 
opportunities for children to get these free or low-cost immunizations by 
making them available through more than 70,000 private physicians. At present, 
free or low-cost shots are available only through public health clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 The task facing employees at the GSA distribution center looks simple enough. 
They will accept deliveries of vaccine from manufacturers, all of whom are 
located within several hundred miles of this facility; they will put the 
vaccine into specially designed boxes to be shipped to physicians, and then 
they will give them to Federal Express to deliver. 
</P>
<P>
 But the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, and Sen. 
Dale Bumpers (D-Ark.), who is trying to halt implementation of the program, 
insist that the vaccines could lose their effectiveness as a result of GSA's 
lack of experience in handling them. Until now, the vaccines have been 
distributed to physicians only by the manufacturers. In particular, GAO 
criticized GSA's failure to test the shipping containers to see if they will 
keep the vaccines sufficiently cool. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, William P. Nichols, an official with the federal Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, who is helping with GSA planning, 
said that Bumpers and the GAO have exaggerated the difficulty of shipping 
vaccines. He said it is a simple matter of using dry ice to keep the polio 
vaccine frozen and regular, picnic-style ice packs to keep the other vaccines 
at around 34 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 GSA officials note that even the pharmaceutical companies rely on Federal 
Express to ship their vaccines. They also stress that they will be abiding by 
the same regulations as the companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The only real difference between distribution by the government and the 
pharmaceutical companies, they say, is the cost. The CDC estimated the GSA will 
realize a savings of about $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
 GSA claims to be able to ship vaccine for 40 cents per dose -- one fifth the 
amount the Administration estimates it would cost privately. Vaccine 
manufacturers dispute these figures and, in any case, maintain they could beat 
the government's price. 
</P>
<P>
 Boiman insists he can ship vaccine more cheaply than the manufacturers for 
three reasons: GSA will consolidate vaccine from several companies into a 
single shipping container; GSA gets the lowest possible price from Federal 
Express, and GSA is not trying to make a profit. 
</P>
<P>
 Understandably, GSA is defensive about the criticism it has received since the 
vaccination distribution program became an issue in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Boiman says he was taken by surprise when GAO auditors showed up without 
warning at the Burlington facility. As a result, he said, he supplied them with 
incomplete information. 
</P>
<P>
 Under questioning by the GAO auditors, Boiman acknowledged that he would have 
preferred a few more months to implement the program. He said the GAO 
misinterpreted his remarks to mean that the GSA facility would not be ready to 
implement the program as scheduled Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 But GSA's biggest handicap has nothing to do with the details of the 
vaccination distribution program. Critics of the President's vaccine program 
have been quick to bring up past problems at the agency. They cite as an 
example a 1992 audit that found GSA had sold $123 million worth of government 
property for $13 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Boiman and his co-workers insist the GSA's bad reputation is based on ancient 
history. Not long ago, they noted, GAO auditors praised the construction and 
operation of the Burlington center. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the controversy over the vaccination distribution program comes at a 
time when the GSA, under Administrator Robert W. Johnson, who previously headed 
a Fortune 500 company in Southern California, has undertaken a serious effort 
to burnish its image. 
</P>
<P>
 Some GSA officials see the vaccine distribution program as an opportunity to 
help reverse the agency's decline. If GSA succeeds in distributing these 
vaccines, Boiman predicted, it will attempt to take over vaccine distribution 
for the Defense Department and the Veterans Affairs Department. 
</P>
<P>
 According to GSA officials, vaccine makers are fueling the controversy in 
Congress because the program cuts into their profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturers now are forced to sell about 50% of their vaccine to the 
government at sharply discounted prices. Under the new program, they likely 
will be required to sell about 80% of their vaccine at a discount. Their 
distribution profits also will be cut by the government-run system. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the vaccine manufacturers appear to be cooperating with 
government officials in implementing the program. Five of 15 anticipated 
purchase contracts with the manufacturers already have been agreed upon. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is Bumpers known to be aligned with the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Before his reelection in 1992, Bumpers received $2,000 each from two of the 
biggest vaccine makers, Merck & Co. and Connaught Laboratories. But neither 
Bumpers nor the other leading critics of the plan -- Sen. John C. Danforth 
(R-Mo.) and Reps. Scott Klug (R-Wis.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) -- are among the 
top recipients of drug industry campaign contributions in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 As Clinton Administration officials see it, Bumpers opposes the President's 
plan primarily because he was an early architect of the existing childhood 
program and because his wife, Betty, is closely identified with current efforts 
to immunize preschoolers.

DEMOCRATS STILL SEEK ACCEPTABLE HEALTH FORMULA; REFORM: GEPHARDT, MITCHELL NEED 
A VERSION THAT CAN PASS BOTH HOUSES. GORE STRESSES BENEFITS FOR THE MIDDLE 
CLASS WITH UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN TUMULTY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With Congress expected to vote on health reform within the next few weeks, 
Vice President Al Gore on Sunday re-emphasized what has become the 
Administration's rallying cry: That the middle class has the most to gain from 
a bill guaranteeing health insurance to all. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Democratic congressional leaders reaffirmed their commitment to 
President Clinton's basic health care reform goal of universal coverage but 
indicated they have yet to find the right formula that can assure that both 
houses will pass such a bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration and congressional leaders hope their arguments regarding 
the middle class will sink in in the final days before the legislation reaches 
the floors of both houses. They are trying to counter what they believe is the 
politically damaging impression that health overhaul is yet another big 
government program that will benefit the poor at the expense of the more 
affluent. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important to understand what group of Americans universal coverage is 
aimed at," Gore said on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press." "The poor have many 
programs, but because of the Medicaid program, they have health care. The 
wealthy can do very well buying their own health insurance." 
</P>
<P>
 But, he added, "middle-income families are the group that are at risk of 
losing their insurance." 
</P>
<P>
 Gore appeared on the program with Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell 
(D-Me.) and House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.). All three 
emphasized that universal coverage is a goal to be obtained over a number of 
years, not immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Congressional leaders are exploring whether they might win more votes if they 
delay the onset of a so-called employer mandate. That provision, which is a 
requirement that employers pay up to 80% of the cost of their workers' health 
insurance premiums, is the most controversial element of Clinton's approach to 
health reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore said that debate has shifted toward a two-stage plan in which the mandate 
would be the fallback if other reforms fail to boost sufficiently the number of 
people who have health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Mitchell said that such an approach -- known as a "hard trigger," in 
the tortured jargon of Capitol Hill -- is only one of the options that he is 
considering. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't made a final decision. I'm still in the process of consulting with 
other senators," Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Congressional sources have said that the other options include lowering the 
80% employer requirement to as little as 50% and easing it significantly for 
small businesses. The ultimate bill that Mitchell produces could also be a 
combination of those efforts to make the employer mandate more palatable to 
lawmakers who fear it could cause massive job loss. 
</P>
<P>
 And in a development that is certain to alarm abortion rights advocates, Gore 
and Gephardt also hinted that they would not allow the morally charged issue of 
guaranteeing abortion coverage to stand in the way of passing a bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will push for our original proposal (which made abortion part of the 
standard package of benefits available to everyone), but Congress will make the 
final determination," Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gephardt said he wants to "find a solution that leaves the abortion question 
about where it is in the country and not have it stop health care reform from 
going forward." 
</P>
<P>
 In suggesting that he seeks to maintain the status quo, Gephardt was referring 
to the fact that abortion is covered under most private health plans. 
</P>
<P>
 But while he expressed confidence that he could find a middle ground on the 
issue, it is far from clear what that would be. 
</P>
<P>
 Some have suggested a compromise might be a system under which abortion 
coverage is something that policyholders could buy separately, but abortion 
rights advocates have said that is not acceptable. Others, including the Senate 
Finance Committee, have embraced the idea of a "conscience clause," under which 
employers could choose not to offer abortion coverage. That is also opposed by 
supporters of abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Having already slipped well behind schedule, the congressional leaders also 
said they would hold Congress in session beyond the scheduled start of its 
August recess if that is what it takes. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I really think we can finish this bill by the 12th or 13th of August," 
Gephardt said. 
</P>
<P>
 If both houses manage to approve health legislation by then, they will come 
back in the fall to work out a compromise between their two bills and attempt 
to pass it before their final adjournment.

ROLE OF TV NEWS IN SHAPING FOREIGN POLICY UNDER INCREASING SCRUTINY; MEDIA: 
INFLUENCE MAY BE OVERSTATED, BUT TECHNOLOGY IS REQUIRING NATION'S LEADERS TO 
HAVE NEW KINDS OF COMMUNICATION SKILLS AND A CLEARER FOCUS. 
</P>

 As the United States ponders invading the island nation of Haiti to oust its 
military junta, a troubling question arises: In the age of instant 24-hour 
news, is U.S. foreign policy being whipsawed by the quick emotionalism of TV? 
</P>
<P>
 In Somalia, the George Bush Administration sent in troops after the public was 
barraged by wrenching TV images of starvation. Then the Clinton Administration 
a year later began to pull those troops out -- the mission not accomplished -- 
after the public was barraged with wrenching images of a dead U.S. soldier 
being dragged through the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the most thoughtful voices in the country on foreign policy, such as 
author George S. Kennan and Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), have suggested that U.S. 
foreign policy is too often based on the capricious and emotional pull of 
television images, which in Haiti have included desperate refugees being fished 
from the sea and scenes of unconscionable poverty ashore. 
</P>
<P>
 A closer look reveals that television news has not played as decisive a role 
in policy-making as the critics imagine, even in Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 But technology is requiring leaders to have new kinds of communication skills 
and a clearer focus to resist the hyper-velocity of round-the-clock media. And 
here the Clinton Administration, even its own officials concede, is suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason observers of foreign policy are so worried is that television 
coverage of foreign affairs in recent years has become less coherent and more 
oriented to stoking crises. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten and 20 years ago, the networks had webs of overseas bureaus and covered 
trends and events abroad on a regular basis. Today, due to network cutbacks in 
foreign bureaus and fears of audience boredom, television news has become a 
kind of information mercenary. It tends to cover only wars and disasters -- 
usually with reporters who parachute in from elsewhere and may know little 
about the country. 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, a detailed study of the records from the Vanderbilt University 
television archives reveals: 
</P>
<P>
 * The three broadcast network news divisions today average only two foreign 
stories a night, averaging six minutes per show -- and these stories almost 
always involve violence. Regular coverage of foreign politics and trends has 
all but vanished. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ten years ago, the three networks averaged more than double that many 
stories, and nearly 50% more time, and covered politics, foreign policy and 
social trends regularly. 
</P>
<P>
 * Twenty years ago, the networks did even more foreign stories each night, an 
average of close to six stories a night, though they were usually shorter than 
today. The cumulative message on TV today is that the rest of the world is a 
confusing and dangerous place filled with civil war and ethnic and nationalist 
hatreds. 
</P>
<P>
 Driving the change is a drastic cutback in the number of network overseas 
bureaus. CBS today has only four foreign bureaus, down from close to 20 in its 
heyday. NBC now has nine, and ABC 13. In 1993, CBS even stopped having a 
full-time State Department correspondent. Network executives acknowledge that 
they no longer attempt to systematically cover trends, events and politics of 
the major capitals of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 But they say they have no choice, given the realities of economics. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, perhaps CBS "did better work" overseas in many places of the world 20 
years ago, said Lane Venardos, vice president of hard news and special events 
for CBS News. "But the issue is nobody can afford to do that in this day and 
age. So it doesn't do any good to talk about what might have been. It is a new 
age." 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, surveys consistently reveal that the public doesn't care as much 
about foreign news. So while the networks have good people abroad, executives 
limit foreign news on their broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a feeling that certainly exists at CBS that the State Department and 
the process of diplomacy is not a good TV story," said CBS correspondent David 
Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 This crisis mentality on television, said David Gergen, the Clinton 
Administration adviser to the State Department, "makes it harder to sustain a 
foreign policy and explain why you are doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 But there is little evidence that crisis pictures on television routinely 
pressure policy-makers into action. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, for instance, the Bosnian civil war was the most reported story on 
network television, accounting for 1,071 minutes of the three major network's 
evening newscasts, nearly twice as much as the second-most covered story, 
health care, according to the Tyndall Report, a weekly monitor of the networks. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the Clinton Administration, like George Bush's before it, resisted the 
pressure, often amid torrid criticism from the press. 
</P>
<P>
 During the final months of Bush's presidency, reporters say, his assistant 
secretary of state for public affairs, Margaret Tutwiler, even called news 
organizations to urge them to cover Bosnia, hoping that the pictures would 
pressure her Administration to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
 But the policy didn't change. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider China: Bush resisted the pressure of pictures from China's Tian An 
Men Square massacre in 1989, said his press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, 
because "Bush knew China and knew there was nothing we could do that would be 
effective." 
</P>
<P>
 Even consider Somalia: Yes, Bush acted in Somalia after seeing the TV 
pictures. But the pictures, officials explain now, were not the reason. 
</P>
<P>
 "It came at a time when he was trying to leave office and didn't want to face 
the charges of being a lame duck and dropping the ball for an incoming 
President," said one high-ranking Bush official involved in the discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps more important, the Bush Administration thought it saw a way, however 
mistakenly, for the U.S. military to act without risk -- by providing 
humanitarian aid. 
</P>
<P>
 The consideration of whether a particular action might work is more likely to 
drive policy than television, policy-makers say. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, communications technology has compressed time throughout the 
process of diplomacy, formally one of the world's most deliberative 
environments, thereby putting a premium on decisiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Gulf War, the Bush Administration faced a special pressure when the 
Iraqis released pictures of a bunker where 400 women and children were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The visual was horrendous," recalled Tutwiler. "A response couldn't wait 
three days. How much stuff do we declassify instantly" in order to justify the 
bombing to the public, she asked rhetorically. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was the morning Saddam Hussein suddenly sent a communique saying he 
was willing to withdraw from Kuwait and the Bush Administration felt it had to 
respond quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 After a quick translation of the message, Secretary of State James A. Baker 
III and Bush decided the overture was laden with conditions and insincere. 
"Only 30 minutes had elapsed when President Bush told me to go on TV, to use 
CNN, essentially, to deliver a message to 26 governments simultaneously that we 
were rejecting the message," Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
 All this may make the chances of mistakes greater, said Fitzwater. But most 
who have been involved in these crises believe that even these moments need not 
dictate the decision-making. 
</P>
<P>
 Hodding Carter III, assistant secretary of state during Jimmy Carter's 
Administration, goes even further. "I think it requires an official absence of 
policy and a loss of nerve for the pictures to drive policy." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than driving Administrations to act quickly, most research shows that 
the overwhelming pull on public opinion is to keep the country out of foreign 
adventures. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are looking for an exit," said Clinton pollster Stanley B. Greenberg. 
"They turned the channel when the Berlin Wall came down, and after all the 
years of sacrifice from the Cold War, they are largely turning the channel on 
Bosnia." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Greenberg says a close look at the numbers suggests the public does 
not even care much if a politician hesitates all that much over foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is interesting is how little foreign policy events seem to be linked to 
Clinton's overall job performance approval rating. After Somalia, Clinton's 
foreign policy rating dropped 20 points, but his job performance rating only 
budged a couple points." 
</P>
<P>
 In Haiti, as in Bosnia, public sentiment generally has been against 
intervention. A moment in Haiti that hurt the Clinton Administration came last 
year when about 100 supporters of the military junta showed up at the 
Port-au-Prince docks carrying sticks, prompting a U.S. Navy ship to abort a 
landing of U.S. and Canadian military trainers paving the way for a return to 
democracy there. 
</P>
<P>
 But what hurt more, State Department officials concede now, was the impression 
of American weakness, which could have been avoided if the ship had waited a 
day or two rather than seeming to be scared away by the sight of men with 
sticks. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem in the Clinton Administration, even some of its own officials 
concede privately, is that many of its top people lack some of the more modern 
skills that television demands. 
</P>
<P>
 Vice President Al Gore's debate with businessman Ross Perot over the North 
American Free Trade Agreement vote "was very creative, probably the single most 
creative use of television to advance foreign policy," said State Department 
spokesman Michael D. McCurry. But other than that, "we haven't had much." 
</P>
<P>
 Others are even more blunt. On television, Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher "looks like he just walked out of a bad opera," said one former 
high-ranking State Department official. 
</P>
<P>
 National Security Adviser Anthony Lake also suffers on the airwaves. Deputy 
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott is reluctant to become too visible and trump 
his boss. That leaves only Clinton and Gore, who want to emphasize domestic 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the Bush State Department, Baker and his aides planned three months 
ahead what they wanted to accomplish and what news coverage they hoped to 
initiate. "Sometimes we were successful and could do the whole list, but 
rarely," said one Bush official. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton team has had trouble doing that, officials acknowledge privately. 
</P>
<P>
 A more difficult question may come if the U.S. decides to invade Haiti: How do 
officials handle live coverage from the battlefront? 
</P>
<P>
 For Haiti, journalists have agreed to be in a Defense Department press pool, 
which travels with an early wave of troops. This group would submit to escorts 
and censorship. 
</P>
<P>
 But the pool is supposed to dissolve after a day or two. Beyond that neither 
the military nor the press has done much planning. 
</P>
<P>
 "When things hit," said Barry Dunsmore, a 30-year veteran of ABC News, "we 
send out the ground station and think about who is the prettiest person to send 
with it."

YOUTH CRIME, WORKPLACE VIOLENCE RISING, STUDIES SAY; STATISTICS: JUSTICE DEPT. 
REPORT SHOWS NEARLY 1 MILLION SERIOUS OFFENSES ARE COMMITTED ON THE JOB. 
JUVENILE COURT CASES UP 26%. 
</P>

<P>
 Crime's pressure is mounting for office workers and juveniles, according to 
two studies released by the Justice Department on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 A study by the department's Bureau of Justice Statistics, found that one of 
every six violent crimes occurs at work, affecting nearly 1 million victims 
nationwide each year. It said 16% of all assaults, 8% of all rapes and 7% of 
all robberies take place at work. 
</P>
<P>
 The department also reported that the number of juvenile court cases involving 
serious offenses such as murders and aggravated assaults grew 68% from 1988 to 
1992. Of the 118,700 serious crimes committed by youngsters, aggravated assault 
cases increased the most, up 80%, or 77,900 cases in 1992, the study showed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The workplace is the scene of almost 1 million violent crimes every year," 
said Lawrence A. Greenfeld, acting director of the Bureau of Justice 
Statistics. "About 10% -- or 100,000 -- of these violent workplace crimes 
involve offenders armed with handguns." 
</P>
<P>
 The survey does not include information on homicides. But data from other 
sources indicate that 4% of all homicides also occur in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Levin, Northeastern University professor of sociology and criminology, 
said some data show the number of bosses killed at work has doubled over the 
past 10 years, with three to four a month slain by a disgruntled worker or 
ex-worker. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half of the crimes at work were not reported to the police, the 
agency said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those not reporting the crimes, 40% said they believed the matter was minor 
or too personal while 27% said they disclosed the incident to another official, 
such as a company security guard. 
</P>
<P>
 In the study on juvenile courts, cases increased by 26%, to nearly 1.5 
million, according to the study by the Office of Juvenile Justice and 
Delinquency Prevention. Homicides increased by 55%, to 2,500; robberies went up 
by 52%, to 32,900; and forcible rape cases rose by 27%, to 5,400. 
</P>
<P>
 "Criminals are getting younger, victims are getting younger," said Wesley 
Skogan, a political science and urban affairs professor at Northwestern 
University. "It's a combination of bravado, hopelessness, access to firepower 
and the allures of the drug market." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the overall increase in juvenile court cases, Skogan said, comes from 
an increasing willingness to prosecute young people. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also found an increased willingness to transfer cases from juvenile 
court to adult criminal court, based usually on the seriousness of the offense, 
the juvenile's record and the juvenile's amenability to treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Janet Reno said the statistics on escalating youth crime and 
significant crime at work show the need for Congress to adopt anti-crime 
legislation as quickly as possible.

SIMPSON TEAM REJECTS MAN'S REWARD OFFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A lawyer for O.J. Simpson on Sunday rejected a New Jersey businessman's offer 
to add $250,000 to the $500,000 reward the defense team is offering in the 
slayings of Simpson's ex-wife and her friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Robert L. Shapiro termed "very generous" the offer made 
Saturday by real estate executive Bernard W. Gimbel.But Shapiro said that while 
he had spoken to Gimbel's lawyer and would not discourage the businessman's 
efforts, "we're not working with him." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Simpson's lawyers announced the $500,000 reward for information 
leading to the "real killer or killers" of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald 
Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 Gimbel said he met O.J. Simpson a decade ago while playing tennis at a 
friend's house. Several years later, he said, Simpson agreed to appear at a 
fund-raiser for the Bernard W. Gimbel Multiple Sclerosis Comprehensive Care 
Center at a hospital in Teaneck, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 "O.J. is somebody who is always willing to help others and now here's 
something others can do to help him," Gimbel said, adding that he hopes his 
offer will prompt other wealthy friends of Simpson's to offer reward money, 
increasing the pot by several million dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 "With three or four million, someone would come forward and squeal on their 
mother," Gimbel said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he believes the former football star was charged with the murders 
merely "because he's high-profile." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson, who remains in custody, pleaded not guilty to murder charges at his 
Superior Court arraignment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing is scheduled this morning on, among other things, a motion by the 
defense seeking the right to conduct its own DNA tests on blood samples 
collected at the murder scene and Simpson's home.

A YOUNG ATHLETE'S LIFE CUT SHORT; ACCIDENT: THE 11-YEAR-OLD LYNWOOD GIRL WAS 
KILLED WHILE TRAVELING WITH HER TEAMMATES TO LAS VEGAS TO PLAY THE GAME SHE 
LOVED -- BASKETBALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Scrappy and tough, Tracey Myricks launched her sports career at age 8 by 
winning a spot on a previously all-boys Pop Warner football team. 
</P>
<P>
 She moved on to basketball, tagging along to practice with her older sisters 
and dribbling so incessantly that she drove her family nuts. This year, she 
finally turned 11 -- old enough to shoot and run with the big kids on the 
Lynwood Lady Knights. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracey was traveling with the team to a Las Vegas tournament over the weekend 
when an assistant coach fell asleep at the wheel of the Lady Knights' van. It 
flipped, bounced three times and landed 650 feet from where it left the 
roadway. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracey was critically hurt and died a few hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine of her teammates, Coach Ellis Barfield and Assistant Coach Michelle Allen 
were injured in the accident early Saturday morning. On Sunday, two young 
players remained in intensive care at University Medical Center in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Khaleah Smith, 12, was fighting for her life after suffering massive head 
injuries and a severed arm. Naishun Jenkin, 14, was listed in serious 
condition. Three other Lady Knights were stable. 
</P>
<P>
 And back home in Lynwood, friends and relatives mourned. 
</P>
<P>
 They described Tracey as a loving, outgoing girl, a hard-working student who 
earned nearly straight A's in the fifth grade at Mark Twain Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 "She got along with everybody," said her mother, Lisa. "She was like a nucleus 
-- everyone went with her. She had a big heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Above all, friends said, Tracey was determined. When she got a home computer, 
she plunged into a teach-yourself-to-type program -- swiftly working up to 85 
words per minute. When she wanted to try football, she joined the Pop Warner 
team, and quickly won over the bewildered boys. 
</P>
<P>
 But her real passion was basketball. She would spend hours on the court after 
school, and at night would plunk down in front of the TV to study her Lakers 
heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 She was thrilled to accompany the Lady Knights on the trip to games in 
Arizona, a basketball seminar in Colorado and the tournament at the University 
of Nevada, Las Vegas, according to her aunt, Rose Heisser. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tracey got into sports three years ago, and she just became a fanatic, 
especially with this basketball," Heisser said. "She would practice as many 
hours as her parents would allow. She didn't travel a lot, so this trip was 
real exciting for her."  
</P>
<P>
 Tracey's parents traveled to Nevada on Saturday to bring back their daughter's 
body, and returned home Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 People in Lynwood talk approvingly about the Lady Knights, a city-sponsored 
after-school team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sports is their way out, even for girls," said Ladonna Gissel, a member of 
the board of directors at the First Baptist Church of Lynwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracey's older sister, 16-year-old Christina, plays on the Lady Knights. She 
was in a different van Saturday morning when the accident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracey's mother works as a supervisor at a photography lab, and her father, 
John Andrew, is employed by Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Nevada Highway Patrol, Trooper Steve Harney, said the 
district attorney's office will decide in about 10 days whether to charge the 
van's driver with involuntary manslaughter. The driver, Assistant Coach Allen, 
has told officers that she nodded off at the wheel. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers found the driver's side crushed, the windows shattered and the tires 
blown. But the interior emerged in relatively good condition, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate to say it, but there was room to live in there," Harney said. If the 
girls had been wearing their seat belts, he said, "we would have had a better 
outcome."

3 MEN KILLED IN GUN BATTLE AT GIRL'S PARTY; VIOLENCE: AS MANY AS 11 SHOTS ARE 
FIRED NEAR CHILDREN AND ADULTS CELEBRATING A 3-YEAR-OLD'S BIRTHDAY. IT IS THE 
FOURTH SUCH DEADLY INCIDENT IN L.A. COUNTY SINCE APRIL 30.

<P>
 A 3-year-old's late night birthday party at a house near Vernon ended when a 
shootout among armed party-goers killed three men, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
 With as many as 11 shots being fired so close to the crowd where children were 
playing and people were dancing late Saturday, "it's very lucky that no one 
else got shot," said Los Angeles Police Detective Eric Campos. 
</P>
<P>
 It was at least the fourth such deadly incident in Los Angeles County since 
April 30 -- a loud party ending in gunshots. The other three shootings claimed 
six lives and left 20 wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest deaths occurred during a gun battle on the sidewalk in the 4800 
block of Long Beach Avenue, in front of a house where a family celebrating a 
daughter's birthday had hired a band that could be heard for blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, signs of the partyremained scattered in front of the tiny house -- 
a broken beer bottle, crumpled cigarette packages, paper plates piled with 
jalapeno peppers. And in one stucco wall was a quarter-sized bullet hole.  
</P>
<P>
 About 40 people showed up at the party, most of them relatives, according to a 
man who answered the door Sunday. He asked not to be named but said he was the 
father of the girl whose birthday was being celebrated. Police, however, said 
60 or more people, many of them uninvited, turned out. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before 11 p.m., two men began to argue, continuing a dispute that had 
begun earlier, Campos said. As guests danced and children played, each man 
pulled out a semiautomatic handgun and began firing. 
</P>
<P>
 As one lay wounded, Campos said, his friends, seeking vengeance, chased and 
shot the other man, who managed to kill one pursuer before dying. The first 
wounded man died en route to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The identities of the dead, who were 30, 34 and 36 years old, were not 
released pending notification of relatives, Campos said. He said all of the men 
involved knew one another and the family. None had been invited, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia Tarango, 17, who lives next door, said she called police 30 minutes 
before the shooting to complain about the loud music and was told that officers 
were too busy to come out. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she was on the telephone to police a second time when the blasts from 
at least 11 shots pierced the still-blaring music. Then, according to Tarango, 
the officer on the phone said, "All right, all right, the police are on their 
way." 
</P>
<P>
 Campos said he was not aware of how the crime was reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators believe that alcohol played a role in the killings, Campos said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the earlier incidents, two teen-agers were killed and seven wounded June 4 
when suspected gang members walked up to an end-of-school party at a 
million-dollar house in San Marino, and began blasting away with semiautomatic 
weapons. No arrests have been made. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 15, three teen-agers were killed and three others wounded when they 
were attacked by Laotian gang members while leaving an outdoor birthday party 
in Long Beach. Two youths have been charged in those shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 30, a 25-year-old woman was killed and 10 young men wounded during 
shooting that began after carloads of gang members pulled up to a party in the 
Firestone area.

STREET SMART / HENRY CHU: TAKING OUT BUMPS IS A GRIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY CHU 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's not as high-profile as the feverish repair jobs on the shattered Santa 
Monica and Golden State freeways. Politicians don't elbow each other for the 
credit. And many of us may not even notice the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 But for months, workers have labored quietly to make post-earthquake freeway 
driving a less-jarring experience. On weekends, in the late hours when most of 
us are asleep or in no state to get behind the wheel, swarms of orange-jacketed 
workers are smoothing out our roadways, erasing a new crop of bumps and humps 
that were spawned at overpasses by the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of them are just a few inches high. But as you zip along at 55 m.p.h. or 
more, those few inches can throw your car out of alignment, bruise passengers 
and scrape your tires bald. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask Roy Neilson. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're going off all the time," Neilson says of the alignment on his 10 
trucks, which log hundreds of miles on the freeways each week for his plumbing 
business. "That 405 (Freeway) . . . it's a mess." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So where did all these new bumps come from, and why do they occur at 
overpasses? 
</P>
<P>
 In the January temblor, the force of the shaking was such that many freeway 
roadbeds sank. Bridges and overpasses, which are built on separate, stronger 
foundations of concrete and reinforced steel, stayed put -- and are now 
slightly higher than the rest of the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is a rough ride, mostly along the freeways near the epicenter. The 
San Diego and Simi Valley freeways were especially hard hit, with smooth 
patches constantly interrupted by the rises and falls that bookend overpasses. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironing out the wrinkles has occupied work crews since April. Although 
Caltrans spokesman Russell Snyder said exact figures on the number of 
overpasses affected and the cost of fixing them are not available, estimates 
put the effort at $3 million to $6 million -- only 1% to 2% of the overall 
$308-million price tag of post-quake highway repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 That's far less than the 16% of the repair bill eaten up by work on the 
collapsed Santa Monica and Golden State freeways, including the handsome 
bonuses contractors received for finishing those projects early. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're low-scale compared to that," said Jim McAllister of Caltrans, who is 
overseeing the work on one segment of the San Diego Freeway in the southern San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The bump project receives none of the glamorous treatment that attended the 
reopenings of the downed freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody seems to know what we're actually doing out here, to be honest," 
McAllister said. "But it's a necessary thing that needs to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 His crews have spent their weekends these last few months tearing up the 
roadway and pouring fresh concrete in quick-hit overnight projects designed to 
minimize disruption to motorists. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the glare of floodlights, workers dig up the huge slabs of concrete 
leading to and away from the bridges -- "approach slabs" that can stretch as 
long as 30 feet. Beneath, where now lie small grids of reinforcing steel bars, 
workers substitute a stronger, longer steel network that can only be lifted by 
cranes. 
</P>
<P>
 The new grid is then attached to the overpass. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll never see it, but it's designed to keep the roadway from pulling away 
from the bridge," McAllister said. 
</P>
<P>
 Quick-drying concrete is poured on top, and the slight height difference 
between the overpass and the approach slab is tapered over 10 yards or more, 
making it virtually indiscernible. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers retool one lane at a time to avoid shutting down the entire freeway; 
an overpass, spanning both sides of the roadway, may take a few weeks to 
finish. 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, the overnight work drags on past dawn, keeping part of the 
freeway closed and triggering the tempers of motorists who honk their horns 
angrily and rattle workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans expects to finish within the next few months -- which is none too 
soon for motorists whose vehicles have suffered in the meantime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seeing a real big increase in the front end of cars going out of 
alignment, causing the tires to get chewed up," said Goldy -- just Goldy, thank 
you -- the manager at Hank's Tire Service in Woodland Hills. "By the time that 
people become aware of it, it's too late. If you're hitting those (bumps) day 
after day after day, you're going to burn out a front pair of tires in no 
time."

DANCER GENE KELLY HOSPITALIZED AFTER SUFFERING STROKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Entertainer Gene Kelly was hospitalized after suffering a mild stroke, 
officials at UCLA Medical Center said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly, 81, was in stable condition and resting comfortably, hospital spokesman 
Chris Woodson said.Kelly, known for his singing and dancing in Hollywood 
musicals such as "An American in Paris" and "Singin' in the Rain," was admitted 
to the hospital Saturday, Woodson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodson said he did not know when Kelly would be released. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly was hospitalized in May for treatment of cellulitis, a skin bacteria 
that infected his right leg. 
</P>
<P>
 During his career, which has spanned more than half a century, Kelly has 
performed in, directed or produced 47 films. 
</P>
<P>
 He appeared most recently in "That's Entertainment! III," a sequel to the 
popular 1974 anthology of MGM musicals. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly attended the July 16 concert at Dodger Stadium featuring opera tenors 
Placido Domingo, Jose Carreras and Luciano Pavarotti. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly stood up and exchanged nods with the three performers after they sang 
his signature song, "Singin' in the Rain."

FOUR ARRESTED IN W. HOLLYWOOD ASSAULT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DUKE HELFAND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In what authorities believe was intended to be a gay-bashing incident, a man 
was chased, beaten and repeatedly hit by a car after assailants called him a 
homosexual slur during an attack in West Hollywood early Sunday morning, 
deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Hill, 23, of Lancaster, suffered only bruises to his elbows and a cheek 
and cuts on a foot and thigh in the 3 a.m. incident on Santa Monica Boulevard 
near Plummer Park. He was treated at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and released. 
Authorities did not know whether Hill is gay. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without a doubt, he is very lucky to be alive," said Deputy Larry Mead, 
Sheriff's Department spokesman. "He could very well have been killed." Hill 
could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Chapa and Jesus Betancourt, both of Montebello, and Hector Camacho of 
Los Angeles, all 19, were booked on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon 
and civil rights violations, Mead said. Each was being held in lieu of $150,000 
bail. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth suspect, a 15-year-old from East Los Angeles, was booked on the 
same charges and held without bail at Sylmar Juvenile Hall, Mead said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies were uncertain of a motive, but speculated that the group might have 
been looking to rough up a homosexual in a city known for its outspoken gay 
population.  
</P>
<P>
 Mead said the four approached Hill, swore at him and threatened to kill him. 
Hill initially ignored his attackers' taunts as they approached in their gold 
1987 Honda, Mead said. He said they drove off but soon returned, pulled 
alongside Hill, got out of the car and began beating him. 
</P>
<P>
 As Hill tried to run away, Chapa allegedly got back in the car and sped toward 
Hill, knocking him onto the hood. Chapa then allegedly braked the car abruptly, 
throwing Hill off. 
</P>
<P>
 When the car hit Hill again, he clung to the hood as it drove about half a 
block along Santa Monica Boulevard. The driver braked again, throwing Hill off 
for a second time. He ran into the nearby Yukon Mining Company restaurant and 
called authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was shaking. He was scared," one Yukon employee recalled. "He said, 
'There's a guy out there who wants to beat me up.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the men fled, but returned to the restaurant parking lot about 
two hours later, where witnesses spotted them. Sheriff's deputies arrested them 
a short time later, Mead said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed like they were going after somebody (they believed to be) gay, not 
a specific person," said West Hollywood sheriff's Lt. John O'Brien. "Whether it 
was a gang initiation or something else, who knows. (Hill) was probably in the 
wrong place at the wrong time."

<TEXT>
<P>
 What stories the grimy, peeling, cracked walls of the old Hall of Justice 
might tell if their aged stone and mortar could be given voice. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people went forth from the Hall's courtrooms to Death Row. Many more were 
sent to prison. A few walked out the doors, free. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, after 70 years at the heart of the county's justice system, the building 
at Temple and Spring streets stands abandoned after January's earthquake, with 
only movie makers and historians interested in seeing it remain. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, on the 15 floors behind the Italian Renaissance facade of gray 
granite, ghostly voices of the famous and infamous might still drift down the 
long corridors: Actor Errol Flynn, car-bombing Police Lt. Earl Kynette, 
gangster Bugsy Siegel, perjuring Dist. Atty. Buron Fitts, Red Light Bandit 
Caryl Chessman, and Sirhan Sirhan, Robert Kennedy's assassin. 
</P>
<P>
 Courtroom dramas were plentiful there in the half-century when the building 
was practically a second home to judges, famed attorneys, reporters and police 
officers. Here, thousands of prisoners paced and sweated in the 520 cells or at 
defense tables: 
</P>
<P>
 1926 -- Supporters crowded in to cheer on Aimee Semple McPherson -- radio 
evangelist and charismatic lightning rod of a Los Angeles church -- who was on 
trial for filing a false police report after her mysterious disappearance from 
Venice Beach. Dist. Atty. Asa Keyes dropped the misdemeanor charges in 
mid-trial. (It was rumored that Keyes took $30,000 to withdraw the charges.) 
</P>
<P>
 1927 -- Hundreds of courtroom-watchers almost rioted when a judge began to 
issue reserved seats to political cronies for the trial of William Edward 
Hickman, who kidnaped a 12-year-old girl and then returned her, apparently 
alive, for ransom. Afterward, it was found that he had sewn her eyes open to 
make her appear alive and deceive rescuers. 
</P>
<P>
 1929 -- Within days of each other, and with the same judge and defense 
attorney, theater magnate Alexander Pantages was tried for statutory rape, and 
his wife was tried for vehicular manslaughter. So great was the curiosity that 
carpenters built barricades outside the courtroom to keep people in line. 
</P>
<P>
 Eunice Pringle, 17, in ponytail and little-girl clothes, testified about how 
Pantages had raped her. Ordered to come to court the next day in the clothes 
she wore the day of the alleged rape, she appeared as a seductive woman. The 
jury convicted Pantages. He appealed and another jury acquitted him. Pringle 
admitted on her deathbed that she was paid to frame him. 
</P>
<P>
 Days before, Lois Pantages was convicted of killing another motorist, a 
Japanese gardener. She was sentenced to 10 years probation and a $78,500 fine. 
She collapsed at the verdict; all five women jurors burst into tears. 
</P>
<P>
 1931 -- Ice cream vendors sold their wares to hundreds who cooled their heels 
waiting to get into the murder trial of a man who would normally be at the 
prosecution table: Deputy Dist. Atty. Dave Clark, accused of shotgunning top 
crime boss Charles Crawford and former newspaperman Herbert Spencer. He was 
acquitted of Spencer's death, and charges were dropped in the Crawford case. 
Clark was running for municipal judge while awaiting his murder trial and got 
60,000 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 1940-1941 -- Crowds flocked in when actor George Raft testified for his 
friend, hoodlum Bugsy Siegel, on trial for the murder of Harry (Big Greeny) 
Greenburg, a witness to a mob killing. Siegel was freed after two star 
witnesses were shot, gangland-style. Years later, a friend of Siegel's willed 
$10,000 to Dr. Benjamin Blank, the jail physician, for supposedly giving Siegel 
special privileges behind bars. Siegel was back in the old Hall in 1944 on 
gambling charges. He pleaded guilty and paid a $250 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 1942 -- Movie fans jammed the Hall as renowned defense attorney Jerry Geisler 
got Flynn acquitted of statutory rape charges involving two teen-age girls 
aboard his yacht. 
</P>
<P>
 1943 -- Authorities fearing a "zoot suit" riot guarded the courtroom where 22 
pachucos stood trial for the murder of fellow pachuco Jose Diaz. Diaz was found 
dead after a fight at a party near an abandoned Eastside quarry -- a site the 
press dubbed "Sleepy Lagoon" after a song. Twelve of them were convicted of 
murder, five were convicted of lesser charges and five more were acquitted. All 
the convictions were reversed in 1944. 
</P>
<P>
 1943 -- The unlikely attraction was matronly but alluring Louise Peete, a 
woman who had been married four times, with each husband committing suicide 
when she rejected them. Previously convicted of murdering a boyfriend, she was 
on trial for robbing and murdering a woman who had believed in her innocence. 
Peete was executed in the gas chamber in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
 1957 -- During L. Ewing Scott's trial for the murder of his wealthy wife, who 
disappeared from their Bel-Air home, his lawyer argued that no body had been 
found and that the victim "might walk through this courtroom door at any time." 
</P>
<P>
 "Aha," he said as the jurors looked expectantly toward the door. "That shows 
you are not convinced 'beyond a reasonable doubt' that she is dead." Then came 
the prosecutor's turn. "Every head in this courtroom turned toward that door 
just now," J. Miller Leavy noted. "Except one -- that of the defendant. And he 
didn't bother to look because he knows she's not going to walk through that 
door -- he killed her." Scott received a life sentence, was paroled in 1978 and 
died in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 1968 -- To try Sirhan in the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, the county 
built a high-security courtroom on the 13th floor, just a few paces from his 
cell. 
</P>
<P>
 1970-1971 -- When the Manson family was on trial for killing actress Sharon 
Tate and six others, Manson's "girls" kept vigil outside. The barefoot young 
women carved Xs into their foreheads and promised to remain "until our father 
is released." Inside, Manson was barred from the courtroom after he leaped to 
within a few feet of Judge Charles Older. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later, the new Criminal Courts Building opened across the street.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: TODAY'S TOPIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While President Clinton and Congress wrangle this week over a final 
health-care reform bill, there is a sense in the medical community that no 
matter what the agreement the delivery of medical care in the United States 
will be vastly different in the coming years. 
</P>
<P>
 Topping the list of challenges for the Clinton Administration is cutting the 
astronomical cost of health care, which could reach a total of $1 trillion for 
1994 alone, according to the People's Medical Society, a consumer group based 
in Allentown, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 In today's Platform, a panel of health-care professionals discusses one of the 
cost-cutting changes already taking place: the growing numbers of licensed 
caretakers who are performing simple medical procedures in place of doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 Although in most cases these health-care providers are by law required to work 
in tandem with a medical doctor, the trend still stirs controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 These professionals -- nurse practitioners, physician assistants, nurse 
midwives, nurse anesthetists, dental hygienists and opticians -- argue that 
they have enough education and meet enough licensing requirements to safely 
minister to patients without the supervision of a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 Physicians, on the other hand, worry that these health-care providers are not 
trained to deal with potential life-and-death problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not opposed to change," says Steven Thompson, vice president for 
government affairs for the California Medical Assn., a physicians' lobbying 
group. "We're opposed to change that jeopardizes the patient. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not opposed legislation that allows some expansion of scope of their 
responsibilities," Thompson says. "But if there is something beyond their 
scope, we want to make sure a physician is present to make sure the appropriate 
medical supervision is available." 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, that view does not sit well with other health-care 
providers. They charge that physicians are not so much concerned about patient 
care as they are about their own pocketbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real problem is that nurse practitioners and physician assistants want to 
get paid for doing the procedures," says Donna Ver Steeg, who heads the primary 
care unit of UCLA's School of Nursing. "They perform the procedures but the 
doctor sends in the bill to the insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their rates don't approach those of physicians," Ver Steeg says. "They are 
not doing things that are dangerous. The average primary-care problems are not 
of the magnitude one would expect a physician to be treating." 
</P>
<P>
 That view is generally supported by consumer groups. "We feel there should be 
more choice for the medical consumer," says Mike Donio of the People's Medical 
Society.  
</P>
<P>
 "As a consumer, shouldn't I have the choice to go, for example, to a dental 
hygienist who would clean my teeth for $20 or $25 instead of a dentist who 
would charge me $60 for the same procedure?" Donio asks. "We want to control 
the rate that medical costs are increasing," Donio adds. "We want to be able to 
purchase those primary care services at a lower cost."

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: COMMUNITY COMMENT; 
CHARTER SCHOOLS: 'QUALITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Santiago Middle School in the city of Orange has become Orange County's 
first charter school, giving more autonomy to educators and parents. Robert L. 
French, acting superintendent of the Orange Unified School District, talked to 
James Blair about some of the background and implications of the move, which 
will take effect in September, 1995. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have copies of the 1924 and 1937 education codes. They're about 200 pages. 
Today's education code fills 11 volumes, with thousands of regulations. Most of 
the regulations, I assume, came because somewhere along the line legislators 
thought they could improve education by passing all these laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The education code limits a lot of the things teachers, principals and 
communities have been trying to do. For example, if you wanted to bring in an 
art specialist, a music specialist or someone in science or computers to teach 
a mini-course or even a whole class, that's been restricted in past years 
because these guest experts weren't credentialed as teachers.  
</P>
<P>
 So the school said, "We've got a changing population, a changing body of 
knowledge and challenges that students will be facing in the future. We think 
there are better ways to do it." The faculty, principal, community members -- 
parents and non-parents -- worked this last year developing their proposal, or 
"charter petition" as it is called. It represents a combination of the school 
and the greater school community who decided they were going to improve 
learning, expand the students' thinking skills and expand the core curriculum.  
</P>
<P>
 The granting of charter status says to Santiago Middle School, "You're free of 
restrictions on what you teach and how you teach it. You're free to go and see 
what you can do to improve." It opens up a creative faculty who says, "We're 
going to have quality and we're going to be accountable to our constituents." 
</P>
<P>
 There were about 35 people at the meeting when the board finally approved the 
petition. They were ecstatic. I saw parents, faculty members and a principal 
excited about what they were capable of doing.  
</P>
<P>
 The community and the school board have broken away from the school district 
in many respects. The governance is what's different. It now rests with a 
committee made up of 13 that includes parents of students at Santiago, parents 
of students from the feeder elementary schools, parents from the high school to 
which these students will go, and members of the staff. They're going to 
determine how students are evaluated using the California Learning Assessment 
System test and other performance standards. Although there are certain federal 
regulations regarding equality of opportunity, and their budget must be 
approved by the county superintendent of schools, they're their own bosses. 
</P>
<P>
 The educator's going to be the expert on research or what experience works. 
The parent can provide input (on what he sees his) kid being able to do and 
what turns him on to learning. Home and school will be able to work more 
cooperatively. I see much closer involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 I think the district can learn that there are other ways in which students can 
be taught other than having 35 kids in rows with a credentialed teacher in 
front of them, and other ways of measuring learning. 
</P>
<P>
 (Working at a charter school) encourages teachers who have been excited about 
the teaching/learning process and wanted to do things but were inhibited by the 
formal structure. Students will feel good about their learning and understand 
that learning will be lifelong. They will enjoy what they're doing and find 
school to be of value.

 The following students have received scholarships for their commitment to 
human relations and participation in activities aimed at bringing people of 
different races and cultures together. The awards were given by two groups 
within the Los Angeles Unified School District -- the Council of Black 
Administrators and the Assn. of Jewish Educators. CHIDIMMA OFAH

 I come from Nigeria -- I'm a real African American. I had never experienced 
prejudice before coming here. I've been involved in the Human Relations Task 
Force at school. It tries to bring together blacks and Latinos, which has been 
a major problem on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 We got people to wear green ribbons in support of better relations between the 
races. We were surprised: A lot more people wore them than we expected. We did 
this exercise called "Fish Bowl," where a person of one ethnicity stood inside 
a giant fish bowl, and another person of a different ethnicity stood outside 
it. The person outside had to listen and learn from the person inside.  
</P>
<P>
 I hope people will pick up the pieces after I graduate and continue the work. 
There are a lot of people who want to get involved, but are afraid. STEPHEN

 I was chairman of the National Council of Governors in the Junior State of 
America, a national organization that encourages people under 18 to be 
politically active. After the civil unrest, our focus was urban expansion. 
Through an organization like ours, we wanted students to realize that they can 
have a say, even though they may not be able to vote yet. 
</P>
<P>
 I helped set up chapters at Dorsey, Crenshaw and Lynwood high schools. 
Students that we dealt with were very responsive. One of our highlights was a 
conference and a mayoral candidate's forum held at Manual Arts High last year 
that got a lot of attention. When we have trips to Washington and other places, 
we give students at inner-city schools discounts and help them raise funds so 
that they can participate as much as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Political involvement is not the sole answer to socioeconomic and other 
problems, but it is a good start. It maintains faith that the country can work.

 I was a participant in a trip to Great Britain sponsored by the Youth 
Leadership Awards L.A. and the Constitutional Rights Foundation. We toured 
schools, saw a lot of depressed areas and saw a lot of similarities between 
there and here, even with gang violence. I went with an incredibly diverse 
group of students who had been working for a while in human relations, which 
impressed me and made me want to do more. 
</P>
<P>
 I was a leader in the Youth Task Force at Hamilton, which started after the 
Rodney King incident. Our main focus was improving community and police 
relations, and addressing the negative socioeconomic conditions that affect a 
lot of students. We also did outreach, like raise food for the homeless and 
sponsor blood drives. The good thing was the whole task force was run by 
students. On my own, I've done volunteer work for AIDS Project L.A. and the 
Feminist Majority Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 The student task force wanted to make people understand that getting involved 
is so easy and so rewarding. But people hesitate. BYRON RAMOS

 The Anti-Defamation League changed the course of my life. They sponsored a 
trip to Israel last April that I went on. I was exposed to the Jewish culture 
for the first time. My interest in not only Jewish culture, but my own Latino 
culture, started to grow. I became very interested in human relations and civil 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
 I took a trip to Washington after that and got more exposed to the nationwide 
problem of human rights. I started speaking a lot at Jewish community centers, 
churches and schools. I tried to explain to people how to understand and 
respect other people and other cultures.  
</P>
<P>
 Eventually I want to become involved in human rights as a lawyer. Right now 
I'm having a rough time accepting my church's prejudice against gays. In the 
past I wouldn't have reacted so strongly, but now I know the harm silence can 
cause. If you don't speak out, things can't ever change. AMANDA UNDERWOOD

 I come from a biracial background -- my mom is Jewish and my father is black. 
I've always seen aspects of both identities. I got involved with Operation 
Unity, which is a group started by a black woman to try and get black and 
Jewish teens together. I was on the original committee that shaped the 
organization. I can see a lot of similarities between the two groups. Sure, 
there are differences, but people perceive more differences than there actually 
are. There's a lot of education that needs to be done among people. People need 
to see they come from common backgrounds. I've been very lucky because I 
haven't personally experienced racial prejudice, but I know it exists.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD; 
SAN GABRIEL FOOTHILLS: LIVING WITH BEARS AND MOUNTAIN LIONS

 Across the southern base of the San Gabriel Mountains stretches a string of 
communities nestled against the chaparral of the Angeles National Forest. Along 
these foothills, tensions can arise because people live in homes located where 
all manner of wild animals roam from the forest's edge into neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's got rattlesnakes. Everybody's got coyotes," says Glen Owens, who 
lives on a Monrovia hillside. But the plot can thicken when bears and mountain 
lions wander in. Owens, who heads a group aimed at preserving the San Gabriel 
Mountains as a wilderness recreation area, had a bear amble through his 
backyard last year. A friend of his faced off with a mountain lion on a biking 
trail in Monrovia; the cougar sauntered away. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes such encounters do not end peacefully. This year, police shot and 
killed a 350-pound bear in Azusa. The incident provoked a protest. In response, 
Azusa officials have formed a Wildlife Response Policy Commission, with the 
notion that there is a need for a uniform approach in handling such incidents 
throughout San Gabriel foothills. The commission held its first meeting last 
week. In a related effort, an Arcadia man rounded up donations to buy two 
tranquilizer dart guns that state game warden said would help them cope with 
wildlife in neighborhoods. ON THE NEED FOR EXPERT HANDLING 
</P>
<P>
 The potential for life-threatening danger always exists in bear or mountain 
lion encounters with humans, but Cal Poly Pomona zoologist, Glenn R. Stewart, 
says that even big bears or mountain lions can be captured with tranquilizer 
darts if the proper dosage is given by trained experts shooting the animals in 
the right spot. "You have to estimate the animal's weight right. It's good to 
give even a dose larger. You can overdose them two or three times. It's not 
going to harm them. They'll just sleep longer," he says. Ropes, cargo nets or 
even gun-like devices which can fire a net 30 feet can pull down a bear or 
mountain lion long enough to get a dart into it, Stewart says. THWARTING ANIMAL 
INTRUDERS 
</P>
<P>
 Discourage bear and mountain lion from coming into residential areas by 
securing outdoor food sources. Garbage, fruit and certain plants can attract 
bears or smaller mammals like deer, coyotes, racoons, skunks, rabbits or possum 
that can be prey for mountain lions.  
</P>
<P>
 Seal all garbage. 
</P>
<P>
 Keep cat and dog food where wild animals can't reach it.  
</P>
<P>
 Fence off garden and yard areas.  
</P>
<P>
 Call 911 if you see a bear or mountain lion in your neighborhood. An untrained 
person should never approach a bear or mountain lion. If the animal feels 
cornered it could attack. PROTECTION IN THE WOODS 
</P>
<P>
 Naturalists estimate that there are 450 bears and at least 1000 mountain lions 
that live in Southern California. When you're in any wilderness area: 
</P>
<P>
 Recognize that you are a visitor in the wild animals' habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 Keep food secure and out of your sleeping bag or tent. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, wild animals avoid human contact. A mountain lion may attack to 
defend partially eaten prey which they have stashed. Bears and mountain lions 
with cubs may charge in defense of their young. ANIMAL ADVOCATE'S VIEW 
</P>
<P>
 "I went through the roof. I couldn't believe that they had killed this bear. I 
believe that they had killed this bear."  
</P>
<P>
 I believe so strongly that we share this planet with all the other creatures, 
large or small. To basically execute these animals seems to be barbaric. I was 
hoping this incident could be used to raise the consciousness of people. We 
shouldn't be angry at the people who did this. What we should do is try and 
understand why this happened, understand that there is a fear about large 
animals and in some cases people act hastily. I don't think you can blame 
anybody that years and years of cultural indoctrination has created this fear."

IMMIGRANT'S TALE OF ECONOMIC JUSTICE

 I came to Southern California just after the fireworks of the July 4, 1971, 
celebrations had cooled down. I came to get a higher education which was 
available in my mother country of Pakistan but only to a limited number of 
students. Never did I dream that my sojourn was to be a permanent voyage to 
this "foreign" land.  
</P>
<P>
 When I got a job at the K-Mart in Fullerton, many of my friends were concerned 
that I would stand out as a foreigner. They feared that an immigration 
inspector would recognize me or a complaint about my work would spark an 
investigation by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Because of this 
fright, most of my friends worked as bus boys or as janitors in Disneyland at 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people think it is illegal for foreign students to work. The INS would 
grant us a permit to work part-time if we maintained our full-time status in 
school and could show a need to earn some money to pay our way if circumstances 
had changed since we came. Hence it was easy for us to get the permit, but it 
was subject to renewal yearly and had a 20-hour-per-week restriction. Imagine 
telling your boss that you could not fill in for the Christmas rush over 
midterm break, that you couldn't work more than 20 hours per week. I assumed 
that as long as I did my minimum schoolwork there would be no reason for denial 
of the permit. Hence, if you could work 30 hours a week and still carry a full 
load at school more power to you. But you were still under the gun if you went 
to 21 hours in any week as you had violated your permit and had broken the law. 
Hence, once being in this vulnerable position, the last thing that you would 
have the courage to do was to try to exploit the system, even though there are 
a small number that will, which is so unfair as they get the media attention. 
</P>
<P>
 When I went back to Karachi a couple of years later, the country that I had 
left was gone. The spillover from the oil wealth had made it a very 
materialistic nation. We had a brief shining moment of a people's government, 
but the prime minister was hanged despite the appeals of President Jimmy Carter 
and other world leaders. The dark cloud of militarism took over and the country 
became the conduit of arms for the Afghan fight with the Russians.  
</P>
<P>
 Once you get used to living in a land where the air may be polluted but you 
are free to yell about it to the governor without fear of reprisal, it is 
pretty hard to live in a land where the news anchor is fired for not starting 
with a broadcast featuring the military dictator. Once you are used to living 
in an open society where you are innocent until proven guilty, there is due 
process and you have the Bill of Rights to guarantee your freedoms, it is too 
suffocating an experience to go back to live in your motherland until it is 
free also. 
</P>
<P>
 But I have paid a price. My children cannot even understand my mother tongue, 
hence they can never speak with my mother. I have lived all my adult life away 
from my loving siblings and parents, who cannot afford to live here with me 
because of high medical costs. I am forever subjected to live where Christmas 
is the dominant holiday and very few people will ever know of the joy of Eid Al 
Adha, the Muslim holiday after Ramadan, the month of fasting. 
</P>
<P>
 But this land is the best there is in this wretched world in these trying 
times. We all know the price of freedom is eternal vigilance: We have 
demagogues who exploit the weakest among us whenever there is an economic 
downturn. It is not enough to do good; we have to stop evil. We cannot be 
content in just paying our taxes and not being involved in the civic duties to 
keep this land true to its ideal and sharing in the dream of Dr. Martin Luther 
King that all men are created equal and endowed by their creator with certain 
inalienable rights. 
</P>
<P>
 I ask that others remember that not all of immigrants are economic refugees. 
Many of us are here because of tyranny in our homelands. Thank you, America, 
for being the home of the free and the brave and letting me be part of the 
salad bowl, this great and noble experiment of mankind.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: CONVERSATION WITH 
EDWARD M. SZYNAKA; SAVING LIBRARIES -- IT'S THE COMMUNITIES' DECISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Budget cuts have forced many Southern California libraries to reduce 
services. But residents of Pasadena decided to buck the trend last year, with 
79% of voters agreeing to pay additional taxes specifically for libraries. 
Since then, Altadena and South Pasadena voters have also agreed to levies to 
bolster their libraries.National Public Radio writer Donna Mungen talked with 
Edward M. Szynaka, director of the Pasadena Library. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Question: You describe your library as a "dynamic information utility center." 
Why? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Twenty years ago, it was much easier to describe libraries. But 
nowadays we give out bits of information that change people's lives, as opposed 
to only handing out great books to read. In Alvin Toffler's "Future Shock," he 
describes how we'll all have to become accustomed to the "dynamic" quality of 
technology. As we've all grown more dependent upon information, it also has 
turned into a utility much like water and electricity. In the future, the 
library will be a resource and a center for the "information poor." The people 
who succeed will know how to obtain, use and utilize this information. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is there anything distinctive about Southern California libraries? 
</P>
<P>
 A: In Southern California we have a big contrast from rags to riches, with the 
Los Angeles County Library System fighting for its survival while the city of 
Los Angeles just opened a beautiful Central Library. California has the 
distinction of leading the nation in the closing of public libraries. Also it's 
hard to believe, but it's easier through the California interlibrary loan 
system to receive a book in prison than at your local library. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How can libraries compete in an environment where few, if any, 
revenue-increasing propositions are passing? 
</P>
<P>
 A: If citizens are clearly presented with the issues I believe they will act 
accordingly. I don't subscribe to the idea that people are totally against 
investing in their communities. However, there is a growing cynicism on the 
part of citizens because they feel their dollars are not necessarily doing what 
they want.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What was your strategy for gaining community support? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It was a three-year journey. When we ran the library campaign, one of our 
consistent messages was that citizens could be assured that if they paid $20 
per household that their $20 would go directly to the library. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: At one point during that three-year period your staff took a salary cut. 
Why? 
</P>
<P>
 A: My staff felt that if anyone was going to save the library, it would be us 
and perhaps we needed to set an example. So 92% of the staff took their salary 
adjustments, and like a United Way campaign, they essentially donated it to the 
library. But it was never about saving our jobs because people who go into this 
profession are almost like missionaries. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How did you achieve the reputation of being one of the best libraries in 
the area? 
</P>
<P>
 A: For many years, we've emphasized citizen participation and programming for 
all parts of the community, not just for the intellectually elite. Most people 
around the world know the city of Pasadena from the Rose Parade, but many don't 
realize that Pasadena has an extremely diverse population made up of 16% 
African Americans, 20-25% Latinos and 8% Asians, as well as a rather large 
Armenian community. 
</P>
<P>
 Our eight branch libraries are located in very distinct neighborhoods. They 
each serve as Statues of Liberty because they are reminders of what is 
different and what is great about America. Also our team approach doesn't 
distinguish between librarians and clerks and I think all of this sets us 
apart. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What can other cities do faced with a similar situation? 
</P>
<P>
 A: They shouldn't wait until they're in a crisis. Our solution came when a 
citizens' advisory board approached the City Council requesting that a vote be 
put before the public. We're not entirely out of the city budget, but the 
special levy requires the city to put up a certain amount. The reminder is made 
up by the library tax. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What are challenges ahead? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The immediate future looks very good. Eighty-three days after the election, 
all the branch libraries opened back up and the book budget is back to where it 
was. But this measure is only good through June 30, 1999. So the community will 
have to make another decision at that time.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: PLATFORM; CHANGING 
MEDICAL ROLES: 'MAIN THING IS THE PATIENT'

By Compiled for The Times by M.K. Kuehler 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration's move to reform the American health-care system is 
fueling debate over who is qualified to deliver different levels of care to 
patients. Here some medical professionals share their views.  
</P>
<P>
 BENJAMIN SHWACHMAN 
</P>
<P>
 Anesthesiologist and past president, Medical Assn. of Los Angeles County 
</P>
<P>
 Nurse practitioners should think of practicing in the same light as physicians 
do: Proceed with great fear. Restrict yourself and accept the fact that you 
can't do it all, and to the extent you want to do more, you should go back for 
more training. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no shame or harm in being supervised (by a physician). No one's 
trying to stop nurse practitioners from working. The main thing is that the 
patient get the best from everybody. DOROTHY CARUSO-HERMAN 
</P>
<P>
 Former nurse practitioner and co-founder of Hospice Nurses Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't think physicians should be threatened; NPs are not trying to take away 
their role. Nurse practitioners do pick up on a lot of things. NPs are much 
more aware psycho-socially, more conversant and take more time with patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Physicians are threatened that a nurse practitioner might make a decision that 
would not be what they would make. They have had a corner on the market and 
never wanted to accept the fact that the nurse was never more than their 
handmaiden. 
</P>
<P>
 I see the nurse and nurse practitioner and well-trained physician assistants 
moving into the area, in effect, of middle management, with physicians as upper 
management. More partnership, less hierarchy -- neither threatens the other. 
MARY KNUDTSON 
</P>
<P>
 Nurse practitioner, UC Irvine Medical Plaza 
</P>
<P>
 In general, most of the physicians who have worked with nurse practitioners 
are pleased with the quality of care and are supportive of the role of NPs.  
</P>
<P>
 With health-care reform, some things will be looked at. The Clinton proposal 
may remove barriers against NPs providing care -- for example, not requiring 
them to be in a relationship with the physician as a supervisor; allowing them 
to be reimbursed by third parties and giving them prescription privileges. (In 
the future) NPs will become an integral part of the managed health-care system 
because they are cost-effective, provide quality care and patients are pleased. 
VINCENT GUALTIERI 
</P>
<P>
 Urologist, secretary of Medical Assn. of L.A. County 
</P>
<P>
 Nurse practitioners and physician assistants are skilled, but there should be 
a doctor's supervision. The American Society of Internal Medicine issued a memo 
strongly opposed to independent nurse practitioners. Organized medicine is 
concerned about patient care, not about cutting into physician incomes. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, NPs were carefully supervised in clinics. When they leave this 
setting, there's no control. I think an increased role for NPs would have to be 
done in coordination with organized medicine to set standards. LES HOWARD 
</P>
<P>
 Physician assistant, USC faculty member 
</P>
<P>
 I believe in dependent practitioners working under a physician. Physician 
assistants are an extension of the physician. There needs to be a physician in 
the picture because of their (advanced) training. PAs do want

 Both sets of professions (medical health and mental health) are going through 
turf wars. Nurse practitioners' and psychologists' issues are very similar: 
People are desperately looking for alternative ways to keep healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 Psychiatrists (like other physicians) are forced more into treating with 
medication, while psychologists are trained to approach problems physically, 
psychologically and social-culturally. NPs' and psychologists' "mind-body" 
approaches are more likely to take those things into account. 
</P>
<P>
 NPs are a challenge to traditional models of health delivery controlled by 
white male physicians. Nursing professionals are females, often from diverse 
backgrounds and, as a profession, reflect society.

EXPO ROOKIE HAS DODGERS WAVING A WHITE FLAG, 7-4; BASEBALL: LEFT FIELDER DRIVES 
IN ALL OF MONTREAL'S RUNS AS L.A. LOSES ITS FIFTH IN A ROW. 
</P>

 The Dodgers lost their eighth game in 10 on this trip, this one, 7-4, to 
Montreal, which completed a sweep of the three-game series with the help of 
rookie Rondell White, who drove in all the Expo runs on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Disparaged and disjointed, the Dodgers boarded a bus to take them away from 
Olympic Stadium, their dome of despair. Their next stop on this nightmare tour 
though, will be anything but a rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Their fifth consecutive loss cut the Dodgers' lead in the National League West 
to 1 1/2 games over the San Francisco Giants, setting up a showdown for the 
division lead when the two teams begin a three-game series tonight at 
Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the team that everyone is worried about -- if we are to win this 
thing, we have to go in and beat them," shortstop Rafael Bournigal said.  
</P>
<P>
 There are few questions left to ask the Dodgers, who are hitting but not 
scoring enough, pitching inconsistently, and fumbling plays in the field. They 
hit three home runs Sunday, but gave up 16 hits to their 10. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's . . . baseball," said starter Kevin Gross, who was the victim of some 
bad breaks and White. 
</P>
<P>
 Each time pitching coach Ron Perranoski walked to the mound, the crowd of 
34,402 applauded. The Dodgers used five pitchers, with Gross (7-7) departing 
after four innings, having given up six runs and 11 hits. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodger bullpen held the Expos to one run over the next four innings. 
White's one-run single in the eighth inning gave him seven RBIs, which tied the 
league high this season, set by the Dodgers' Cory Snyder against Pittsburgh on 
April 17. To this Dodger team, that seems like decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 10 games on this trip, the Dodgers have been outscored, 60-40, and 
out-hit in batting average, .322 to .273. In three of the games, they have 
stranded 13 or more runners -- including 13 on Sunday and 78 overall. 
</P>
<P>
 "These games are over, they are in the record book, you can't erase them," 
Manager Tom Lasorda said. "You just have to think about tomorrow. All the 
questions of 'What do you expect? What do you hope? What will you do?' They all 
have the same answer. We have to go out and win, and we haven't done that." 
</P>
<P>
 The frustration was demonstrated before the Expos batted in the fourth inning, 
when third base coach Joe Amalfitano was ejected for disputing a call by first 
base umpire Larry Vanover. Amalfitano, known for his even demeanor on the 
field, thought a ball hit by Cliff Floyd was fair, and Eric Karros fielded it 
for an out. But it was ruled foul, and Floyd went on to single before White hit 
a three-run homer, his first home run this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Amalfitano said that play alone wasn't the source of his anger. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot of things," he said. "Certain things happen over a period of a 
game, or games, that maybe build up and you look up and see something, and it 
goes." 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda tried to change his team's momentum by replacing first base coach 
Reggie Smith with bench coach Bill Russell to start the game. Lasorda coached 
third base after Amalfitano was ejected. 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy appeared to work at first, when Brett Butler, who was three for 
five, led off the game with a single and scored on a double-play ground out by 
Tim Wallach. Karros, who had not hit a home run in 145 at-bats, teamed with 
Mitch Webster for back-to-back homers in the fourth. Both solo shots came 
against Kirk Rueter (6-2), cutting the deficit to 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
 But White, who was four for five in the game, doubled in two more runs in the 
fifth, chasing Gross. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Gwynn hit a solo home run in the ninth, his second pinch-hit home run, 
but Expo reliever John Wetteland went on to his 18th save. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, the Dodgers will face former teammate Darryl Strawberry, who has said 
the Dodgers have already "been caught." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the Giants we're playing, not an individual, or a particular guy," 
Wallach said. Rondell on a Roll 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal rookie Rondell White, who was batting .255 with no home runds and 
four RBIs in 51 at-bats before Sunday, went four for five ansd drove in all of 
the Expos' runds in a 7-4 victory over the Dodgers. His at-bats: 
</P>
<P>
 First inning: Singled against pitcher Kevin Gross' foot to score Juan Bell. 
Third inning: Hit a three-run home run against Gross. Fifth inning: Doubled 
against Gross to score Darren Fletcher and Cliff Floyd. Sixth inning: Struckk 
out with bases loaded against Roger McDowell. Eight inning: Singled against Jim 
Gott to score Moises Alou.

1988 OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALIST NAPUNYI DIES AFTER KO LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Wangila Napunyi, who struggled as a professional after winning the first 
Olympic boxing gold medal for an African nation, died Sunday morning in a Las 
Vegas hospital two days after suffering head injuries in a knockout loss. He 
was 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Napunyi, who fought for Kenya under the name Robert Wangila in the 1988 Games 
at Seoul, was stopped in the ninth round by welterweight David Gonzales, ranked 
No. 10 by the World Boxing Council, in a bout Friday night at the Aladdin 
Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 The bout was scheduled for 10 rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Wangila's death came less than three months after British boxer Bradley Stone 
died as a result of injuries suffered during a bout in the London area on April 
26. Stone died two days later. 
</P>
<P>
 According to observers, Napunyi walked from the ring without visible problems, 
but 30 minutes later started vomiting, then collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the post-fight examination in the ring, he was very alert," Robert Voy, 
the ringside physician, said Friday. "He responded normally. There were no 
complaints of headaches." 
</P>
<P>
 At the hospital, doctors discovered a large blood clot on the right side of 
Wangila's head, according to Dr. Albert Capanna, who performed surgery Saturday 
morning. Napunyi was placed on a life-support system immediately after the 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Napunyi, who had a professional record of 22-5 and who received $2,500 for the 
fight, died at 10:30 a.m. Sunday, according to a University Medical Center 
spokesperson. 
</P>
<P>
 Napunyi gained major attention during the Seoul Olympics, and became a 
professional in 1989 as one of the most eagerly awaited welterweights in many 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 He was known as a the hardest hitter in the Olympics, but was later criticized 
for his work ethic. 
</P>
<P>
 He started 12-0, then lost his 13th pro fight, on a knockout by Eric Hernandez 
in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to quit and go back home to Kenya," Wangila said at the time. "I was 
looking bad and I wasn't making any progress at all." 
</P>
<P>
 The struggle continued for Wangila, who trained at times in the Los Angeles 
area and fought at the Irvine Marriott and, most recently, at the Forum, where 
he was knocked out by Australian Troy Waters on Oct. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Wangila, 175-5 with 165 KOs as an amateur, was knocked out at least four times 
in his pro career. 
</P>
<P>
 Wangila's was the first death resulting from a boxing match in Nevada since 
1982, when South Korean Deuk-Koo Kim died of head injuries sustained in a bout 
against Ray Mancini, World Boxing Assn. lightweight champion. 
</P>
<P>
 The reaction and criticism resulting from Kim's death caused world title bouts 
to be cut from 15 to 12 rounds.

MATTINGLY HELPS KO THE ANGELS; BASEBALL: HE HITS THREE-RUN HOMER OFF GRAHE 
AFTER LANGSTON TIRES IN NINTH, AND YANKEES WIN, 6-4. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The New York Yankees played eight innings of rope-a-dope with the Angels 
Sunday at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 When they grew weary of that, they sent Don Mattingly to the plate to land the 
haymaker that propelled them to a 6-4 come-from-behind victory and a four-game 
series sweep. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a new twist, but it worked just as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yankees had battered the Angels in the first three games, outscoring them, 
30-12, and outhitting them, 46-29. For eight innings Sunday, New York seemed 
content to wait out Angel left-hander Mark Langston. 
</P>
<P>
 When Langston tired, the Yankees pounced, and most of the crowd of 25,754, 
some waving brooms, loved it. 
</P>
<P>
 The game boiled down to Angel reliever Joe Grahe versus Mattingly with two on, 
one out and the Angels ahead, 4-2, in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 It turned out to be a mismatch all the way. Mattingly hit the right-hander's 
2-and-2 pitch over the right field wall for a three-run homer. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel Manager Marcel Lachemann insisted there was no other way around the 
matchup. Grahe is his closer, so he entrusted the club's fate to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Yankee Manager Buck Showalter sensed that, too, waiting for the right chance 
to spring one of five left-handed pinch-hitters against Grahe. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the five, Mattingly and Wade Boggs are likely to wind up in the Hall of 
Fame some day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like a kid in a candy shop," Showalter said over and over again. 
</P>
<P>
 Lachemann said Langston was exhausted and he wasn't going to leave him in the 
game to face the right-handed hitting Gerald Williams. Langston had given up 
seven hits with a season-high 10 strikeouts -- fanning Williams twice -- but 
had thrown 143 pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 Grahe replaced Langston, and Mattingly replaced Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, Mattingly circled the bases to a standing ovation, which left 
the Angels feeling doubly cursed. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, after Lachemann replaced Grahe with Mark Leiter, Lachemann motioned for 
Grahe to wait so they could walk off the field together. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess he was going to jump in front of the bullets on the way (into the 
dugout)," said Grahe, 2-5 with a 6.05 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
 Lachemann had this to say after the Angels fell to a season-low 16 games below 
.500: 
</P>
<P>
 "If they want to boo both of us that's fine. It's nothing new to me because 
I've been here before, but it's tough on the players. A guy hits a home run and 
everyone is cheering for him. These people want a winner and I understand, but 
it goes both ways." 
</P>
<P>
 The ninth inning unfolded in agonizing fashion for the Angels. Riding 
Langston's pitching and solo homers by Mark Dalesandro, Rex Hudler and J.T. 
Snow off Jim Abbott, the Angels led, 4-2. But trouble is never far away this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 After retiring Danny Tartabull to start the ninth, Langston gave up a single 
to Mike Stanley, then walked Jim Leyritz. 
</P>
<P>
 Lachemann had seen enough, deciding to turn to Grahe to preserve the victory. 
But it also brought up the inevitable confrontation. Showalter wasn't about to 
let Williams bat for himself, instead calling on Mattingly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't pinch-hit that often," Mattingly said after his first career pinch 
homer. "I got myself ready a couple of innings before. It looked like Langston 
was losing command, and all of the left-handers were just waiting to see who 
would get the call." 
</P>
<P>
 At the plate, Mattingly waited patiently, picking out what Grahe called "a fat 
one, obviously," sending it over the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was gone all the way," Mattingly said. 
</P>
<P>
 Grahe said: "I let the whole team down. I didn't just let Mark down." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite losing four games to the Yankees, the Angels remained five games 
behind first-place Texas in the American League West. The Rangers spent their 
weekend losing four in a row to Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 But talk of playoff contention was pretty far-fetched after Sunday's defeat. 
The Yankees clearly exposed all of the Angels' weaknesses in the course of the 
four games. 
</P>
<P>
 "They knocked me around pretty good, so I can't say anything bad about them," 
Grahe said.

SHEEHAN AVOIDS PLAYOFF AS GREEN BREAKS WRONG WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINE BRENNAN, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After four days, 72 holes and more than 270 shots by each player, the U.S. 
Women's Open was decided by a choice that amounted to a fraction of an inch, 
one way or the other. 
</P>
<P>
 If Tammie Green had aimed a little more to the left, her breaking, 12-foot 
birdie putt would have fallen into the right side of the cup, forcing a playoff 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 But because she didn't, Patty Sheehan won her second U.S. Women's Open in 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had so many near misses in the Open and so many disappointments that 
this is gratifying," said Sheehan, who also won in a playoff at Oakmont (Pa.) 
Country Club in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, 1990 (a collapse in the final round) has always been there, and I 
came close in '83 and '91. It is just a tournament that I have always wanted to 
win because it is on probably the most difficult golf course that we play all 
year long." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheehan shot a par 71 for a 277 total, seven under, and earned $155,000. Green 
shot a 71 and finished at 278. 
</P>
<P>
 Finishing a surprising third was Sweden's Liselotte Neumann, who fired a 
two-under 69 for a final score of 281. Her more infamous countrywoman, 36-hole 
leader Helen Alfredsson, dropped six more strokes to finish tied for ninth at 
one over par. 
</P>
<P>
 In a final round that had the look and feel of match play, Sheehan and Green, 
playing together in the last pairing, fired one can-you-top-this shot after 
another until, finally, they both stood on the huge 18th green with putts that 
could conceivably give them the most prestigious title in women's golf. 
</P>
<P>
 Surviving the most difficult of the four days on the Old Course at the 
Indianwood Golf and Country Club, Sheehan stared down a 30-foot putt to win the 
tournament, while Green, one stroke behind, paced around the 12-footer that 
could tie if Sheehan missed. 
</P>
<P>
 The shadows had grown long. The crowd around the green was still. 
</P>
<P>
 First came Sheehan, the 37-year-old Hall of Famer with one of the most 
patient, consistent games in golf. 
</P>
<P>
 She gave the putt a firm stroke, sending it gradually uphill, hoping it would 
fade slightly right to left into the cup. Instead, it scooted along the left 
edge of the hole and slid four feet by. 
</P>
<P>
 That was Green's chance. If she made her downhill 12-footer, she would go one 
under par for the day and tie Sheehan at seven under, forcing an 18-hole 
playoff. 
</P>
<P>
 She looked long and hard at the putt, deciding that if she aimed for the left 
edge of the cup, she would make it. 
</P>
<P>
 But a second or two after she stroked it, she knew she was wrong. It trickled 
by the right side, never touching the hole, and once Sheehan made her 
four-footer, it was over. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a good fight, but it just didn't end up like I'd wished it would," 
said Green, who won an LPGA tournament in Youngstown, Ohio, three weeks ago and 
finished second in nearby Toledo two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like I hung in there and gave Patty a run for her money."

HE PICKS UP A MOUNT, BUT DIES RIDING; HORSE RACING: LIMON TAKES OVER ON FILLY 
FOR LOS ALAMITOS RACE BECAUSE THE REGULAR JOCKEY IS LATE, THEN IS KILLED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 An unlikely series of events resulted in Juan Limon riding a 2-year-old filly 
in the seventh race at Los Alamitos on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the last ride of Limon's life. That filly, Ima Dashing Lady, stumbled 
25 yards from the finish of the Quarter Horse Futurity Trials. Thrown over the 
head of Ima Dashing Lady, Limon was crushed by the filly when she went down. 
The 35-year-old jockey suffered brain damage and died about 30 minutes after 
the race in the emergency room at Los Alamitos General Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Limon wasn't scheduled to ride Ima Dashing Lady in the 350-yard race. At entry 
time, trainer Blane Schvaneveldt had scheduled his son-in-law, Roman Figueroa, 
who had ridden Ima Dashing Lady to a third-place finish at Los Alamitos in her 
only previous start. 
</P>
<P>
 Figueroa, riding in the Lassie Stakes at Prescott Downs in Arizona on Saturday 
afternoon, couldn't get to Los Alamitos in time, and Schvaneveldt hired Limon 
to ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Figueroa has been married for seven years to the former Brenda Schvaneveldt, 
the trainer's daughter, who was on the verge of being engaged to Val Tonks in 
1983 when that 19-year-old jockey was killed in a spill at Los Alamitos. Tonks 
and Limon are the only jockeys to be killed in the 43-year history of the 
track. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Limon and I) were real good friends," said Blane Schvaneveldt, who was 
running a couple of horses at Los Alamitos on Sunday, but didn't go to the 
track to saddle them after the mishap. "We have these accidents very rarely, 
but when we have them they are very tragic." 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Figueroa was back riding at Prescott Downs. By phone between races, 
he talked about Limon being a jockey who was liked by everybody. Then, 
addressing the irony of his not making it to Los Alamitos in time, he said: 
"Somebody must have been watching over me." 
</P>
<P>
 Late Saturday afternoon, Figueroa and another jockey, Jose Badilla Jr., were 
scheduled to take a charter plane from the Prescott airport to Phoenix, to 
catch a commercial flight to Long Beach. But the races ran long at Prescott 
Downs and the two riders hired a direct charter from the local airport to Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Their two-hour flight actually reached Long Beach a little early. "But after 
that, nothing went right," Figueroa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Badilla's girl friend had arranged to meet the jockeys at Long Beach, but 
apparently their charter landed at a different terminal. The jockeys left 
without her, taking a cab. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew the way, but the driver was confused," Figueroa said. "He got some 
maps out and tried to figure it out." 
</P>
<P>
 The stewards at Los Alamitos were allowing trainers to replace the tardy 
jockeys on a race-by-race basis. The cab carrying Figueroa and Badilla arrived 
in the track's parking lot as the horses were entering the track for the 
seventh race, with Limon in Ima Dashing Lady's saddle. 
</P>
<P>
 Figueroa watched the race on a television monitor in the jockeys' room. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looked like the filly might have (tangled her hoofs) or broken down," he 
said. "It looked like Juan was going to be all right. I've been in spills 
exactly like that. You break some ribs, or maybe a collarbone. That's what I 
thought might have happened this time." 
</P>
<P>
 Ima Dashing Lady bounced back up and ran off, apparently not injured. Jimmy 
Lewis was riding Doctor Gaskill, the colt who won the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "Out of the corner of my eye, I could see the other horse (Ima Dashing Lady) 
near me," Lewis said. "The filly was making a little bit of a run. About 25 
yards from the wire, out of the corner of my eye, I could see her go down. I 
looked back and it looked like she fell on Juan." 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Mitchell, the trainer of Merry Freddy, another horse in the race, was 
among the first to reach Limon. "Danny told me that Juan never took a breath," 
said Steve Treasure, who rode Merry Freddy. 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Jalisco, Mexico, Limon lived in Buena Park with his wife, Rosie, 
and their 4-year-old daughter. Los Alamitos officials said that Limon had two 
children from a previous marriage who live in Fresno. Limon had won 19 races at 
the meet and ranked ninth in the standings. 
</P>
<P>
 After beginning his career in Utah, Limon came to Los Alamitos in 1986, 
winning 205 races and five stakes. His biggest victory came aboard Mighty Easy 
Pass in the $400,000 Denim N Diamonds Futurity and this year he won the 
$100,000 California Sires Cup Futurity with Dash Of Cider, whom he was 
scheduled to ride later on Saturday night's card. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a bad deal," Figueroa said. "He was a good man. He stood by what he 
said. He had had some bad breaks, some injuries, that slowed him down, but he 
was putting everything back together again." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Mike Hidinger, the jockey room custodian: "Juan was a quiet guy and 
everybody liked him. He wouldn't have said a mean word if you had hit him with 
a club." 
</P>
<P>
 Visitation for Limon will be from 3 to 6 p.m. today at the Hilgenfeld Mortuary 
in Anaheim, with a Rosary at 6 p.m. A Mass will be said Tuesday at noon at St. 
Anthony Claret Catholic Church in Anaheim and the body will be returned to 
Jalisco, Mexico, for burial. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Allred, president of the Horsemen's Quarter Horse Racing Assn., said his 
group will pay for funeral expenses and the shipment of the body to Mexico. 
Limon will be buried in Allred's racing silks and a trust fund will be 
established for the jockey's family. Before the thoroughbred races at Hollywood 
Park Sunday, the jockeys observed a moment of silence for Limon and the track's 
flag was flown at half staff.

MIKE DOWNEY: IT'S TIME TO START DELIVERING AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Dodgers and Giants open a crucial, critical, vital, urgent, pretty 
important series tonight at Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Williams will be there, eager to hit his 62nd homer by Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Darryl Strawberry will be there, doing whatever he can, as always, to help the 
Dodgers beat the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Bonds will be there, prepared to deliver several clutch hits, this not 
being October. 
</P>
<P>
 But which Dodgers will show up -- the hustling ones who dominated their 
division for half the season or the struggling ones who hope never to visit 
Montreal again? 
</P>
<P>
 The National League West, which turned out to be every bit as embarrassing as 
the American League West, is in serious jeopardy of being represented in the 
1994 playoffs by the Colorado Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado could become the first playoff team in baseball history on which I 
can name only one player. 
</P>
<P>
 I had been counting on the Dodgers to run away with this season's division 
race, then perhaps play the Yankees in the World Series. Instead, we could be 
looking at that Colorado Rockies-Texas Rangers, uh, Fall Classic that would 
draw TV ratings right up there with Bulgaria vs. Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, let's not give up on the Dodgers, who still have a chance to win this 
thing as long as their starting pitchers pitch nothing but complete games over 
the next 64 dates. 
</P>
<P>
 Boy, could we use that Valenzuela kid now, huh? 
</P>
<P>
 For a club that has been in first place for months, the Dodgers sure have been 
unlucky. They've had everything go wrong but ceiling tiles falling on the fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Unluckiest of all has been Delino DeShields, the Mister Bill doll of second 
basemen, who has had every conceivable bit of bad luck except falling into the 
LaBrea tar pits. 
</P>
<P>
 And when everything seemed to be calming down for him, DeShields stepped up to 
home plate Saturday, looked up at the center field scoreboard in Montreal and 
found out that his wife was pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, I don't know about you, but if I ever have a wife and she ever has a 
baby, I would rather not find out about it on the scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
 I want her to come up to me and say: "Honey, have I got news for you." Or say: 
"Honey, you'll never guess what the doctor told me." Or say: "Honey, you know 
that good-looking mailman we have?" 
</P>
<P>
 But DeShields got the news from a full-color jumbo screen before a paid 
attendance of 35,831, right between the guess-tonight's-attendance game and the 
blooper video. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guess what?" the scoreboard reported. 
</P>
<P>
 DeShields, whose nickname is Bop, must have blinked as though the scoreboard 
was speaking to him personally, the way those freeway signs did to Steve Martin 
in "L.A. Story." 
</P>
<P>
 "Another Baby Bop, Love, Tisha." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, I have heard of infield chatter distracting a batter. I've heard of 
"hey, batta, batta" distracting a batter. I've heard of "Dar-ryl! Dar-ryl!" 
distracting a batter. But never baby talk. Never gootchy-gootchy-goo. 
</P>
<P>
 Pop Bop got called out on strikes on four pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 And let's face it, the Dodgers need all the hits they can get. They can never 
get enough runs, because no lead is safe. Going into Sunday's play, only one 
pitching staff in baseball, Detroit's, had fewer saves. Joe Grahe of the Angels 
has more saves than the Dodgers' entire active roster. 
</P>
<P>
 Being in first place didn't keep the Dodgers from tinkering with their team. 
They demoted their starting shortstop and a six-save relief pitcher to the 
minors. They also let Strawberry go so that Robert Shapiro could concentrate on 
other clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the Giants are closing in. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to mention the hated Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego? No, San Diego is still in the middle of that big 
turn-of-the-century rebuilding plan. 
</P>
<P>
 I still believe the Dodgers have better things to do this season than play 
spoiler to San Francisco in the season-ending series. I believe we will still 
have some great nights at Dodger Stadium, as soon as they clean up after those 
three tenors. 
</P>
<P>
 But first, the Dodgers have some important business at Candlestick Park. They 
should all check in with their wives before the game, ask if anything's new.

GOODWILL GAMES ROUNDUP; U.S., WITHOUT NBA, LOSES TO RUSSIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Where's the Dream Team when the United States needs it? 
</P>
<P>
 With no NBA stars to help out, a group of American college players struggled 
again in international competition, losing to the Russians, 77-75, at the 
Goodwill Games on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Collegiate-level teams have won only the 1993 World University Games since 
taking a gold medal in the 1986 Goodwill Games. U.S. teams have been beaten in 
the 1988 Olympic Games, the Pan Am Games, the World Championships and the 1990 
Goodwill Games. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our players are now more determined than ever to get into the gold-medal 
round," U.S. Coach George Raveling said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russians, playing a tough defense that prevented the Americans from 
getting the ball inside, took the lead for good, 60-58, with less than seven 
minutes to play on two free throws by Andrei Fetisov, drafted by the Boston 
Celtics last month and then traded to the Milwaukee Bucks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russians held off every ensuing U.S. challenge by making their free 
throws. The Americans missed several key free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 Sergei Bazarevich led the Russians with 23 points. Sergei Babkov, who did not 
play in Saturday night's 95-93 victory over China, scored 18. Fetisov had nine. 
</P>
<P>
 Shawn Respert of Michigan State, who hit a three-pointer just before the 
buzzer, led the Americans with 17 points, but was six for 16 from the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Reserve Michael Finley of Wisconsin provided a lift off the bench, scoring 14 
points; Damon Stoudamire of Arizona had 11. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russians made 24 of 28 free throws, but the Americans were only 14 of 27 
from the line. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could have gotten out of here with a win if we had made our foul shots," 
Raveling said. "The game came down to which team was most successful at the 
foul line. The Russians made theirs in critical times, we missed ours." 
</P>
<P>
 The Americans still can reach the medal round if they defeat China today and 
Russia beats Argentina. China is 0-2 after losing to Argentina, 74-49, Sunday 
night. SWIMMING 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander Popov won the 50- and 100-meter freestyle races; he defeated world 
record-holder Tom Jager in the 50 in a slow time of 22.55 seconds. Popov, 
American Angel Martino and Chinese swimmer Ren Xing each won two gold medals. 
China won five of the 10 women's events. TRACK AND FIELD 
</P>
<P>
 Lance Deal became the first American hammer thrower to win a major 
international competition since Harold Connolly in the 1956 Olympics and the 
first American to surpass 262 feet 5 inches overseas, winning at 263-1. 
Britain's Sally Gunnell, the 1992 Olympic champion and 1993 world champion, won 
the women's 400-meter hurdles in 53.51 seconds, the fastest time in the world 
this year. Quincy Watts, the 1992 Olympic gold medalist at 400 meters, won for 
the first time this year, in 45.21, edging Britain's Duane Ladejo, who had the 
same time. Gwen Torrence won the women's 100 in 10.95. BOXING 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. boxers won one of four matches. At 132 pounds, Larry Nicholson of Tyler, 
Tex., defeated Arthur Santana of the Netherlands, 17-4. Terrance Cauthen of 
Philadelphia lost in the same weight class, 7-6, to Bruno Wartelle of France. 
At 157 pounds, Jesse Aquino of Kansas City lost, 10-1, to Dirk Dzemski of 
Germany. At 201 pounds, Darrell Dixon of Tacoma, Wash., lost, 11-3, to Peer 
Mueller of Germany.

MORNING BRIEFING: UH, OH, OH, CANADA GETS AN APOLOGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The owner of Las Vegas' Canadian Football League team has apologized to all 
Canadians after singer Dennis Parks mangled the words and tune of their 
national anthem. 
</P>
<P>
 Posse owner Rick Mileti apologized for Parks turning "O Canada" into "Uh Oh 
Canada" July 16 before the first CFL game in Las Vegas, a 32-22 overtime 
victory against Saskatchewan. 
</P>
<P>
 "By way of explanation, but not excuse, this singer was recommended to us out 
of Los Angeles as a professional who had sung your anthem many times for the 
Olympics," Mileti said in a letter to Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien. 
"Obviously, we were misled." 
</P>
<P>
 Add anthem: Vice President Al Gore, in Ottawa for a meeting with Chretien, 
even mentioned the incident in a speech. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was certainly glad to see that the U.S. football players reacted so 
strongly and better than the singer," Gore told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who is the oldest player to win the American League batting 
title? 
</P>
<P>
 Family life: Craig Griffey, younger brother of Ken Jr. and an outfielder with 
Seattle's Double-A Jacksonville farm team, finds the attention being paid his 
brother amusing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a big deal at all to me," Craig told Paul Meyer of the Pittsburgh 
Post-Gazette. "I think it's kind of funny. It's weird seeing all the reporters 
wanting to talk to him. I've known him a long time. I wonder why anybody would 
want to talk to him." 
</P>
<P>
 First hand: Former Raider defensive end Greg Townsend and former Eagle 
linebacker Jerry Robinson were roommates when Townsend joined the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll never forget when I first came in the league and all he ever talked 
about was Philly this and Philly that," Townsend said after signing a one-year 
contract with Philadelphia. "Every night, I heard about what a great place 
Philly was. I guess I'll get to find out for myself." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a fact: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, born Lew Alcindor, weighed 12 pounds at 
birth. 
</P>
<P>
 He can't hide: Simon Hobday, the new U.S. Senior Open champion from South 
Africa, once had a terrible problem with his putting. At one tournament, he 
played with a wide-brimmed straw hat. 
</P>
<P>
 When he missed a putt that lipped the cut and spun away, he look skyward and 
said: "Oh, God, I hoped you wouldn't recognize me in this hat." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Ted Williams, who was 40 in 1958 when he hit .328 for the 
Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>

Kelly: "At 34, the Bills' quarterback may not be over the hill, but he can see 
the top of it." SHAV GLICK

DATELINE: ST. PETERSBURG; INSTEAD OF A DREAM, RAVELING OFFERS A WAKEUP CALL ON 
LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although the young men selected to play basketball for the United States in 
the Goodwill Games would not be confused with even a college Dream Team and 
most of the Russians who beat them by two points Sunday are seasoned 
professionals, Coach George Raveling is aware that few people at home will 
understand still another international defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 He feels pressure to win the gold medal here, which the United States still 
has a chance to accomplish, and does not apologize for passing that feeling on 
to his players. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the reality of life that nothing less than a gold medal is going to 
satisfy the American thirst," he said last week. 
</P>
<P>
 But Raveling, who is spending his summer vacation from USC by coaching the 
U.S. team, has not allowed that goal to diminish his other role -- as an 
educator who knows that the gym is not all there is to life. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether or not it is fair, officials of USA Basketball, which governs U.S. 
teams in international competition, have become recognized as the 
quintessential ugly Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 It was their decision to send the U.S. men to luxury quarters in Miami between 
games of the 1991 Pan American Games at Havana. And although they had no 
control over the behavior of Bob Knight during the 1979 Pan American Games in 
Puerto Rico or of John Thompson during the 1988 Summer Olympics at Seoul, it 
was their decision to appoint them as U.S. coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 But if USA Basketball must accept at least a share of the blame for Knight and 
Thompson, then it deserves the credit for Raveling. 
</P>
<P>
 When he appeared at a news conference last week, he did not bring players with 
him. He had sent them on a tour of the spectacular St. Isaac's Cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it would be a failure for us to come this far and not take 
advantage of the educational experience available to us in a city of such 
historical significance," Raveling said. "You almost have to thrust it on the 
players, but later in life they'll appreciate that we did." 
</P>
<P>
 They will see other famous tourist attractions before returning home, but that 
is not all. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking forward to them taking a bus into the city, getting away from the 
tourist spots and getting a bird's-eye view of the people," Raveling said. "I 
want them to see the stark contrast that exists between life on the street here 
and in Washington, Chicago and L.A." RANDY HARVEY

WATER TURNS GREEN, SWIMMERS STAY TAN; GOODWILL GAMES: SWEDES GO HOME, BUT U.S. 
TEAM COMPETES; TIMES ARE SLOW IN STILL-MURKY POOL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 They laughed about it, sang songs about it, bottled it and, eventually, even 
swam in it. Well, most of them did. The Swedes took one glance at it Sunday and 
said dasvadanya . 
</P>
<P>
 It was the water for the Goodwill Games in the SKA Swimming Pool, which Martin 
Zubero, a Floridian who represents Spain, renamed "the Black Lagoon." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the water was not black. It was more like evergreen. 
</P>
<P>
 When B.J. Bedford of Etna, N.H., climbed out of it, the first thing she did 
was to make sure she was still tan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I would come out of there looking like the Incredible Hulk," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bedford made her comment after the first of her three races, which was one 
fewer than some swam as all 20 events were held on one day. The first half of 
the program had been scheduled for Saturday, but was postponed after a mishap 
last week involving the charcoal in the filtration system, which made the water 
look like the La Brea Tar Pits. Sunday, it was considered clear enough for 
swimming. 
</P>
<P>
 The times, even for a lull in the season when most of the swimmers are not 
shaved and tapered, were slow as swimmers could not see the wall from more than 
a foot or two away and therefore became tentative on their turns. 
</P>
<P>
 In the women's 400-meter medley, Chinese backstroker Bai Xiuyu flipped into 
her turn too early and had to take two freestyle strokes instead of one to 
reach the wall. That should have cost the Chinese a disqualification, but they 
instead were awarded the gold medal as the violation was overlooked. Bai 
admitted her error and apologized, saying that she was disoriented because of 
the murky water. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Coach Frank Comfort of North Carolina, whose relay team finished second, 
is still trying to figure how that affected a swimmer who spends virtually her 
entire race looking at the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've just got to roll with the punches," he said with a shrug. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. team has taken more of them than Chuck Wepner, the "Bayonne Bleeder," 
since arriving here last Wednesday. That was the day the pool was closed. In 
search of an alternative for practice Thursday, the swimmers were taken to a 
naval base an hour and a half outside the city. The pool there was one that 
only algae could love. They found a better pool closer to their hotel Friday, 
but it was only 25 meters long. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the night the organizers decided to push back the start of the 
swimming by 24 hours. That also was the night the U.S. swimmers took a poll to 
find out how many thought they would ever be allowed to compete. The answer was 
none. 
</P>
<P>
 But they maintained their sense of perspective, sightseeing during the day and 
talking positively at night. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're spoiled," said Angel Martino of Americus, Ga. "We're so used to 
everything going perfectly in the United States. Then we go to an international 
competition where everything is not perfect and we let it blow our cool. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had some meetings here, just with the swimmers, to remind ourselves to 
relax. We didn't elect a captain. We just said that everyone on the team is a 
captain." 
</P>
<P>
 They did, however, elect a designated complainer. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking a cue from "The Lion King," the swimmers sang "Hakuna Matata," which 
roughly translates to "Don't Worry, Be Happy." Between choruses, Melvin Stewart 
of Charlotte, N.C., supplied the complaint of the moment. He had plenty to 
choose from -- jet lag, stomach cramps, malnutrition, water from the tap, water 
in the pool, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the biggest wimp in the world," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday afternoon, the team finally got permission to enter the SKA Swimming 
Pool. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first swimmers in was Scott Jett of Sanger, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's water, just like American water," he told his teammates when he emerged. 
</P>
<P>
 Qualifying the remark later for reporters, he said: "I grew up swimming in 
lakes and rivers." 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart dived and wrote his name with his finger in the dirt at the bottom. 
Others filled bottles with the water to take home as souvenirs. "No one would 
believe us if we just tried to explain it to them," said Nicole Haislett of St. 
Petersburg -- the one in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 After Sunday's morning session, Haislett was no longer able to maintain her 
happy face. She acted as if she would rather have been on a plane home, like 
the Swedes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think maybe that would have been an option for us if we weren't so far from 
home," she said. "But to come this far and go home without doing anything would 
have been silly. But I don't blame the Swedes." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if she was glad she came, she said: "Honestly? Not really. While I'm 
here, I'm trying to make the best of it. But I'd rather have stayed home with 
my own schedule, my own training." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve West, a breaststroker from Huntington Beach, said he had no problem with 
the water because he swims with his eyes closed. He swam a personal best while 
finishing second in the 200-meter breaststroke behind Russia's Andrei Ivanov. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was suggested that the water was too warm, another complaint of the 
swimmers, he said: "Just a little." 
</P>
<P>
 One of his Russian competitors, Andrei Korneyev, interrupted. "Not just a 
little," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 By Sunday night, the heat of the water had been turned down and the color had 
improved to olive green. Claiming that she could detect the lanes even in the 
deep end, Michelle Griglione said the pool was better than the one where she 
earned her water wings at the Alexandria, Va., YMCA. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course," she added, "the health department closed that one down."

INDURAIN LEAVES DOUBTERS NOTHING TO QUESTION; TOUR DE FRANCE: SPANIARD WINS 
WORLD'S PREMIER CYCLING EVENT FOR FOURTH CONSECUTIVE TIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Miguel Indurain answered his critics Sunday by riding into history with his 
fourth consecutive Tour de France victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going downhill yet," the 30-year-old Spanish cyclist said. "After my 
third place (earlier this year) in the Tour of Italy, everyone started 
questioning things. I answered on the road, in the Tour." 
</P>
<P>
 He did it in convincing fashion, winning the world's premier cycling event by 
the largest margin in six years. 
</P>
<P>
 On whether he will have the incentive to try to win an unprecedented fifth 
consecutive Tour, Indurain said he will have to wait and see. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's still a year to go before the fifth one and we have to train with 
hope and drive," he said. "Whether it's possible or not, only the road can say 
for sure." 
</P>
<P>
 Jacques Anquetil of France and Eddy Merckx of Belgium are the others to win 
four in a row, and five overall. France's Bernard Hinault also won the race 
five times. 
</P>
<P>
 Indurain seemed to get stronger as the 21-stage race rolled along. Meanwhile, 
his biggest challengers of the past -- Tony Rominger, Claudio Chiappucci and 
Gianni Bugno -- were out of the race by the end of the second week, victims of 
illness or exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rominger, Chiappucci and the others were sick," Indurain said. "I think a lot 
of riders enter the Tour tired after a lot of early season races. The Tour 
doesn't pardon anyone. You have to begin with reserves." 
</P>
<P>
 And though this year's race was especially demanding because of hot weather, 
Indurain won by the biggest margin since 1988, crossing the line after the 
final 109-mile stage with an overall time 5 minutes 39 seconds better than 
Piotr Ugrumov of Latvia. Marco Pantani of Italy was third, 7:19 back. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the crowds cheering Indurain on the Champs-Elysees were eight busloads 
of fans from Villava, his Pyrenees hometown of 7,500. Back home, cycling fans 
rang church bells, shot off fireworks and uncorked champagne. 
</P>
<P>
 Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez sent a telegram praising Indurain's 
"capacity for sacrifice, class and healthy spirit of competition." 
</P>
<P>
 Indurain rode near the head of the pack most of the day on the final stage 
from Euro Disneyland to the Champs-Elysees. 
</P>
<P>
 The stage was won by France's Eddy Seigneur. Indurain finished in the pack 
with the other leaders Sunday, 29 seconds behind Seigneur. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spaniard said he did not expect to win the final stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was difficult to win (Sunday) because the Champs-Elysees is reserved for 
the sprinters," he said.

SWIMMING; BURGESS WAKES UP IN TIME TO SHATTER MEET RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY WITHERSPOON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Greg Burgess, the 1992 Olympic silver-medalist in the 200-meter individual 
medley, won the event at the Janet Evans Invitational at USC on Sunday night 
with a time of 2:03.32, breaking the meet record he set last year by 1.27 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Burgess had given little indication that he would go that fast in the finals 
after clocking a relatively slow 2:08.82 in the morning's preliminary heats. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just get a little sluggish in the morning and when there's not very much 
competition," said Burgess, 22, of Jacksonville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Burgess' performance gives him momentum going into the U.S. national 
championships at Indianapolis, Aug. 14-19, when he will compete for a chance to 
represent the United States at the World Championships in Rome in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Burgess, who used the meet as a warm-up for the U.S. nationals, 
Christopher Mitchell, 22, of Atlanta, Ga., used it to jump-start his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell won the 100 breaststroke in 1:03.90, after winning the 200 
breaststroke on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell was diagnosed with mononucleosis last August and dropped out of 
swimming. 
</P>
<P>
 He decided three months ago that he would try to make a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashley Tappin, 19, of Metairie, La., won the 100 butterfly in 1:02.52. 
</P>
<P>
 Allison Wagner, 17, of Gainesville, Fla., won the 200 individual medley in 
2:17.22. 
</P>
<P>
 Hisato Yasui set a Japanese national record in the 1,500-meter freestyle, 
winning in a meet-record 15:26.18. Yasui's Japanese teammates ran around the 
pool deck waving a Japanese flag while he accepted his award. 
</P>
<P>
 Kyoko Iwasaki, 15, of Japan also set a Japanese record when she won the 100 
breaststroke in 1:11.59. Kristine Quance of the Trojan Swim Club finished 
second in the event, .33 seconds behind Iwasaki. She also placed third in the 
200 individual medley. 
</P>
<P>
 Quance, 19, of Northridge, won four events at the 1992 U.S. nationals, but is 
recovering from a shoulder injury.

LAPORTE SEES ENOUGH OF PADILLA'S PUNCHES; BOXING: AZUSA FIGHTER RETAINS HIS 
TITLE WHEN OPPONENT QUITS AFTER 10 BECAUSE OF LIMITED VISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 They checked their ballet shoes at the door, charged into each other for 10 
rounds and exited bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's boxing," Azusa's Zack Padilla said when it was over. "That's how they 
did it in the olden days. Nobody was dancing, we just started out fighting." 
</P>
<P>
 In a frenetic display of punching, Padilla shook off several hard overhand 
rights to the cheek by veteran Juan LaPorte and ignored a small cut over his 
left eye to retain his World Boxing Organization junior-welterweight title 
before a loud, mainly pro-Padilla crowd of about 3,000 at the Grand Olympic 
Auditorium on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 After several rounds when both fighters leaned in close and fired scores of 
short, hard shots to the body and head, Padilla (22-1-1, 14 knockouts) won when 
LaPorte quit before the 11th round because of limited vision in his left eye. 
</P>
<P>
 LaPorte (40-15) said he settled for the technical knockout because he had 
injured the eye in training and didn't want to risk serious damage. "Zack's 
just a machine," LaPorte, a former featherweight champion, said. "He kept 
punching." 
</P>
<P>
 LaPorte caught Padilla early in the first round with a sweeping right hand 
that seemed to stun him, but Padilla recovered quickly enough to dominate most 
of the early and middle rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before the fight, I said he was going to come out throwing that big right 
hand, and that's exactly what he did," Padilla said. "See, I knew what I was 
talking about. But I felt his punches were weak." 
</P>
<P>
 Padilla immediately began buzzing LaPorte with his trademark machine-gun 
attack, drawing in close, ducking under the rights and hitting LaPorte with 
hundreds of short-armed shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once I knew I could smother him, I knew I could execute what I wanted to do," 
Padilla said. " 
</P>
<P>
 Although LaPorte looked weary in the middle rounds, he seemed to find strength 
in the seventh -- and the eighth was three minutes of short-range blasting from 
both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 But Padilla's attack never wavered, and by the ninth, LaPorte was catching 
blow after blow on the face and hearing the roars of Padilla's fans. 
</P>
<P>
 In an earlier 10-round bout, highly regarded Pomona lightweight prospect Shane 
Mosley blitzed through Narciso Valenzuela, scoring a fifth-round 
technical-knockout. 
</P>
<P>
 Valenzuela, who was knocked out by Oscar De La Hoya last October and lost to 
Carlos Hernandez earlier this year, said after the fight that he thought 
Mosley, who concentrated on the body, hit harder than De La Hoya. 
</P>
<P>
 Mosley said: "I felt like he was soft in the midsection, so early on I went to 
the head, then tried to sneak in shots to the body." 
</P>
<P>
 Mosley (13-0, 12 KOs) caught Valenzuela with a perfect left hook to the side 
in the third round that sent Valenzuela (35-17-2) toppling to the canvas, then 
scored the TKO when Valenzuela was left defenseless two rounds later.

PHILLIPS TO DEFEND TITLE AT FORUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Champion Verno Phillips and No. 1 contender Jaime Llanes will meet tonight at 
the Forum in a World Boxing Organization junior-middleweight title bout. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers decided to return to holding fights on Monday nights, abandoning a 
short-lived experiment with Fridays. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the second consecutive Los Angeles-based championship fight for the 
lightly regarded WBO, which sanctioned a junior-welterweight match at the Grand 
Olympic Auditorium on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York-based Phillips (22-4-1, 12 knockouts) won the WBO championship, 
which is not considered a major title, in Phoenix on Oct. 30 over local 
favorite Lupe Aquino, and is undefeated (14-0-1) in his last 15 bouts. This is 
Phillips' first official defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Llanes is 27-2, with 26 KOs, and has won 24 consecutive bouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the card is a scheduled 10-rounder between the World Boxing Assn.'s 
No. 2-ranked lightweight, Fabian Tejada (37-3-2, 29 KOs), and Mauricio Aceves, 
who has lost his last six fights. TIM KAWAKAMI

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; WHITE SOX WIN FINAL MEETING WITH INDIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eight exciting games in 11 days left the Chicago White Sox and Cleveland 
Indians voicing the same lament Sunday: Too bad it's not September. 
</P>
<P>
 Julio Franco homered and drove in three runs and Alex Fernandez slowed down 
the Indians as the White Sox won, 4-2, at Cleveland in the final game of the 
season between the Central Division leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 The White Sox and Indians split their final four-game series, keeping Chicago 
two games in front. The teams also split four games in Chicago last weekend. 
The White Sox won the season series, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played them 12 games, regardless," White Sox Manager Gene Lamont said. 
"For the fans' sake and baseball's, it's real interesting to play them in 
September, to play the contenders in the heat of the pennant race. We can't do 
that because the schedule is made up." 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, the Indians seemed satisfied that they had made a decent 
impression in what was perhaps their most important series in a generation. 
They haven't been pennant contenders since the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen this much media before in Cleveland," losing pitcher Charles 
Nagy said. "It was a big series for the fans. Who knows? It might help us down 
the road. People talked about must-win games, and it's only the end of July. We 
proved we can beat each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez (10-7) gave up two runs and six hits in eight innings, quieting a 
Cleveland lineup that had scored 25 runs over the previous three games. He 
struck out five, walked one and improved to 5-0 over his last eight starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto 4, Texas 2 -- The Blue Jays won their eighth consecutive game as they 
completed a four-game sweep of the West Division-leading Rangers at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Cornett gave up five hits in six innings for his first major league 
victory for the two-time defending World Series champions, who are 7-0 at home 
since the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Molitor led off the eighth inning with his 14th homer and fourth in four 
games to put Toronto ahead, 4-2, and help hand the Rangers their fifth loss in 
six games. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 8, Seattle 2 -- Mike Greenwell homered and John Valentin drove in three 
runs to lead the Red Sox at Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston and Seattle split the four-game series, which was moved to Boston 
because of falling ceiling tiles in the Kingdome. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Sox got six hits and scored three runs in the first inning against 
George Glinatsis (0-1), who began the season in Class A. He lasted only 
two-thirds of an inning in his second major league start. Valentin hit a 
two-run homer and Tom Brunansky had a run-scoring double. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City 6, Detroit 4 -- Jose DeJesus pitched five innings to gain his 
first major league victory in nearly three years as the Royals won for only the 
fourth time in their last 11 road games. 
</P>
<P>
 DeJesus, called up from triple-A Omaha on July 16, was making his first start 
of the season and gave up five hits and three runs. He won for the first time 
since Aug. 31, 1991 when the Philadelphia Phillies beat Atlanta, 10-4.  
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota 10, Milwaukee 6 -- Kirby Puckett's two-run homer highlighted a 
five-run seventh inning for the Twins at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 Puckett drove in four runs. Kent Hrbek hit a three-run homer for the Twins. 
Dave Winfield added a solo homer and Chuck Knoblauch scored four runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland 7, Baltimore 6 -- Rickey Henderson scored on a wild pitch by Mark 
Eichhorn in the bottom of the ninth inning at Oakland to give the Athletics the 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Hemond hit a three-run homer against Alan Mills in the eighth to tie the 
score at 6-6. The A's trailed, 6-0, after six innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went up there with kind of a pinch hitter's mentality. I didn't want to let 
him get ahead of me," Hemond said. "So I was looking for a fastball, something 
good to hit."

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; BONDS' SINGLE OFF OLD NEMESIS LIFTS GIANTS TO AN 8-6 
VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Barry Bonds looked like anything but a .193 hitter against John Franco when he 
faced the New York Mets' relief ace Sunday at Shea Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds hit a two-out, two-run single off his nemesis with the bases loaded in 
the eighth inning, leading the San Francisco Giants to an 8-6 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Franco has always had success going right at you with his fastball," Bonds 
said. "Obviously, in that kind of a situation, I enjoyed it. Every player wants 
that kind of an opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds drove in three runs on his 30th birthday. He keyed a three-run rally in 
the eighth inning, capped by Matt Williams' run-scoring single. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants are 12-2 since the arrival of Darryl Strawberry, who had a hit and 
drove in a run. Bonds has 18 runs batted in since Strawberry joined the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory pulled San Francisco to within 1 1/2 games of the West 
Division-leading Dodgers, who open a three-game series tonight at Candlestick 
Park. It will be the first time Strawberry has faced the Dodgers since they 
released him earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, there are no extra juices," Strawberry said of the upcoming series. "I'm 
now playing for the Giants and I do my job for the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking forward to the series after this long road trip and I'm no more 
concerned that it's the Dodgers than if it were any other team." 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds, who had two hits, is batting .455 (20 for 44) and has eight homers and 
17 RBIs on the trip.  
</P>
<P>
 In the eighth, the bases were loaded when Franco was brought in to face him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Franco has always given Barry trouble," Giant Manager Dusty Baker said. "He 
was only hitting .193 against him, but left-handed batters always seem to do 
well against him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Barry gave himself and us a present. It was his 30th birthday and I'm sure 
he's enjoying it." 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 13, Pittsburgh 1 -- Jeff Bagwell homered twice and drove in five runs 
and Craig Biggio hit a grand slam to lead the Astros at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston won three of the four games in the series, outscoring the Pirates, 
38-11. The Astros pulled to within one game of the Central Division-leading 
Cincinnati Reds, and begin a three-game series at Cincinnati tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Bagwell leads the majors with 98 RBIs. He has hit 32 home runs. His 20 homers 
this season at the Astrodome broke the team record of 18 set by Lee May in 
1974. He had a two-run single in the third inning, then hit a solo homer in the 
sixth and a two-run homer in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 3, Cincinnati 0 -- Fill-in starter Jim Bullinger and Randy Myers 
combined on a five-hitter at Chicago and Mark Grace hit two doubles and drove 
in a run. 
</P>
<P>
 Bullinger (5-2) pitched in place of Steve Trachsel, who is bothered by a 
blister. Bullinger pitched eight innings, giving up five hits. Myers pitched 
the ninth for his 20th save. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 5, San Diego 3 -- Danny Jackson pitched seven innings at 
Philadelphia and won his 13th game -- his highest victory total in six years. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson (13-4), who yielded five hits and two runs, struck out seven and 
walked none. The last time he won 13 or more games was 1988, when he was 23-8 
for Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Jones pitched 1 1/3 innings for his league-leading 26th save. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida 6, Colorado 4 -- Gary Sheffield had five hits, including a two-run 
homer in the ninth inning, to give the Marlins the victory before 68,045 at 
Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Carr led off the ninth with a walk. Sheffield, who had four singles in 
his previous at-bats, followed with his 22nd homer. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 8, St. Louis 5 -- Charlie O'Brien and Jose Oliva hit three-run homers 
to lead the Braves at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Glavine (12-8) won for the fourth time in his last five starts, although 
he gave up five runs and 12 hits in 7 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien's homer, his seventh, capped a four-run rally in the fourth inning 
against Bob Tewksbury (10-10) and gave Atlanta the lead for good.

 Jimmy Spencer outraced and outmaneuvered teammate Bill Elliott to win the 
DieHard 500 at Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer, with Elliott close behind, took the lead with 19 laps remaining in 
the 188-lap race, then held off Elliott, winless since November of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got me one heck of a race car," Spencer said. "Awesome, man. Never in my 
life have I had a race car handle like this. I had my foot in it all day long." 
</P>
<P>
 In the last five laps, Elliott, the 1988 Winston Cup champion, tried to go 
outside Spencer. Then he tried to go inside his teammate's car. He even tried 
to feint to one side and drive to the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Elliott: "I didn't know what else to do. He had a faster car, that's all 
there is to it."

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; OFFERMAN PLAYING WELL, CLAIRE SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 While Fred Claire, executive vice president, says he wants to keep Rafael 
Bournigal as the starting shortstop, his stance on bringing Jose Offerman back 
appears to be softening. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one thing I think (Offerman) could give us would be more on offense," 
said Claire, who said Offerman is playing well for triple-A Albuquerque. 
"(Offerman) is strong and he will drive the ball more. But Rafael's on-base 
percentage is good and he has made some heads-up running plays." 
</P>
<P>
 When Montreal Coach Timmy Johnson was the manager of the Dodgers' rookie team 
at Great Falls, Mont., his shortstops at one time or another included 
Bournigal, Offerman and Jose Vizcaino, now the shortstop for the New York Mets. 
But Johnson said Bournigal was the best defensive shortstop he has ever 
managed.  
</P>
<P>
 "(Delino) DeShields is the best infielder ever, shortstop or second," Johnson 
said. "But Bournigal can play as well as anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 A year after Bournigal arrived, Offerman did. "Offerman was No. 1 offensively, 
he did everything," Johnson said. "He ran and made things happen and we thought 
he would be a better (all-around) player, a Garry Templeton type. I still think 
(Offerman) can be."

 On the day after Italy lost the World Cup final, an Italian newspaper ran a 
story on catcher Mike Piazza. The headline was titled, "The Baggio of 
Baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza, though, is rarely recognized in Montreal. On his way to the ballpark 
on Saturday, he walked to the Metro, took the subway, and walked through a 
crowd of about 100 outside Olympic Stadium without being approached.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's different here than in any city in the league," Piazza said. "You don't 
have all the people hanging around the hotel and I can just walk right down the 
street and nobody knows me. I don't mind signing autographs, but it's a nice 
break to come here and not have all the attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "This city is one of my favorites. I love the restaurants, the fans are laid 
back, the shopping is good." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rudy Seanez went shopping in Montreal, and a clerk, trying to describe him 
later, said he was that "Italian" pitcher on the staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've passed for a lot of things, but never an Italian," said Seanez, who is 
Latino. "I bought some things from that store but had left before my wife paid 
for them. But when I was looking at them back at the hotel, there was this one 
shirt that had cost $160. It's OK if she spends that much, because it is 
usually for an outfit. But for a shirt? So I took it back and got three shirts 
for what that one cost." MARYANN HUDSON

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; GRAHE'S ROLE IN JEOPARDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 On the heels of another bullpen meltdown, Manager Marcel Lachemann said he 
will meet soon with pitching coach Chuck Hernandez to discuss possible changes. 
</P>
<P>
 The most pressing issue would be what to do with the closer's role. After Joe 
Grahe gave up a three-run homer to Don Mattingly in the ninth inning Sunday, 
Lachemann hinted that Grahe might lose the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I probably have other options," Lachemann said. "And I can't say I won't 
think about them. I'll talk to Chuck about it (before Tuesday's game against 
Oakland)." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Angels assigned pitcher Jeff Schwarz, acquired Saturday from the Chicago 
White Sox, to their 25-man roster. They also designated pitcher Scott Lewis for 
assignment. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwarz, a right-hander, had no record with a 6.35 earned-run average in nine 
relief appearances for the White Sox. Lewis was 0-1 with a 6.10 ERA in 20 games 
for the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dean Chance, honored Sunday by the Angels 30 years after winning the Cy Young 
Award, said that major league pitching isn't what it used to be. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to knock the game of baseball, but the real good pitchers stand 
out like a sore thumb," said Chance, the only Angel to win the Cy Young Award. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the guy with Boston (Roger Clemens). You can't fear anybody. He's a 
guy who can put (batters) on their butts." 
</P>
<P>
 Chance was 20-9 with two saves and a 1.65 earned-run average in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Shortstop Gary DiSarcina skipped Sunday's game because his wife, Janee, was 
expecting the couple's first child at any time. 
</P>
<P>
 Right fielder Tim Salmon, sidelined because of a strained right hamstring, sat 
out his seventh consecutive game. He is scheduled to test his leg by running 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yankee catcher Mike Stanley went into Sunday's game batting .280 with 14 home 
runs and 43 runs batted in. He was five for 10 with three homers and six RBIs 
in the past two games. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Angel catchers Greg Myers and Chris Turner were batting .233 with 
two homers and 16 RBIs. ELLIOTT TEAFORD

<P>
 The Philadelphia Phillies have lost third baseman Dave Hollins again, one day 
after he came off the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollins suffered a broken bone in his left hand Saturday night after swinging 
at a foul ball in the sixth inning of the Phillie-Padre game.Hollins, who is 
expected to be sidelined for six weeks, suffered a broken right hand last 
season.

 The Lake Elsinore Storm, a Class A affiliate of the Angels, has challenged 
Southern California baseball fans to try to outdraw the San Diego Padres 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 The Storm will play the Stockton Ports at the 7,566-seat Lake Elsinore 
Diamond, about 60 miles north of San Diego. The Padres will play the Colorado 
Rockies at Jack Murphy Stadium, where capacity was lowered to 46,510 by 
covering the upper deck seats with tarps. 
</P>
<P>
 The Padres' smallest home crowd of the season was 7,094 against Pittsburgh on 
May 31. The Storm has played before two crowds larger than that this season, 
including a California League-record 7,608 on July 2. 
</P>
<P>
 "Storm baseball at the Lake Elsinore Diamond is big-league in every respect 
already . . . but there's something special about outdrawing a major league 
team on the same night," General Manager Kevin Haughian said.

WOODS SIMPLY HAS TOO MUCH ON THE BALL; GOLF: HE WINS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA 
AMATEUR EASILY, DESPITE IMPRESSIVE PERFORMANCE BY RUNNER-UP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Mark Johnson will have to be content as Southern California's best golfer with 
a day job. 
</P>
<P>
 The 40-year-old delivery man and sales representative for a beer company in 
Barstow shot a 67 at Hacienda Golf Club on Sunday, his best of four good rounds 
at the Southern California Golf Assn. Amateur Championship, to finish at 275, 
five under. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in contention to win (the Amateur) for about the last six years," 
Johnson said. "But this is the first time I've put together four solid rounds. 
And I got hammered." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson was referring to Tiger Woods, who beat him by five strokes. Woods, 18, 
of Cypress, shot a par 70 to finish at 270 after a course-record 62 on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlie Wi, from North Hills, was third at 278. Don Baker from Canoga Park and 
Santa Barbara's John Pate tied for fourth at 283.  
</P>
<P>
 Said Woods: "My swing is a lot better lately, and my hands are not as wild. I 
haven't had any growth spurts in a while and I think that's a lot of it. I've 
leveled off lately." 
</P>
<P>
 The Amateur caps a string of impressive performances for Woods. He recently 
was 35-under par for 140 holes of match play at the Pacific Northwest Amateur. 
He now hopes to qualify for the U.S. Amateur before attending Stanford in the 
fall.  
</P>
<P>
 "He's one of the very best amateurs in the country," Johnson said of Woods. 
"He's going to be a great golfer. He plays one of our events and breaks all the 
records." 
</P>
<P>
 By Sunday's final round, Woods had become easily the biggest draw at the 
event, as Tom Kroll, a golf sales representative from San Marcos, could attest. 
</P>
<P>
 "(During Woods' 62 round on Saturday), I got to (the ninth hole) and saw my 
son," Kroll said. "He said, 'Where's Tiger?' My own kid would rather watch 
Tiger." 
</P>
<P>
 Kroll was fifth at 284. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Cuff, a pre-tournament favorite, walked the course with his pregnant wife, 
Kathy, and 22-month old son, Kevin. Cuff, a steel manufacturing sales 
representative from Temecula, finished at 298. 
</P>
<P>
 "How often do I practice? Well, I had a round with a client last week," Cuff 
said. "I try to play most Saturdays, but it hasn't been real often." 
</P>
<P>
 These are the typical amateur players, a field Johnson would have crushed any 
other year. But then came Woods. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know what it feels like to be lapped," Woods said. "But its nice to be on 
the other side."

HOLLYWOOD PARK; GRAND FLOTILLA, POTRIDEE ARE STAKES WINNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Jenine Sahadi belonged to Delta Gamma at USC, she and one of her sorority 
sisters never envisioned what they've accomplished together in the last two 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jenine was from a horse family, so it was easy to tell what direction she 
might go in," Mary Louise Sloan said. "But I wasn't really brought in to horses 
until I married Mike." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Sloan, who is general counsel for Circus Circus, the company that runs 
Las Vegas casinos, and Mary Louise race Grand Flotilla, and Sahadi is their 
trainer. The 7-year-old continued to perform his big-race feats Sunday, winning 
the $250,000 Sunset Handicap at Hollywood Park, which came on the heels of his 
victory in the $500,000 Hollywood Turf Handicap on May 30. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sloans' 3 1/2-year-old son, Andrew, was also in the winner's circle 
Sunday, wearing black silks with the diagonal red sash similar to the ones that 
Gary Stevens wore on his winning ride. The Sloans are also partners in 
Samourzkan, who won the $100,000 Laurance Armour Handicap at Arlington 
International for trainer Bob Hess Jr. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This horse kicked in real good," Stevens said of Grand Flotilla. "He wasn't 
going to let that other horse (Semillon) by." 
</P>
<P>
 Grand Flotilla, running with stablemate Sir Mark Sykes, was the 7-10 favorite 
and beat Semillon by a neck. Emerald Jig was third, another 2 1/2 lengths back 
and a neck better than Sir Mark Sykes in fourth place. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sunset wasn't even the most expensive race on the card for Hollywood 
Park's next-to-last racing day this season. In the $300,000 Vanity Handicap, 
Potridee and jockey Alex Solis overcame trouble on the inside, split horses in 
the last sixteenth of a mile and beat Exchange by a neck while the 7-5 favorite 
and 119-pound highweight, Golden Klair, finished third, beaten by about 
three-quarters of a length. 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Ron McAnally has won the Vanity in recent years with some champion 
Argentine-bred mares -- Bayakoa and Paseana -- and he also won it in 1991 with 
Brought To Mind, but Potridee, who's also from Argentina, was a surprise at 7-1 
and had finished last on the grass in the Beverly Hills Handicap three weeks 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 On dirt in the Vanity, she ran 1 1/8 miles in 1:48, carrying 114 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Argentine-bred horses can run either way, on dirt or grass, and she's 
no exception," McAnally said. "She didn't run her race last time, and I felt 
Kent (Desormeaux) didn't know her very well and he sort of gave up on her on 
the turn. She had a little trouble in the race and it was a tough race, of 
course, with Hollywood Wildcat and those top fillies. But I figured she didn't 
take too much out of herself and she could come back in this race on the dirt 
because it was the best race of the meeting." 
</P>
<P>
 Exchange, making only her second start since May 1993, appeared to have the 
Vanity won before Potridee got through. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I had it won," said the 6-year-old mare's jockey, Laffit Pincay. 
"But when she gets on the lead, she doesn't always try like she can. When she 
saw the other horse coming, it was too late. She tried to come back on again, 
but it was too late." 
</P>
<P>
 Solis was serving the last day of a five-day suspension Sunday, but because of 
California's designated-race rule that applies to major stakes, he was able to 
ride Potridee in the Vanity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hustled her to go to the lead, like Ronnie wanted to do, but she didn't 
show any speed today," Solis said. "So I put her in good position and waited 
all the way around." 
</P>
<P>
 Potridee was fifth on the far turn, with Exchange chasing the leader, Southern 
Truce, up front. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the three-eighths pole, everybody was coming from everywhere, and I was 
trapped down inside," Solis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no place to go, but I was very happy that my filly never dropped the 
bit. She was still running and running. I finally got some clearance at the 
eighth pole. I started hitting her left-handed, and she just flew home the last 
sixteenth." 
</P>
<P>
 Potridee earned $165,000 for owner Leslie Grimm, which is more than the 
5-year-old mare earned in 10 starts in the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunset winner Grand Flotilla, running 1 1/2 miles on grass in 2:26 1/5, earned 
$158,000, boosting his earnings to $565,500 for the Sloans since they bought 
him in France late last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Sahadi, who has been training on her own since April 1993, frets before races, 
and Sunday she was happy that the Sunset was run as the third race on the card. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad I didn't have to wait until the eighth," she said. "It was stressful 
this time, because he was the favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 "But he's been feeling well, and Gary (Stevens) said (Grand Flotilla) feels 
like a 2-year-old. This horse feels like he's getting younger instead of 
getting older." Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 In other races Sunday, Sky Beauty, who is undefeated in four starts this year, 
won the $150,000 Go for Wand Stakes at Saratoga by 10 1/2 lengths over Link 
River and Overbury, and Vaudeville dead-heated for the victory in the $300,000 
American Derby at Arlington International. Eagle Eyed, the favorite at 
Arlington, needed seven assistant starters to get her loaded and then flattened 
out in the stretch before finishing fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Hollywood Park windup today, trainer Wayne Lukas will try to beat colts 
with the filly Serena's Song in the Hollywood Juvenile. Serena's Song is the 
2-1 morning-line favorite, and Ron McAnally's Mr Purple, who won by three 
lengths in his only race, is next at 5-2. After two dull races in Kentucky, 
Serena's Song broke her maiden with a 10-length victory at Hollywood in June, 
then won the Landaluce Stakes by 4 1/2 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 McAnally leads the meeting with six stakes victories, and with 23 winners is 
one behind Sandy Shulman in the trainer standings. . . . Chris Antley, who 
leads the jockeys in stakes victories with nine, rode a disqualified winner, 
Never Topped, Saturday and has been handed a five-day suspension. The penalty 
will start Thursday, the second day of the Del Mar meeting.

VALLEY'S NEW ERA OFFERS REWARDS, PUNISHMENT; BUSINESS: A RUTHLESS DOWNTURN HAS 
MASKED A RESTRUCTURING TREND. RISING INDUSTRIES EVOKE OPTIMISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Well before the Northridge earthquake, changing markets and hard times had 
upended the San Fernando Valley -- overturning the lives of some while heaping 
unexpected fortune on others. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who lost jobs or equity or business, the past several years have 
been a lingering disaster, a conspiracy of bad luck and unexpected betrayals. 
</P>
<P>
 "It started with the riots, then it seemed to go downhill. . . . Every time 
there was a disaster -- the fires, the earthquake -- it died some more," 
Shirley Silverstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 After 14 years, she is closing the family's Van Nuys toy store -- Miniature 
Towne U.S.A. -- and moving to Texas. "It's the recession," she said. "With so 
many people laid off, it has had a great rippling effect on us." 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, for others -- those posting record sales, moving to larger quarters, 
climbing the corporate ladder -- the 1990s have so far been a time of unequaled 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 "For all practical purposes, we didn't know there was a recession, except that 
every time we needed to hire somebody there would be dozens of applicants," 
said Mark Sampson, director of research and development for a North Hollywood 
firm that he and a partner started in 1990. Sales for their company, Matchless 
Amplifiers, grew from zero to $1 million in two years. Sampson expects to 
double that this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Far from capricious, the economy's path reflects the orderly work of 
capitalism's invisible hand, clearing the way for a 21st-Century economy. And 
the Valley, like the rest of Southern California, is witness to a dramatic 
adjustment that has been partially obscured by three years of recession. 
</P>
<P>
 A new economy is emerging that, like its predecessors, will have its share of 
winners and losers, decided -- as always -- by the demands of willing buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 It is an economy that is leaner and more competitive, with fewer lifetime 
employees and more part-time and temporary workers. It is a workplace with 
plenty of jobs but fewer that pay well. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also a market in which a bit of sweat and cash can still propel a good 
idea from a neighborhood garage to a 100,000-square-foot factory. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Sandel, an Israeli immigrant, had friends in nursing who complained about 
routine chores, such as counting needles. That idea sparked the creation of 
Devon Industries, which now employs nearly 400 at its Chatsworth plant. Last 
year, Devon sold about $60 million in medical supplies, including needle 
counters. 
</P>
<P>
 The old economy transformed Los Angeles County, especially Chatsworth and 
Canoga Park, into a high-technology center, employing some of the brightest 
minds and most productive hands in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Cars, airplanes and motion pictures employed thousands of Valley workers. 
While the movies continue to cast a bright picture, other workers in 
traditional Valley industries have lost jobs and position and security. 
</P>
<P>
 Reductions in federal defense spending and a changing marketplace have 
eliminated more than 10,000 local jobs, knocking the wind out of the nation's 
premier manufacturing powerhouses. 
</P>
<P>
 At Hughes Aircraft Co., General Motors, Lockheed Corp. and other bastions of 
Valley employment, hundreds of acres of once-productive factories are shuttered 
and for sale. Their absence has produced lean years for a host of smaller 
companies and retailers as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocketdyne, a division of Rockwell International Corp. and one of the Valley's 
largest employers, predicts it will hire fewer than 20 college graduates this 
year, compared to 200 five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 James Osment, the firm's administrator of college relations, said newspaper 
classified ads used by his firm and others to recruit employees used to be so 
thick, "you could hardly pick up the section with two hands. Now you can pick 
it up with two fingers." 
</P>
<P>
 But in that vacuum, an army of small- and medium-sized companies are thriving. 
</P>
<P>
 In key industries such as entertainment, computer hardware, biomedical and 
aerospace subcontracting, Valley firms account for nearly 30% of all employment 
and revenues in Los Angeles County, according to a research project directed by 
economist David Friedman. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley scores high in four other industries: general industrial machinery, 
metalworking, computer software and environment-related businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers bolster a more optimistic view of the region, although there 
remain complaints from business owners over taxes, government regulation and 
social issues such as crime, Friedman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite the fact that a lot of firms would like to leave, they can't. I call 
it the 'golden handcuffs,' " said James Renzas of Paragon Decision Resources of 
Irvine, a consulting firm. "Take the high-tech crowd. Where are they going to 
find a labor market with the kind of brainpower you find in L.A.? In Boise?" 
</P>
<P>
 But even with a healthy stock of firms, providing enough good-paying jobs will 
be one of the most serious dilemmas of the new economy, say experts. 
</P>
<P>
 Productivity has skyrocketed -- more is produced with fewer workers, machines 
do more and more of the repetitive work once assigned to assembly lines. The 
payoff is competitively priced products as well as the continued survival of 
local firms. It also means there is less demand -- and compensation -- for all 
but the most irreplaceable flesh-and-blood employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Rewards, once spread broadly among production workers, are now increasingly 
concentrated on those who develop and design new technologies and products, 
along with those who sell them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reality is we are up to our neck in technology," said Jack Kyser, chief 
economist with the nonprofit Los Angeles County Economic Development Assn. 
"What we need is an infrastructure to get it out of the lab and onto the 
factory floor and start creating jobs in a fairly quick manner." 
</P>
<P>
 The area has borne the brunt of the California recession. Altogether, Los 
Angeles County lost more than 500,000 jobs between December, 1990, and January 
of this year, accounting for between 60% and 70% of the total number of 
California jobs lost in that time, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Trade unions that once guaranteed top wages and benefits to workers have 
dwindled. The International Assn. of Machinists District 725 once represented 
more than 40,000 workers in the years following World War II. Their numbers had 
fallen to half that by 1974. Now, there are 2,400 members, said union Research 
Director Don Nakamoto. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been the result of reduced aircraft contracts," he said. "The slowdown 
has been over the past 20 years, but the recent cuts have been the most 
dramatic." 
</P>
<P>
 David Bantle, a 71-year-old former aerospace engineer and one of the new breed 
of entrepreneurs, said the bad news for machinists has benefited his firm, 
DAMACO Inc. The machine shops that once worked for aerospace now aggressively 
compete for his business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of those shops are very hungry," said Bantle, who 13 years ago started 
making lightweight electric wheelchairs in his Chatsworth garage and now owns a 
24,000-square-foot factory. "That is unfortunate for them, but great for us 
because they are highly competitive." 
</P>
<P>
 There has been no contraction for supermarket workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Historically, we have been in a good situation because people obviously have 
to eat, so that gives us a leg up on most industries," said Rick Icaza, 
president of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, Local 770. "But the 
jobs have basically been frozen in the grocery industry. There haven't been 
many hirings." 
</P>
<P>
 Union checkers earn close to $14.50 an hour, plus $4 an hour in benefits. Even 
box boys earn health and pension benefits on top of their $5 hourly wage, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But union officials worry about the growth of independent and warehouse-style 
food markets, some of which rely heavily on lower-paid temporary and part-time 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a 25% price advantage on payroll because 80% of their employees are 
part time and excluded from benefits," Icaza said. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking part-time or temporary jobs -- which typically pay lower wages and 
offer few benefits -- has been the only option for many Valley workers. And 
state employment officials predict that the trend will grow. 
</P>
<P>
 Unemployment claims in the Valley went from 66,853 in 1989 to a peak of 
108,243 in 1992. Last year, the total dipped to 88,289, according to the state 
Employment Development Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The layoffs and firings have continued to slow down, according to a Times poll 
of San Fernando Valley residents. Earlier this month, 16% reported that they or 
a family member had been fired in the last year, compared to 25% a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 It is probably no coincidence that one-third of Valley residents polled this 
month say they have taken some job training or schooling in the past two years 
to boost or change their careers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being frozen, that is the highest risk, saying: 'This is what I do, this is 
what I am,' " said James Boulgarides, professor of interdisciplinary studies at 
Cal State Los Angeles. "You have to re-create yourself, like a phoenix out of 
the ashes and re-create a new life." 
</P>
<P>
 As the Valley's largest manufacturers have cut jobs or left altogether, many 
workers lucky enough to find new employment have discovered it pays less and 
offers fewer benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Among people who have changed jobs in the last five years, nearly one-fifth of 
those between the ages of 30 and 64 say they are working part time because they 
cannot find full-time jobs, according to this month's Los Angeles Times Poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Job prospects through the end of this decade will become increasingly divided 
between large numbers of low-paying jobs and relatively scarce high-paying 
positions, according to state forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest number of new jobs predicted for California in the next six years 
are, in order: retail sales clerk, corporate executive, waiter, office clerk 
and cashier. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those, state officials predict there will be 124,000 new jobs for top 
managers and executives, and 400,000 for the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the relatively well-paying jobs in the top 25 -- besides executive -- 
are nursing, accounting, engineering and teaching. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half of the top 25 will pay minimum wage, according to the EDD. Of 
the 50 occupations expected to have the largest numbers of jobs created through 
the year 2000, 29 start at minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles County, state economists predict that over the next three 
years, the jobs with the greatest demand will be, in order: sewing machine 
operators; office clerks; executives; film/TV producers, directors and actors, 
and waiters. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Valley slowly winds its way out of the recession, "people will find 
jobs," said UCLA economist Daniel Mitchell, "but they will find them at the K 
mart clerk level. There is no great natural law that says income" will be 
spread evenly among workers. 
</P>
<P>
 More troubling to consider is that as educational demands climb for the best 
jobs, the dropout rate at city schools remains over 33%. Although a lot of new 
jobs being created in the Valley and elsewhere are a big step up for many 
immigrants, that may not be true for their U.S.-born children. 
</P>
<P>
 The payoff of a college education, as compared to the rewards of a high school 
background, has soared in recent years, said Morton Schapiro, dean of USC's 
College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and former chairman of the school's 
economics department. 
</P>
<P>
 That is not because college graduates are doing so well, but because high 
school graduates' incomes have plummeted. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence of the widening income gap is apparent in the Valley, where the 
income of the wealthy grew much faster than that of the poor during the 1980s, 
according to the 1990 U.S. Census. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 12% of working adults in the Arleta-Pacoima area reported their 
occupation as managers or professionals, for example, compared to nearly half 
the adults living in Sherman Oaks, Studio City, Toluca Lake, Encino and 
Tarzana, according to the U.S. Census. 
</P>
<P>
 Prospects remain dim for restoring widespread blue-collar prosperity through 
large employers making new products such as electric cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "The concept of defense conversion is politically correct, it sounds good and 
rolls off the tongue. . . . It seems like something you can throw money at and 
create jobs," said David Goodreau, chairman of the California Industrial 
Council and president of a Burbank aerospace manufacturing firm. "But the 
technology just isn't there to support it. Maybe there is a lot for R & D-type 
jobs, but from the standpoint of hiring a lot of the production workers being 
laid off, those people are out of luck." 
</P>
<P>
 Others are less pessimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "The entire country is going through this kind of stratification, but the 
difference is that California still has a manufacturing base, tens of thousands 
are opening up new businesses," said economist Friedman, who has written 
extensively about the state's economy. "The argument that we have reached some 
kind of low-wage, low-skill equilibrium is totally false." 
</P>
<P>
 He points to several Valley firms that are doing well in the new marketplace 
and are not limited to sophisticated, high-technology products and services. 
There are also some traditional factories that have found a niche in the global 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Ornstein, chief financial officer of Superior Industries International 
Inc., a Van Nuys-based manufacturer of aluminum wheels, said business has grown 
dramatically over the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are the world leader, with about a 40% market share," Ornstein said of the 
firm that was started in the Valley 35 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,000 people work at the Van Nuys plant and another 2,500 work at 
factories in Arkansas, Kansas and Tennessee. While echoing many complaints 
about the region, Ornstein said his firm has no plans to leave. Jobless Claims

 The client couldn't figure out why their successful roll candy was a dud among 
Latino buyers. Everybody else seemed to like the fact that they contain less 
than 10 calories in a piece. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you say that to a Hispanic, and they say, 'Phooey, I'm eating this for 
energy, and this has nothing in it,' " Carlos Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
 That sort of insight now yields Garcia's Burbank-based consulting firm, Garcia 
Research, about $1 million a year in revenues from companies seeking ways to 
latch onto the fast-growing Latino market. 
</P>
<P>
 "Big corporations know they need to understand the consumer base, but to them 
it is like doing business in Hong Kong. It scares them," said Garcia, 42, who 
holds advanced degrees in business and comparative literature. "They don't 
understand the culture or the language, yet the numbers are growing so fast, 
they can't ignore them. So we are in an ideal situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia, who started his company in 1990, not only helps big companies reach 
Latinos. He assists Latino-owned firms going mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
 How big will the Latino population grow? 
</P>
<P>
 "I expect to be around to do Gloria Molina's campaign for President," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Former aerospace engineer David Bantle got his idea while attending a 
conference at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. He was watching someone struggling to 
push a friend in a wheelchair around the hilly campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it might be possible to come up with a device that you could add to 
any manual wheelchair that would convert it to a power chair," said Bantle, 71. 
"It happened that my wife's father had been in a wheelchair for 35 years, and I 
was aware there were a lot of needs for the handicapped." 
</P>
<P>
 So 13 years ago, when the kids were grown, Bantle used some savings and turned 
his three-car Chatsworth garage into an office and workshop, where he worked 
evenings and weekends. He built his first dozen wheelchair motors in 1980, 
which were more portable and easier to use than anything else on the market at 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Bantle and 35 employees build more than $2 million worth of drive motors 
and wheelchairs annually at his company, DAMACO, still an upstart compared to 
the industry's giants. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there wasn't the recession, I would probably be growing even faster than I 
am now," said Bantle, who just bought a 24,000-square-foot building for the 
company in Moorpark. "After working quite a few years in aerospace, it's nice 
to have a business of my own." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosalie Duong said she's hiring like crazy. 
</P>
<P>
 She's looking for college graduates who have advanced degrees in the 
biological sciences as well as laboratory experience to work at Qiagen in 
Chatsworth, a wholly owned subsidiary of the German company Qiagen, GmbH. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm makes and sells kits used by researchers to purify nucleic acid, 
proteins, DNA and RNA from blood or any tissue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our products are used by companies or universities engaged in molecular 
biological research," said Duong, general manager of the local plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the customers are researchers seeking the keys to eradicating 
imperfections in human cells that cause disease and disabilities. To do that 
work, scientists need to separate out pure cellular materials, the task 
performed by the Qiagen kits. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how advanced the technology, one economic principle prevails: Time 
is money. 
</P>
<P>
 "With our patented technology," said Duong, "what used to take three days 
takes between one and three hours." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Asher hopes to use old-fashioned technology to battle a new plague. 
</P>
<P>
 Asher, founder and chairman of HemaCare Corp. in Sherman Oaks, is in the last 
round of the government approval process for an AIDS treatment based on a 
100-year-old idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Using blood from people who have the HIV virus, the idea -- called passive 
hyper-immune therapy -- is to create vast pools of plasma that contain the 
antibodies to battle the virus. Then the plasma -- or a derivative -- can be 
transmitted to AIDS patients who can no longer produce the antibodies on their 
own. The same idea is used in the treatment of tetanus and rabies, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know whether it delays the inevitable or whether people will stay 
well," said Asher, whose firm now sells blood components. 
</P>
<P>
 After two clinical trials, Asher said it looks so far as though patients 
receiving the treatment live longer. A third and final trial required by the 
federal government is expected to begin later this year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the technology is approved, Asher expects he would need 1,000 more 
employees. "We don't anticipate it would be any more expensive than the drugs 
available now, such as AZT," he said. SAN ENRIQUEZ

POLITICAL DOGFIGHT EXPECTED OVER CITY ANIMAL SHELTER; SERVICES: SEVERAL COUNCIL 
CANDIDATES SAY THE FACILITY IS AN EXAMPLE OF LAVISH SPENDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Less than a year after building a much-vaunted $2.3-million animal control 
shelter, politics could force the city out of the cat and dog business. 
</P>
<P>
 While the shelter is praised by animal lovers for its progressive, pro-life 
policy, it is also under fire from several declared City Council candidates in 
the November election who claim the facility represents lavish overspending by 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody is suggesting that the building be torn down, but if the anti-shelter 
forces gain a council majority, the city could end up selling the shelter or 
turning it over to somebody else to run. 
</P>
<P>
 "If elected, I wouldn't stand with what we have today," said candidate Larry 
Gilbert. "The animal shelter is something a lot of people can point a finger at 
as an example of excessive expenditure by the council." 
</P>
<P>
 The price tag for the shelter included 39 acres of mostly unbuildable hillside 
property. It opened last October, sharply dividing the community between dog 
and cat lovers on one side and those who resent so much public money being 
spent on animals on the other. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, three of the five declared council candidates oppose the shelter. But 
in what promises to be a real political dogfight, animal lovers promise to be 
ready for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Council member Sharon Cody, who routinely plucks pets off the street and 
places them in adoptive homes, said anyone who intends to abolish the city's 
animal control program is in for a bruising battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've known for a long time there could be people elected who think the best 
thing to do with a dog is to drown it," said Cody, who founded the animal 
shelter. "I challenge all the animal lovers who have talked to me to make sure 
these individuals do not become council members." 
</P>
<P>
 Standing behind her is a ready-made volunteer organization, the 100-member 
Friends of Mission Viejo Animals who already volunteer thousands of hours at 
the city shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials are taking the challenge seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 With three council seats open in November, it would take two anti-shelter 
candidates winning office -- and joining longtime shelter opponent Councilman 
William S. Craycraft -- to gain a majority capable of changing the shelter's 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert and like-minded candidates said they would open discussions with 
county animal control to operate animal services out of the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 They say the city could also privatize animal control, selling or leasing the 
shelter to an outside company and contracting services with that group. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first feeling would be to negotiate with other communities," said Tom 
Potocki, who has taken out papers to run for the council. "This shelter is and 
has been an example of excessive spending, but we need to turn it into 
something viable, whether that means privatization, dealing with the county or 
a regional concept." 
</P>
<P>
 "Those in Mission Viejo who have animals and pets are just delighted they have 
this fantastic government program at little or no money," said former 
councilman Norman P. Murray, who is strongly considering running again in 
November. "But can Mission Viejo afford to subsidize this program? 
</P>
<P>
 The shelter has a $355,000 annual budget, which pays for five employees and 
upkeep on the 32 kennels and its 2,500-square-foot office. The net annual cost 
is about $80,000 more than the city paid county animal control two years ago, 
before the local shelter opened. 
</P>
<P>
 Pet owners get far more than a pro-life policy that bans euthanizing animals, 
city officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 One animal control officer is on duty at all times, compared to the one or two 
county employees who patrol all of South County, said Assistant City Attorney 
Dan Joseph. 
</P>
<P>
 "They care more," Cody said. "Recently, a man had his dog run over by a car. 
The officer who told him stayed around and consoled him, put his arm around 
him. You can't buy that kind of service." 
</P>
<P>
 Cody is racing against time, trying to put together the one proposal that 
satisfies all the candidates: making the shelter a regional program. 
</P>
<P>
 Invitations have been extended to San Clemente, Dana Point, Laguna Niguel and 
San Juan Capistrano to consider running their animal control programs from the 
Mission Viejo shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 "A regional system certainly makes more sense than one city going on its own," 
Laguna Niguel City Manager Tim Casey said. "On the other hand, there's a 
question of costs." 
</P>
<P>
 Casey said an initial Mission Viejo estimate shows his city would pay $50,000 
to $150,000 more than the cost of county animal control services, but added 
that the figure could drop if more cities sign on. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the final figure, Cody said cities will be getting great value for 
their money. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bottom line is we're providing an extraordinary service in this community," 
she said. "We've saved over 1,000 animals from being euthanized so far. At the 
end of every leash we send out the door is a person whose life will be touched 
by this animal." Deluxe Shelter Opened: October, 1993 Area: 2,500 square feet 
Accommodations: 32 kennels (can be divided to house 64 dogs) and 20 cat cages 
Cost: $2.3 million, including $1 million for 39 acres of land Annual budget: 
$355,000 Paid employees: Five Volunteers: About 50, four hours per week, for 
clerical duties as well as exercising, feeding and cleaning animals. Source:

JOCKEY KILLED AS HORSE STUMBLES IN RACE; TRAGEDY: THE RIDER, WHO WAS THROWN 
FROM HIS MOUNT AT LOS ALAMITOS, WAS A LAST-MINUTE SUBSTITUTE. 
</P>

<P>
 An unlikely series of events resulted in Juan Limon riding a 2-year-old filly 
in the seventh race at Los Alamitos on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the last ride of Limon's life. That filly, Ima Dashing Lady, stumbled 
25 yards from the finish of the Quarter Horse Futurity Trials. Thrown over the 
head of Ima Dashing Lady, Limon was crushed by the filly when she went down. 
The 35-year-old jockey suffered brain damage and died about 30 minutes after 
the race in the emergency room at Los Alamitos Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Limon wasn't scheduled to ride Ima Dashing Lady in the 350-yard race. At entry 
time, trainer Blane Schvaneveldt had scheduled his son-in-law, Roman Figueroa, 
who had ridden Ima Dashing Lady to a third-place finish at Los Alamitos in her 
only previous start. 
</P>
<P>
 Figueroa, riding in the Lassie Stakes at Prescott Downs in Arizona on Saturday 
afternoon, couldn't get to Los Alamitos in time, and Schvaneveldt hired Limon 
to ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Figueroa has been married for seven years to the former Brenda Schvaneveldt, 
the trainer's daughter, who was on the verge of being engaged to Val Tonks in 
1983 when that 19-year-old jockey was killed in a spill at Los Alamitos. Tonks 
and Limon are the only jockeys to be killed in the 43-year history of the 
track. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were real good friends," said Blane Schvaneveldt, who was running a couple 
of horses at Los Alamitos but didn't go to the track to saddle them. "We have 
these accidents very rarely, but when we have them they are very tragic." 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Figueroa was back riding at Prescott Downs. By phone between races, 
he talked about Limon being a jockey who was liked by everybody. Then, 
addressing the irony of his not making it to Los Alamitos in time, he said: 
"Somebody must have been watching over me." 
</P>
<P>
 Late Saturday afternoon, Figueroa and another jockey, Jose Badilla Jr., were 
scheduled to take a charter plane from the Prescott airport to Phoenix, to 
catch a commercial flight to Long Beach. But the races ran long at Prescott 
Downs and the two riders hired a direct charter from the local airport to Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Their two-hour flight actually reached Long Beach a little early. "But after 
that, nothing went right," Figueroa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Badilla's girlfriend had arranged to meet the jockeys at Long Beach, but 
apparently their charter landed at a different terminal. The jockeys left 
without her, taking a cab. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew the way but the driver was confused," Figueroa said. "He got some maps 
out and tried to figure it out." 
</P>
<P>
 The stewards at Los Alamitos were allowing trainers to replace the tardy 
jockeys on a race-by-race basis. The cab carrying Figueroa and Badilla arrived 
in the track's parking lot as the horses were entering the track for the 
seventh race, with Limon in Ima Dashing Lady's saddle. 
</P>
<P>
 Figueroa watched the race on a television monitor in the jockeys' room. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looked like the filly might have (tangled her hoofs) or broken down," he 
said. "It looked like Juan was going to be all right. I've been in spills 
exactly like that. You break some ribs, or maybe a collarbone. That's what I 
thought might have happened this time." 
</P>
<P>
 Ima Dashing Lady bounced back up and ran off, apparently not injured. Jimmy 
Lewis was riding Doctor Gaskill, the colt who won the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "Out of the corner of my eye, I could see the other horse (Ima Dashing Lady) 
near me," Lewis said. "The filly was making a little bit of a run. About 25 
yards from the wire, out of the corner of my eye, I could see her go down. I 
looked back and it looked like she fell on Juan." 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Mitchell, the trainer of Merry Freddy, another horse in the race, was 
among the first to reach Limon. "Danny told me that Juan never took a breath," 
said Steve Treasure, who rode Merry Freddy. 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Jalisco, Mexico, Limon lived in Buena Park with his wife, Rosie, 
and their 4-year-old daughter. Los Alamitos officials said that Limon had two 
children from a previous marriage who live in Fresno. Limon had won 19 races at 
the meet and ranked ninth in the standings. 
</P>
<P>
 After beginning his career in Utah, Limon came to Los Alamitos in 1986, 
winning 205 races and five stakes. His biggest victory came aboard Mighty Easy 
Pass in the $400,000 Denim N Diamonds Futurity, and this year he won the 
$100,000 California Sires Cup Futurity with Dash Of Cider, whom he was 
scheduled to ride later on Saturday night's card. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a bad deal," Figueroa said. "He was a good man. He stood by what he 
said. He had had some bad breaks, some injuries, that slowed him down, but he 
was putting everything back together again." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Mike Hidinger, the jockey room custodian: "Juan was a quiet guy and 
everybody liked him. He wouldn't have said a mean word if you had hit him with 
a club." 
</P>
<P>
 Visitation for Limon will be from 3 to 6 p.m. today at the Hilgenfeld Mortuary 
in Anaheim, with a Rosary at 6 p.m. A Mass will be said Tuesday at noon at St. 
Anthony Claret Catholic Church in Anaheim and the body will be returned to 
Jalisco, Mexico, for burial. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Allred, president of the Horsemen's Quarter Horse Racing Assn., said his 
group will pay for the expenses for the funeral and the shipment of the body to 
Mexico. Limon will be buried in Allred's racing silks and a trust fund will be 
established for the jockey's family. Before the thoroughbred races at Hollywood 
Park on Sunday, the jockeys observed a moment of silence for Limon and the 
track's flag was flown at half staff.

THE THRILL IS GONE; TENS OF THOUSANDS JAM COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS ON CLOSING DAY FOR 
A FINAL APPEAL TO THE SENSES 
</P>

 No, the pony didn't kick. It wasn't even unfriendly. But from the horrified 
look on 18-month-old Dana Davis' face, it was the pony from hell. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is her first time on a pony," explained Bob Davis, who videotaped his 
daughter atop "Rusty," a docile Shetland pony, as Dana screamed her way around 
the pony rink at the Orange County Fair on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "She didn't like it when she first got on. She likes dogs though," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, 32, and his wife, Diane, 29, of Rancho Santa Margarita, took Dana, 
facial expressions and all, to enjoy the 102nd edition of the Orange County 
Fair, which ended Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17-day run -- billed as a more user-friendly attraction this year with 
automated scooters, more ATM posts, and the Ejection Seat, a reverse bungee 
drop for the young at heart -- was on its way to an overall attendance figure 
of about 670,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Russell Kibota, a fair spokesman, said attendance this year was about the same 
as last year's 668,096. As of Saturday, the fair's attendance was 607,351, 
below last year's figure of 616,811 at the same time. But Kibota noted that at 
3 p.m. Sunday, they had 38,001 people compared to only 23,511 last year at the 
same time. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's favorite ride may have been the Ejection Seat, a $40-a-ride heart 
thumper that had had 4,700 riders as of Saturday night, Kibota said. The ride 
literally launches people into the air like a slingshot. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the fair's gaiety, tragedy struck July 16 when a 45-year-old Los 
Alamitos carnival worker touched an exposed wire while repairing lights on the 
Gravitron ride and was electrocuted. Cal-OSHA is still investigating the 
incident that took the life of Ron Vogt. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, fair-goers enjoyed what county fairs are known for: cotton candy, 
hot dogs on a stick and fun. 
</P>
<P>
 Donna Jackson, 27, of Newport Beach, took her son, Cole, 1 1/2, on the 
elephant ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Cole's reaction? 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not saying much," Jackson said. "I think he's tired." 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually it was fun, though kind of scary," said Jackson's friend, Sharon 
Stephen, 31, of Aliso Viejo, adding that she came to the fair to win back the 
money she once lost pitching quarters onto plates on the midway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lost 40 bucks," Stephen said, laughing. "But I brought extra money today. I 
want to win!" 
</P>
<P>
 The fair was a good run for vendor John Arthur Mason, 33, of Philadelphia, who 
hawked the Salsa Master, a hand-operated food processor. "It's the No. 1 
selling appliance in America right now." 
</P>
<P>
 But dealing with some customers Sunday was troublesome. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I get this last-day bargain-basement buyer who wants to buy everything for 
a low price," Mason said. "Well, I tell him I'm not Monty Hall, see? This is 
not, 'Let's Make a Deal.' And, there's nothing behind door No. 1." 
</P>
<P>
 Mason said he spends 11 months on the road traveling to county and state fairs 
pitching Salsa Master, Ginsu knives and veggie slicers. From Orange County, 
it's on to Paso Robles, then Sacramento and Dallas, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cecilia Paz, 35, of Huntington Beach, found a shady spot and relaxed eating 
piping-hot corn-on-the-cob. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been seeing lots of things today," Paz said as she and her mother, 
Julia Fowler, of Huntington Beach, munched away. "We're here for the rodeo 
because there are horses and I love horses . . . the exhibits and the food. Of 
course, the food." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Golden Gate Comedy Stage, "Guido" had another audience spellbound. 
</P>
<P>
 "OK, pick a card," said the comedian and magician whose real name is Gary 
Schnell, as an audience member plucked an imaginary card from space. 
</P>
<P>
 "OK, put it back in the deck. Ahem, face down, PUULEASE!" he said to the roar 
of laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be honest," said Schnell, 45, of San Francisco. "And, it's not just 
because I work here a lot, but the Orange County Fair is one of the best places 
to work. It's my seventh year here, but I do county and state fairs all over 
the country. For one thing, you certainly have better weather here. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you something. Orange County audiences seem to be really more 
receptive than other audiences. I don't know why, but maybe it's because 
they're generally aware of better entertainment and know what good 
entertainment is all about."

LAW BANNING 'TIMEOUTS' IS UNDER FIRE; EDUCATION: PROBLEM STUDENTS IN SPECIAL 
SCHOOLS CAN NO LONGER BE REMOVED FROM CLASS TO COOL OFF. MANY ARE SENT OUT OF 
STATE, AT TAXPAYER EXPENSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A little-known law that went into effect last year could double the number of 
special education students transferred from Orange County schools to private 
out-of-state programs, and create a costly new burden for local taxpayers, 
education officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1993 law, known as the Hughes Act, prohibits schools from using "timeouts" 
-- a period during which students are removed from the classroom and placed 
alone in a room while they regain their composure after a conflict -- for 
special education students. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Larry Belkin, director of the county Department of Education's 
special schools unit, four students from county school districts have been sent 
out of state this year as a direct result of the Hughes Act, which was approved 
by the Legislature last year. Belkin predicts that number will increase 
substantially as more districts become aware of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took more than a year for information about the law to get out to school 
districts," Belkin said. "When we check with teachers and other school 
officials, it's amazing how many of them don't know about the law. As more 
become aware, we expect to see more students referred to out-of-state" schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Students with severe emotional problems will be most directly affected by the 
new law. These students often exhibit behavior that includes hurting themselves 
and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Private schools which contract with districts to handle such special education 
students are not exempt from the law. Belkin fears that once those schools 
become aware they can no longer use timeouts to control behavior, they may be 
reluctant to accept local students with behavior problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Rossier, director of the private Rossier School in Garden Grove, which 
accepts special education students from Orange and Los Angeles counties, said 
she has referred at least five students this year to residential, out-of-state 
facilities because of the timeout prohibition. She said she believes several 
other students may soon follow. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am seeing kids go (to residential facilities) who shouldn't have to go," 
Rossier said. "I have had to refer more kids out in the last year (because of 
the Hughes Act) than I ever had to before." 
</P>
<P>
 But not every school is interpreting the law so strictly. Dick Schnetzer, 
coordinator for business services for Mardan School of Educational Therapy, a 
private school in Irvine that contracts with many Orange County school 
districts, said the Hughes Act would have no impact on his facility's selection 
of students. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is nothing in the regulations prohibiting timeouts," Schnetzer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the bill does not prohibit a tactic that many special education 
advocates say is much more intrusive than a timeout: the prone containment, 
which allows up to four adults to physically restrain a student laying flat on 
the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not allow prone containment," Rossier said. "I find it very incongruent 
that that is permitted while timeouts, which if done properly can be very 
positive, are not allowed." 
</P>
<P>
 Rossier defended timeouts as a dignified way for students to regain control of 
their behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are occasions when it is therapeutic for students to have privacy to 
gather themselves up," Rossier said. "That has been removed in the Hughes 
bill."  
</P>
<P>
 Introduced by state Sen. Teresa Hughes (D-Inglewood), the bill originally 
called for a study of how special education students are disciplined. 
</P>
<P>
 Belkin and other education officials agree that the bill was needed to address 
some cases of abuse by teachers against special education students. "The idea 
of the Hughes bill was to look at both bad and good practices and develop 
regulations to implement the good practices statewide," Belkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 One highly publicized case involved an Orange County boy who was killed in 
1987 while at Gill Education Center, a county special education school. 
Fourteen-year-old Barth Pico died when a teacher attempted to stop an outburst 
by the retarded boy by rolling him up in a mat used for physical education. 
</P>
<P>
 But shortly after the bill passed and before the study was completed, the 
state Commission on Special Education, at the request of the state Department 
of Education, asked special education administrators, including Belkin, to 
write regulations that would be used to implement the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a big problem with the regulations," Belkin said. "Some of the 
language in the bill was ambiguous, and there were discrepancies. We were 
trying to write (regulations) for things that weren't clear." 
</P>
<P>
 Sending students to out-of-state facilities is far more expensive than 
educating them locally. The schools, generally located in Utah, Texas and 
Arizona, can charge as much as $200,000 per year for some students. School 
districts pay 30% of the bill, with the state picking up the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Belkin said 30 county students are currently in out-of-state residential 
facilities, at a cost of about $2 million. But that figure does not include the 
cost of housing students or treating psychiatric problems they may have. 
</P>
<P>
 Belkin and other special education administrators are concerned about how the 
regulations are being interpreted by schools, special education advocates and 
parents of special education students. 
</P>
<P>
 The law mandates that a student's "physical freedom" be assured. Belkin and 
others on the regulation committee took that to mean that a student could not 
be placed in a locked room or restrained by straps or other devices. 
</P>
<P>
 But some officials with the state education department say the law prohibits 
any type of restraint. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the Hughes Act says is that you have got to develop a plan if you even 
suspect a child is capable of violent behavior, before that behavior occurs," 
said Allan Simmons, manager of the special education division of the state 
education department. "School is a positive learning situation and even the 
very bizarre behavior can be controlled in a positive way." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the law, teachers may use physical restraint when a student exhibits 
spontaneous, unpredictable behavior that presents a clear and present danger to 
the student or other students, but only the first time a student becomes 
dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 Once that has happened, teachers must develop a behavior intervention plan 
that may not include timeouts for future outbursts, according to several 
education officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Kreil, director of the Northeast Orange County Special Education Local 
Plan Area (SELPA) said he is concerned about the potential for students now 
placed in local facilities, public or private, to be referred back to the 
district because of the Hughes Act regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Students placed in such facilities, Kreil said, are generally those with the 
most profound behavior problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wouldn't send kids to the county if we had the appropriate place for them 
here," Kreil said. "These kids are very challenging." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Hemsley, director of the West Orange County SELPA, said some of the 15 
students from his area currently placed in county or local private schools may 
have to be sent out of state if the regulations are interpreted to mean that no 
form of timeout is permitted. 
</P>
<P>
 "If those schools had to strictly adhere to that interpretation, they would 
need another setting" that allowed timeouts, Hemsley said.

STREET SMARTHEAD BIKE LANES ON FAIRVIEW WILL YIELD WHEN WORK ON RIVERBED ENDS

 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Please tell me who the rocket scientists are who decided to change Fairview 
Street in Santa Ana to a four-lane street. What in the heck were they thinking? 
</P>
<P>
 Fairview was a six-lane street (three lanes in each direction) from the Costa 
Mesa Freeway up to the Santa Ana River crossing. Now it has only two lanes on 
each side, going north from 1st Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to this brilliant change, there was a little bit of congestion. Now 
there's a parking lot. What once took 10 minutes to get through now takes half 
an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Their plan (whatever it was) backfired! Please tell them to give us back our 
lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross Greco 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton 
</P>
<P>
 You can relax. You will get your lanes back in November or December. 
</P>
<P>
 City and county traffic engineers together decided to convert Fairview's outer 
traffic lanes to temporary bike lanes, said Albert Mesch, associate traffic 
engineer for Santa Ana. The decision was approved by Santa Ana's City Council 
and city manager, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The move was done to accommodate bicyclists who cannot use the Santa Ana River 
bike trail during reconstruction of the riverbed, Mesch said. The U.S. Army 
Corps of Engineers, which is doing the work, determined it would be unsafe for 
cyclists to use the bike trails during construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The riverbed project extends from the Pacific Ocean to the city of Orange and 
goes through several cities, Mesch said. Each city involved and the county, 
which owns the river, came up with different alternatives for the cyclists who 
use the river bike trail, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana and the county thought it was best to create a bike route traveling 
up Newhope Street, then on 1st Street between Newhope and Fairview and then up 
and down Fairview between 1st and the Santa Ana River, Mesch said.

 The median strip landscaping on La Palma Avenue just west of the intersection 
at Imperial Highway in Anaheim Hills causes a hazard for anyone wishing to make 
a left-turn exit onto La Palma from the northwest corner shopping center and 
theater complex. 
</P>
<P>
 The taller shrubbery on the median strip obstructs any view of approaching 
eastbound La Palma traffic. These particular shrubs are surrounded by low-lying 
shrubs of a different variety that do not block the view at all. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd like to see the taller shrubs either removed entirely or else spaced at 
intervals to allow essentially clear viewing of oncoming traffic by 
left-turning motorists from this busy shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 Personally, I'm tired of having to decide whether to turn left and risk 
colliding with an unseen vehicle or turn right and travel several miles out of 
my way to return home.

 Ask, and ye shall receive. On the strength of your letter, the Anaheim Parks 
and Recreation Department late last week had the oleanders on La Palma trimmed 
back to the standard 18 inches, said Jack Kudron, parks superintendent for 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Private landscape contractors do the shrub trimming as needed all over the 
city, Kudron said. A city landscape inspector spends much of his time ensuring 
that the contractors do their jobs, but letters like yours are always welcome, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kudron also said his department is considering removing the oleanders and 
replacing them with a lower level shrub that wouldn't require pruning. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart:

 Since there are exits for Alameda Street on both the San Diego and Riverside 
freeways, why are they lacking on the Glenn Anderson (105) Freeway? Why does 
such a major street lack even mention on our newest freeway? 
</P>
<P>
 On the westbound Glenn Anderson, there is not even a sign saying something to 
the effect of "Alameda Street, use next exit." I do not know whether there is 
such signage in the eastbound direction. 
</P>
<P>
 If it is Caltrans' intention not to construct an interchange at Alameda, then 
I recommend signs be erected before the Long Beach Boulevard and Wilmington 
Avenue exits on the westbound Glenn Anderson Freeway and signs before the 
Wilmington Avenue exit on the eastbound side.

 Back in 1972, The state Supreme Court, ruling on challenges to the Glenn 
Anderson Freeway brought by environmental groups, issued a decree in 1972 that 
limited the number of streets that could intersect with the freeway, said Rick 
Holland, a Caltrans spokesman in Los Angeles. Budget constraints and 
environmental concerns were cited in the decree that allowed for only 10 street 
intersections, he said. Western Avenue and Alameda Street were thus eliminated. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Holland said Caltrans does not plan to erect extra signs on the freeway to 
alert motorists of the best exits to take to get to Alameda Avenue. Too many 
signs would be a safety hazard, he said.

GLOOM WITH A VIEW; SLOW TORMENT IN A SLOW HOUSING MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Each time he approaches his dream house on the hill, Darrel Swendener sees the 
signs of his growing discontent. 
</P>
<P>
 First, outside the driveway is the for-sale sign that has perched like a 
vulture for more than two years -- a warning that something is not quite right 
here. And the same clanking realtor's lock box clings to his front door. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, he and his wife, Carol, keep the house spotless -- a necessity in the 
event of a realtor's ambush at most any hour of the day or night. That means no 
dirty dishes, no half-filled coffee cups left on the table, no little 
unfinished projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the browsers with the white gloves and video cameras who wander 
through the bedrooms and bathrooms with their real estate agent guide, all of 
them asking nosy questions, making unfair assumptions, judging the Swendeners 
as much as they're sizing up their house. 
</P>
<P>
 For a couple of years it has gone on, the ebb and flow of would-be buyers who 
always seem to find something wrong: The price is too high. There's no swimming 
pool. Geez, the grass isn't exactly the right color. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Swendeners, who bought the 2,730-square-foot home in 1989, the 
rejections are little insults that have become one big hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like living in a model home -- it's just not ours anymore," Carol, 57, 
says, sitting in the kitchen of the hillside Northridge home with a 280-degree 
panorama of the twinkling San Fernando Valley lights below, a view that some 
days can stretch for 50 miles or more. 
</P>
<P>
 "We watch them come and go, and you finally ask yourself, 'What's wrong with 
my house? I love this place.' You finally decide that your house has a jinx, a 
little black cloud hovering overhead that chases people away." 
</P>
<P>
 In January, that cloud rained more bad news: The couple suffered $60,000 in 
damages during the Northridge earthquake. They only placed their home back on 
the market in late June after Darrel spent months playing fix-it man. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the couple is watching the clock. Arthritis has forced both into early 
retirement. In a few months, they won't be able to afford the mortgage on the 
house they thought they would own through retirement. Now there's no choice but 
to let their dream home go. 
</P>
<P>
 The Swendeners are among thousands of anxious homeowners dragging an A-framed 
ball and chain -- a house that refuses to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 While 1993 brought a modest rise in the number of homes sold in the Valley -- 
the first rise in home sales in four years -- realtors warn that the market 
remains soft. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, according to statistics from the San Fernando Valley Assn. of 
Realtors, 10,506 homes and condominiums were sold locally, a 7.2% rise from 
1992, which saw sales of 9,805. During the same period, however, the average 
price of a single-family home dropped 10.9%, from $283,386 to $252,633, 
representing the third year of decline. 
</P>
<P>
 And so far this year, sales of homes and condos in the Valley are up by 24%, 
but the average price of a single-family residence is down 11% from last year, 
to $231,283. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, a peak sales year, 19,714 single-family homes and condominiums were 
sold in the Valley. The average price of a single-family dwelling, excluding 
condos, was $248,492. 
</P>
<P>
 Such sobering statistics point to several factors at work in the market. For 
one, realtors say, banks are selling hundreds of houses at half the going rate 
in an effort to recoup investments on foreclosed homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's one thing the homeowner has to deal with," said Tom Morehouse, owner 
of Century 21 in Chatsworth. "Banks have 20 or 30 properties to sell at once 
and they blow them all out with real low prices. It's hard for the homeowner to 
compete." 
</P>
<P>
 Many homeowners, especially those who bought their house during the 1980s boom 
and hoped for huge profits, are asking too much, market watchers say. 
</P>
<P>
 "The seller then blames the agent when his house doesn't sell," said Joe 
Andrews, owner of Century 21 All-Star Properties in Canoga Park. "They tell 
you, 'Do something!' But these people have to realize if their asking price is 
unrealistic to begin with, they're not going to sell their home." 
</P>
<P>
 Darrel Swendener says that argument makes his blood boil. 
</P>
<P>
 "The realtors aren't making any money," said the 58-year-old former Sears 
employee. "So they walk right in and say, 'Drop the price.' They're only 
thinking of their commissions. Meanwhile, they're driving the price of every 
house in the area down, down, down. There's no bottom." 
</P>
<P>
 After paying $340,000 for his house in 1989, Swendener put it on the market in 
1992 for $579,950. Later, the price dropped to $470,000. Slowly, like the 
thermometer dropping on a cool autumn night, the asking price plummeted to its 
current level: $335,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were assured that if we dropped the price it would sell immediately," 
Swendener said. "We followed instructions. And nobody even looked at the 
place!" 
</P>
<P>
 The Swendeners are no newcomers to the Southern California housing market. 
They made big profits on two previous homes. But with the Northridge house, 
Darrel says, they made one big mistake: They invested $100,000 in improvements, 
money they'll probably never see again. 
</P>
<P>
 So they sit and wait. Then they can move to Oregon and settle in a more 
affordable community. 
</P>
<P>
 First, though, they have to endure the lookers. 
</P>
<P>
 Without knocking, one woman walked in on a naked Darrel as he showered. 
Another offered Carol cash -- not for the house -- but for the Christmas tree 
ornaments she had made by hand. 
</P>
<P>
 They have watched dumbfounded as Asian investors walk through the house 
speaking only Japanese, bowing as they walk out the door. Another man startled 
Darrel in the garage, holding the couple's guard dog in his hands: "When your 
guard dog gets friendly, you know you've been invaded." 
</P>
<P>
 One day, Darrel lost his cool when a man complained about the browning Bermuda 
grass in the back yard: "I just came unglued. I told both he and the realtor to 
leave. They obviously were not interested in the house. And I had taken all I 
could stand." 
</P>
<P>
 But the end, they know, is coming. 
</P>
<P>
 One day, someone will make the right offer on their dream home. Then they'll 
be free to go -- with tears in their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "For years, it's been like living with a cancer patient," Darrel said. 
"There's been a lot of pain. We want the end to come. But, when it does, we 
know it's going to hurt even more."

STREET SMART

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Since I moved to Agoura Hills in 1991, a section of Agoura Road between 
Liberty Canyon Road in Agoura Hills and Lost Hills Road in Calabasas remains 
closed to traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 This has created rerouting problems whenever there's road-blocking accidents 
on the southbound Ventura Freeway. Whenever this occurs, motorists unfamiliar 
with Liberty Canyon Road travel our residential streets seeking a freeway 
alternative only to find that there is none. This has added to the traffic mess 
and, recently, an accident at the intersection of Liberty Canyon and Country 
Glen Road when a frustrated motorist attempted a U-turn. 
</P>
<P>
 What's going on with that closed section of Agoura Road, and when is it 
expected to reopen, if at all? 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Schultz, Agoura Hills 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 For something to reopen, it has to have first been opened, and unfortunately, 
that strip of Agoura Road does not qualify. Although construction was finished 
six years ago, in the summer of 1988, a tortured history has kept the strip 
closed, despite its ideal position as a freeway bypass route. 
</P>
<P>
 According to county Department of Public Works spokeswoman Jean Granucci, the 
road was built by a developer in exchange for development rights in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 But concerns about landslides kept it from opening immediately after 
construction. Sure enough, in February, 1989, a water main broke, and millions 
of gallons of water and earth tumbled onto the roadway, damaging it. The 
developer was told to check the stability of the slope and repair the road. 
</P>
<P>
 The developer has since gone bankrupt. Its bank then took over, and has pretty 
much finished stabilizing the hillside and fixing the roadway. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's the problem? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, it appears that, after the 1989 landslide, the Las Virgenes Municipal 
Water District relocated its water lines right onto the road itself, curbside. 
The lines are exposed, not buried. 
</P>
<P>
 Who's responsible for moving and burying them, the Las Virgenes MWD or the 
developer's bank? Each says it's the other's responsibility. Now, the two 
parties are locked in litigation to decide who's right, and until it's settled, 
the roadway remains closed to traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 So don't hold your breath. And even after the legal tug-of-war is over, 
Granucci said, you'll have to wait at least another four to six months for the 
actual water-line relocation to be completed before the access road opens. 
</P>

 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Your column has not always caught my attention. I therefore would not be 
surprised if you have addressed this question before. I would love to know what 
is happening with the elevated express lane section of the Harbor Freeway south 
of Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 If work is ongoing, it certainly is being done inconspicuously. What's the 
story? 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Mathews, Glendale 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Work on the $500-million Harbor Freeway improvement project is indeed ongoing. 
You are correct, however, that it is being done inconspicuously. In fact, 
that's the idea, according to Caltrans senior resident engineer Mike Perovich. 
</P>
<P>
 The 19.6-mile project -- which includes three elevated portions -- began 
construction in 1989. Perhaps the project's most noticeable element has been 
the elevated portions, which are called viaducts. 
</P>
<P>
 But big freeway projects are done in stages. Work on the viaducts stops while 
workers concentrate on widening the freeway roadbed. Most of this work is 
taking place behind sound walls and "gawk screens," which explains why you are 
unable to see it. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Caltrans is trying to minimize the project's impact by keeping 
most lanes open except overnight, and widening most bridges in phases to 
alleviate the pressure on surrounding surface streets. 
</P>
<P>
 That, says Perovich, is why the work seems to be taking so long. If Caltrans 
just shut the freeway down entirely like the earthquake did the Santa Monica 
Freeway, the project could be finished much faster. 
</P>
<P>
 For the record, most of the project will be completed in 1996, with final work 
scheduled to be done in 1997.

COUNTY SEEKS PUBLIC-SAFETY SHIELD AGAINST CUTS; SPENDING: LAW ENFORCEMENT 
OFFICIALS ARE WORKING ON A PLAN TO EXPAND DEFINITION OF SERVICES FUNDED BY 
SPECIAL SALES TAX REVENUE. MEANWHILE, SUPERVISORS OPEN THEIR BUDGET DISCUSSIONS 
TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHYLLIS W. JORDAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bound by their own promise to exempt public safety from budget cuts, Ventura 
County leaders are now looking for new ways to define public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Animal control officers rounding up vicious dogs, medical examiners performing 
autopsies, even personnel recruiters hiring new sheriff's deputies could all 
come under that umbrella -- and eventually benefit from the special sales tax 
revenue pumping nearly $30 million into criminal justice budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials, who until recently were accusing the Board of 
Supervisors of "money laundering," are now working on a plan to expand public 
safety's reach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking for a way to deliver as much public service as we can relate to 
law enforcement, and I am willing to accept responsibility for the (services) 
under my budget," Sheriff Larry Carpenter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter said the plan could include county services, such as purchasing, 
personnel and vehicle maintenance. It could also involve specific jobs, such as 
airport and harbor security guards, coroners and animal-regulation officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Still unclear is whether law enforcement departments would assume control over 
these services and jobs, or simply share revenues provided through the 
Proposition 172, half-cent sales tax extended by the voters last November. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Carpenter and Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury have said that any 
diversion of the tax revenue would constitute a breach of faith with the 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
 The sheriff and district attorney will present their proposal to the board 
today when budget deliberations resume. Ultimately, it will be the supervisors 
who control the use of the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members said they would welcome a solution to their dilemma of 
supporting law enforcement without gutting the rest of county government. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there has to be some kind of sharing and I'm not sure what form that 
would take," Supervisor Maggie Kildee said. "There's nobody who wants to cut 
public safety." 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as March, the board pledged $24 million of the sales tax money to 
expand services for the sheriff, district attorney, public defender and 
Corrections Services Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 But faced with a mounting deficit and unexpected state cuts, board members say 
they may have to trim those budgets now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm willing to admit that I made an honest mistake, and I'm going to have to 
deal with that," Supervisor Maria VanderKolk said at a recent meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 But that would mean breaking the promise the supervisors made in March and 
risking the wrath of voters who expected Proposition 172 money to be used 
specifically for public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, law enforcement and political figures have warned of the political 
repercussions with the voters. 
</P>
<P>
 But if they don't touch criminal justice, board members would have to slash 
20% of all remaining county agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 In a worst-case scenario, that could cost 124 jobs, limit poor residents' 
access to medical care, eliminate services for veterans, trim mental health and 
animal control staffs and gut the medical examiner's staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're going to wipe out or severely cripple some of those services public 
safety has to have," Supervisor Vicky Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy Jenks, who heads the Animal Regulation Department, said she saw this 
coming. She has watched her staff drop from 65 to 48 workers in the past five 
years. This year's cuts would take another six employees and shut down the 
kennel in east Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 So Jenks submitted a letter to the board, suggesting that some of her 
operations be considered public safety and, thus, be exempted from budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not saying that our kennel operation is public safety," Jenks said. 
"But things like vicious dogs and biting dogs and animals on the highway, those 
are definitely public safety issues." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department calls on her officers to help break up cockfights or 
handle sea animals stranded on the beach, she said. This year's budget cuts, 
however, would eliminate the officers she uses for such emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenks' letter also suggested putting the county medical examiner's office and 
even some building inspectors under the public safety umbrella. 
</P>
<P>
 Other department managers say they too could make an argument for including 
their services. "I clearly think our department is part of a public safety 
department," said Randall Feltman, director of county's Mental Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who are mentally ill who are receiving treatment are safe, stable 
members of society. People who are not receiving treatment are going to 
encounter law enforcement. It's obvious, we're going to pay for it through 
mental health professionals or sheriff's deputies." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the County Fire Department has argued that it should receive some 
of the funds provided in the special sales tax. Supervisors refused to grant 
firefighters any of the money until the department streamlines its operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter would not discuss his proposal in detail, and Dist. Atty. Michael 
Bradbury could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 But the sheriff said he was eager to try something new. "I can tell you that 
we have for some time wanted to break out of the typical bureaucratic mode," he 
said. "I do think if the board is genuinely interested, within two or three 
years we really can become more efficient." 
</P>
<P>
 The debate over whether law enforcement agencies should absorb some of this 
year's cuts is just a piece of the larger budget question facing county 
supervisors: how to hack as much as $19 million from the county's $880-million 
spending plan for fiscal 1994-'95. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, the board's budget subcommittee prepared a cost-cutting proposal 
that serves as a base for further negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, however, the board disbanded the subcommittee and pledged that all 
five supervisors would develop the budget together. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is, the full board has not yet agreed on a plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, Supervisor John K. Flynn proposed approaching the budget 
on a three-year basis, using long-term reorganization of county government to 
cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
 His plan calls for using reserve funds to balance the budget, while waiting 
for the long-term reductions to take effect. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors have agreed to try Flynn's approach. But they have not 
resolved what mix of cuts and reserve funds they should use. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn favors a plan that would rely heavily on reserve funds this year and cut 
deep into the budget in the years ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 But other supervisors want to see major overall reductions this year, as much 
as $15 million. That would leave the board in better shape next year, when the 
state is again expected to cut county funding. 
</P>
<P>
 VanderKolk and Howard, the two supervisors not seeking reelection this 
November, both favor that approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, I'd rather do it now, which is odd because I could slough it off to 
the next guy," VanderKolk said. "There is no way you're going to get around 
this next year." 
</P>
<P>
 VanderKolk has advocated cutting benefits for county employees. That could 
include reducing health insurance, forcing county workers to take off days 
without pay and cutting managers' perks. 
</P>
<P>
 But many of those issues are governed by union contracts and would be 
difficult to change, other supervisors say. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you offer benefits, it's part of a pay package you negotiate," Flynn 
said. "When you get into negotiations, you're not going to be able to change 
that much. I don't want to waste time on that." 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn supports an early retirement plan and cuts in spending for staff travel 
and training. But he said the big savings will come with structural change in 
the county government, dramatic shifts that would take two to three years to 
achieve. 
</P>
<P>
 Kildee supports spreading the cuts over the years, with $10 million to $12 
million coming this week. "In my mind, it would be very hard to downsize all at 
once at the end of three years, even if you plan for it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors will open budget deliberations today with final pleas from 
department heads. A public hearing will follow this evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, supervisors will begin making final decisions in deliberations that 
could continue for the rest of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to have some very tough days in the next week," Howard said.

DEPUTY D.A. MAKES CASE AGAINST DISABILITY; CAREERS: DAVID LEHR HAS NEVER LET 
CEREBRAL PALSY HOLD HIM BACK. THE VENTURA ATTORNEY BELIEVES IN THE PHILOSOPHY: 
'USE WHAT YOU'VE GOT.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 David Lehr, a rookie Ventura County prosecutor born with cerebral palsy, 
acknowledges that his condition may have benefited him on occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Such was the case when Lehr plastered campaign signs on his walker during a 
bid for 10th-grade class president at Chatsworth High School. 
</P>
<P>
 To say the least, the strategy did not impress Lehr's opponent, who was 
trounced. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doesn't it bother you that some people are voting for you because they are 
feeling sorry for you?" the sulking opponent asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Recalling the anecdote last week, Lehr smiled sheepishly and said: "Use what 
you've got." 
</P>
<P>
 Many people say that the 26-year-old Ventura resident, who doctors predicted 
would never walk on his own, has done just that. 
</P>
<P>
 At age 10, he ditched his walker during a Special Olympics race. In high 
school, he won the class presidency. In 1990, he received a bachelor's degree 
at UC Santa Barbara. Two years ago, he earned his law degree. And last April, 
he was tabbed for one of the 19 sought-after openings as a Ventura County 
deputy district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 But success for Lehr has not come without extraordinary challenges, some 
frustrations and a few major setbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervising prosecutors at the district attorney's misdemeanor unit said they 
hired Lehr after he did a sound job during a short stint as a temporary worker. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very apparent to us that David could do the job," said the unit's 
supervisor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Nancy Ayers. "It wasn't part of the hiring 
decision that, 'Yes, we were going to give him the job because he is disabled, 
or we were not going to give him the job because he is disabled.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But other potential employers were not so open-minded, Lehr said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was continually passed over for positions with private law firms after 
graduating from Golden Gate University in San Francisco in December, 1992, and 
passing the State Bar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe every employer has a doubt when they see me walk in for an 
interview," Lehr said. "I know if they hire me I'll do a better job than most 
other people because my willpower will outlast anybody with functional legs." 
</P>
<P>
 No one has ever directly mentioned Lehr's condition in rejecting him for a 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 "They never say that that was the reason," Lehr explained. "But when they are 
talking afterward, they mention a few other things -- and they all have to do 
with my cerebral palsy." 
</P>
<P>
 The exact number of Ventura County residents with cerebral palsy is not known, 
but 163 county residents with the condition receive government medical 
services, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cerebral palsy is a motor disorder characterized by spastic paralysis. It 
often occurs at birth or in early childhood and results from damage to the 
central nervous system. 
</P>
<P>
 In Lehr's case, he did not breathe during his first four to six minutes of 
life. That cut off oxygen to his brain, causing damage to some brain cells, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The condition sends constant signals to his muscle groups, Lehr said, leading 
to some involuntary muscle reactions. Lehr, however, learned to counteract 
those reactions through physical therapy, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people afflicted with cerebral palsy have no control over their muscles 
and remain in a fetal position or must use wheelchairs. Lehr said he is "about 
halfway down the scale." 
</P>
<P>
 Lehr uses a cane to get around. He walks with an unsteady gait, and sometimes 
has difficulty controlling the movements of his muscles. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I get real excited, and I'm not concentrating on relaxing, I have a hard 
time making normal movements," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was after a 40-yard dash in a Special Olympics competition that Lehr, in 
the middle of a football stadium, put down his walker. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some reason, and I have no idea why, I just let it go and started 
walking," he remembered. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother was pleasantly surprised, considering that doctors had said her son 
would never get around without a walker. "Mom took a picture and cried a lot," 
Lehr recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, he has had to use the walker only occasionally, like during the 
10th-grade election for class president. 
</P>
<P>
 Lehr said his real love -- besides law -- is politics. He has been running for 
offices since sixth grade. 
</P>
<P>
 In high school, he once spent a couple hundred dollars on a race for class 
president. But his opponent still did him one better. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to a fairly wealthy high school, and I'm not wealthy," he said. "My 
opponents would staple their names to candy wrappers or balloons. Somebody 
bought like 50 T-shirts with everybody's names on them at $10 apiece." 
</P>
<P>
 It's one reason Lehr felt comfortable putting campaign signs on his walker. 
</P>
<P>
 He finished law school in just six semesters, the minimum allowed by the 
American Bar Assn. It was after passing the State Bar exam in spring, 1993, 
that Lehr began having trouble landing a job. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County district attorney's office was in a hiring freeze because 
of a budget crisis. And private law firms apparently did not think a person 
with cerebral palsy could do the job, Lehr said. 
</P>
<P>
 So last October he did the only thing he could. He began working as a 
volunteer in the district attorney's juvenile unit, where he won 54 of 58 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's hard-working, he's committed," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Karen Block, a 
juvenile prosecutor. "To do the same job physically as anyone else takes him an 
incredible amount of effort -- little things you don't think about on a 
day-to-day basis. He's about one of the smartest people I've met." 
</P>
<P>
 He has also brought levity to the often staid quarters of the district 
attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Swiping stationery from Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury, Lehr sent memos to 
the other new prosecutors announcing a swearing-in ceremony April 1 in 
Courtroom 28 of the Hall of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Problem is, no such courtroom exists. But many of his colleagues, excited 
about the occasion, fell for Lehr's April Fools' Day prank. It was only after 
some of them started phoning their parents and arranging for them to attend the 
ceremony from out of town that Lehr fessed up. 
</P>
<P>
 Lehr, who wants to run for Congress in 1998, said he hopes his accomplishments 
illustrate that people with cerebral palsy can live productive lives. His dream 
is to run for President. 
</P>
<P>
 If those aspirations ever come true, he said, he doesn't plan on using a 
walker during the campaign -- unless he has to.

STREET SMART: THERE'S NO TIMETABLE FOR SYNCHRONIZING VICTORIA AVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Every day, I drive along Victoria Avenue in Oxnard, and every day I run into 
the same problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The lights on northbound Victoria at Wooley, 5th Street and Gonzales Road are 
not synchronized. 
</P>
<P>
 This causes unnecessary delays that could be avoided if the timing of the 
lights were in sync. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this change possible? 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Nelson, Oxnard 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Control over the strip of Victoria Avenue you drive each day is split two 
ways. 
</P>
<P>
 The portion of Victoria that includes Wooley and 5th Street falls within the 
city of Oxnard, while Gonzales Road is in unincorporated county territory. 
Regarding synchronization, it is difficult to coordinate such a project that 
crosses both city and county territory, says Butch Britt, county deputy public 
works director. 
</P>
<P>
 He adds that he has heard few complaints about the timing of the lights along 
this stretch of Victoria. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Britt says he has not observed any major backups on Victoria 
between Wooley and Gonzales and counsels patience on the part of drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've driven this road quite a bit, and I don't see any problem with it," 
Britt says. "It's not supposed to be the Indy 500." 
</P>
<P>
 Samia Maximous, Oxnard transportation manager, says the signals are far enough 
apart that synchronized timing is not absolutely necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 However, she says the city will study the effect of synchronizing the signals 
the city controls, at least during rush hour. 
</P>

 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I was pleased to read that Caltrans has opened a new bike lane along the 
Moorpark Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 As an avid cyclist, I am always happy to learn about new places to ride my 
bike. 
</P>
<P>
 Are there plans for any other new bike lanes in the county? 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Johnson, Thousand Oaks 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans has no immediate plans to install any more roadside bike lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 But a plan for a 200-mile countywide bike path system will soon be considered 
by the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the paths would greatly improve mobility for bicyclists 
throughout the county.

 Dear Street Smart:

<P>
 There's a crosswalk in Ventura that is very dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 It's located on Harbor Boulevard at the end of a footbridge near the Ventura 
Pier between San Jon Road and California Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The cars come very fast, and it's hard to get them to stop. It's especially 
dangerous at sundown because the sun limits visibility. 
</P>
<P>
 With all the tourists and residential traffic, it would seem ideal for a stop 
sign or light. 
</P>
<P>
 As it is, it looks like an accident waiting to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Helfert, Ventura 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 The crosswalk you refer to is not perfect, but it was the safest spot near the 
pier for a crossing, says Nazir Lalani, Ventura traffic engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really looked carefully before we put the crosswalk in there," Lalani 
says. "It is the best place we could find where drivers can see pedestrians." 
</P>
<P>
 The city decided not to install a stop sign or traffic signal because the 
crosswalk is located mid-block, Lalani says. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this type of situation, the accident level could actually increase if you 
put in a stop sign or traffic signal," Lalani says. "Cars just won't stop." 
</P>
<P>
 Next year, the city is planning to overhaul a large portion of the beachfront, 
making access to the beach easier for pedestrians, Lalani says. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, wary pedestrians may want to walk down to California Street to 
cross.

VENTURA PIER BECOMES MEMORIAL OF TEARS, JOY; TRIBUTE: GRIEVING MOTHER FINDS A 
WAY TO KEEP HER SON'S MEMORY ALIVE. SHE JOINS OTHERS IN ADDING LOVED ONES' 
NAMES TO THE HISTORIC STRUCTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In the months after 23-year-old Richard Adams drowned in an accident near the 
Ventura Pier, his mother, Carolyn, would scour the beach night after night in a 
desperate search for her lost son. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard's body was discovered near Pierpont Beach two weeks after his 
disappearance, but his distraught mother continued to look for her son. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never saw his body. That made it harder," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard's body was later taken for a closed-casket burial in Stockton, where 
he was born. That left Adams with another sense of emptiness because she and 
others in her Ventura community had no local grave site where they could mourn 
her son. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have someone -- and you love them and you lose them -- the worst 
fear you have is that people will forget about him," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But last August, Adams found a way to honor Richard's memory. 
</P>
<P>
 She joined hundreds of other Ventura County residents who have donated $105 to 
$125 each for a plank on the pier and an inscription on a plaque honoring the 
dead. The money goes toward a $1-million fund for future restoration of the 
122-year-old structure, which at 1,958 feet is the longest wooden pier in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Since it was launched last June, the "Pier Into the Future" campaign has 
raised about $330,000, organizers say. And contributions are still coming at 
the rate of about 10 a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It kind of dribbles in," said Marita Clark, a campaign volunteer who 
processes donations. "And then we may have a surge." 
</P>
<P>
 The 700 memorial inscriptions join another 2,000 names of living donors etched 
on charcoal-colored granite plaques displayed at the pier's mouth. Fifty-five 
larger donations -- one as much as $15,000 from a business -- have been 
received since last summer, said campaign chairman Monty Clark, Marita's 
husband. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign organizers had hoped to collect 75% of the $1-million goal by the end 
of last year, Monty Clark said. But the flagging economy and a lack of 
hoped-for commitments from area business slowed progress, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, "we're going to keep plugging away at it," he said. The pier, shut down 
for 13 months for repairs from a series of damaging winter storms, reopened 
last October after a $3.5-million renovation. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, about $300,000 of the money stockpiled by the fund has been invested 
in mainly low-risk stocks and bonds by the Ventura County Community Foundation, 
said Kate McLean, the foundation's president. The remaining $30,000 in savings 
is kept in a checking account for easier access for administrative costs. 
</P>
<P>
 McLean, whose nonprofit group oversees investments for community-oriented 
organizations, said the goal for the pier fund is to eventually earn more money 
than the community has contributed and provide a source of money for pier 
upkeep. 
</P>
<P>
 Individual donors give for a variety of reasons, Marita Clark said. Some feel 
an emotional tie to the historic structure and want to commemorate a marriage 
proposal made there or some other special event in their lives. Some have even 
bought a plank as a wedding gift, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a couple that came up to us at the Fourth of July street fair 
(booth this year) who recently got engaged on the pier," she said, reflecting 
some of the happier contributors. "They were going to buy a plank so their 
names would be on the granite marker there." 
</P>
<P>
 The "In Memoriam" plaque, which includes Richard Adams' name, has helped her 
move forward in her healing, Carolyn Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It helps you realize that he's gone, which is probably what a grave does," 
Adams said. For her and her 27-year-old daughter, Tammy, Richard's plank and 
inscription are prized possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard worked for several years within a block of the pier as a parking 
garage attendant. Often, Adams said, he would take his dog to the beach at the 
pier and throw sticks in the water, playing fetch. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was on one of those days that Richard mysteriously disappeared, and his 
dog walked into a nearby hotel lobby a short time after his master was last 
seen alive. Adams said she believes Richard was out on a jetty near the pier 
and must have slipped off and hit his head on a jagged rock as a tide swept in. 
</P>
<P>
 "He loved Ventura," she said, "and he loved being near the pier, so to me the 
memorial is kind of symbolic that he liked this area." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first names on the memorial plaque is that of a Ventura man in his 
late 20s who is dying of AIDS, Marita Clark said. He approached Clark and asked 
to have his own name placed on the "In Memoriam" plaque. 
</P>
<P>
 "That one was really hard," she said. "He is facing his own mortality, and it 
forced everyone else around (in the office) to do that too." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark said she believes the man's name represents the only living person found 
on the memorial plaque. 
</P>
<P>
 For 59-year-old Stephen Flores, a fifth-generation Ventura resident, it was 
the wish to do something for his grandfather that drew him to make a memorial 
donation. 
</P>
<P>
 Flores bought a plank in memory of his grandfather, a Teamster from 1917 to 
about 1925 who loaded and hauled lumber on a horse-drawn wagon from ships that 
pulled up to the pier, which at that time served as a wharf. 
</P>
<P>
 "He died before I was born," Flores said. But the pier served as a place to 
remember the grandfather Flores never knew. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we were growing up, the pier was a place for us to go and fish," Flores 
said. "I knew that my grandfather worked on it. Naturally, I feel a strong 
belonging to the pier. It's part of Ventura." 
</P>
<P>
 Renee Evans of Fillmore also has a nostalgic attachment to the pier. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent afternoon, Evans cast lines off the end of the Ventura Pier, her 
first fishing excursion with her 14-year-old son, Scott. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she has considered donating to the pier, and may still, because she 
treasures fond memories from her youth when she fished at the pier with her 
father. "We used to fish through the cracks in the pier," she said. "My dad 
wouldn't allow us to fish near the edge. He was afraid we'd fall off. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to have it back -- it's like an old friend came back," she said. 
"It's going to be a lot of memories for a lot of young kids, just like I've 
got." FYI (East Ventura County Edition, B4) 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of purchasing a plank on the pier and having a name inscribed on a 
granite plaque is $120, plus a $5 processing fee. For more information on the 
"Pier Into the Future Campaign," call Ventura City Hall at 658-4726.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; CITY TO CONSIDER FATE OF DEVELOPER'S BRIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The fate of a pedestrian bridge that would link the Crossroads and Westpark 
Plaza shopping centers will be decided by the City Council on Sept. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Co. agreed build the $500,000 bridge across San Diego Creek several 
years ago in exchange for city approval of the Westpark Plaza development. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has asked the City Council to remove the bridge requirement from 
the development agreement. The company said the structure would be seldom used 
by shoppers and would not fit in with the design of the retail centers. 
</P>
<P>
 But some city officials and residents want the bridge. The link would 
encourage people to walk or bicycle to their favorite shops rather than drive, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Crossroads contains a Mervyn's department store as well as specialty 
shops. Westpark Plaza includes a Lucky Food Center and Payless Drug Store. The 
company eventually plans to build movie theaters and a restaurant at the plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 A survey for the city released this month found that many tenants at both 
shopping centers favor the bridge proposal as long as they are not charged 
additional rent for the project. SHELBY GRAD

<P>
 Seven people have taken out candidacy papers so far for the November city 
elections, including the only incumbent expected to run for reelection, Mayor 
Susan Withrow. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Potocki was the first potential candidate to pick up papers last week, on 
the opening day of the filing period for city elections.Potocki, a board member 
on the El Toro Water District, was also one of the leaders of the Aegean Hills 
annexation drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Another candidate is Larry Gilbert, a businessman and longtime critic of City 
Hall's spending habits, who is a fixture at City Council meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Also taking out papers were Mirid Weidner, who works at home, and Neil 
Lonzinger, a businessman. 
</P>
<P>
 Lonzinger, a neighbor of Gilbert's, decided to run for the council after 
several long discussions between the two men about Mission Viejo politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Withrow obtained her filing papers Wednesday, while two more potential 
candidates, attorney Joseph Saunders and computer specialist Keni Cyr-Rumble, 
came to City Hall on Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The filing period ends Aug. 12, unless at least one incumbent declines to run 
for reelection. The filing period would then be extended to Aug. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbent council members Robert D. Breton and Sharon Cody have both said they 
will not run for office in 1994. FRANK MESSINA

 The pageant, last performed in 1988 in San Clemente, is expected to begin next 
July with a two-week run at its new venue here.The production is a story of 
California settlement by Spanish missionaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Bertha Henry Taylor, a member of a committee overseeing the revival of the 
pageant, said that organizers are optimistic that the shows will be the first 
of many. 
</P>
<P>
 During a news conference last week at the mission, a check for $35,000 was 
given to the South Orange County Community Theatre by the now-defunct La 
Christianita Pageant Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The group dissolved so its assets could be turned over to the new committee, 
made up of members from the San Juan Capistrano Chamber of Commerce, Mission 
San Juan Capistrano and playhouses that operate under the South Orange County 
Community Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald Miller, business manager of the mission, said officials want to see the 
pageant performed every year. 
</P>
<P>
 Norman Wright, the pageant's playwright, told those gathered Thursday that the 
pageant may have finally found a permanent home. "We think it will have a long 
and well-deserved run," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Open auditions will be held in the spring. For more information, call (714)

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; 13 TAKE OUT PAPERS FOR 2 COUNCIL SEATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The race for two open seats on the City Council is already shaping up to be a 
crowded one, with 13 potential candidates taking out nomination papers last 
week, according to the city clerk's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidate filings do not close until Aug. 12, and potential candidates have 
until then to return their documents with the signatures of at least 20 
registered Anaheim voters, City Clerk Leonora Sohl said. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-year terms of Councilmen Fred Hunter, Irv Pickler and Bob. D. Simpson 
expire in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Pickler and Hunter are prohibited by term limits from seeking reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson has said he will not run again for the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Although this means there are three open council seats, only two will be up 
for election because of a charter amendment passed in 1992 that changed the 
selection process of the city's mayor, Sohl said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are five council members, with one serving as mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, one of the council members was selected by the voters to be 
mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 But beginning this year, someone running for mayor need not be a council 
member to run for the office, Sohl said. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, incumbent Tom Daly and retired businessman Curtis A. Stickler have 
taken out nomination papers in the race for mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 If Daly were to lose the mayoral race, however, he would retain his council 
seat for two more years; that would eliminate one of the open seats. 
</P>
<P>
 If Daly is elected mayor and a third seat remains open, the City Council will 
have 60 days to appoint someone to the position. 
</P>
<P>
 If they fail to do so, then the city must hold a special election, Sohl said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who had taken out nomination papers for a City Council seat as of Friday 
afternoon were: Keith Oleson, a computer hardware salesman who ran in 1992; 
Loretta Sanchez Brixey, a public finance specialist; and Leonard Lahtinen, a 
high school teacher and member of the North Orange County Community College 
District board. 
</P>
<P>
 Also taking out papers were: Lou Lopez, an Anaheim police officer and a member 
of the Anaheim City School District and Anaheim Union High School District 
boards of education; Sharon A. Ericson, president of the largest employee union 
and an office supervisor in the Parks and Recreation Department; and Shirley A. 
McCrackin, an educational consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the following people took out nomination papers: Mitchell T. 
Tracy, an assistant program director; Jerry R. Stoces, a buyer in the aerospace 
industry who ran in 1988; John A. Russo, a sales representative; Paul V. 
Bostwick, an Anaheim business owner; Jason D. LeVecke, a business manager; Kurt 
F. Meidinger, a pattern maker; and Phyllis R. Boydstun, a real estate broker.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; CITY VOTES TO BEGIN TELEVISING MEETINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After months of debate on whether to broadcast City Council meetings, council 
members have embraced lights, camera, action. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning with the council's Aug. 2 meeting, residents will be able to watch 
their council members in session. 
</P>
<P>
 The meetings will be aired live on Comcast, Channel 53, the city's government 
channel that usually carries public service announcements, at a cost of about 
$30,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members voted 4 to 1 last week to televise their meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Don Bankhead cast the dissenting vote, saying he would rather use 
the money to buy books for the library. 
</P>
<P>
 Airing the council meetings live saves the city the expense of taping them and 
making copies available for the public, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 They said that for years residents have been asking to see their council on 
television. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor A.B. (Buck) Catlin said he objects to spending money on televising 
council meetings in light of the current fiscal restraints on the city, which 
have shrunk the library's book-buying budget by about $70,000 over the past 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
 But Catlin said he has received numerous phone calls and letters from 
residents urging him to support televising the council meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The general rhetoric of the public seems to say, 'We want to see televised 
council meetings,' " Catlin said. "But I think that's not as effective a way to 
use the money for public education as a library is." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Chris Norby, who has proposed televising council meetings every 
year since the mid-1980s, disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad that we're doing it," Norby said. "I think had we done it earlier, 
some of the divisiveness of the last couple of years might have been avoided. 
But better late than never." MIMI KO

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; DANCE-A-THON BENEFITS NEW AIDS FACILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five hours of music and dance attracted hundreds of people to the Ventura 
Theatre on Sunday for the Christopher House's first Dance-a-Thon, a 
fund-raising benefit for Ventura's only home for AIDS patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really need housing for people who are infected with HIV and AIDS," said 
Martina Rippey, who helped organize Sunday's benefit. "Many times these people 
have nowhere else to stay because their families have turned them away." 
</P>
<P>
 The theater space and food were donated by local businesses and groups eager 
to support the Christopher House Foundation, which operates the 12-bed facility 
on Thompson Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The event netted the organization an estimated $7,000, according to a 
Christopher House spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "The house is all full, but we just lost one (patient) last week," said 
foundation board member Edwina Garcia. "Someone else will move into that room 
soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Alison Arngrim, who played the spiteful Nellie Olsen on the "Little House on 
the Prairie" television show, was the guest emcee for Sunday's fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
 "Steve Tracy, my husband on the show, died of AIDS," she said. "I was good 
friends with him and took it pretty hard. So ever since then I've been involved 
in the cause." 
</P>
<P>
 Joni Bernard, a psychiatric technician who works at Ventura County Mental 
Health, brought her husband, Jose, and their two young boys to the dance 
marathon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is the beginning of a long road ahead of us," said Bernard, who 
raised $210 by soliciting sponsors to pledge donations. "There's a real need 
for people to be informed about the magnitude of this illness and how it's 
affecting people's lives." 
</P>
<P>
 For Alexis Krajeski, the benefit Sunday was a chance to help a good cause and 
have some fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just love to dance," said the 16-year-old Agoura High School student, who 
raised $65 in pledges. "Besides, AIDS needs more research and attention." 
</P>
<P>
 The Christopher House opened June 1 after a four-year effort supported 
primarily by volunteers and donations. JEFF McDONALD

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: FLYNN OPPOSED TO IMMIGRANTS MEASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHYLLIS W. JORDAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Supervisor John K. Flynn is urging the Ventura County Board of Supervisors to 
take a stand against a ballot initiative aimed at denying education and 
services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "The proposal has the potential of condemning a whole ethnic group because of 
their skin color," Flynn wrote in a letter to his fellow supervisors."It could 
subject them to suspicion and searches, make them prey to criminal activities 
and could create an entire underclass." 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called "Save Our State" initiative purports to save $300 million in 
state and local revenue by withholding medical care and social services to 
undocumented residents. 
</P>
<P>
 School districts, on the other hand, could spend as much as $10 million 
annually trying to verify whether students and their parents are legal 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is an inappropriate, emotional reaction to the state's ongoing inability 
to effectively manage the fiscal problems of the state of California," wrote 
Flynn, who serves a large Latino population in his Oxnard area district. "It is 
a thinly veiled attempt to make immigrants the brunt of a much deeper, systemic 
and structural problem facing California." 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors will consider Flynn's proposal at Tuesday's meeting. PHYLLIS 
W. JORDAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; CITY TO WEIGH PLANS FOR BALBOA BAY CLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB ELSTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council tonight will consider approval of conceptual plans for 
expanding the Balboa Bay Club. 
</P>
<P>
 The council vote comes a month after the Planning Commission voted unanimously 
to grant approval to the $25-million project, which would entail demolishing 
and rebuilding much of the club.The hearing tonight is not expected to draw 
much opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think we have a very good project here," said Dave Wooten, president of 
the Bay Club. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote would specifically approve the Bay Club's application for changing 
the zoning of its leased land from residential to a planned community, 
approving a study of the traffic impacts of the project and permitting the club 
to exceed the basic 26-foot height limit on property along Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 The project calls for an expansion of the club from about 155,000 square feet 
to about 189,000 square feet and adding a new members-only athletic facility, a 
public restaurant, coffee shop, two bars, a ballroom, four conference rooms and 
bay-front walkways. 
</P>
<P>
 The overall project seeks to give the club a badly needed overhaul while also 
providing a better view of the ocean and the harbor to residents who live on 
the inland bluffs overlooking the club, say club officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The private Balboa Bay Club, which was built in 1948, has long been home to 
the rich and famous. It has never been open to the general public, though it 
sits on city-owned property along Mariners Mile on West Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 If the plans are approved, Bay Club officials predict that the opening stages 
of demolition will take place within three to five years. BOB ELSTON

<TEXT>
<P>
 After more than two decades in data processing, Anne Johnson-Grim of Oxnard 
decided she wanted to do something "more in touch with people." 
</P>
<P>
 So at 51, she signed up for nursing school in Woodland Hills.Now she is one of 
seven Ventura County nursing students honored with scholarships from Kaiser 
Permanente, the health care conglomerate that runs hospitals and HMOs 
throughout Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The corporation has awarded a total of $144,000 in scholarships to 161 
registered nursing students throughout the region. 
</P>
<P>
 "As part of our commitment to support our communities and to ensure a 
qualified, well-trained work force, Kaiser Permanente encourages and assists 
those pursuing careers in nursing," said Carol Stern, recruitment director for 
hospitals in Panorama City and Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson-Grim, who attends Pierce College, received a $1,000 award for academic 
excellence. All 25 winners in that category had grade-point averages of 3.7 or 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Three students at Ventura College -- Caryn Dugas, Isabel Marquez and Sharon 
Brown -- received $1,000 scholarships designated specially for students 
pursuing nursing as a second career. All three live in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Three more Ventura County residents received $500 scholarships for programs 
affiliated with Kaiser Permanente hospitals in Southern California. They are 
Patricia Andreas of Simi Valley, who attends Pierce College; Kerry Hicks of 
Oxnard, who attends Ventura College, and Rommeil Felix of Oxnard, who attends 
Moorpark College. PHYLLIS W. JORDAN

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; SUSPECT IN FATAL SHOOTING ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police on Sunday arrested a Ventura man who investigators suspect shot and 
killed a 23-year-old transient in a Ventura home last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas A. Corral was taken into custody in Las Vegas by Ventura police, but 
further details on the arrest were not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
 Corral is suspected of storming into his girlfriend's Ventura home last 
Thursday and killing Roger Rowland, whom police described as a drifter, with a 
single gunshot to the stomach. He died about 45 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
 A police spokeswoman said Sunday the warrant for Corral's arrest was issued 
sometime over the weekend by a Ventura County judge. Authorities said Corral 
was also wanted by police in connection with a 1991 kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are also seeking Ruben Viveros, 19, for questioning. Viveros allegedly 
accompanied Corral into the apartment on Kirk Avenue where the shooting 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 As of late Sunday, Viveros had not been located by authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said Corral's 18-year-old girlfriend, who is also the mother of 
his infant, lives in the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Corral has been a fugitive since being identified as a suspect in 
the 1991 ransom kidnaping of a 3-year-old Los Angeles boy. JULIE FIELDS

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; AIRPORT REUSE STUDY HIGH ON CITY'S LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city will pay up to half the cost of an El Toro Marine Corps Air Station 
reuse study -- a $125,000 symbol of the city's commitment to fight automatic 
conversion of the air base into a commercial airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo is one of seven South County cities discussing how much to 
contribute toward the $250,000 study. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say Mission Viejo will likely contribute from $32,000 to 
$60,000 but is prepared to go higher if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the council has been consistent in realizing how critical the El Toro 
(reuse plan) is to Mission Viejo quality of life," said Mayor Susan Withrow, 
the city's representative on the South County Cities Working Group. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Mission Viejo, South County cities represented in the coalition 
include Laguna Hills, Laguna Niguel, Laguna Beach, Dana Point, San Juan 
Capistrano and Lake Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 The El Toro air base is on the federal closure list and North County cities 
want to see the facility converted into a commercial airport. Cringing at the 
thought of hundreds of noisy jet airliners passing overhead daily, the South 
County cities have banded to fight the airport proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The group voted recently to hire Kotin, Regan and Mouchlin Inc. to conduct the 
study, requiring the consultant to hire an airport planning expert to assist in 
research. 
</P>
<P>
 South County cities want to examine major areas of the El Toro reuse concept. 
</P>
<P>
 The consultant will examine six past studies of the El Toro 
conversion/commercial airport issue. 
</P>
<P>
 South County cities hope to define the economic impact of an international 
airport for Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The study will also look at alternative proposals for the air base, such as 
housing or retail uses, and compare their economic impact to what is expected 
from an airport. 
</P>
<P>
 An environmental study will also be done "that won't be too in-depth because 
of the 30- to 45-day time frame (for the study), but it will look at noise and 
safety issues related to an airport," Withrow said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Mission Viejo, Laguna Niguel and Laguna Hills have approved 
financial participation in the study. The other cities are expected to vote on 
the issue soon. 
</P>
<P>
 The South County cities received a late bid from the North County coalition, 
known as the Orange County Airport Regional Authority, or ORACA, to participate 
in the study. 
</P>
<P>
 ORACA asked to pay for a portion in exchange for having a voice in airport 
issues being examined. 
</P>
<P>
 But Withrow said the offer came almost two weeks after the consultant's 
contract had been finalized. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an interesting offer, but it's too late because the scope of the 
contract was already determined," she said. FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; COUNCIL CANCELS ITS NEXT TWO MEETINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council canceled its next two regularly scheduled council meetings 
because of vacations and a light city workload. 
</P>
<P>
 The council unanimously decided to permanently skip meetings between July 15 
and Aug. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has historically not held council meetings in the last week of 
December as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did it to give both the council and staff a little more ease in planning 
vacations in light of the summer season and lighter agenda we see during these 
times," Mayor Susan Withrow said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the council holds its next regularly scheduled meeting, on Aug. 22, it 
will also have a new duration limit of 9:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, meetings lasting until 11 p.m. required a council vote to 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
 The new curfew was proposed by Councilman William S. Craycraft, who thought 
meetings would move faster with a 9:30 p.m. checkpoint. FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; 6 FAMILIES EVACUATED; FIRE EXTINGUISHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Six families were evacuated from their homes for two hours Sunday afternoon 
while fire engine companies from four cities battled a brush fire in the 
Santiago Creek riverbed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were very lucky," said Bill Zastrow, a battalion chief with the Santa Ana 
Fire Department."With a minimum amount of wind, we got a lot of people there 
really quickly, had a good water supply and put the fire out. This could have 
been a whole different story; as it turned out, it was a good story." 
</P>
<P>
 Zastrow said the blaze -- which consumed about an acre of brush, bamboo trees 
and shrubbery -- caused only minor damage, affecting the attic of one nearby 
house, the shake roof of another and several back-yard fences. 
</P>
<P>
 No injuries were reported resulting from the 1 p.m. blaze, although Zastrow 
said there were unconfirmed reports that several pet birds in a back-yard 
aviary might have been killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Though arson investigators were called to the scene, the chief said, they had 
not yet determined whether the fire had been set deliberately or resulted from 
natural causes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were reports of a loud noise," Zastrow said. "Perhaps a gunshot, 
fireworks or a transformer blowing. At this point we just don't know; we're 
still looking at it."DAVID HALDANE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: JEWISH GROUP GETS GRANT FOR NEW OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jewish Family Service of Orange County recently received a $7,500 county grant 
to help pay for the opening of a branch office in Costa Mesa that will offer 
counseling services and programs for older adults. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder presented the Community Social Program Grant to 
the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Mel Roth, executive director of Jewish Family Service of Orange County, said 
that the grant money will be used to open the branch office as well as to start 
an education program designed to boost teen-agers' self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 The program will be available to youth groups, clubs or classes of teen-agers 
between the ages of 15 and 18, Roth said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the organization decided to open the branch office to serve people who 
live in Costa Mesa, Huntington Beach, Fountain Valley, Newport Beach, Irvine 
and Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 "The new location will make it much easier for residents of west Orange County 
to access the important counseling and social services provided by Jewish 
Family Service," Wieder said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Roth said that the nonprofit organization has a main office in Orange and a 
branch office in Laguna Hills but that those facilities are too distant for 
people who live in west Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether for counseling services or for a crisis situation, they could not 
come this far (to the Orange office), and we felt that by being in that part of 
the county, we'd be more geographically accessible to residents of those 
cities," Roth said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the Costa Mesa branch, at 250 E. Baker St., is scheduled to open Sept. 
1 and is on the Jewish Federation campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The Community Foundation of the Jewish Federation of Orange County also 
contributed money to start the branch office, which will cost a total of $7,170 
to open, Roth said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the services that will be offered are information and referral services 
for older adults who may need crisis intervention or help in solving financial 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Roth said that the services are open to anyone who wishes to use them and that 
fees are based on income and family size. 
</P>
<P>
 "We serve people of all backgrounds, and our services are open to anybody of 
all races, religions and ages," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization now serves more than 5,000 people a year, Roth said. Growth 
of 15% to 20% is expected with opening of the Costa Mesa office. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization is seeking volunteers to help refugees learn about the 
culture here, to visit the isolated and frail elderly, to assist special-needs 
clients with problem-solving and to visit people in retirement homes. DEBRA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; COUNCIL TO ADDRESS BUDGET TONIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council tonight will get its first look at the city's 1994-95 fiscal 
year budget. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials don't expect the budget to include major cuts or layoffs even 
though Seal Beach faces more than $500,000 in unexpected expenses from May's 
pier fire and a sand replenishment program. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor George Brown predicted that the new budget will look similar to last 
year's $9.2-million general-fund spending plan. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the fire and sand bills will prevent the city from beginning to 
replenish its reserves, a move City Manager Jerry L. Bankston had hoped to 
begin this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The debts might also force the council to delay its promised reduction of the 
utility-users tax. The 11% levy that residents pay on their monthly gas, 
electric and telephone bills is now one of the highest in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pier fire really threw us for a curve," Brown said. The budget "tightens 
the belt in some spots, but I don't see major cuts." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said the council still hopes to reduce the utility tax, perhaps sometime 
next year.SHELBY GRAD

FAMILY, FRIENDS 'REVEL IN RUINS' OF EARTHQUAKE; AFTERMATH:'IF YOU'RE GIVEN 
LEMONS, MAKE LEMONADE,' HOSTESS SAYS OF PARTY AT HER BADLY DAMAGED HOME.

<P>
 The invitation said not "come as you are," but "come as you were at 4:31 a.m. 
Jan. 17." 
</P>
<P>
 But for many of the party-goers who showed up at Irene and Stuart Boyd's 
"Revel in the Ruins" party Sunday in the yard of what used to be their 
Northridge home, that simply wasn't an option. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would've come naked if I came in what I was wearing," said Gary Schneider 
of Tarzana, who stood by the Boyds' pool in shorts and a polo shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a family gathering," laughed Debbie Perez of Sherman Oaks, who wore a 
shorts-and-blouse outfit. "I don't think everyone was prepared to see what I 
was wearing or not wearing." 
</P>
<P>
 The gala July event is a tradition in the Boyd family: all three of their 
children have July birthdays, and every year they share one big birthday bash 
with 300 of their closest friends. The affair always revolves around a theme. 
This year, with the family's quake-ravaged 6,000-square-foot house little more 
than cracked walls and piles of bricks awaiting a bulldozer, there was little 
hesitation about a theme. 
</P>
<P>
 "What were we going to do?" asked Irene Boyd. "If you're given lemons, make 
lemonade." 
</P>
<P>
 So they dedicated the children's birthday party to the Northridge earthquake, 
bought spray paint to let the kids scribble graffiti on one side of the house, 
and told their friends to come as they were when the pre-dawn quake hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the children came in oversized T-shirts and nightgowns, but quickly 
shed them to jump in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsay Davis, 10, wore a pink nightgown and slippers, and said she forgot her 
stuffed animal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yikes, look at the house," she said as she peered into the entry where a 
stairway led to the sky. "I thought my house looked bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Party games ranged from the serious -- a CPR demonstration and an earthquake 
preparedness table -- to the silly. There was a wheelbarrow of bricks and bowls 
of paint so children could paint "real rubble" to bring home as souvenirs. 
Other children spread white T-shirts, emblazoned with "Revel in the Ruins," on 
tarp-covered patios and spray-painted them with bright-colored fissures and 
cracks. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyrics like "Rock this town," "There's a whole lotta shakin' goin' on," and "I 
feel the earth move under my feet" blared from a sound system set up on the 
porch. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just continue to party in the face of adversity," said Kathleen 
Silverman of Woodland Hills. "They've got a lot of courage and spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 The $1-million home, which was Richard Pryor's before the Boyds bought it five 
years ago, had no earthquake insurance, said Stuart Boyd. It will be torn down 
by the city in about two weeks. Meanwhile, the family is living in the 
one-bedroom guest house. The three children, ages 11, 9 and 6, sleep on the 
pullout couch. 
</P>
<P>
 The family briefly considered skipping the traditional party, but decided it 
would be a good way to bring people together after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the guests agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good way to turn the page and close it," said Debbie Perez. "It's 
inspirational to everyone else that they can do this."

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; CHANGES SOUGHT AT DEADLY RAIL CROSSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A recent fatal head-on collision at a railroad crossing west of Moorpark has 
prompted city officials to step up efforts to pressure the state Department of 
Transportation or the Southern Pacific railroad to make the crossing safer. 
</P>
<P>
 The July 9 accident was the second fatal head-on collision at the crossing in 
less than a week, officials said.The crossing -- at California 118, just west 
of Grimes Canyon Road -- was listed by the state Public Utilities Commission as 
the 37th most-dangerous crossing in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials contend that while there have been no accidents involving 
trains at the crossing in recent memory, the crossing's configuration makes it 
easy for drivers to drift into oncoming traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 The track runs parallel to the two-lane highway on both sides of the crossing, 
which resembles a distended X . Crossing gates and flashing lights stop traffic 
on the highway, which has a posted speed limit of 55 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Pacific officials say that because other crossings in the state have 
proven more dangerous, they do not have immediate plans to significantly alter 
the design of the crossing. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Vicky Howard, who said she drives over the crossing at least twice 
a day, told the Moorpark City Council she has been pushing to make the road and 
rail-line intersection safer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is that it's a Southern Pacific crossing and they're not 
cooperating," Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under county pressure, Caltrans has made some improvements to the asphalt 
around the track. Howard said Southern Pacific has been more receptive to 
laying concrete around the tracks where the asphalt has turned bumpy. SCOTT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; COUNCIL OKS REPAIR FOR PARK BALL COURTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Tennis, handball and basketball courts at three neighborhood parks and at the 
Fountain Valley Recreation and Cultural Center will be resurfaced to make them 
safer to play on. 
</P>
<P>
 Repairs will be made to 13 tennis and three handball courts at the Recreation 
Center, two tennis and one basketball court at Ellis Park and a basketball 
court at LaCapillia Park and Stonecress Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council last week approved spending $55,000 for the repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne S. Osborne, public works director, said that the surfaces of the playing 
courts have become slick. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main purpose (for the repairs) is for safety reasons," Osborne said, 
adding that a new coating provides more traction. 
</P>
<P>
 Osborne said the repair costs are $20,000 higher than normal because the 
existing coatings on two of the tennis courts must be removed before a new 
surface is applied. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is expected to award a bid to a contractor in September, with 
repair work to start in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Osborne said the tennis courts will be closed for about a week and the 
basketball courts shut down for 48 hours while repairs are being made. DEBRA

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; PANEL CAPSULIZES PLAN FOR CITY 
CENTENNIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Want a "Back to the Future" experience? Just wait until October, 2064. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when Thousand Oaks will celebrate its centennial year of cityhood -- 
and when time capsules installed in the Civic Arts Plaza courtyard will finally 
be opened. 
</P>
<P>
 Although few of today's adults will be around to witness the ceremony, an 
18-member committee has it all planned out. 
</P>
<P>
 They will seal the capsule in a bench-like vault this fall, during the Civic 
Arts Plaza's grand opening ceremonies. And they will anoint 50 children to 
serve as its guardians. 
</P>
<P>
 Those youngsters will return to the site in the year 2014, place another 
capsule in the vault, and select a fresh cadre of guardians. They, in turn, 
will perform the same ritual in the year 2039, to mark the city's 75th 
birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 The final generation of guardians will be in charge of opening all the 
capsules in the year 2064, as Thousand Oaks celebrates its first century. 
</P>
<P>
 Building the vault and gathering the capsule materials will cost about $7,100. 
Last week, council members approved that expense as part of the grand opening 
budget for the Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Councilwoman Elois Zeanah voiced concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure how many of our residents think the time capsule is relevant or 
beneficial," she said, criticizing the project's price tag. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the end, Zeanah agreed to support the capsule. And she might even end 
up contributing to it. All council members will be asked to pen predictions for 
the future and seal them, for posterity, in the capsule. STEPHANIE SIMON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; TRUSTEES OPPOSE 2 NEW EXPULSION BILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Huntington Beach City School District Board of Trustees has unanimously 
voted to oppose pending state legislation that would make it harder to expel 
unruly handicapped students. 
</P>
<P>
 The trustees voted 5 to 0 at their meeting last week for a resolution that 
opposes any new law "which requires school districts to provide educational 
services to handicapped children after they are expelled, even when it is 
determined that the conduct was not a manifestation of the child's handicap." 
</P>
<P>
 In a memo to the school board, district Supt. Duane Dishno said that the state 
Department of Education is sponsoring two Assembly bills that would weaken 
school districts' ability to expel handicapped students. The bills would 
require schools to educate handicapped students expelled for reasons not 
related to their handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 Dishno said federal courts have ruled that "a school district may withhold 
educational services from a handicapped student when it is determined that the 
conduct (causing expulsion) was not a manifestation of the child's handicap." 
The pending state legislation would change that situation, Dishno told the 
school board. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the federal courts have so far ruled "that there is simply no 
justification" for exempting handicapped students from the expulsion rules that 
apply to non-handicapped children. BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS; COUNCIL TO CONSIDER INTERIM SMOKING BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council today will consider an ordinance prohibiting smoking in 
buildings owned or leased by the city despite a recently adopted state law that 
bans smoking in virtually all places of employment. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the ordinance is still necessary because the state's 
no-smoking law will not take effect until Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still prudent for the council to adopt the ordinance," City Manager 
Robert C. Dunek said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Dunek said that under the state law, smoking inside bingo parlors 
will be allowed only for two years, after which the smoking ban may be extended 
to those places. 
</P>
<P>
 The city ordinance allows smoking in rooms A and B of the Community Center, 
where local groups hold bingo games, Dunek said. He said the city wants to keep 
that exemption for as long as bingo games are held there. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dunek said that the state law "pretty much accomplishes what the city 
envisions to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Signed by Gov. Pete Wilson last week, the state law bans smoking and use of 
tobacco products in enclosed work areas. Exempted are tobacco shops, meeting 
rooms in hotels and convention centers, and gaming clubs, which include bingo 
facilities. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; NEW TASK FORCE TO ASSESS YOUTHS' NEEDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The members of Mayor Linda Moulton Patterson's Children's Needs Task Force 
figure they have a difficult but essential task. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we'll solve all the problems, but I think we can make a step 
forward and try harder to meet the needs of children in our community," Moulton 
Patterson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17-member task force, created by the mayor in April, met for the first 
time last week to brainstorm and develop a way to aid local youth. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force is made up of a cross-section of people from the community, 
including representatives from schools, churches, service organizations, parent 
groups and day-care facilities, as well as city departments and commissions. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonnie Bruce, a task force member and Huntington Beach Union High School 
District trustee, said she views the task force as an initial step in assessing 
needs in order to make changes that will benefit youth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you put the needs on the table, then you can find solutions," Bruce 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce said that especially in today's times with resources and money at a 
minimum, members of the group must "put our creative brains together and come 
up with programs and solutions." 
</P>
<P>
 Moulton Patterson said she formed the task force to address the alarming and 
growing problems that children face, including the increasing number of 
children raised in single-parent homes, raised in poverty and those left 
unsupervised while parents work. 
</P>
<P>
 At the first meeting, task force members explored ideas, including the need 
for after-school programs, parent training and education, affordable day care 
and tutoring services. 
</P>
<P>
 Moulton Patterson said the task force will establish goals and objectives and 
present recommendations to the City Council in January.DEBRA CANO

3 BROTHERS ARRESTED IN CARJACKING FROM IRVINE HYATT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three brothers were arrested Sunday in connection with the hijacking of a car 
from the parking lot of a Hyatt hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Taken to Orange County Jail and booked on suspicion of carjacking and assault 
were Barney Garibaldi Torres, 25; Lawrence Barney Torres, 32; and Adonis Barney 
Torres, 30, all of El Monte. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Sgt. Jim Lowder of the Irvine Police Department, the carjacking 
occurred about noon in the parking lot of the Hyatt Regency Irvine, 17900 
Jamboree Road, when the brothers, accompanied by two other suspects, approached 
Andy Niizawa, 19, as he arrived for work as a valet at the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 After ordering Niizawa to turn over the maroon 1990 Honda Civic he was 
driving, Lowder said, the five men "physically assaulted" him before fleeing in 
his Honda and their own older-model bronze Cadillac. 
</P>
<P>
 The Honda Civic was spotted by an Anaheim police officer about 40 minutes 
later traveling north on the Santa Ana Freeway at Beach Boulevard, according to 
Lowder. After pulling the car over, police arrested Barney and Lawrence Torres 
at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Adonis Torres, Lowder said, was arrested a short time later at his home in El 
Monte. The two other men suspected of being involved in the carjacking are 
still at large, the police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This doesn't happen often," said Lowder, adding that Niizawa suffered minor 
injuries and had already retrieved his car from authorities. "Especially not at 
the Hyatt."

CONDO FIRE FORCES 17 FROM THEIR HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seventeen people have been displaced by a fire that raged through one of the 
buildings in their condominium complex Saturday night, seriously damaging seven 
units. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire was in the roof area, said Rudy Weyland, a spokesman for the Anaheim 
Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The damage caused by the 10:34 p.m. blaze at Brookhurst Village, 1250 S. 
Brookhurst St. in Anaheim "will require major reconstruction," Weyland said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Weyland, the three-alarm fire took 49 firefighters from Anaheim, 
Garden Grove and the county fire department about 25 minutes to contain. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire investigators have not yet determined the cause of the blaze nor the 
dollar amount of damage it caused, Weyland said. But of the seven damaged 
units, he said, three on the ground floor and one on an upper floor received 
water damage while three more on the upper floor received heavy damage to their 
roofs caused by the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Weyland said representatives of the Red Cross quickly arrived at the scene to 
assist displaced residents in finding food and shelter. "They have put them up 
in motels and hotels" until the damage can be assessed and repaired, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The only person reported injured, Weyland said, was a security guard who 
suffered minor smoke inhalation. The guard was not hospitalized.

1 MAN KILLED, 2 HURT IN DRIVE-BY SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 22-year-old Santa Ana man was shot to death and two others were wounded 
early Sunday during what police called a gang-related, drive-by shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the victims were identified, pending notification of their 
relatives.The wounded, a 15-year-old boy and another 22-year-old man, were 
listed in stable condition at local hospitals and are expected to live, said 
Sgt. Brian Collins of the Santa Ana Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred about 1:50 a.m. in the 300 block of North Jackson 
Street, a residential area frequented by gangs, Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims were talking outside a home when a car drove up, Collins said. 
Immediately after the 15-year-old approached the car to talk to the driver, 
shots were fired and all three victims were hit, Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man who was killed was shot once in the back and pronounced dead at 
Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center, Collins said. The other 
two victims were shot in the lower body. 
</P>
<P>
 The assailants fled and no weapon was recovered. The incident is under 
investigation by the department's gang detail, Collins said.

 A violent three-car traffic collision on California 126 at Timber Canyon Road 
-- between the cities of Santa Paula and Fillmore -- claimed the lives of two 
people late Sunday afternoon, injured 11 others and tied up traffic for hours, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5:18 p.m. accident killed an adult and a child, sent five people to 
hospitals with major injuries, six with moderate injuries, according to a 
California Highway Patrol spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The identities of the dead were not available. The cause of the collision was 
not immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
 The injured were taken by helicopter and ambulance to Santa Paula Medical 
Center and to Ventura County Medical Center, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The CHP said the cars involved in the crash included a gray Toyota sedan, a 
red Nissan sport utility truck and a Ford passenger van. 
</P>
<P>
 The late-afternoon accident closed the highway, causing the CHP and the 
California Department of Transportation to take traffic off the roadway at 
California 23 in Fillmore and at Hallock Drive in Santa Paula. CHP and Caltrans 
officials hoped to reopen the roadway by 11 p.m. J.E. MITCHELL

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; LIBRARIES GET A RENEWED SHELF LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The last few years have witnessed the depressing sight of cash-starved public 
libraries dropping magazine subscriptions and cutting back on book purchases. 
Worse, they have reduced hours as well, sometimes whole days: All 27 Orange 
County-run libraries are closed on Fridays; 10 Los Angeles County-run libraries 
have shut down completely. 
</P>
<P>
 But anyone concerned that the public does not care for these buildings that 
provide intellectual nourishment, and sometimes even serve as day-care centers 
for latchkey kids, should take heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Three thousand people showed up this month for the opening of Newport Beach's 
new, $8.2-million central library, a well-buffed jewel that sparkled in the 
sun. Moreover, just days before the ribbon-cutting in Newport Beach, the Laguna 
Beach Library reopened to appreciative readers after a $500,000 face-lift that 
closed the county-run building for more than two months.  
</P>
<P>
 The Newport Beach opening was the culmination of seven years of planning, 
evidence that elected officials could display foresight and leadership. The 
bulk of the funds for the building came from bonds authorized by the taxpayers; 
businesses, community groups and individuals chipped in nearly $2 million. The 
Irvine Co. donated the site. It was a good example of the public-private 
partnership that Orange County has displayed a number of times, one worth 
imitating elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach is a wealthy community, but it has been affected as other cities 
in Southern California by the recession. The library budget has been cut by 
7.5% this year; the branch libraries that were open 65 hours a week two years 
ago were open 54 hours a week last year and 45 hours a week this year. All the 
more reason to celebrate the new library, which replaced a smaller facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends of libraries are stepping forward elsewhere. Last week, Los Angeles 
County supervisors tentatively endorsed a worthwhile proposal to raise $30 
million annually by taxing property owners in areas covered by the county 
library district. Library officials realize they will have to lobby the public 
for support, but they should be encouraged by similar campaigns waged 
successfully in Altadena and South Pasadena last month and in Pasadena last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Public libraries provide the space and tools that feed the imagination and 
encourage hope for better days. While they have fallen on hard times, the 
festivities and ballot box wins provide promise for the future.

MASSACHUSETTS MAKES OVERTURES TO PACKARD BELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHIP JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Packard Bell Electronics Inc. official confirmed Sunday that Massachusetts, 
led by its governor, William Weld, is competing to become the company's next 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, Chatsworth-based Packard Bell, one of the nation's largest 
personal computer makers, let it be known that it was seeking a new location 
for its corporate headquarters. Company officials said they had outgrown their 
six facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 To make matters worse, the Northridge earthquake badly damaged their 
facilities just a few days after their disclosure. 
</P>
<P>
 Massachusetts joins a list of suitors that already includes the Antelope 
Valley, Salt Lake City and Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
 Liz O'Donnell, a Packard Bell spokeswoman, said the company currently has a 
two-year lease at temporary facilities in Westlake Village and has no immediate 
plans to relocate. 
</P>
<P>
 The company remains open to proposals from other cities, O'Donnell said, and 
had not yet set a deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Kranhold, a spokesman for Gov. Pete Wilson, said Massachusetts' proposal 
to lure a major corporation out of the state was not unusual and that Wilson 
would fight to any retain major businesses in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nothing new that states have been aggressively courting California's 
largest employers," Kranhold said. To try to keep these businesses in 
California, he said, the "governor and Legislature have enacted a series of 
reforms, most notably the workers' comp reform bill." 
</P>
<P>
 Kranhold said Wilson has met with Packard Bell executives since it announced 
its intentions to explore other sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Massachusetts officials could not be reached for comment Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County officials and city officials in Lancaster and Palmdale, the 
Antelope Valley's two largest cities, have lobbied the Legislature to obtain a 
designation as an enterprise zone for the Antelope Valley site being considered 
by Packard Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 The enterprise zone designation would allow local governments to offer firms a 
wide variety of tax and other incentives. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Antelope Valley proposal to Packard Bell includes such 
financial draws as the donation of a 50-acre parcel and low-interest loans. 
</P>
<P>
 The trick, said Bill George, a spokesman for the state's Trade and Commerce 
Agency, is to satisfy the specific needs of a company. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to look at every proposal, and they can put any dollar figure on it 
they want, but you've got to look and see if it's what the company really 
needs," George said.

IMAGINATION TAKES FLIGHT AT CLOSE OF VALLEY FAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Shut up and jump! 
</P>
<P>
 So dared the T-shirts worn by the self-professed adrenaline-addicted employees 
of Bungee Outerlimits, one of the most popular new attractions at the San 
Fernando Valley Fair. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hooked!" declared rookie jumper Melissa Kephart of Burbank, clambering 
off the enormous yellow safety cushion after making a mighty backward leap from 
the top of the bungee tower. "It's taken me two days to work up the nerve to do 
this," said the twentysomething Kephart, who squeezed in her perilous plunge on 
the last day of the fair. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated four-day total of 51,000 people braved the scorching heat at the 
Los Angeles Equestrian Center in Burbank for the 48th San Fernando Valley Fair, 
sponsored by the 51st District Agricultural Assn. For those who prefer less 
pulse-pounding pleasures than bungee diving, there were carnival rides, cold 
lemonade and soap- and lace-making demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
 But not everybody loved the event. On Saturday, the activist group Last Chance 
for Animals displayed banners and handed out leaflets at the fair's entrance to 
protest the treatment of bulls in the two Bull-O-Rama events. Fair spokeswoman 
Georgia Cluver said the protesters dispersed after being told by police that 
they would be arrested for demonstrating on private property. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, the fair's management closed some rides to prevent patrons from 
getting blisters caused by the sun pounding down on metallic seats and slides. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was no lack of activities to keep Valley residents entertained. 
</P>
<P>
 To take on the flesh-sucking effects of centrifugal force, sisters Nicole, 14, 
and Jennifer Keith, 10, of Chatsworth hopped on a giant, revolving wheel called 
Roundup. Jennifer said Roundup is one of her favorite rides because she likes 
to get dizzy. 
</P>
<P>
 Marisa and Adam Van Houten, ages 7 and 4, opted to play Simon Says at Kids 
Games, under the shade of the Children's Fun Stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Some guests walked away from the fair with a balloon and cotton candy in hand, 
having tasted a piece of old-fashioned America. Then there were people who will 
remember the 48th San Fernando Valley Fair for their daredevil jumps. Said 
Kephart: "It was the most exciting thing I've ever done in my life."

WOODS' RESUME GROWING; GOLF: HE ADDS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ASSN. AMATEUR TITLE TO 
HIS LIST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Tiger Woods may not be grown up. The caddies for the Stanford-bound Woods are 
high school pals. 
</P>
<P>
 But Woods confirmed Sunday that he has outgrown local amateur golf. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods, 18, of Cypress, easily won the Southern California Golf Assn. Amateur 
championship at Hacienda, shooting an even-par 70 to finish at 270 after a 
course-record 62 Saturday. Mark Johnson of Barstow was closest at five back. 
</P>
<P>
 In Woods' first appearance at the Amateur, he broke the one-day tournament 
record (was 64 before his record 62), and total score (was 274). 
</P>
<P>
 "My swing is a lot better lately, and my hands are not as wild," Woods said. 
"I haven't had any growth spurts in a while and I think that's a lot of it. 
I've leveled off lately." 
</P>
<P>
 The Amateur caps a string of big performances for Woods. He recently was 35 
under for 140 holes of match play at the Pacific Northwest Amateur. He now 
hopes to qualify for the U.S. Amateur before school starts this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's one of the very best amateurs in the country. He's going to be a great 
golfer," Johnson said. "He plays one of our events and breaks all the records." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Johnson will have to be content as Southern California's best 
golfer with a day job. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, 40, a delivery and sales representative for a beer company in 
Barstow, shot a 67 Sunday, his best of four very good rounds at the Amateur, to 
finish at 275, five under. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in contention to win (the Amateur) for about the last six years," 
Johnson said. "But this is the first time I've put together four solid rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I got hammered." 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing by eight going into Sunday's final round, Johnson made an early 
charge. Woods fell to one-over at six while Johnson was two-under, five strokes 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods promptly holed a 35-foot chip shot for eagle. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson birdied No. 7 to keep his lead at two, bogeyed eight and watched Woods 
birdie nine. 
</P>
<P>
 Tied at the turn, the Amateur was over. 
</P>
<P>
 By Sunday's final round, Woods' presence eclipsed the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Kroll, a golf sales rep from San Marcos, felt Woods' shadow. 
</P>
<P>
 "(During Woods' round of 62)), I got to nine and saw my son," said Kroll, 
whose golf bag has paint impressions of the hands and feet of his two children. 
"He said, 'Where's Tiger?' My own kid would rather watch Tiger." 
</P>
<P>
 Kroll finished fifth at 284 and was one of many sales representatives, 
mortgage brokers, real estate agents and cleaning contractors who ended up 
grinning in disbelief at the leader board. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlie Wi, from North Hills, finished third at 278. Don Baker from Canoga 
Park and Santa Barbara's John Pate tied for fourth at 283. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the typical Amateur players, a field Johnson would have crushed any 
other year. 
</P>
<P>
 But not with Woods around. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know what it feels like to be lapped," Woods said. "But it's nice to be on 
the other side."

LANGSTON FINDS SOME RELIEF OFF THE FIELD; BASEBALL: FAMILY AND FRIENDS LIFT HIS 
SPIRITS AFTER THE ANGEL BULLPEN SQUANDERS HIS LEAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The bullpen couldn't pick him up, so it was left to his two daughters and Jim 
Abbott's new dog to lift Mark Langston's spirits Sunday. An hour after he had 
held the Yankee hit parade at bay for 8 1/3 innings, Langston was in the hall 
outside the Angel clubhouse, cavorting with kids and puppies and trying to 
think about anything but the afternoon's events. 
</P>
<P>
 Langston took a 4-2 lead into the ninth inning. He left after getting Danny 
Tartabull to pop up, giving up a single to Mike Stanley and walking Jim 
Leyritz. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Joe Grahe and then pinch-hitter Don Mattingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Exit ball from the playing field and the Yankees from town with a four-game 
sweep. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, that's the game of baseball," Langston said. "But it would 
have been a nice win after the way New York has taken it to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Langston, who said he had his best stuff of the season, had struck out a 
season-high 10 batters. But he also had thrown 143 pitches when Manager Marcel 
Lachemann went out to get him in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was grinding all he could, but he just had nothing left," Lachemann said. 
"He was reaching back for everything he had, but he was done." 
</P>
<P>
 Langston, while willing to admit he would have welcomed the chance to stay in 
the game, would not criticize Lachemann's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "You always would like to stay out there and finish it," he said, "but 
Marcel's the manager, it's his decision and Joe Grahe is our closer. He made 
the right decision. And if Mattingly hits into a double play, nobody would be 
second-guessing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for Langston and the Angels, Mattingly lined a shot into the 
right-field bleachers for his first pinch-hit home run. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just shows you how well Mark pitched," Lachemann said. "How they hit us 
the last three games and what they did after he came out." 
</P>
<P>
 It took seven precious pitches to get Tartabull to open the ninth and then 
Langston got two quick strikes on Stanley before hanging a curveball that the 
Yankee first baseman grounded into the hole at short. Langston then fell behind 
Leyritz and walked him on five pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to stay aggressive," Langston said. "I wasn't going to give in to 
(Leyritz), even on the 3-1 pitch, because he's the kind of guy who can put it 
in the seats. I knew going into the inning that if a couple of guys got on, the 
bullpen would be coming in, but I wasn't going to groove one." 
</P>
<P>
 Langston appeared anything but eager to leave the mound, however, shaking his 
head in apparent disagreement with Lachemann's decision. The scheduled hitter, 
Gerald Williams, had struck out in his previous two at-bats with some 
particularly feeble swings. 
</P>
<P>
 And even though the Yankees had two potential Hall of Fame left-handed hitters 
-- Mattingly and Wade Boggs -- waiting on the bench, Lachemann went to 
designated closer Grahe, a right-hander. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt as good today as I have the whole year," Langston said. "I had a good 
fastball and I was throwing it for strikes. I had a good breaking ball and I 
was throwing the changeup where I wanted it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's disappointing, but there's nothing like having your family to pick you 
up, to give you a little perspective. You have to remember that all you can do 
is give it all you've got and hope to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "And all we can do now is forget about today and try to get started on a roll 
on Tuesday."

VALLEY NORTH CAPS A WILD DAY WITH TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 No one was happier than Tony Montiel that Valley North pulled out a 9-8 
victory over Sun Valley in the American Legion District 20 championship game 
Sunday at Birmingham High. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley North's Montiel relieved Jim DeBiase with Valley North leading, 8-4, 
and one out in the top of the ninth, but he allowed Sun Valley to tie the 
score. Fortunately for Montiel, Valley North won in the bottom of the ninth 
when Ray Daryabigi scored on Hugo De La Torre's bases-loaded wild pitch with 
none out. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a stressful day for Montiel, who finished Valley North's 13-11 victory 
over Encino earlier Sunday morning. That game had been suspended in the ninth 
Saturday because of darkness. Montiel, who began the ninth with a three-run 
lead, walked the bases loaded but escaped, giving up one run. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley North (19-8), the 10th-seeded team in the 10-team, double-elimination 
tournament, won all six of its playoff games to qualify for the Area 6 
playoffs, which begin Thursday at UCLA's Jackie Robinson Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 DeBiase was outstanding for most of the day Sunday. Through eight innings, he 
had given up two runs, five hits and one walk. With his team leading, 8-2, he 
retired the first batter in the top of the ninth and struck out the second, but 
catcher Brandon Murphy couldn't hold the third strike, a curveball in the dirt, 
and Luciano Cuevas reached first base. 
</P>
<P>
 DeBiase then gave up four straight hits before yielding to Montiel, who 
couldn't retire the side until Sun Valley (18-7-1) tied the score, 8-8. On 
Saturday, Sun Valley scored four runs in the top of the ninth to beat Van Nuys 
East, 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kind of thought about that," Valley North's Bryan LaCour said. "But we knew 
we just needed one run. We were all composed." 
</P>
<P>
 Daryabigi led off the bottom of the ninth with a triple. Sun Valley 
intentionally walked Murphy and Montiel before the key wild pitch.

MINOR LEAGUE NOTEBOOK / CHRIS FOSTER: NAULTY NOT ONE TO FOLD SO EASILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dan Naulty may never play solitaire again. The game can wear on you after six 
hours of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Naulty was 8-4 with a 2.95 earned-run average at Ft. Myers, a Class A team for 
the Minnesota Twins. Those numbers were good enough for a promotion to 
Nashville, a double-A team. 
</P>
<P>
 But Naulty found getting to Nashville was easier than getting to Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
 Follow: 
</P>
<P>
 Naulty, who played at Ocean View High School and Cal State Fullerton, got word 
of his promotion last Sunday. He was even scheduled to pitch for Nashville 
Monday night. No problem. Ft. Myers is a measly two-hour flight from Nashville, 
so Naulty would just pop in and pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Then things got sticky. The first leg of the flight went smooth. He landed in 
Atlanta at midnight, just a stopover. Then trouble started. Mechanical problems 
grounded the airplane and, an hour later, the flight was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 Out came the cards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I must have played 1,000 games of solitaire," Naulty said. "I played cards, 
listened to music and waited. That's all I could do." 
</P>
<P>
 Naulty finally got to Nashville at noon Monday. By game time, he had been 
without sleep for nearly 40 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he pitched six innings, giving up four hits and two runs. Naulty struck 
out three and walked three. He took the loss, but was just happy to have 
survived. 
</P>
<P>
 "I walked a few guys, which got me in trouble," Naulty said. "But overall, I 
think it was a good outing. Especially considering I had been up since 5:30 
a.m. the previous day. I was a little anxious." 
</P>
<P>
 But Naulty will take the stress. 
</P>
<P>
 This is his third season in professional baseball and by far his best. Naulty 
went 13-4 for Fullerton in 1992, helping the Titans reach the championship game 
of the College World Series. He was drafted in the 14th round by the Twins, but 
he didn't exactly open any eyes last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Naulty started at Ft. Myers, where he went 0-3 with a 5.70 ERA. He was demoted 
to Ft. Wayne, a lower Class A team. Naulty had a 3.26 ERA, but his record was 
6-8.  
</P>
<P>
 "I felt I pitched pretty good, but I couldn't string any wins together," 
Naulty said. "Sometimes winning isn't the top priority here. They are looking 
for development." 
</P>
<P>
 So Naulty came to a simple conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 "To move up, you have to dominate a level," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Naulty came close to that this season. He was among the leaders in the Florida 
State League in victories and strikeouts (83). 
</P>
<P>
 His best outing, though, was a loss. He pitched a two-hitter, striking out 14 
against Tampa. One of the hits was a home run, which gave Tampa a 1-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it only impressed Twins' officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if I was dominating, but I was doing good enough," Naulty said. 
"I was ready to move up." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, it was in the cards. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If ever there were a player prepared for the rigors of professional baseball, 
it's Aaron Boone. He has plenty of tutors, no doubt about it. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ray Boone, his grandfather, was an infielder in the major leagues for 13 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bob Boone, his father, was a catcher for 19 years in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bret Boone, his brother, is currently the second baseman for the Cincinnati 
Reds. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing I haven't expected," said Aaron Boone, who played at Villa 
Park High School and USC. "You never really know until you get there, but 
everything they told me has been true." 
</P>
<P>
 Boone is a third baseman for Billings, a Class A team for the Reds. The 
organization not only employs his older brother, but his father. Bob Boone is a 
coach with the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I call them or they call me almost every night just to find out how everybody 
did," Boone said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron, the middle of three sons, may have had the biggest news so far this 
season. His first professional hit was a grand slam, against Yakima. As far as 
he knows, none of his relatives made such a big entrance into pro ball. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Home cookin': Aaron Boone's first season has been a bit easier than the rest 
of the Boone clan had it. 
</P>
<P>
 When Billings is home, Boone lives with a local family, who are friends of 
some friends. He pays no rent, gets the use of a car and the food is a little 
better than what his teammates are getting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Home-cooked meals every night when we're home," Boone said. "That's the best 
thing." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Mike Schooler, one of the top closers in baseball four years ago, was released 
by the Wichita Wranglers after attempting to resurrect his career as a starter. 
</P>
<P>
 He was 0-8 at the time of his release. 
</P>
<P>
 Schooler, a graduate of Garden Grove High School, led the Seattle Mariners in 
saves in four of the past five seasons. He had 33 saves in 1989 and 30 in 1990.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GOLF ASSN. AMATEUR CHAMPIONSHIP; BAKER GETS CLOSE VIEW OF 
WOODS' RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Don Baker is 43 years old. Most of the time, that number doesn't bother him. 
He is an accountant by trade and these are not big numerals. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a different story over the weekend at the 95th Southern California Golf 
Assn. Amateur Championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker, who lives in Canoga Park, is neither a young lion nor a graybeard, but 
he definitely felt closer to the latter Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the fourth time this week that I played with guys who weren't even 
born when I played in my first SCGA (in 1972)," said Baker, who shot a 74 to 
finish in a tie for fourth with Santa Barbara's John Pate and give him his 
second consecutive top-10 finish. "How's that make a guy feel?" 
</P>
<P>
 Tiger Woods of Cypress, an 18-year-old with the mettle of a veteran and who 
played in the same threesome as Baker, cruised to an even-par 70 Sunday at 
Hacienda Golf Club to win the championship by five shots with a tournament 
record of 10-under 270. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Johnson of Helendale was second at 275, followed at 278 by Charlie Wi of 
North Hills (five shots ahead of Baker). Other area players finishing in the 
top 10 were Jason Gore of Valencia, ninth at 287, and Chad Wright of Ventura, 
10th at 290.  
</P>
<P>
 Wi, 22, shot a 69 for his third under-par effort, yet he was never in 
contention down the stretch. "I didn't play awesome, but I played good," Wi 
said. "What do you say when a guy plays that well? Maybe one of these days, 
that'll be me." 
</P>
<P>
 Woods opened the day with an eight-shot lead over Johnson, 39, who made a 
definite run at Woods on the front nine. Johnson trimmed Woods' lead to five as 
the pair played the par-five seventh hole. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson reached the center of the green in two and had a 20-footer for an 
eagle. Woods was on the fringe, 35 feet from the hole. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost predictably, the red-hot Woods holed the putt -- which would have 
rolled at least six feet by the hole had the ball not slam-dunked squarely into 
the back of the cup -- for an eagle. Johnson two-putted for a birdie and 
finished with a 67, the second-best round of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore, 20, shot a 70. Despite four three-putt greens, Wright, 18, shot a 74. 
James Camaione of the Crystalaire Country Club in the Antelope Valley shot one 
of the day's best rounds, a 68, to jump into a two-way tie for 13th at 293. 
Dave Sheff of the Oakmont Country Club in Glendale shot a 70 and finished at 
295. Keith Kinsel of Glendale shot a 79 and fell to 306, and Greg Bell of 
Studio City shot a 78 and finished at 300.

SALSA BEATS SOUNDERS TO MOVE INTO FIRST; SOCCER: WRIGHT, PAULINHO GET GOALS IN 
2-1 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The last time the Salsa played at Titan Stadium, league MVP Paulinho was on 
the bench, Coach Rildo Menezes was defending himself and a championship was 
being lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Before an opening-night gathering of 2,148 Sunday, Paulinho was scoring, 
Menezes was long gone and the Salsa was moving into first place. 
</P>
<P>
 For a day, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salsa beat Seattle, 2-1, to take the lead in the American Professional 
Soccer League, though it may be short-lived. The league is expected to rule 
today on what to do with the Salsa's 3-0 victory over Houston. The APSL revoked 
the Houston franchise's membership Friday, citing an internal ownership 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 The APSL has three options: Wipe out the game against the Force and take away 
the Salsa's nine points for victory; rule the game a 1-0 forfeit victory for 
the Salsa and take away only two points from the Salsa's total of 31; or it 
might reschedule with another team playing the Houston spot in the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salsa (4-2) has a four-point lead over Seattle (3-3, 27 points). It has 
won four in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was the first for goalie Bob Ammann, who had four saves. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were a little slow getting started this season, but our defense has been 
superb," Ammann said. "Tonight, I didn't even have a lot to do. It's just a 
matter of time before Paul (Wright) and Paulinho get going." 
</P>
<P>
 Wright scored the game's first goal in the 19th minute off an assist from 
Paulinho, and Paulinho made it 2-1 with a goal in the 42nd minute after taking 
a pass from Yari Allnutt. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright and Allnutt each have three goals and an assist for the Salsa. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought the first goal was way, way offsides," Sounders Coach Alan Hinton 
said. "At the same time, L.A. played a wonderful soccer game and I have no 
complaint with the result." 
</P>
<P>
 Salsa Coach Rick Davis said he doesn't expect the team to really begin playing 
well, though, until August. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided to limit our preseason . . . put it off until June," Davis said. 
"The fact we've won four in a row with the team playing 60-70 % of its 
capability makes us happy. July 31st will be 8 1/2 weeks and that will be a 
regular preseason. Come August, when we hit our stride, I don't think there 
will be anybody in this league that can play with us." Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Salsa owner William De La Pena announced the Salsa will compete this fall in 
Mexico's new Division I-A. The league begins the first week of September and 
the Salsa will play its home games at Cal State Fullerton. The 14-team league 
will not compete against the 18-team Division I in league, but will be involved 
in a 32-team Cup tournament in early 1995. Also expected to compete in Division 
I-A are Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. De La Pena expects to play a home 
game every other week during a 26-game schedule; he expects the schedule to be 
completed within two weeks.

SCHULTZ BRINGS HIS ATTITUDE TO THE RAMS; FOOTBALL: OFFENSIVE LINEMAN NOT 
INTERESTED IN MAKING A GOOD IMPRESSION ANYWHERE BUT ON THE FOOTBALL FIELD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Meet Bill Schultz, the goofy-looking offensive lineman with the Mohawk 
haircut, goatee and surly disposition. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so the Indianapolis Colts weren't impressed -- they cut him. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said it was due to me making so much money," Schultz said. "But I think 
the coaching staff just didn't like me very much." 
</P>
<P>
 Understandable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had a couple of the guys tell me to cut the tail off," Schultz said, 
"and I've just looked at them and told them to kiss (off)." 
</P>
<P>
 Four years in Indianapolis before the Colts cut him? 
</P>
<P>
 "To have a place on the team I shouldn't have to kiss (up to anyone)." 
</P>
<P>
 First impressions sometimes can be deceiving. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are going to see a mean (individual) on the field," Schultz said. "If 
I'm going to run block somebody I'm going to put them on their (behind). 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not here to impress anyone. I'm here to do a job. I'll wear the same set 
of clothing all month, I don't care. I'm not here to smell good. I've got one 
job and that's to play well on the football field. If I stink, fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Future interviews, of course, will be conducted via telephone, but while the 
winds are blowing right there's still time to learn more about Mr. 
Congeniality. 
</P>
<P>
 William Schultz, raised in Granada Hills, was the starting left tackle for USC 
in the 1990 Rose Bowl victory over Michigan. He was forced into action against 
Lawrence Taylor in his rookie season for the Colts. "Held the hell out of him 
and he called me every name in the book," Schultz said. 
</P>
<P>
 He owns a Corvette and Harley Davidson -- each with the license plate: Mohawk. 
He has a ton of superstitions. He blamed his release in Indianapolis on the 
fact that he shaved his head bald. He credits his good fortune in joining the 
Rams on the fact that he switched to a Mohawk cut the day before the team hired 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very superstitious," he said. "I put my left sock on first before every 
game, write my grandmother's name on my wrist tape before putting on my gloves, 
walk on the field to see how my shoes feel before putting on my pads and then 
throw up once or twice." 
</P>
<P>
 He gets steamed when people tell him he looks goofy, and downright hot asked 
if he owns a mirror and ever uses it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought about cutting my hair off and coming in like everybody else, but 
I'm not like everybody else. I'm one of a kind," Schultz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could not go out tomorrow and get a job paying me the money I make. A lot 
of people in this game don't seem to understand that." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams understand and like him. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you got four earrings I don't give a damn," said offensive line coach Jim 
Erkenbeck. "I kind of like the Mohawk. Individuality. 
</P>
<P>
 "This guy can play. He volunteered to play left tackle for us. He wants to 
make this team, will make this team, and is glad to be back in Southern 
California." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams like him so much that they have a plan to move him to left guard and 
challenge Tom Newberry. 
</P>
<P>
 And Schultz is ready to do whatever it takes to make the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all friends now; on the field we're not friends," he said. "I got cut, 
and for the first month I didn't leave my house. You're nothing suddenly; 
you're not anything special. I was scared. I thought it was all over for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Stinky, but motivated, Schultz is back on the job and a good training camp 
away from winning full-time employment. 
</P>
<P>
 "You lose a job and it makes you see the light," Schultz said. "I'm going to 
bust my (butt)."

DODGE GIVES HIS "HERO" A DIFFICULT TIME; TENNIS: HE SURPRISES OLMEDO, 6-4, 6-4, 
TO WIN SINGLES TITLE AT NATIONAL HARD COURTS TOURNAMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Larry Dodge says Alex Olmedo is still his "hero," but Dodge made it clear 
Sunday that hero worship goes only so far. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodge won his first national age-group singles championship by surprising 
Olmedo, 6-4, 6-4, in the finals of the 55-and-over division of the U.S. Tennis 
Assn. National Hard Courts at Lindborg Racquet Club. Olmedo, the 1959 Wimbledon 
champion who now teaches tennis on the back yard court at his Encino home, had 
won the title the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just can't play any better than that," Dodge said. "I'm just happy it came 
in a match like this one." 
</P>
<P>
 In the other singles final Sunday, Dick Johnson, a teaching pro at a country 
club in St. Louis, defeated Leland Housman, a heart surgeon from San Diego, in 
the 50-and-over division, 4-6, 6-2, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was Dodge's upset that stole the show. An architect from Piedmont, 
Dodge used a hard-hitting, aggressive style to stop Olmedo, who did not appear 
as sharp as he had earlier in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he gets to a ball, he's perfect with his shots," Dodge said of Olmedo. 
"He just can't run now the way he used to be able to. Fortunately, I hit the 
ball harder than some of the other players in this division, and I was able to 
run him around. I was able to take the game to him. I took some chances, 
because I didn't want to get in a finesse game with him. He's too good at 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Dodge said he respected the fact that Olmedo, 58, is still willing to play in 
events of this type against players with far less recognition than what Olmedo 
achieved as a touring pro. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice of him to do it," Dodge said. "Not too many guys who have done what 
he's done would." 
</P>
<P>
 When Olmedo was told that Dodge had called him "his hero" before the match, 
Olmedo laughed and said: "Well, why didn't he let me win then?" 
</P>
<P>
 Olmedo said he was surprised by the strength of Dodge's game. "He played very 
well today," Olmedo said. "He served well, and he returned well. I probably 
rushed a little too much. I maybe should have stayed back more, but I didn't 
know what to expect from him. I rely a lot on my serve and he returned it well. 
He played better than I expected him to." 
</P>
<P>
 Olmedo was behind, 5-2, in the first set, then held serve and broke Dodge in 
the ninth game to make it 5-4, but Dodge broke back in the 10th game to win the 
set. The score was tied, 4-4, in the second set, but Dodge broke Olmedo in the 
10th game to win the match. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 50s final, Johnson bounced back from losing the first set by using a 
more aggressive net game to take control of the match. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's played in a lot of national tournaments, and that was a factor in his 
favor," Housman said. "I may have gotten a little nervous in the third set, 
although I don't think I did. He kept the pressure on me all the way by coming 
to the net. There was only one break in that last set, but he ended up getting 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said he tried to capitalize on Housman's second serve by coming in. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the 20th USTA national championship for Johnson in the various age 
divisions. "But it's the first one I've ever won outdoors," he said. "I've 
always been primarily an indoor player. I was a pro at an indoor club in 
Rockford for several years, and we didn't even have outdoor courts, so most of 
my experience is indoors." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson was happy to be playing in the relatively mild temperatures of 
Southern California compared to the heat and humidity in St. Louis. "It's so 
nice here compared to the heat back there that you can lose in the first round 
and still have a nice trip," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson and Dodge also claimed doubles titles later in the day. Johnson teamed 
with Jody Rush of Tumwater, Wash., to win the 50 doubles championship over Dick 
Leach of Laguna Nigel and Ken Stuart of Newport Beach, 6-3, 6-4. Dodge and his 
partner, Lenny Lindborg of Laguna Beach, defeated Jim Nelson of Irvine and Bob 
Duesler of Newport Beach in the 55 doubles, 1-6, 7-6, 7-6.

SOCKERS BEAT THE SPLASH, STAY IN FIRST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The reigning power in the Continental Indoor Soccer League's Western Division, 
the San Diego Sockers, showed they still could pack a wallop when challenged by 
an upstart. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sockers, who have won 10 of 12 indoor championships, scored a 9-6 victory 
over the Splash on Sunday to retain their hold on first place. The Splash and 
Sockers will play again at 7:35 p.m. on Saturday at The Pond of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego (11-3) got five goals from John Molomo, including two on shootouts, 
to drop the Splash (11-5) a game back in the standings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was looking forward to this game all year," Splash midfielder Raffaele 
Ruotolo said. "I've had great times in this building (the San Diego Sports 
Arena) and won a lot of championships, and it was one I wanted really bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruotolo won three Major Indoor Soccer League titles with the Sockers and is 
one of three Splash starters, along with the coach, who played when the Sockers 
dominated the indoor game. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruotolo had a goal and an assist, matching MISL and CISL records for 
consecutive games with an assist (17). He has 24 assists, one fewer than he had 
in his five-year career. His power-play goal at 3 minutes 1 second into the 
third quarter tied the score, 5-5, but Molomo scored unassisted 1:30 later on a 
shootout after Doug Neely's hand ball, and Brian Negrete added another at 11:13 
to put the game out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash's Paul McDonnell, a rookie from Cal State Fullerton, had his first 
professional hat trick, giving him eight goals this season. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonnell's final goal made it 7-6 midway in the fourth quarter, but Toby 
Taitano scored at 11:20 and Molomo scored an empty-net goal from midfield at 
14:26 while the Sockers used a sixth attacker. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash played the final 2:43 without Ruotolo (21 goals, 24 assists) and 
Rod Castro (19 goals, 12 assists), also a former Socker, after they drew 
misconduct penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sockers led the league in penalty killing at home (75%), but the Splash 
was perfect in three power-play opportunities, with Dale Ervine, McDonnell and 
Ruotolo scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash also was hurt by three apparent hand balls in the penalty arch that 
would have provided a shootout opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made some mental mistakes that cost us," Splash Coach George Fernandez 
said. "Whenever you give up a goal within 30 seconds in the beginning of the 
quarter, it's going to hurt you, and it happened twice." 
</P>
<P>
 Molomo scored 11 seconds into the game, and Rene Ortiz scored 19 seconds into 
the third quarter.

 Every other Tuesday night, they gather in classrooms at Holman United 
Methodist Church near Downtown Los Angeles, in search of help, or at least 
hope. 
</P>
<P>
 Many are frightened, some face a language barrier, few understand the nuances 
of the American legal system -- but all believe that misconduct by law 
enforcement agencies has caused them harm. 
</P>
<P>
 Thinking they have nowhere else to turn, they attend the Police Abuse Small 
Claims Court Assistance Clinic, looking for advice, redress, or simply somebody 
to whom they can tell their story. 
</P>
<P>
 The law students and volunteer lawyers who staff the clinic teach people how 
to sue police agencies for damages in Small Claims Court, where the maximum 
award is $5,000 and lawyers aren't permitted to represent clients. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first things they tell these clients is the chance of winning their 
case, or any money: slim. 
</P>
<P>
 But lawyer Ronald Kaye, a founder of the clinic, said winning is not the only 
issue. A big part of the clinic's goal is "to empower people to stand up for 
their rights" -- even though they may lose their case," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent clients have included: 
</P>
<P>
 * A woman who claimed she was sexually fondled after being handcuffed at 3 
a.m. by a sheriff's deputy who pulled her car over for "no reason at all." 
</P>
<P>
 * A woman who said she and her two daughters, 9 and 10, were traumatized by 
transit officers in the middle of the night after a fare dispute on a Gardena 
bus. She said she ended up in the hospital with a dislocated shoulder because 
of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 * A man who claimed that a high-speed police chase of a teen-ager driving a 
stolen car caused a crash into his Bellflower home, nearly killing him and his 
wife as they slept at 3 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * A Los Angeles couple who claimed that their trip to a police station for 
first aid -- after the woman hit her husband on the head with her purse and 
drew blood -- led to the wife's arrest for battery, mistreatment by officers, 
denial of medicine for her severe health problems and an $8,000 hospital bill 
they can't afford. When asked by a clinic volunteer why they went to the police 
in the first place, the husband said he had been "taught from childhood" that 
"the police are who you turn to whenever you're in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the odds, many decide to pursue their cases because, as the Los 
Angeles couple put it, they want to "stand up for themselves" and "go on 
record" about how they were treated in the hope that others will not be treated 
the same way. 
</P>
<P>
 Each client is assigned a volunteer counselor who interviews the person and 
decides whether the case is appropriate for Small Claims Court. If so, the 
counselor helps file documents, gather evidence and coaches clients on how to 
present the case in court. 
</P>
<P>
 About 95 people have gone to the clinic for advice since it opened in 
November. Organizers say about 50 of these clients are being prepared to file 
claims. Of the four who've done so already, only one has won. 
</P>
<P>
 That was Dorothy Dotson, 70, whose apartment was mistakenly broken into by 
police who went to the wrong address in a drug raid. She was caught literally 
with her pants down, and says she was forced to remain that way while the 
intruders searched. A judge awarded her $5,000. The city attorney's office has 
announced it will appeal in Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Brennan, clinical law professor at the USC Law Center, said the 
possibility of such appeals is a problem with the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds like a good idea," he said, "but the reality is that if anyone wins 
against the police in Small Claims Court, the city attorney will merely appeal 
the decision in Superior Court." 
</P>
<P>
 And in that court, Brennan said, "You need an attorney to represent you. The 
whole point of Small Claims Court for these people was because they couldn't 
get attorneys in the first place. So they are back to where they started. 
That's why I don't see this clinic as any kind of real solution." 
</P>
<P>
 Karol Heppe, executive director of the abuse-monitoring group Police Watch and 
founder of the clinic with Kaye, disagrees. She said a Pomona attorney has 
offered to represent Dotson, without cost, in Superior Court during the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 And as more clinic clients win in Small Claims Court, Heppe hopes, more 
attorneys will volunteer to represent them at no cost if the city appeals. 
Perhaps then, she said, the trend of appealing these cases will be reversed. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Hokinson, a senior assistant city attorney, represents the Los Angeles 
Police Department in cases involving personal injury and property damage. He 
said that suing the police in Small Claims Court is "not a new concept; it's 
been going on for years. (The clinic) is just an organized effort to get more 
people to use the court." He has no problem with that, he said. But the city 
will appeal the Dotson case because "we do not believe the facts . . . justify 
an award of $5,000 to that claimant." 
</P>
<P>
 Another role of the clinic is to "help monitor rogue behavior of those few 
police who repeatedly commit acts of abuse," said co-founder Kaye, who was a 
member of the 1991 Christopher Commission. Volunteers keep a record of names of 
the alleged abusive officers, whether from LAPD, the L.A. County Sheriff's 
Department or other agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. John Duncan, an LAPD spokesman, said the department has no comment on the 
clinic. "We investigate internally" any complaints of alleged police 
misconduct. "In fact, we have flyers at the stations to tell the public how to 
initiate such complaints." 
</P>
<P>
 Many clinic clients say they're looking for more. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bellflower man, Edward Villavicencio, said that after piecing together the 
story from officers on his lawn, he learned they had chased a teen-ager in a 
stolen car. The boy crashed at high speed into Villavicencio's parked car, 
which ignited and went through his wall. "If my car wasn't there as a buffer 
we'd be dead. The police did not apologize or offer to help fix my house and 
car. They just left." 
</P>
<P>
 His clinic advisers say he has a difficult case, since it was the criminal's 
car, not the police car, that did the damage. He has filed for damages against 
the city of Torrance and the County of Los Angeles for the destruction of his 
car. (His house was repaired with insurance funds.) He has also been advised to 
file for relief from the state's Victims of Crime program. 
</P>
<P>
 Villavicencio says he'll persist, not just for the money, but because "it's a 
matter of principle."

THE LIVING PROOF; TROUBLED KIDS HAVE TO LISTEN TO MICHAEL MCKENZIE WHEN HE 
TELLS THEM THEY CAN OVERCOME HELLISH CHILDHOODS. WITH HELP, HE'S DONE EXACTLY 
THAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When his mother started screaming, Michael McKenzie just rolled over in bed 
and shut his eyes tighter. 
</P>
<P>
 The 8-year-old had learned during a lifelong tour of shabby motel rooms and 
children's shelters how to sleep through noise or hunger or even fear. She had 
been drinking again. He couldn't tell what she was ranting and sobbing about 
this time, but when he heard the banging on the front door he knew he had to 
quiet her down. 
</P>
<P>
 Half-asleep, he wandered into her room to find her fumbling beneath her 
mattress for a butcher knife she kept stashed there ever since a man had 
followed her home from a bar. She pulled it out just as the door came crashing 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the police kicked in the door they saw her standing there above me with 
the knife, so they tackled her," McKenzie remembers now, 14 years later. "I 
think there were four or five of them. They wrestled her to the ground, really 
hard. I remember I just kept crying." 
</P>
<P>
 That night it was back to a shelter and an uncertain future for young 
McKenzie. It was the fourth time he had been taken away from his mother, and it 
wouldn't be the last. Already a grade behind in school, the shy little boy 
seemed to have disadvantages stacked against him on all sides. 
</P>
<P>
 His father had left long before, when McKenzie was an infant, and his mother 
was again seeking solace in a bottle. Like hundreds of neglected or abused 
children who pass through Orange County's social system each year, McKenzie had 
a head start on failure. But, unlike most of those kids, McKenzie escaped. 
</P>
<P>
 A handsome and charismatic 22-year-old, a college student and surfer with an 
easy smile, he seems now to be worlds away from his troubled youth. He's 
overcome emotional problems that made him a dour, depressed youth. And he's 
back at the shelter where he spent much of his childhood, this time to reach 
out to youngsters who, as he did, find themselves paying for their parents' 
mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 McKenzie returned two years ago to the familiar courtyards of Orangewood 
Children's Home, the county's refuge for kids in distress. He came back to help 
create and now head a peer-counseling program that the home's officials 
describe as wildly successful. 
</P>
<P>
 Every two weeks, McKenzie and 17 other trained alums of the home meet with 
teens, listen to their problems and answer questions about drugs, suicide, 
pregnancy and other heavy topics. Most of all, they offer themselves as role 
models. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the kids, the guys especially, come into the program thinking 
they're too cool for it to do them any good; they think we don't have anything 
to tell them that they don't already know," McKenzie said. "But when we tell 
them we've been where they are now, you can see them look up and pay 
attention." 
</P>
<P>
 The success of the program, and of McKenzie himself, has been like a tonic for 
many of the world-weary staff at Orangewood. They know the numbers are against 
them, so they embrace the victories. "We don't get to see a lot of the ones who 
make it, just the ones that keep coming back," supervisor Cindi Ortiz said. "We 
get a lot of negativity, so it's refreshing." 
</P>
<P>
 Another person who finds inspiration in McKenzie's turnaround is William G. 
Steiner, former director of Orangewood and now a member of the county's Board 
of Supervisors. The two grew close when the boy was at the shelter, and the 
politician picked McKenzie to hold the Bible for him when he took his oath of 
office in March, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, that was like a happy ending after seeing a lot of tragedies," 
Steiner said. "I buried a lot of kids through the years, and I saw a lot of 
others take turns for the worst. They end up in jail or on drugs or become 
abusive parents themselves. It can burn you out. So when you have a success 
like Mike, it just renews your faith." 
</P>
<P>
 For much of his youth, it seemed unlikely that McKenzie would become a success 
story. Five times he was taken from his mother's care because of neglect. He 
missed long stretches of school. While most kids were grappling with long 
division, he was coping with a deep depression as he was shuttled between 
foster homes. But he never blamed his mother, whom he remembers had a 
"beautiful, peaceful smile" that could always renew his hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "I loved her, and I was able to forgive her every time. In reality, yes, I 
guess I was suffering for her mistakes, but I never really thought of it like 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 The dark years reached their nadir just a few weeks before his 15th birthday. 
His mother died of a stroke, and suddenly he was all alone in the world. 
"Things could have gotten really bad after that," McKenzie concedes. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Steiner asked San Clemente stockbroker Peter McKenzie to meet the 
boy. The two hit it off, and soon Michael moved in. Later, he would take his 
foster father's name. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter McKenzie had taken in troubled teens before, but he had never seen one 
who had so effectively shut himself off from the world. "At first I wasn't 
really sure Mike even liked me," he said. "He had the biggest wall around him I 
had ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
 Breaking down that wall would be no easy task. The teen was still doing poorly 
in school and bottomed out when he was expelled for truancy. He slept away most 
days. "It sounds funny, but that's how my depression was expressed," Michael 
McKenzie said. "I wouldn't get up usually until noon." 
</P>
<P>
 His new father saw potential in McKenzie, but he knew he needed help digging 
it out. "We got him some counseling. We had to. I was going crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 The professional help, along with a healthy dose of tough love from the people 
around him, helped McKenzie mount an incredible comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking evening classes to make up credits, he managed to graduate on time and 
was voted student of the month three times in his senior year. More than that, 
he came to grips with his past and his mother's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of kids like Mike use their problems as an excuse to fail, but Mike was 
lucky enough to have people around him who cared a great deal about him and 
held him accountable for his actions," Steiner said. "We weren't going to let 
him use his background as a reason not to succeed." 
</P>
<P>
 McKenzie said something inside him guided him through the low times. Without 
it, the tough love and counseling might not have been enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't have a lot of opportunities for a long time; I realize that now. But 
when I was growing up, I felt this strength inside me, deep down, that made me 
feel I would succeed," McKenzie said. "There were a lot of times when I may 
have doubted it, but I still had that feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 Often, as a youngster, McKenzie had little else he could rely on. His mother's 
battles with addiction and poverty left her little room to raise a son. He 
missed a lot of school, sometimes because he was too ashamed of his clothes or 
where he lived to ride the school bus. 
</P>
<P>
 He would go whole days without eating, or he would force down a meal of 
whatever he could find in the unkempt kitchen -- be it raw sugar, dry cereal or 
uncooked spaghetti. His mother was either working or, when she lapsed into an 
alcoholic binge, off partying. 
</P>
<P>
 McKenzie said he and his mother twice ended up living in dank warehouses, 
sleeping on shaky cots among piles of clothes and stacks of boxes. Once, at age 
12, he was arrested for shoplifting. A schoolteacher had chided him in front of 
other students about his socks, which she said were soiled and smelly, so he 
went to a department store to steal some. 
</P>
<P>
 Another time he was kidnaped for several days by two women, co-workers of his 
mother who decided she was unfit to raise him. "That wasn't scary or anything; 
they were nice people, but it was pretty strange." 
</P>
<P>
 Again and again the strangeness in McKenzie's life prompted authorities to 
step in and take him from his mother, the first time when he was just an 
infant. Sometimes he would spend several weeks or months in foster care until 
his mother could show she had the means to care for him. 
</P>
<P>
 After he was taken the fourth time, after the police believed she was menacing 
him with the knife, he spent three years with a Garden Grove family. Even 
though he grew close to those foster parents and the other children in their 
home, he always dreamed of returning to his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "She would come and visit every other Saturday, and then I would watch her 
walk up to the bus stop and leave," he remembered. "It was always hard to see 
her go. I had all these unrealistic expectations that we would be able to get a 
house and be happy. I just didn't see the whole picture." 
</P>
<P>
 When the day came to wave goodby to the tearful foster family and return to 
his mother for the final time, McKenzie was beside himself with excitement. He 
was certain they would now have the life he dreamed of. He was crestfallen when 
he found out that, instead of a home, they would once again be living in a 
motel. 
</P>
<P>
 That disappointment grew when his mother resumed drinking. One night he and 
his mother fell asleep watching television. He was roused by a noise and looked 
over to see his mother convulsing, gripped by a stroke. As she was rushed to a 
hospital, McKenzie, then 14, was taken to a friend's house and then back to 
Orangewood. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later, a counselor took him aside and told him his mother was dead. 
"I didn't get to visit her in the hospital, and I really beat myself up about 
that for a long time," he said. "I know she loved me. No matter what happened 
through the years, I know that." 
</P>
<P>
 After that he was lucky enough to be placed with Peter McKenzie. If he had 
stayed in the shelter until turning 18, his life might have taken a decidedly 
darker turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies show that as many as half of the teens who leave shelters upon 
reaching adulthood end up homeless in the first few years out, said Shelley 
Westmore, assistant director of the Orangewood Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Westmore said she can also attest to other dangers, such as drugs, that await 
the cut-loose charges. "They get a handshake and a pat on the back, and then 
they're on their own," she said. "And it's scary out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Grateful for his chance to start anew, McKenzie decided he wanted to give 
something back. He began helping with Orangewood benefits and activities, and, 
after a summer camp stay sparked an interest in peer counseling, he was eager 
to help with a fledgling program being set up at the home. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon he was leading the effort. "Mike was just the natural choice," Westmore 
said. "He has instant credibility with these kids. As the program had grown, 
time and time again the kids will tell us the thing they got out of the 
sessions was, 'There is life after Orangewood.' That's the message Mike brings 
to them." 
</P>
<P>
 McKenzie is working this summer as a senior counselor with disadvantaged teens 
at the R.M. Pyles Boys' Camp in the Sequoia National Park. The boys are from 
backgrounds that mirror his youth -- many have no fathers in their lives, and 
not much in the way of money or opportunity -- and the camp stresses self 
esteem and personal responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 He hopes to attend a four-year university next year to pursue a degree in 
child psychology or a related discipline.  
</P>
<P>
 Walking through the spartan rooms of Orangewood, pointing to the playgrounds 
he roamed as a pensive adolescent, McKenzie reflected on his long, scary ride 
and the sad ending of his mother's life, and talked about unfinished business. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish things could have been different," he said. "At the time I really 
couldn't understand a lot. But now I see where I came from, the reality of it. 
My mom was an alcoholic, and she had a lot of problems. And that's OK. But I 
wish I could have told her goodby."

COMMITMENTS; BLACKS FACE EXTRA CHALLENGES ON THE ROAD TO LOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANCES GRANDY TAYLOR, THE HARTFORD COURANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When it comes to relationships, there's no shortage of advice. Everyone from 
Ricki Lake to Cosmopolitan has an idea on how to meet the right man or woman or 
how to keep the flames of passion burning. 
</P>
<P>
 But for African-American men and women, the search for love can seem even more 
daunting, and all that advice may not address the real issues that black 
couples face. Social ills that threaten the black community also affect the 
stability of families and can make it more difficult for single men and women 
to find satisfying relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 In their new book, "Friends, Lovers and Soulmates: A Guide to Better 
Relationships Between Black Men and Women" (Simon & Schuster, 1994), 
psychologists Derek S. Hopson and Darlene Powell-Hopson of Middlefield, Conn., 
turn their attention to helping black singles and couples improve their 
communication and support of each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a real need for a more positive approach," Hopson said. "So often the 
focus has been negative in terms of talking about the crisis, and not as much 
on what we can do to enhance our relationships." 
</P>
<P>
 The black community has kept its relationship issues quiet, Hopson said, 
because doing otherwise seemed "like airing dirty laundry in public" and giving 
the larger society ammunition against them. 
</P>
<P>
 But "in keeping our issues from other people, we have also to some extent kept 
them from ourselves," Hopson added. "People want to have solid relationships, 
but are finding challenges, whether single or married, in knowing what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 For African-Americans, racism and economic hardship have strained intimate 
male-female relationships, as have adherence to mainstream standards of beauty 
and success. Hollywood myths about love and romance don't help matters, the 
Hopsons say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Love is not just this amorphous quality of passion and intense feeling, but 
it really is a conscious, purposeful decision, an act of love," Powell-Hopson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people hop from relationship to relationship," constantly seeking the 
thrill of infatuation because they think love is gone when that stage has 
passed, Hopson said. "If you only focus on romance, you neglect those other 
areas of love." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hopsons examine how lack of awareness of racial identity and racism in 
society can have a negative effect on male-female relationships. For example, 
some people grow up with negative messages about black men or women from their 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Black men and women with that negative voice in their upbringing will find it 
speaking whenever they get involved in a relationship," Powell-Hopson said. 
</P>
<P>
 A client who came to Powell-Hopson suffering postpartum depression was having 
trouble bonding with her child. Therapy revealed that the woman was having 
trouble accepting a child who was dark-skinned, as she was, instead of 
light-skinned, as her husband was. 
</P>
<P>
 "She obviously grew up hearing negative messages about skin color and hair 
texture," Powell-Hopson said. "If we had just focused on the traditional 
analysis, we would have never been able to get to the root cause of her 
depression." 
</P>
<P>
 Another couple had decreased sexual desire. The man was frustrated at work 
watching co-workers he had trained promoted over him, "and felt very 
emasculated," Powell-Hopson said. "He felt he could not come home and share 
this with (his wife) because it would not be manly" and their marital 
relationship began to suffer. When they began to talk about it, he found his 
wife could give him a great deal of support and their relationship improved, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hopsons also suggest that African-Americans rely on the principles that 
helped sustain the black community in the past, such as collective 
responsibility, and that a couple try to focus on their strengths instead of 
just their weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
 In the book, "we talk about a we-ness instead of an I-ness," Hopson said. "So 
much in society is 'I' focused, what am 'I' getting out of it, as opposed to 
what can we as a couple achieve, in our relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 And in the home, cooperation works better than competition, he said. 
Competition works in the workplace, but at home a competitive approach can lead 
to conflict and disruption. This is especially true for black couples, he said, 
who in the past have had to rely on a cooperative approach to succeed in the 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hopsons, both of whom have doctorates in clinical psychology, have been 
married for nine years. Derek, 42, specializes in marital and family therapy, 
and Darlene, 36, specializes in child and family therapy. They have a 
7-year-old daughter, a 21-month-old son, and an informally adopted 19-year-old 
son. 
</P>
<P>
 The husband-and-wife team are frequent guests on TV and radio talk shows. They 
have co-authored two other books: "Different and Wonderful," published in 1990, 
and "Raising the Rainbow Generation: Teaching Your Children To Be Successful in 
a Multicultural Society," published in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hopsons met at a psychologists convention in Washington. While the other 
professional men she met told her about their credentials and the books they 
were writing, "Derek told me a story about his grandmother that stole my 
heart," Darlene says. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's most important is that we are best friends, and have seen each other 
through all kinds of challenges," she added. "Like any couple, we have our 
struggles, but we have excellent communication."

 Men keep zonking out on Helen Argyriou's couch. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how hard she pretends to be interested in her date's passion for 
French toast. No matter how long she primps and perfects her Mediterranean 
looks. No matter how riveting her life stories are. 
</P>
<P>
 Awake one minute, unconscious the next. 
</P>
<P>
 Argyriou, a 30ish Santa Monica fashion designer, sighs as she ponders four 
recent dates, each with a different man. "I don't get it," she says. "Why do 
these men fall asleep on me? They don't even try to seduce me." 
</P>
<P>
 Not yet, anyway, says Michael Evans, 37, a Los Angeles bachelor. He's never 
met Argyriou, but he claims to know why men snooze on her sofa. 
</P>
<P>
 He laughingly calls it the "civilized seduction trick," in which a man who 
desires intimacy with a woman -- but doesn't want her to hurl names relating to 
animals or sewage -- feigns slumber once inside her place for coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 In theory, the woman finds him so adorable, she relents from disturbing his 
rock-solid repose. He leaves before dawn, calls her to apologize for his 
exhaustion and sweet-talks another rendezvous. On it, he repeats "sleep" until 
fate suddenly awakens him, urging him to consummate this new bond he has with 
the woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Men who've suggested such things to Argyriou have failed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it backfires," Evans acknowledges, but "sometimes it works, which 
just goes to show how important dating games are." 
</P>
<P>
 Played by many of the nation's 71 million singles age 18 and older, dating 
games can range from elaborate seduction schemes to simple exaggeration of 
income, athletic feats or chest configuration. They are games that, most 
experts caution, seldom produce any lasting winners. 
</P>
<P>
 Kris Rosenberg, a Pittsburgh psychologist who has counseled countless 
deceiving and deceived daters, distinguishes between making a good impression 
(being polite, well-groomed) and acting like someone you're not (assuming 
another personality, suppressing beliefs). 
</P>
<P>
 Making a good impression sours with bad intentions, Rosenberg says. There is 
nothing wrong, for example, with enhancing an appearance with a pushup bra or a 
toupee, as long as reality, if and when exposed, is not a shock. 
</P>
<P>
 "Think about what is motivating you to look or act a certain way," Rosenberg 
advises, "because the greater the lie, the bigger the dating game." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who do the latter will inevitably feel particularly rejected and 
disillusioned when a relationship falters. "The true self always comes out," 
says Rosenberg, author of "Talk to Me: A Therapist's Guide to Breaking Through 
Male Silence" (Tarcher Putnam, 1994). 
</P>
<P>
 Psychologist Joyce Block agrees that singles should ditch their insecurities 
and be direct about who they are when they first encounter a potential mate. 
</P>
<P>
 Adults who must pretend in order to impress a love interest should examine 
relationships with their parents, suggests Block, an adjunct psychology 
professor at Notre Dame University and author of "Family Myths: Living Our 
Roles, Betraying Ourselves" (Simon & Schuster, 1994). 
</P>
<P>
 Children often create false images to please a parent, she says. Those who did 
not receive approval carry immature behavior with them into their grown-up 
years. "Then only slowly and painfully will they learn," she says, "that 
(dating games) do not work for people who want intimacy and meaning." 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Mangini, a 38-year-old fashion consultant, wants both. Before the 
evening begins, the self-described "dating queen" insists on organized rituals 
and ruses to both entice and screen men. 
</P>
<P>
 Three nights a week, she struts her long legs in short skirts, bolsters her 
bosom and poufs her blond hair. When a security guard announces her date's 
arrival, Mangini waits to stage her dramatic descent down the stairs of her 
Sherman Oaks condo. She even practiced the slink. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening show is a test. "I don't need a man who's intimidated by my looks, 
my black BMW, my condo or my life, which is so together," says Mangini, who 
plucks most of her prospects from a dating service. "It just says he has this 
void that needs filling. I'm not into co-dependents." 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming he passes, the games end and "everything else is reality," she says. 
"I'm into honesty. I want a man who can be himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Gamesmanship may be at its height in Southern California, home of performers 
and others fascinated by their own appearance, says John Toomey, regional 
executive director of Personal Search International, a matchmaking service. And 
Americans are more immature and insecure than singles in other countries in 
which Toomey's agency does business, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I'm making generalizations, but there is no other culture like ours," 
says Toomey, 37. He adds that members in other countries tend to look for 
partners based on character and react with shock when they hear about U.S. 
dating standards. "Few (Americans) are interested in inner qualities, 
especially in L.A. It's always big chests or big salaries." 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Schlessinger compares local adult courting to that done by teens since 
both revolve around immaturity and sex. Adults used to act more honest and 
civilized. Years ago, teens had less sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the two are merging, says Schlessinger, a talk-radio psychologist on 
KFI-AM and author of "Ten Stupid Things Women Do To Mess Up Their Lives" 
(Villard Books, 1994). Each day, she receives calls from the heartbroken, 
suffering in relationships where one partner created or concealed personal 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hear some pretty outrageous stories," says Schlessinger, who describes 
game-playing singles older than 40 as hopeless. "I know other silly (dating) 
stories are out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Such as the case of Sam, 33, an L.A. native who now lives in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 One day in March, he recalls, he feigned motion sickness on a 5-m.p.h. boat 
ride at the Luxor Hotel and Casino to attract the sympathy of a buxom brunette. 
</P>
<P>
 She fell for the ploy, cooing with sympathy and offering Sam soda crackers 
stashed in her purse. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was beautiful but dumb," admits Sam. He declines the use of his last name 
because he doesn't want to risk women discovering his dishonesty. Besides, he's 
a businessman. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I do pretty good business picking up women. . . . I got this dating thing 
cinched," says Sam, who acknowledges that he's never had a relationship with a 
woman for more than four months in his 18 years of dating.

CAN THIS MARRIAGE BE SAVED?: COMMITTMENTS; CAUGHT UP IN A CYCLE OF NAGGING, 
IGNORING

 "Roger would do anything for someone he loves," says Sharon, 35, a tearful 
woman who works as a fund-raiser for a nonprofit community group. "That's why I 
fell in love with him. And it's why I'm so heartbroken now." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Sharon, Roger, a real-estate salesman with a firm known for its 
toughness, says he's going out with clients after work but doesn't tell her 
where and never calls to say he'll be late. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm frantic, thinking his car is wrapped around some telephone pole," she 
says, "not to mention the fact that I have spent the entire night home alone." 
</P>
<P>
 When Roger is home, he's catatonic in front of the TV. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was never much of a talker," Sharon says, "but now he's totally 
withdrawn." 
</P>
<P>
 Adding fuel to her anger is the fact that Roger never gets around to doing any 
of the things he's promised to do.  
</P>
<P>
 Their five-year marriage began to unravel months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've tried to be understanding," Sharon says, her voice filled with 
resignation, "but I can't count on him to do anything." 
</P>
<P>
 "As usual, my wife is exaggerating," says Roger, 32. "I'll admit that 
sometimes I lose track of the time. I think about calling, but I know I'll get 
my head handed to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Roger says Sharon makes him feel like he's reporting home to mother. If she's 
not obsessing about some problem in her life, she's haranguing him about not 
being there for her. "Look, I'm in a pressure-cooker office; it's much tougher 
than my old job. But how can I tell her about problems at work when she's so 
wired already?" 
</P>
<P>
 Roger insists that if Sharon would leave him alone, he'd get to the things she 
wants done. "Maybe not by her deadline, but I'd get them done." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Overpowered by Sharon's relentless manner, Roger slid into what therapists 
call passive-aggressive behaviors," says Jane Greer, a marriage counselor in 
New York City and Douglaston, N.Y. It's easier for Roger not to talk, to avoid 
Sharon and her issues altogether, than to fend off her worries. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, by being passive and doing nothing, he is continuing the 
conflict. Of course, this only makes Sharon more anxious. And like many people 
caught in a similar bind, Sharon tries to control her anxieties by controlling 
her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 Are you caught in a similar nag-and-ignore power game with your spouse? Do you 
feel irritated and resentful when your spouse says he or she will do something 
but never gets around to doing it? Here's what you can do instead: 
</P>
<P>
 1. First, realize that you may not be able to get your mate to change his or 
her behavior, but you can change yours. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Take control of the situation yourself by setting limits. Figure out what 
you can do so you're not exclusively dependent on your spouse for accomplishing 
your goals. For instance, Sharon can tell Roger that if he's not home by 7:30, 
she will meet friends by herself -- and she must follow through. You can also 
try negotiating a reasonable deadline for him to do something. Sharon can say: 
"I'd like you to get the part for my computer by the end of the month. Do you 
think you can do it by then?" If he says yes, but doesn't follow through, then 
you'll at least know for sure that you can't count on him. You're forced to 
find another solution -- one that doesn't include nagging. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Re-evaluate your standards. Could they be too rigid? Without giving up or 
giving in, is there a way to modify your request or change the timetable in 
your head? In every healthy relationship, partners have to accept their 
differences. For instance, if Sharon stops badgering him, Roger will feel more 
inclined to call home if he'll be late as well as do the things she's asked him 
to do. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Finally, if you find the problem insurmountable, tell your partner so 
clearly and strongly. You can say: "We can either try to talk this out here, or 
we can do it in a therapist's office." A good therapist can referee and guide 
your discussions toward a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 Realize that you may not be able to get your mate to change his or her 
behavior, but you can change yours.

PLAYING BY THE RULES

<TEXT>
<P>
 You date. You have a hard time telling if you're being yourself or playing 
games. And you have an even harder time figuring out what your love interest is 
doing.Some experts offer these guidelines: 
</P>
<P>
 Fair Game 
</P>
<P>
 * Stuffing a wallet with extra cash for unexpected expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 * Applying makeup and hair products for killer looks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Eating light throughout the day to minimize that nauseating first-date 
feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sharing a well-balanced meal. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tidying home for date's arrival. 
</P>
<P>
 * Elaborating on professional and personal achievements. 
</P>
<P>
 Foul Play 
</P>
<P>
 * Stuffing a wallet with extra cash to look rich. (What happens to your rent 
when your date expects you to spend it all?) 
</P>
<P>
 * Dramatically altering your appearance and pretending that you always look so 
effortlessly glamorous. (Picture the morning after. Or an unexpected encounter 
at the grocery store?) 
</P>
<P>
 * Starving for the day in favor of a flatter stomach. (Imagine how hungry 
you'll get if the relationship gets serious.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Taking two bites from a salad and then whining about being full. (You'll 
either be perceived as a liar or a weirdo.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Stashing dirty underwear in the bathroom cabinet, covering comic books with 
a fat Renoir book. (You'll be found out. Many peek in bathrooms and feign 
fascination with intellectual displays.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Inflating job titles and athletic feats. (Singles say they're wary of 
actors, screenwriters and sports champs who almost made it.) KRISTINA SAUERWEIN

A CASTLE WITH A DIFFERENT CAGE; HE'S 30, A PARENT, AND TAKING A REST FROM 
'TWISTED CHARACTERS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA WINER-BERNHEIMER, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nicolas Cage lives in a fabulously fake, unabashedly new old castle -- with 
turrets, yet -- at the scenic tip of one of Hollywood's less ostentatiously 
chichi hills. "I got a really good price on it," he offers absurdly. "Nobody 
wants to live in a castle." 
</P>
<P>
 The living room walls are heavy with maroon brocade; a gigantic stuffed black 
bug, reputed to have been used in an "Outer Limits" episode, dangles from a 
corner over his shoulder. Parrots are making wild jungle squawks from another 
room, and gargoyles are just about everywhere. The man has style. He calls it 
"Gothic hot-rod." 
</P>
<P>
 And that sounds right. "Would you have expected this from me?" he asks, 
enjoying the effect of his domain. "Did you see something a little more black 
lacquer? High tech? Neo-modern?" Lest we think him seriously concerned, he 
cries out, "Don't judge me! Don't judge me!" -- then extends the tour to the 
tiger-print bedroom with the laminated cockroach in the headboard. 
</P>
<P>
 At 30, Cage has been letting movie audiences judge him -- for nearly half his 
life. He first appeared on-screen at 17 as the sensitive punk-hunk in "Valley 
Girl" (1983), emerging shirtless on the beach and mumbling, "Whaaat, I don't 
want to go to the Valley. I'm not inthe mood to go to the Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 It may not have been Brando calling "Stella!" but the debut kicked off a 
prolific and peculiar career full of edgy, often dangerous characters with an 
unexpected romantic streak and decency trapped behind their eyes. Think Elvis 
and James Stewart in one long, loopy package, probably with adenoids. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, however, he's positively decency unchained in "It Could Happen to 
You," the Andrew Bergman romantic comedy-fable that opens Friday. Cage plays 
Charlie, a good, old-fashioned beat cop in Queens who, short money for a tip at 
the neighborhood coffee shop, promises the waitress (Bridget Fonda) half his 
lottery ticket. Naturally, he wins $4 million and, because "a promise is a 
promise," hands $2 million over to her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, this is the Jimmy Stewart movie," Cage agrees, "but I'm such a huge 
admirer that I'd hesitate to say I was impersonating him. It was really more of 
a tip of the hat, kind of an homage, you know. I do think he had what seemed to 
be a pure American innocence, which trembled on the screen in a way that gave 
people hope. And there isn't a lot of that right now in movies." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Cage had done "so many subversive and twisted characters on the 
darker side of things" that he himself decided a few years ago to lighten up. 
"I know this sounds like a cliche and kind of romantic," he says, "but I'm 30 
now and a parent. . . ." (Weston, 3 1/2, mostly lives with his mother, actress 
Kristina Fulton; Cage, who shares custody, now lives with model Kristen Zang.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I suddenly became worried about my community. I don't want anything to happen 
to people I love. Even when I was making 'Wild at Heart' " -- David Lynch's 
rhapsodic outlaw sonnet (1990) -- "I was still a very sort of rebellious young 
man. Now I feel myself slowing down into a worrywart about society. . . . 
Yeah," he smiles at the adult predicament with a combination of earnestness and 
irony, "I'm a member of the club now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember I saw Jim Morrison in an old TV interview once and he was really 
drugged up on something, but he said, 'I haven't done a song yet that has 
conveyed pure happiness.' And I looked at him and thought, 'You know what? You 
were great, but you hadn't done that -- and you could be really pretentious.' 
And then I thought, 'Am I being pretentious?' I knew I could be funny, but I 
didn't want to be funny. I wanted to be James Dean." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The result was what he calls his "sunshine trilogy" -- Bergman's 'Honeymoon in 
Vegas," then "Guarding Tess," and now this almost mythic style piece. And this 
trio doesn't even include his too-honest-to-lie drifter in "Red Rock West," the 
noir thriller recently rescued from the video gulag for general release, or his 
reluctant bank robber at Christmas in the upcoming "It Happened in Paradise," 
with Dana Carvey and Jon Lovitz. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nick makes ordinary guys so interesting," marvels Bergman, who is similarly 
drawn to everyday characters trapped in extraordinary situations. "There's 
nothing white bread about anything he does." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's the quizzical eyebrows; maybe it's the wariness lurking behind the 
seemingly guileless and sleepy eyes. Whatever, even his sunniest characters 
hint of dark encounters with clouds. "I've always felt we have a little bit of 
good and bad in all of us -- and that's what makes us complicated and all 
that," he says. "But Charlie is good, good, good, so I wanted to play him a 
little larger than life. Naturalism is a style that can be really effective, 
but it can be really boring." 
</P>
<P>
 And so, clearly, can all that goodness. This is, after all, still the fellow 
who decorated the castle, who collects muscle cars, who once told American 
Film, "I'm just more entertained with something that gives you bad dreams." He 
is now filming "Kiss of Death," a remake of the Richard Widmark-Victor Mature 
gangster flick, in which Cage plays the bad guy to the good guy of David Caruso 
of "NYPD Blue." 
</P>
<P>
 This explains his new goatee, ("for a more fierce look"), if not the 
embroidered silk shirt, the rather formal black pants and black alligator shoes 
that, at first glance, give our host the unexpected air of a Don at his Spanish 
villa. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never thought I was handsome by Hollywood standards," he says, "but I 
think, lucky for me, the American public tends to respond more to the Everyman 
-- or Everywoman -- than to the dream man or woman. Look at Harrison Ford, who 
strikes me as a classic Everyman type, very intense but not extraordinarily 
handsome, you know? Tom Hanks is another good example. Of course, there are the 
Mel Gibsons, but I think people by and large like to go to movies to feel like 
they could be these people." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This is a man who has grown up in public -- essentially self-trained and, 
although his pedigree is fascinating, self-created. He was born in Long Beach, 
as Nicolas Coppola, nephew of Francis Ford Coppola, and youngest of the three 
sons of a dancer-choreographer named Joy Vogelsang and a professor of 
comparative literature -- later dean of creative arts at San Francisco State 
University -- named August Coppola. "My dad was always playing great records or 
showing me great classical films and exposing me to all kinds of wonderful 
culture," he says with pride and affection. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nicolas, whose parents divorced when he was 12, left Beverly Hills High 
School in the 11th grade. "I didn't drop out," he corrects firmly. "I took the 
GED and left. I didn't like high school. And my father didn't like the school 
system any more than I did. He felt life experience was the real teacher." 
</P>
<P>
 And the life experience he was drawn to was acting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a skinny little boy and I used to get, you know, beat up by the kids in 
the back of the bus. I remember one day I dressed myself up as somebody else. I 
put on sunglasses and jeans and cowboy boots and I was chewing gum and had all 
this attitude and I told them: 'I'm Nicky Coppola's cousin, Roy Richards, and 
I'm going to beat you up if you mess with Nicky again.' 
</P>
<P>
 "And they believed it. And I think I knew then that I could make people 
believe I was somebody else. But I couldn't be threatening or intimidating as 
me -- I had to think I was somebody else in order to get there."  
</P>
<P>
 He studied acting one summer at the American Conservatory Theater in San 
Francisco and privately for a short time here. Mostly, however, he learned by 
doing -- frequently as many as three films a year -- trying experiments that 
sometimes led to mannerisms. He used to create characters by doing "crazy 
stunts. . . . Because I really didn't know how to act." He had his wisdom teeth 
pulled without Novocain to feel the pain of a disfigured Vietnam veteran in 
"Birdy" (1984) and ate a live cockroach to get in the mood for one of his 
favorite characters, the literary agent in "Vampire's Kiss" (1989). 
</P>
<P>
 "Cher was a real champion for me," he remembers fondly. "I had done 'Peggy Sue 
Got Married' in 1986 where I got slammed by the critics -- which I was quite 
happy about, really, because I was in a state where I wanted to do something 
that would shake people up for some reason. But Cher saw that movie and thought 
the performance was like a two-hour car accident and she really wanted me for 
'Moonstruck.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Cage says he is tempted to do theater -- Lincoln Center's Bernard Gersten is a 
family friend who has expressed interest and Cage has mentioned Eugene O'Neill 
-- but "I'm really a film actor. I want a permanent record. I want to be there 
forever."

 South Coast Repertory has won the largest of three grants -- $200,000 -- 
awarded to Orange County organizations by the National Endowment for the Arts. 
SCR's grant will support its 1994-95 season. The Bowers Museum of Cultural Art, 
awarded $50,000, will use the money to curate "Between Empires: The Artistic 
Legacy of Pre-Hispanic Panama," an exhibit slated to open in January. Laguna 
Art Museum will use its $35,000 grant to organize a retrospective show of work 
by contemporary Los Angeles artist Llyn Foulkes. Curated by independent curator 
Marilu Knode, it is slated to open in October, 1995, and is tentatively 
scheduled to travel to Honolulu's Contemporary Museum and Northern California's 
Oakland Museum. It is Foulkes' "first major retrospective," according to Laguna 
museum acting director Susan M. Anderson. Nationwide, the NEA conferred a total 
of $31.5 million in 1994 third-quarter awards.

 Heidt has spent a lifetime leading orchestras, just as his dad advised him to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
 He once harbored political ambitions, but when he went to his father for 
advice, he was told to stick to the family business. 
</P>
<P>
 A pianist, Heidt first appeared with his dad's orchestra when he was 3. He 
admits he liked being the center of attention. 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating from Stanford University in 1969 with a degree in political 
science and picking up a law degree from Southwestern University School of Law 
in Los Angeles, Heidt was ready to become a political animal. 
</P>
<P>
 That didn't happen, and, after a career of conducting, he concedes that father 
knew best. 
</P>
<P>
 The elder Heidt, who died several years ago, had been famous during the Big 
Band era, not just for his music, but the way he delivered it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dad was a born showman," Heidt said. "He loved the idea of performing, so he 
would do crazy things with the band, like making them all wear tutus or all 
play the same instrument." 
</P>
<P>
 Band-leading was not what Horace Heidt Sr. had planned to do with his life, 
either. He'd wanted to be a professional football player, the younger Heidt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dad was born in Northern California and went to Berkeley, where he was a 
football player with the University of California wonder team of the early 
'20s," said Heidt, adding that his father suffered a serious football injury 
that ended the dream. 
</P>
<P>
 From then on, it was music and one entertainment industry innovation after 
another. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dad put his band on stage and made it the center of attention. That was 
something no one had done before," Horace Jr. said. "He also featured comic 
singing groups in the early '30s. Actor Art Carney was one of the Don Juans." 
</P>
<P>
 His father also toured with entertainers such as the King Sisters, Gordon 
MacRae and Alvino Rey. The elder Heidt also launched several pioneer radio 
shows, such as the game show "The Pot of Gold" and "The Original Youth 
Opportunity Program," an early talent show. 
</P>
<P>
 His dad also built an apartment complex near the corner of Magnolia Boulevard 
and Hazelton Avenue in North Hollywood meant to house members of his band and 
their families. But, by the time it was finished in the mid-'50s, most of the 
band members had done well enough to have their own homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The complex, known as the Horace Heidt Magnolia Estates, did attract people in 
show business, such as "Perry Mason's" Barbara Hale, singer Helen Forrest, Ed 
Begley Sr. and Jr., and Dick and Patti van Patten, who raised their three sons 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 Heidt blossomed in show business. By the early 1970s, he and the Horace Heidt 
Junior Orchestra were playing at the L'Escoffier Room in the Beverly Hilton and 
the Century Plaza Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Heidt, whose group will perform Sunday at the Concerts in the Park program in 
Warner Center, has also performed at Disneyland and Disney World. 
</P>
<P>
 The closest he ever got to politics was an unsuccessful run at state office in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 But he's never stopped making music. At 5:30 p.m. Sunday at the Warner Center 
bandstand, the beat will go on. Take This Job and Look Above It, Look Beyond It 
</P>
<P>
 This is a test for those who have been, are or soon will be job-hunting. 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't matter if you were laid off, became obsolete or just got bored and 
booted, it's all the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not a timed test. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no wrong answers. 
</P>
<P>
 The results will not be given to the person who was, is or might be your boss. 
</P>
<P>
 The only question is: How did you used to feel when "Take This Job and Shove 
It" played on your car radio? 
</P>
<P>
 If you pulled over to the side of the road so you could whistle, cheer and 
boogie, maybe the words and thoughts of Jocelyn Lighthill will have meaning for 
you. 
</P>
<P>
 Lighthill holds a master's degree in career counseling and works at the Valley 
Women's Center in Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
 She believes that losing a dead-end, catatonia-inducing, asphyxiating job is 
not necessarily the worst thing that can happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't make it sound as if I don't understand how frightened most people 
become without a paycheck," she said. "What I am saying is that this can be a 
time for people to re-evaluate what they do professionally and bring that more 
in line with personal interests." 
</P>
<P>
 She advises people not to wait until the ax falls. "It is always better to 
plan ahead so that you can be in control of the job situation, not be at the 
mercy of it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the current economy, everyone needs an updated resume and job options, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of us assume our jobs will always be there if we do them well, and that 
is not the case anymore," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lighthill is not just a theorist. She practices what she preaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had jobs I have loved, and jobs I haven't. I have a tendency to switch 
directions every two years or so," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all have to do, our own deciding about how we want to work, and what we 
want to work at. Some people are happy at safe, long-term jobs. For other 
people that is suffocating. We're all different in that respect and can have 
different ideas about that at different times in life," Lighthill said. 
</P>
<P>
 The best advice for anyone out of work: Try to find a job that makes you happy 
as well as providing a paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more positive your outlook on the situation, the better your prospects of 
doing the right thing for yourself," she said. Overheard: 
</P>

 "It's interesting to me that my grandson is in Mexico this summer perfecting 
his Spanish as a second language. I've never heard him say anything in English 
except, 'Can you loan me $20 till next week?' "

SHOP TALK: HOLIDAY PAY IS AN EMPLOYER OPTION THAT CAN CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Do you have a question about an on-the-job situation? If so, please mail it 
to Shop Talk, Los Angeles Times, P.O. Box 2008, Costa Mesa, Calif. 92626. Or 
call (714) 966-7873 and leave a voice mail message. Questions of general 
interest will be answered in this column on Mondays.

 Question: In our company, we have been guaranteed five paid holidays. Then the 
company came out with a memo that said we would not be paid for a holiday if it 
fell on the weekend. We used to be paid for the holiday even if it landed on 
the weekend. We would like to know if this is correct or if we are due the 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 -- C.P., Fullerton 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Such benefits as holiday pay and vacation pay are not required by law. 
Employers are free to decline to pay for any holidays or to provide any 
vacation pay to employees. Therefore, a company is free to change its holiday 
policy whenever it chooses. Accordingly, it is likely that your employer can 
change its practice on holiday pay to eliminate pay for holidays that occur on 
weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 However, such a change can only be made as to holidays that occur after the 
change is announced. Moreover, the answer might be different if the employer 
somehow had guaranteed to its employees that it would never change its holiday 
pay policy. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Question: What is the law concerning salaried, exempt employees? My company is 
currently on a seven-hours-a-day, 35-hour workweek. In October, we will begin 
working eight hours a day, 40 hours a week and the company does not plan to 
increase our pay, so we'll be working an extra five hours at the same salary. 
Is that legal? 
</P>
<P>
 -- T.D., La Habra 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: The increase of work hours to eight hours per day, 40 hours per week 
does not violate any wage-and-hour laws. If an employee is on a salaried basis, 
employment hours can vary at the option of the employer. Simply being salaried 
does not mean that an employee is also exempt. This is a very common 
misconception in the workplace.  
</P>
<P>
 A non-exempt employee will enjoy the protection of many laws that require rest 
breaks, lunch breaks and a limitation in duration of employment hours. An 
employee may have possible rights in this situation if previous promises by the 
employer have been made regarding the permanency of the work-hour policy, or if 
the change unlawfully discriminates or retaliates against one particular group 
of employees.  
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, often the only recourse for an exempt employee who is asked to 
work unreasonably lengthy hours may be to quit. The salaried, non-exempt worker 
at least has a right to overtime pay. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Don D. Sessions, employee rights attorney, Mission Viejo 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: I work as a physician in Orange County. I've become aware of 
something disturbing. Recently, a salaried employee came to me and told me that 
his new supervisor was insisting that he work seven days a week. Obviously, he 
was in my office for stress and an inability to continue working. Are there any 
laws at all that cover salaried employees? Are there any limits at all on the 
demands that can be placed on them? Do such workers have any recourse other 
than finding a new job? 
</P>
<P>
 -- S.H., Mission Viejo 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Certainly there are laws that govern "salaried employees." A truly 
exempt, salaried employee is paid for projects or services rendered -- not by 
the hour. There are California State Labor Codes that require a day of rest in 
a work week of seven days. However, the law also spells out when employers may 
be allowed an exemption from this requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 As long as an employer does not jeopardize the health, safety or well-being of 
an employee, there can be expectations of meeting project deadlines. But before 
an employee reaches a point where he or she feels an inability to continue 
working, I recommend seeking some viable solutions by suggesting your patient 
talk to his employer. Possibly other work arrangements or additional support 
staff can be established. 
</P>
<P>
 These ideas should be suggested before medical care becomes the only option. 
Even if the employer does not have any formal grievance procedures or policies 
for complaining about work schedules, there is usually an "open door" policy in 
which an employee can attempt to resolve such employment issues.

PACT SIGNED FOR FIFTH TV NETWORK BY '95; BROADCAST: PARAMOUNT'S FORMAL 
AGREEMENT WITH CHRIS-CRAFT COMES JUST BEFORE DEADLINE TO INFORM AFFILIATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LIPPMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paramount Pictures and Chris-Craft Industries, after weeks of tense 
negotiations, have concluded their joint-venture agreement to launch a fifth 
broadcast network by next January, sources close to the venture said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 120-page agreement, reached just before a deadline for notifying 
affiliates was to expire last week, seems for the time being to quell industry 
speculation that the proposed network was on shaky ground. 
</P>
<P>
 In the race to form a new network, the two companies face a challenge from 
Warner Bros., which in recent weeks has been moving swiftly ahead with 
programming announcements and executive appointments for a new network of its 
own. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement between Paramount and Chris-Craft calls for their new network to 
be tentatively called the United Paramount Network -- a reflection that 
Chris-Craft, the broadcast station group, may be taking on a larger role than 
previously planned. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for the delay in reaching a formal agreement between the partners 
was a growing concern on the part of Paramount's new owners, Viacom Inc., that 
the network would be a drain on the studio's financial resources. 
</P>
<P>
 Viacom -- which completed its acquisition of Paramount earlier this month -- 
had expected a merger with Blockbuster Entertainment to provide some of the 
financial wherewithal for the network, but that merger now seems unlikely. As a 
result, Viacom has been putting pressure on Paramount executives to keep costs 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 One way Paramount may limit its financial liability is to bring aboard "third 
party" investors, an idea on which Viacom executives are said to be keen. 
</P>
<P>
 "More and more, this will become a Chris-Craft show," said one source close to 
the situation who asked not to be named. "Chris-Craft can find another studio 
easier than Paramount can find another station group." 
</P>
<P>
 While the network will air on Paramount-owned stations in such markets as 
Philadelphia and Washington, Chris-Craft has stations in key markets such as 
New York and Los Angeles -- where it owns KCOP Channel 13 -- that are crucial 
in any fifth network plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount and Chris-Craft plan to launch their network Jan. 16 with two hours 
of programming each on Monday and Tuesday nights. Paramount is using one of its 
most promising new shows, "Star Trek: Voyager," as the network's linchpin. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the partners are expected to pick a president within the next two 
weeks, having drawn up a list of four final candidates. So far, the network has 
36 affiliates covering 47% of all TV homes in the country, with other 
affiliation agreements expected to be announced this week.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: WHY STOCKS, EARNINGS TAKE DIFFERENT PATHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If the question is what killed the bull market, one suspect can be dismissed: 
We know it wasn't lousy earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,300 companies have already reported their second-quarter results, 
and 71% of those firms met or exceeded Wall Street's expectations, according to 
earnings-tracker Zacks Investment Research in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the highest percentage of on-target-or-better quarterly earnings in the 
nine years Zacks has kept data, says Zacks chief Ben Zacks. In the first 
quarter, by contrast, about 61% of firms' earnings met or topped expectations, 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet on Wall Street, the reaction to the second quarter's excellent numbers has 
been tepid at best, outside of a few individual earnings-induced rallies -- IBM 
Corp.'s surge last week among them. 
</P>
<P>
 True, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has risen 2% since earnings season 
began on July 1, but that has just been enough to pull the index back up to its 
mid-June level. Year-to-date the S&P is down 2.9%. 
</P>
<P>
 For investors, this combination -- earnings momentum without stock price 
momentum -- is frustrating at best and demoralizing at worst. Aren't stocks and 
earnings supposed to move in tandem? 
</P>
<P>
 Often, they do. In 1990, earnings went down and so did stocks. In 1991, 
earnings went down again, but stocks went up because investors bet that an 
economic recovery was near. In 1992 and 1993 the recovery came, and earnings 
and stocks rose together. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Wall Street analysts are estimating that operating earnings (i.e., 
earnings before one-time charges or gains) will rise 16% for the S&P 500 
companies as a group, Zacks says. And in 1995, the analysts see another year of 
earnings growth, albeit at a slower pace -- about 13.5%, according to Zacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, of course, is that the same economic expansion that is lifting 
earnings is also lifting interest rates. So far this year, the shock of rising 
rates -- and fear of still-higher rates in 1995 -- has been a powerful 
depressant on stock prices. Earnings look good, but the market can't overcome 
its paranoia about rates. 
</P>
<P>
 That concern isn't baseless. Take auto stocks, for example: Though earnings at 
the Big Three are surging this year, the market is already focused on 1995. If 
interest rates continue to rise, at some point in 1995 or 1996 the current auto 
sales boom will probably go bust. 
</P>
<P>
 So Wall Street is pricing auto stocks not on hot 1994 earnings, but on the 
expected lower earnings in the not-too-distant future. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are already looking at the cyclical peak in earnings for some of the 
economy-sensitive industries," says David Klassen, co-manager of the Vista 
Capital Growth fund and Vista Growth & Income fund in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, even stocks of companies whose earnings growth is expected to be 
steady over the next few years, rather than cyclical, have been depressed by 
interest rate worries. Wall Street's approach is simple and logical: If 
interest rates are up, stocks aren't worth as much as when rates are down. 
Investors lower the prices they're willing to pay relative to earnings per 
share. 
</P>
<P>
 In market jargon, price-to-earnings "compression" is occurring. As earnings 
get better but stock prices hold steady or fall, the market's price-to-earnings 
ratio, or P-E, gets lower. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the damage in the market this year has not been earnings-related but 
P-E-related," notes Jonathan Schoolar, equity director for the 
$12.5-billion-asset AIM mutual funds in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 The S&P 500 index P-E was 20 or higher in the early '90s, when earnings were 
depressed. Now the index is priced at 14.8 times analysts' consensus S&P 
earnings estimate for 1994; for 1995, the price is 13.1 times estimated 
earnings, according to Zacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the question becomes: How cheap is too cheap for stocks? That will 
depend on what happens with interest rates, inflation and earnings over the 
next few years. The wildly bullish case is that rates stop rising, inflation 
stays low and earnings keep growing -- a combination that almost certainly 
would set the stage for another explosive market rally. 
</P>
<P>
 But many veteran money managers aren't willing to bet the ranch on that 
scenario. Instead, they say, the smarter strategy today is to accept that the 
market is in a very cautious mode -- if not in an outright bear phase -- and 
invest with the tide instead of against it. 
</P>
<P>
 How to do that? One major change, say some pros, is that the risk in chasing 
the few remaining "hot" stocks (typically high P-E issues) now far outweighs 
the potential reward. In a market where P-Es are compressing across the board, 
the highest P-E stocks are naturally the most vulnerable to any bad news. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, "you don't want to buy the stocks that are at their highs, because 
they're probably the next things to correct," argues Dan Miller, manager of the 
Putnam New Opportunities stock mutual fund in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Case in point: Health maintenance organization Mid Atlantic Medical Services 
plummeted from $49.50 to a low of $36.875 last week when one analyst suggested 
that the firm's quarterly earnings hinted at weaker growth ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 At its peak price of $56.625 in June, Mid Atlantic was priced at 39 times its 
most recent 12 months' earnings per share. Now, with the stock's price at 
$41.375, its P-E is a far less stratospheric 22. 
</P>
<P>
 For much of the 1991-93 period, "momentum" investing ruled the day. Money 
chased the high-flying stocks, and bargain hunting was considered a losing 
proposition. You stayed with the stocks that were going up -- no matter how 
overpriced they got -- and ignored those that went down. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the savvy investor will take the opposite approach, Miller and others 
contend. Look for companies whose stocks have been slammed, yet whose long-term 
outlook remains healthy and whose P-Es are reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our strategy is to buy what's down and where we have the greatest confidence 
in the outlook," Miller says. 
</P>
<P>
 One example, he says, is LDDS Communications, a fast-growing provider of 
long-distance phone services. The stock has been cut down with other telecom 
issues this year. At $19 now, LDDS is off 36% from its peak of $29.50. Its P-E, 
based on 1994 estimated earnings, has tumbled from 28 to 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, nothing says that a stock that's down 40% can't fall another 40%. 
But if you're investing in high-quality issues for the long haul, your odds of 
success naturally increase if you buy into declines rather than into manias. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have decent (stock) stories that are down 30% to 40%, somebody's 
going to make a lot of money" when the market eventually turns, argues AIM's 
Schoolar. "The only way I know to deal with selloffs is to buy them." 
</P>
<P>
 Klassen, whose Vista Growth & Income fund has been nibbling at such 
beaten-down issues as PepsiCo (at $30.125, it's down 29% from its 52-week 
high), notes that bargain hunting in a bear market makes perfect sense. Yet it 
remains a hard sell for the many portfolio managers who have been momentum 
players since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people have learned to chase a stock when it's breaking out" on a 
chart, Klassen says. Those investors are wholly unprepared to deal with a 
market where most stocks are breaking down instead of out. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the momentum players' reluctance to buy bargains means they're probably 
leaving plenty of money on the table in those stocks, Klassen says. That's 
found money for fundamental investors who can afford to be patient. Earnings: 
Still on Track 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever ails the stock market, it isn't corporate earnings: Strong 
second-quarter profit reports are bolstering analysts' expectations that 
earnings will continue to rise into 1995, albeit at a slowing pace. Annual 
percent change in operating earnings for the Standard & Poor's index of 500 
major corporations:

<P>
 1995 (estimates): 13.5%

 Even though corporate earnings continue to grow at many companies, the prices 
investors are willing to pay for stocks are coming down relative to earnings 
per share (EPS). Here's a look at price-to-earnings ratios (P-Es) at two points

TURN HER GARMENT MANUFACTURING FIRM INTO A POWERHOUSE -- AND CREATE HUNDREDS OF 
JOBS IN LOS ANGELES.

 Clothing designer Clotee McAfee can barely contain her excitement as she 
describes a pocket-making machine she will install in the new, fully automated 
garment plant she plans to move into by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can set a pocket in three seconds," McAfee said. "Right now, with a single 
needle, it takes three minutes" for one of the 25 sewing machine operators she 
employs to make a pocket and sew it onto a shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 McAfee, a graduate of the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York, is the 
owner of Deljah (pronounced "deal-yah") Simone Inc., a small garment 
manufacturing plant just south of downtown Los Angeles that she started with 
$1,500 after the 1992 Los Angeles riots. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with the help of $730,000 in loans and grants from RLA's Community 
Lending Corp. and the federal Health and Human Services Department -- in 
addition to a $500,000 contract with the Southern California Gas Co. -- McAfee 
is embarking on an 18-month project to transform her company into an automated 
powerhouse 30 times its current size. 
</P>
<P>
 The new factory -- a site has yet to be chosen -- will feature a 
half-million-dollar manufacturing system and a computerized clothing design 
studio and will employ as many as 800 people. 
</P>
<P>
 That's an ambitious plan for a company that recorded less than $300,000 in 
sales last year and now has only 2,000 square feet of production space in its 
factory on East 15th Street, west of Alameda Street. With about 20 sewing 
machines lined up in neat rows, Deljah Simone (named after McAfee's 10-year-old 
daughter) looks more like a tiny schoolhouse than a factory. 
</P>
<P>
 But McAfee, 40, is used to thinking big. She has sewn clothes for such top 
fashion designers as Carole Little and ABS, and has designed lines of clothing 
under her own label, Clotee. 
</P>
<P>
 After the riots, McAfee was inspired to build a business that would create 
opportunities for people she calls "troubled kids." She dreamed of building a 
garment factory full of modern equipment that would capture their imaginations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The automation is essential," she said. "I don't think kids will come into 
just a factory. Kids are fascinated by computers. They love to design on 
computers and move through that world. 
</P>
<P>
 "The environment has to say 'upward mobility,' not 'dead end.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Through a program at her church, McAfee enlisted the help of the Gas Co., 
which saw in her the potential to become one of its regular suppliers. The Gas 
Co. helped her apply for the RLA loan and federal grant -- seed money so she 
could upgrade her capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the Gas Co. awarded McAfee a $500,000 contract to sew its uniforms, 
guaranteeing Deljah Simone a steady source of income and a reference that shows 
the company can compete in the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Wiersma, the Gas Co.'s community involvement manager, said the utility 
decided to back McAfee because her business plan "made a lot of sense." 
</P>
<P>
 McAfee hopes to install enough computerized equipment to hire 480 sewing 
operators and a cadre of designers and other workers, bringing total employment 
as high as 800. McAfee hopes the jobs can lead to careers in clothing design 
and product development. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Economic Development Corp. of Los Angeles 
County, said apparel manufacturers here cannot continue to depend on the low 
labor costs that helped build this city's $8-billion garment industry. Instead, 
they must automate to improve efficiency and preserve apparel jobs in 
California that are quickly moving overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 The mainstay of McAfee's automated factory will be a $500,000 production 
control system that loops around the factory floor carrying pieces clothing to 
66 sewing machine operators along the conveyor until a completed shirt or pair 
of pants emerges at the end of the production line. Each workstation is 
equipped with a computer that keeps track of the amount of work the operators 
do. 
</P>
<P>
 The system will allow Deljah Simone to increase production fivefold, McAfee 
said. Not only do the automated machines work faster than the current 
equipment, but because the system is designed for mass production, McAfee can 
add a second shift. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will finish a product in the time it takes you to walk from where the line 
starts to where it finishes," McAfee said.  
</P>
<P>
 The factory will also have the automatic pocket setter, as well as machines 
that will spread out the fabric and cut it according to patterns, press the 
finished products and sew buttons and button holes at the same time, plus a 
"really awesome" machine that bags clothing to be shipped, McAfee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Altogether, McAfee's business plan calls for spending almost $1.5 million on 
equipment to set up the factory. By the end of 1995, she hopes to have two more 
sets of the production system equipment and a $41,000 computerized clothing 
design system. That will bring the total to $5 million worth of automated 
manufacturing equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 And that means she needs more long-term contracts to guarantee steady income. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Gas Co. contract in hand, McAfee is soliciting major department 
stores and clothing manufacturers with a history of community involvement, 
seeking similar deals to sew mass-produced garments and private label 
merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiersma said that strategy has worked for other small companies the Gas Co. 
has backed. Some of them have parlayed their contract with the Gas Co. into 
deals with giants such as American Honda and Rockwell International. 
</P>
<P>
 McAfee says it would have been tough to create this type of automated factory 
without the help of RLA and the Gas Co. 
</P>
<P>
 When she talks to loan officers at local banks about financing her automation, 
they "cut me off before I can even get started," McAfee said. "It's been very 
difficult getting people to buy into the vision." 
</P>
<P>
 But Al Osborne, director of UCLA's Entrepreneurial Studies Center at the John 
Anderson Graduate School of Management, believes McAfee is on the right track. 
Osborne helped her develop a business plan for Deljah Simone, and he said only 
efficient, automated firms will be able to compete for the manufacturing 
contracts McAfee needs to meet her job-creating goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her plans may appear ambitious due to the size of her company, but it's clear 
she needs to think that way and get those technologies adopted and introduced," 
Osborne said. "Otherwise she won't survive."

A TURN IN THE SPOTLIGHT FOR WELLS' HAZEN; BANKS: THE INCOMING CHIEF HAS BEEN A 
QUIET PLAYER, BEHIND GREGARIOUS CARL REICHARDT. SO FAR, HE'S NOT TELLING HIS 
PLANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS and JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ever since they worked as senior managers at Union Bank in the 1960s, Paul 
Hazen has toiled in the long shadow of Carl Reichardt. 
</P>
<P>
 When the gregarious Reichardt moved to Wells Fargo & Co. in 1970 to head up a 
now-defunct real estate subsidiary, the bookish Hazen soon joined him as vice 
president. As Reichardt moved up the corporate ladder and eventually became the 
financial's institution's top executive in 1983, Hazen always stepped up to the 
rung right below him. 
</P>
<P>
 While Reichardt received most of the credit for Wells Fargo's savvy purchase 
of Crocker National Bank in 1986, he freely admitted that it was Hazen who 
quietly pulled the $1-billion deal together. And when San Francisco-based Wells 
pulled out of a financial nose-dive a few years ago, no one paid much attention 
but Hazen was in the co-pilot's seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it's Hazen's turn to take the controls. Reichardt announced last week that 
he is retiring early and Hazen, 52, will assume the job of chairman and chief 
executive of the state's third-largest bank by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Wall Street analysts -- and even some of the bank's managers -- say they 
know virtually nothing about Hazen, thanks to Reichardt's dominant persona and 
Hazen's low-key style. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a quart low on the charisma," one Wells insider said of Hazen. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hazen's friends and close associates say that he's a man of uncommon savvy 
and grit who has already shown skill in guiding Wells Fargo in new, profitable 
directions, and one who won't flinch at firing senior and lower-level employees 
if profit growth begins to slow. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paul is different, he is quieter," said Lou Burnett, who worked with both men 
for 20 years and is now managing partner of Secura/Burnett, a financial 
services firm in San Francisco. "But nothing is missed by him. Paul is a very 
serious person when it comes to business. "Each can finish the other's 
sentences, but they are still independent thinkers." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the question everyone is asking is how Hazen will lead Wells Fargo on 
his own, particularly at a time when the economy in California -- Wells Fargo's 
primary market -- is still having serious problems. Hazen is keeping his plans 
quiet until Reichardt formally retires. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paul Hazen is not a caretaker," said Joel P. Friedman, a banking analyst with 
Andersen Consulting in San Francisco. Hazen, he said, "will have his own vision 
and views about where the bank should go." But he added: "We don't know what 
they are." 
</P>
<P>
 "Hazen's got a reputation as being a bright guy and crack manager . . . but 
that's about all we know about him," said Mark Zandi, who follows the bank for 
Regional Financial Associates, a consulting firm in West Chester, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell Chaney, an analyst with Dakin Securities in San Francisco, said it's 
unlikely Hazen will push the bank in "any wild and new direction." But Hazen 
probably will look for new, fee-producing services to generate profits in Wells 
Fargo's branch offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Hazen, the eldest son of a lumber store owner, was born in Michigan but grew 
up in Tucson, where his parents moved when Hazen was a child because the dry 
desert air would be better for young Paul's chronic asthma. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as a teen-ager, Hazen was drawn to business. While his high school 
buddies read Sports Illustrated and Playboy, Hazen also read the Wall Street 
Journal, according to David Giles, a boyhood chum and still one of Hazen's best 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'd even bring (the paper) to class with him," Giles said. 
</P>
<P>
 After getting a bachelor's degree in finance from the University of Arizona, 
Hazen earned a master's in business administration from UC Berkeley in 1964 and 
went to work at Union Bank under Reichardt. 
</P>
<P>
 After Hazen joined Reichardt at Wells Fargo in the early 1970s, they moved up 
the corporate ladder in lock-step, with Hazen succeeding Reichardt as president 
of the holding company and the bank in 1984 after Reichardt was named chairman 
and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Hazen was lucky to be there. In 1983, his two sons and a fellow banker were 
involved in a head-on crash on the Golden Gate Bridge that slammed the engine 
of the car Hazen was driving through the front seat and into the back. 
</P>
<P>
 Hazen suffered serious injuries, and doctors told him that he would probably 
have a bad limp for the rest of his life. But after a series of painful 
surgeries and five years of grueling therapy, the limp is gone and he's well 
enough to jog and play tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 "The crash caused me to be more reflective, and I started to spend more time 
with my family," said Hazen, who has two sons. "In some ways, it made me a 
better manager. I started managing my time at work better, and I learned to 
schedule time with my family." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Hazen and Reichardt were busy converting Wells Fargo, a bank many 
analysts thought had become too flabby, into one where managers who did well 
were amply rewarded and those who didn't were shown the door. 
</P>
<P>
 Once their own bank was in shape, the pair quietly started looking around for 
acquisitions and stunned the banking industry when Wells Fargo bought rival 
Crocker National Corp. from its British owners. Hazen handled negotiations that 
were so secretive that even Crocker's chairman didn't know about the merger 
talks until after the deal was done. 
</P>
<P>
 Hazen and the rest of the brass wasted no time making cuts at Crocker. About 
5,000 people, including 1,600 managers, were quickly fired. Eighty offices were 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later, when Wells became one of the first banks to open on 
Saturdays, Hazen and his management team asked tellers and other employees to 
sign an agreement stating they'd take turns working weekends. The 300 who 
didn't were let go. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone in a business has to work as a team, from the president of the 
company on down," Hazen said in a brief interview last week. 
</P>
<P>
 That "team philosophy" cut both ways. When bad real estate loans and a souring 
economy sent Wells Fargo's profit plunging in 1991, Hazen and Reichardt took 
50% pay cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 A company's management "has to provide real leadership," Hazen said in a brief 
interview last week. "If you ask your people to acknowledge hard times, you 
have to be willing to do the same things that you ask them to do." 
</P>
<P>
 But one thing Hazen promises he won't do is transform himself into another 
Carl Reichardt -- who was often quoted and profiled in the business press -- 
though associates say Hazen shares the same wit and sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Carl's great, and in some ways I'll never be able to replace him," Hazen 
said. "If I don't get the same kind of . . . exposure that he has, that's OK by 
me." Bio: Paul Hazen

FOOTNOTES / JAMES BATES: ONE SIZE DOESN'T FIT ALL

<P>
 The recently published "Executive's Book of Quotations" includes this bit of 
philosophy: "Hey, size works against excellence." 
</P>
<P>
 Who said it? The quote, taken from Tom Peters' book "Liberation Management," 
is attributed to Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates, whose gigantic software company 
a week ago agreed to slim down a few of its practices in settling a 4-year-old 
federal antitrust case. Old What's-His-Name 
</P>
<P>
 Before he was Samuel Goldwyn, the late movie mogul was Samuel Goldfish. After 
he shed the name, someone remarked: "A self-made man may prefer a self-made 
name." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Hollywood seems to have trouble remembering that name, even though 
it belonged to one of its pioneers. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Twentieth Century Fox sent out an announcement that it was hiring 
an executive from the "Samuel Goldman Co." 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, a few months back a purported suitor for the MGM studio expressed 
interest by proclaiming that he might want to buy Metro- Golden- Mayer. Merrill 
Lynch Coin Caper 
</P>
<P>
 As previously reported, revelations that 399 rare coins are mysteriously 
missing from a coin fund Merrill Lynch formed in 1990 with Los Angeles sports 
executive Bruce McNall have triggered a probe by Los Angeles police detectives. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Florida regulators are sniffing around as well, although they don't appear 
to be aiming to find the missing loot. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the state comptroller's office in Florida confirms that 
authorities started an informal probe after getting calls from two investors in 
the troubled fund, one of whom thinks the sales pitch he received 
misrepresented things. 
</P>
<P>
 The spokesman adds that the state has just started its inquiry by requesting 
materials and records. Straight-Shooting Ad 
</P>
<P>
 Who is the mystery man behind the mystery gun? 
</P>
<P>
 A magazine ad in the Robb Report magazine for wealthy investors is soliciting 
the best offer on a pistol allegedly fired by outlaw Frank McLowrey when he 
died in the infamous 1881 gunfight with lawman Wyatt Earp at the O.K. Corral. 
</P>
<P>
 Inquiries to the number reveal only that the owner is a wealthy Beverly Hills 
investor who goes by the alias Lee Howard. To convince people of the gun's 
authenticity, he's including an affidavit signed by McLowrey's late niece, who 
purportedly recovered the gun from a vault where it was placed after her uncle 
died. 
</P>
<P>
 A representative said Howard hopes to get six figures for the gun, adding that 
two recent films that show the gunfight may help spark interest. Briefly . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Truth in labeling: The soundtrack being marketed for the hit film "Speed," 
which includes only a handful of songs actually heard in the film, includes a 
label saying the songs were "inspired" by the movie. . . . Quirky Rhino Records 
in Santa Monica has been hired to consult fast-food chain Fatburger on its 
jukebox music.

Q & A: ACQUISITIONS, MERGERS ON FRONT BURNER; DEALS: MOVEMENT IS REMINISCENT OF 
HEADY DAYS IN 1980S. BUT AN ORANGE COUNTY EXPERT SAYS THERE'S A DIFFERENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 FHP International Corp. in Fountain Valley acquired a competing Northern 
California health maintenance organization last month in a deal worth $1.1 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Two months ago, the 413-bed Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical 
Center agreed to sell out to a Tennessee hospital operator. 
</P>
<P>
 And Fidelity National Financial Inc. in Irvine, the nation's fifth-largest 
title insurance company, is attempting to take over US Facilities Corp., a 
Costa Mesa medical stop-loss insurance firm, in what is for Orange County a 
rare hostile bid. 
</P>
<P>
 The buyers are part of the resurgence in mergers and acquisitions that has 
spread across the nation in the past year. Flush with cash -- capital -- raised 
from Wall Street and private investors, businesses are buying in a way 
reminiscent of the binge of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 With that resurgence comes more business for the companies that put together 
the deals. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those companies, Eureka Capital Markets Group in Newport Beach, was 
started three years ago by veteran merger-and-acquisition executive Arthur D. 
Perrone to work mostly with privately held firms. He was vice chairman of 
Geneva Cos. in Irvine, once the nation's leading catalyst for mergers and 
acquisitions among small and mid-size companies. 
</P>
<P>
 While the growing number of M&A deals reminds some of the frenetic pace of the 
1980s, Perrone says that things aren't the same now. That is especially true, 
he said, for the privately held small and middle market companies -- those with 
$5 million to $100 million in annual sales -- that proliferate in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: How do the mergers and acquisitions of today differ from those of 
the 1980s? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: I think the difference today is that there's a better focus on how 
capital is being invested. A lot of the deals in the 1980s were done with less 
equity and more debt, and they were driven by economics. We had a large number 
of economic buyers then, people who were buying businesses based solely upon 
the economic returns they could realize by selling off parts of the companies 
they bought or otherwise capitalizing on the values. And I think we also paid 
the price for that high leverage, the debt, used to finance the deals. In 
addition, I think that, when we had that amount of money coming in chasing too 
few deals, prices went up. Buyers were paying premium prices. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What are we seeing now? 
</P>
<P>
 A. What happened was that mergers and acquisitions fell off about 1989 to '90, 
and what we are starting to see now is a resurgence of capital coming in. But 
the focus is more synergistic, companies looking to add value to their 
products. The economic buyers of the 1980s that survived have put their 
investments into industry classifications and now are becoming the synergistic 
buyers in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Where is the money coming from? 
</P>
<P>
 A. I'm going to define capital as private equity capital that basically comes 
from partnerships, from pension funds, both public and corporate, from 
insurance companies, from endowment funds, from banks and financial 
institutions and from individuals and families. They put their money in private 
capital funds that go out and buy or invest in businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. How much capital is being raised for mergers and acquisitions? 
</P>
<P>
 A. For the first six months this year, about $8 billion was invested in these 
funds altogether, compared with nearly $5 billion for the first six months last 
year. Now, of the total amount raised each year, almost $6 billion went into 
acquisitions of companies the first half of this year, compared with only $2 
billion for the same period last year. Just to give you an idea of what really 
went on in the 1980s and early 1990s, the amount of private equity capital 
raised last year was about $13 billion, compared to $10 billion in 1992, $7 
billion in 1991, $6 billion in '90 and almost $15 billion in 1989, $13 billion 
in 1988 and $18 billion in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Is there anything different about who the investors are these days? 
</P>
<P>
 A. The bulk of it is coming from public pension funds and corporate pension 
funds. What we are seeing, though, is that the money is now starting to come in 
from individuals and family endowments. During the 1980s, a lot of wealth was 
created for individuals and the family endowments. They put their money in the 
stock market in the late '80s and early '90s because the stock market was going 
crazy. People talk about not having any inflation in the last four or five 
years, but that's not true. Inflation has been with financial instruments. If 
you owned stock six years ago, you made a lot of money today. Now what's 
happening, with returns in the public market being suspect, is that the money's 
coming back into the private market. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Are banks still shying away from financing M&A deals? 
</P>
<P>
 A. No. Personally, I think the banks got out of the lending business for two 
or three years there. They had a lot of problems with loans, the government was 
looking over their shoulders, and basically they stopped lending money. That 
created an opportunity for a company like ours to raise debt and equity funds 
for a lot of small and medium-size businesses. But the banks are coming back 
now. Their earnings are better. They've cleared up the loan problems. They now 
are becoming more aggressive, and they're making more capital available for 
acquisitions. There's more competition. We've seen that in the last three to 
four months. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. How are the buyers changing from the 1980s? 
</P>
<P>
 A. The corporations cleaned up their balance sheets, restructured their 
operations, improved their earnings. Now they are really going back to basics. 
They're divesting themselves of divisions that don't fit their core business -- 
you have (hospital supplier) Baxter International that's now talking about a 
half-dozen divisions that it's spinning off -- and they are looking more toward 
vertical integration -- "Tend to our knitting." A corporate buyer is going to 
look for an add-on product or technology. They're not usually buying it for the 
management team. Private investment groups are looking for $10 million to $20 
million in sales, profitability and good management that will remain. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Is anyone else looking for good deals? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Now you've got a third element that's just starting to make a play again. 
With the lower value of the U.S. dollar, we're seeing foreign buyers once 
again. For about the last six months, we've seen heavy groups of United Kingdom 
and Swiss buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What's the profile of a target company? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Companies with sales of $10 million and above, usually with pretax earnings 
of $1.5-million-plus, and some growth to the industry. Now when they fit in 
particular industries the buyers are in, they are more attractive. For 
instance, we're involved with a large company that makes ceiling fans and does 
about $70 million in sales. They manufacture offshore about 110 different types 
of fans. There's a lot of interest from buyers in adding on consumer products. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What's the main reason owners of private companies want to sell? 
</P>
<P>
 A. When we analyze surveys of probably thousands of business owners over the 
last 12 years, we keep coming back to the number one reason: burnout and 
boredom. The average entrepreneur owning a business on the order of between 12 
and 17 years, somewhere between the age of 52 and 65, they get to a point where 
it doesn't hold the same romance for them. The second reason would be financial 
considerations. The third may be health. Burnout is still an overriding factor. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. So will we end up with another M&A feeding frenzy? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Well, we're seeing prices going up, we're seeing money come in, we're 
seeing people looking for deals. It's a wonderful business to be in again. I 
think that there may be some lessons learned from the '80s. One is that 
leverage can be a real double-edged sword. So there is more equity being 
required now. There's more buying for the right reasons, more synergism. I feel 
there is more discipline and more thoughtfulness for the marketplace today than 
what we saw in the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Fidelity National has a unfriendly bid pending for US Facilities. Will 
there be a resurgence of hostile attempts? 
</P>
<P>
 A. I haven't seen that, at least nothing close to what it was in the 1980s. I 
think it's too costly. Also, companies don't want to risk an image problem in 
getting involved with that. Maybe we're a gentler, kinder group. I think the 
times are different. You can just sense that there is more of a professional 
purpose driving mergers and acquisitions today. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. How long is this M&A market likely to continue? 
</P>
<P>
 A. I think it'll continue as long as the money stays available, as long as 
corporate earnings hold up, as long as there's renewed optimism in the economy. 
And I see it for a couple of years at a minimum. Funds Raised 
</P>

wealthy individuals rose 63% in the first six months this year from the same 
period of 1993. The amount raised and where it went, in millions:

 Minorities make up a quarter of the U.S. population, but they own only about 
3% of the nation's franchised restaurants, stores and service outlets, an 
imbalance the Commerce Department wants to correct. Toward that end, the 
department's Minority Business Development Agency on Thursday will host in San 
Diego another in its ongoing series of free franchising seminars.The seminars 
are held around the country and seek to teach minorities the dos and don'ts of 
franchising. They also provide a meeting ground where business people can meet 
franchiser representatives. MBDA acting director Gil Colon said the 100 
seminars that have been held over the past two years have led directly to 45 
franchise deals for minorities. The upcoming meeting, titled "Buying a 
Franchise," will be held at the Hilton Hotel in San Diego's Mission Valley 
starting at 6 p.m.

 When National Medical Enterprises reports its fourth-quarter financial results 
Thursday, it will also disclose the cost of its recently announced 
restructuring. The Santa Monica-based hospital company is dismissing 200 
employees and eliminating another 40 unfilled jobs as part of a cost-reduction 
program that will slash expenses by $32 million a year.One item that escaped 
the cost cutting: National Medical's spiffy 12-passenger Gulfstream IV 
corporate jet, which sells for more than $25 million. However, the company did 
decide to sell its other corporate aircraft, an older, smaller Falcon 50. NME 
spokeswoman Diana Takvam said the Gulfstream came in handy for shuttling 
company lawyers from Santa Monica to Washington during negotiations with the 
Justice Department. The talks led to a $379-million fraud settlement of charges 
of wrongdoing at NME's psychiatric and substance abuse hospitals. Also, NME 
"has some operations in remote locations that are difficult to get to via 
commercial aircraft," including hospitals in Australia, Malaysia and Spain, 
Takvam said.

 Boston Chicken, which set a Wall Street record when its stock began trading in 
late 1993, makes its Southern California debut today with a franchised store on 
Brookhurst Street in Fountain Valley.The unit will be operated by Anaheim-based 
CKE Restaurants Inc., which also owns the Carl's Jr. chain. Boston Chicken, 
which sells rotisserie chicken and side dishes, faces intense competition as it 
expands into Southern California. For example, El Pollo Loco, Kentucky Fried 
Chicken and Kenny Rogers Roasters are selling roasted chicken at stores within 
a few blocks of the new Boston Chicken location. CKE Restaurants plans to open 
as many as 300 Boston Chicken outlets in Southern California and Sacramento in 
coming years.

 California will wind up its huge short-term borrowing program Wednesday, when 
it sells $3 billion in 11-month revenue anticipation notes, or RANs.Last 
Wednesday the state sold $4 billion in 21-month securities. The RANs are 
expected to yield 4% to 4.2%, free of state and federal income tax. Brokers 
report strong pre-offering demand from individual investors. The U.S. Treasury 
will also be a big borrower this week: It will sell $17.25 billion in two-year 
notes Tuesday and $11 billion in five-year notes Wednesday.

 The California Assn. of Realtors is scheduled to release figures today for 
June sales, and the report should provide one of the first solid indicators of 
how rising mortgage rates have affected Southern California's key housing 
industry.Rates on 30-year loans have jumped to about 8.5% from 7% in February, 
adding nearly $150 to the monthly cost of a $150,000 fixed-rate loan. Sales in 
Southern California rose in the spring as "fence sitters" finally decided to 
buy before rates went higher. But the rush slowed as rates kept climbing. The 
June figures should show whether buyers are staying on the sidelines or have 
shaken off their rate hike fears and jumped back into the market.

 Mazda Recalls Some RX-7s: The auto maker announced the action on 12,316 of the 
1993 and 1994 model sports cars to inspect and, if necessary, to replace parts 
in the cooling system.Mazda Motor Corp. inspectors found that the radiator cap 
and pressure valve can fail on some of the vehicles because of heat stress. The 
defect could cause the coolant to boil and spray if the engine is shut off 
after high-speed operation, Mazda said. After repeated instances, the problem 
could damage coolant hoses or cause engine fire. Mazda said owners will be 
notified by mail to bring their cars in for free inspection and repair.

 Bilzerian Loses Appeal in SEC Case: The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District 
of Columbia denied the request by Paul Bilzerian to throw out an order to repay 
illegal profits and interest arising from a pair of takeover attempts in the 
1980s. The former chairman of the Singer Co. was convicted of securities fraud 
and ordered to pay $75 million to the Securities and Exchange 
Commission.Bilzerian and his riches were the focus of a CBS "60 Minutes" 
segment last year. He served 20 months in prison for securities fraud and is 
now in personal bankruptcy proceedings. A lower court had ruled in favor of the 
SEC in February, 1993, requiring Bilzerian to give up $33.1 million in illegal 
profits plus interest, a total of $42 million.

 Financier's Daughter Sues: Tracy Posner Ward, daughter of Miami Beach 
financier Victor Posner, has sued her brother and a New York lawyer, alleging 
that they let a $2-million trust in her name dwindle to $100,000, the Miami 
Herald reported. The lawsuit says she learned of the trust only last year, 31 
years after it was established for her benefit.The suit alleges that Steven 
Posner and Martin Rosen "did the bidding of Victor Posner," allowing the 
trust's assets to be used for undocumented loans and other transactions for 
which the trust received little or no value. Victor Posner, 75, stepped down 
last year as chairman of DWG Corp., owner of Arby's Inc. and Royal Crown Cola 
Co., and sold his controlling stake in the company, now named Triarc Cos.

BRAZIL PACT LATEST CLINTON SUCCESS FOR U.S. FIRMS ABROAD; INDUSTRY: WHITE HOUSE 
LOBBYING HELPED MISSILE BUILDER WIN A $1-BILLION RAIN FOREST PROJECT.

 Brazil's selection of defense giant Raytheon Co. to build a $1-billion 
environmental surveillance system for the Amazon rain forest is being hailed as 
another victory for the Clinton Administration and a model of U.S. 
defense-conversion efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Raytheon's system will combine satellite imagery, ground sensors and air 
traffic control radar to help the Brazilian government monitor the vast Amazon 
Basin -- an area half the size of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The system, which is expected to be operational by the end of the decade, is 
designed to provide early evidence of deforestation, wildlife destruction, 
illegal mining and drug trafficking, Raytheon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Raytheon, a Lexington, Mass.-based concern perhaps best known for building the 
Patriot missiles used in the Persian Gulf War, is the latest U.S. company to 
secure a big foreign contract with the help of lobbying by senior White House 
officials, including the President. 
</P>
<P>
 The award last week came only weeks after Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown 
had led a group of two dozen U.S. business executives on a trip to South 
America in an effort to drum up sales. Clinton followed their visit with a 
letter to the Brazilian government, urging them to choose Raytheon over 
Thomson-CSF of France. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once again, it demonstrates the seriousness of purpose we have in standing 
shoulder to shoulder with American business and protecting the commercial 
interests of the United States," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp. were chosen by Saudi 
Arabia to divide a $6-billion order for new jetliners, and the Saudis later 
chose AT&T Corp. to build a $4-billion telecommunications system. 
</P>
<P>
 The Amazon contract also becomes the largest non-military project for 
Raytheon, which has been trying to lessen its reliance on shrinking Pentagon 
spending. Raytheon already operates a variety of commercial lines, including 
Amana refrigerators and Speed Queen washing machines. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis J. Picard, Raytheon's chairman and chief executive, said the Brazilian 
award "represents a major expansion of the company's capabilities into 
commercial and international business -- converting defense know-how and jobs 
to commercial and environmental requirements." 
</P>
<P>
 Raytheon's common stock climbed 62.5 cents to $63.75 a share in New York Stock 
Exchange composite trading Friday.

HOT JOBS: NURSE DELIVERS CARE TO MOTHERS AND NEWBORNS

 Putting a newborn baby in its mother's arms is what Debra Giannini likes most 
about her job as a licensed vocational nurse. "That just makes my day," said 
Giannini, who works at Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian in Newport Beach. 
"You never get tired of seeing a new mother's eyes light up." 
</P>
<P>
 LVNs assist in the care of patients in hospitals and nursing homes. Under the 
supervision of physicians and registered nurses, they administer injections, 
give medications and monitor intravenous fluids. They also instruct patients in 
self-care at home after they are released from the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Giannini, 39, began her LVN career in 1977 at Hoag. She works in the maternity 
ward, taking care of new mothers and tending to infants in the nursery. 
"There's a lot to do, because these days, mothers don't stay in the hospital 
very long after delivery. Most go home within 12 to 24 hours," said Giannini. 
</P>
<P>
 Her day usually starts by checking with the head nurse to see which patients 
will be hers. She then teams with a registered nurse, who organizes a plan for 
each patient's care. Giannini listens to a taped report on each patient's 
progress before dropping by for a visit. Then she checks vital signs and 
administers any medications ordered by a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 She also instructs mothers in how to bathe, feed and care for their babies. 
"We try to include the whole family in this," Giannini said. "Usually, the 
daddies and siblings are there too." 
</P>
<P>
 Giannini has up to four mothers and four babies assigned to her during a 
shift. While some are being discharged, mothers who have just given birth 
arrive and are placed under her care. "Everyone is at a different point in her 
recovery, and sometimes there is a lot to do to get them ready to go home," 
Giannini said. "We get new patients at all hours, day and night." OCCUPATION: 
Licensed vocational nurse 
</P>
<P>
 * What's involved: Caring for patients in hospitals and retirement homes, 
usually as part of a health-care team that includes registered nurses and 
doctors who plan and direct patient-care procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 * Qualifications: Two to three years of training in both classroom and 
clinical settings. State board examination required after training. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: By 1998, the number of LVNs in Orange County is projected to 
increase by 10.2%, to 4,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * Salary range: $11-$17 per hour, depending on experience. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pros: Most are allowed to work flexible hours, including part-time 
arrangements, which makes it easier to work and raise a family. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cons: They often work on holidays and weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 * Advancement: Some become community health-care educators. Others return to 
school to complete additional training and testing required to become a 
registered nurse. 
</P>
<P>
 * Quote: "Each of us plays an important role here. My favorite assignment is 
the special-care nursery for premature or sick infants." -- Debra Giannini, 
licensed vocational nurse, Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian

SQUEEZED INTO AN ORBIT BETWEEN RUSSIA'S RIMSAT AND JAPAN'S SAKURA 3A.

 A Chinese satellite intended for use by many well-known broadcasters has been 
launched in defiance of international rules into an orbit where it will disrupt 
Japanese telecommunications, government officials here have charged. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll immediately take appropriate measures if China switches on the 
satellite transponders and causes transmission interference with our 
satellite," an official of Japan's Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, 
who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters news agency Friday. He did 
not specify what Japan's action would be. 
</P>
<P>
 Reuters Television is one of the clients scheduled to use the Chinese Apstar-1 
satellite, launched Thursday into an orbit squeezed between a Japanese and a 
Russian satellite. The new satellite is expected to start transmissions in 
about a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Other broadcasters that have been expected to use Apstar-1 include CNN, ESPN, 
Home Box Office Asia, Viacom International, Discovery Communications, TVB 
International and Hong Kong's Television Broadcasts Ltd. Some have made back-up 
plans, however. 
</P>
<P>
 The increasingly bitter Tokyo-Beijing dispute heightens the possibility that 
more broadcasters will turn to using a privately owned satellite, called the 
PAS-2, that was built by Hughes Aircraft Co. for PanAmSat Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The PAS-2 was launched by France's Arianespace July 8 from French Guiana to an 
orbit positioned to serve the Asia-Pacific region. PanAmSat is controlled by 
founder Rene V. Anselmo and the Mexican firm Grupo Televiso. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Chinese satellite is positioned close to a Japanese satellite known as 
Sakura 3a that handles much of the international telecommunications and other 
services of Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp. Earlier this month, an NTT 
spokesman said problems could be prevented by a minor shift in the planned 
orbit of the Chinese satellite. 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo has been pressing Beijing for more than a year to either alter the 
satellite's planned orbit or agree not to use bandwidths employed by the Sakura 
3a. Japan sent a delegation to Beijing to seek a solution to the problem, but 
it met with no success, the ministry official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan charges that China is violating rules established by the International 
Telecommunications Union, a 182-country, United Nations-affiliated body that 
supervises the global use of satellite positions and broadcast frequencies. The 
union lacks effective enforcement powers, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts fear that if China flouts global rules, there could be a 
destructive and expensive breakdown of international order in satellite 
transmissions. China is aggressively seeking to promote its satellite-launch 
services as an inexpensive alternative to Western competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Apstar-1 is owned by APT Satellite Co. of Hong Kong, a Beijing-controlled 
consortium that includes three Chinese government bodies, Singapore Telecom and 
companies backed by investors from Thailand, Macao and Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's Sakura 3a is in an orbit that positions it constantly at a longitude 
of 132 degrees east, while Russia's Rimsat orbits at 130 east. China said it 
was placing the Apstar-1 between these two satellites, at 131 degrees east. 
Tokyo insists that that is too close to avoid interference. "Because Japan had 
placed its satellite earlier than China, the international rules oblige China 
to secure consent from us, but there has been no action whatsoever from China," 
the ministry official said. 
</P>
<P>
 As controversy over the planned Chinese launch heated up earlier this month, 
an APT Satellite spokesman in Hong Kong insisted that Japan had no basis for 
concern. The company, he said, was working out "a technical solution to 
minimize the effect if interference should occur."

 Rice Deal Made With Los Angeles Firm: American Rice, a subsidiary of Los 
Angeles-based Erly Industries, has formed a joint venture with the Vietnamese 
ministry of agriculture to upgrade and operate a rice-processing plant south of 
Ho Chi Minh City that will have a production capacity of about 300,000 tons a 
year. The arrangement is part of a rice production and distribution contract 
under which American Rice has already shipped about 60,000 tons to markets in 
the United States, the Middle East and Brazil, said Gerald D. Murphy, Erly's 
chairman and president. Rice is Vietnam's second-biggest export, behind oil, 
and the country -- which had to import rice until 1989 -- is now the world's 
third-largest exporter, after Thailand and the United States.

 GATT Grants Observer Status: The world trade watchdog has granted observer 
status to Vietnam in a signal of recognition of the advances the once rigidly 
communist state has made toward an open economy. A spokesman said the 
Vietnamese application, presented to a meeting of the ruling council of the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, was widely welcomed by delegations from 
the organization's 123 member countries, which includes the United States. 
Vietnam's ambassador in Geneva, Nguyen Luong, told the council that his country 
would eventually like to become a full member, according to the GATT spokesman.

 Orders for Export Goods Rise: The increase was 10.8% on the year in June, as 
the yen's appreciation against the new Taiwan dollar made the island's products 
more attractive to Japanese buyers, the government said. Taiwan companies 
received $7.75 billion in export orders in June, the Ministry of Economic 
Affairs said. Japan's export orders to Taiwan companies increased 22.3% on the 
year last month to $931 million, the ministry said.

ANN CONWAY: CENTER BOOSTERS CAN'T MASK THEIR ENTHUSIASM FOR 'PHANTOM'

 Sure, they saw it in London , New York and L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 But Henry and Renee Segerstrom pronounced the Costa Mesa production of "The 
Phantom of the Opera" -- which formally opened on Saturday night at Segerstrom 
Hall -- "the greatest thrill of them all." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was more exciting here than anywhere else," said Henry Segerstrom -- 
managing partner of C.J. Segerstrom & Sons (owners of South Coast Plaza) -- as 
he mingled with the 470-strong crush attending the post-performance gala in the 
back lot of the Orange County Performing Arts Center. "It's the culmination of 
a dream. We've been waiting for this musical for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Not since its fifth anniversary in 1991 has the center seen such a social 
splash. Besides the Segerstroms, performing arts movers such as Thomas Nielsen, 
William Lyon, Timothy Strader, Carol Wilken and Al Baldwin swept along a red 
carpet through a swirl of fog as they entered "The Phantom Gala," a $200 
per-person black-tie fest that included a buffet supper and dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 Amazing what you can do with a parking lot. Acres of shimmering black Astro 
Turf disguised the black-top. Tables skirted in jewel-tone cloths and topped 
with rose petals and candelabra stood where staff automobiles are usually 
parked. A rainbow of spotlights made guests feel like they were on stage. (Only 
one glitch: The yellow lights had guests looking like they had hepatitis. Smart 
party-goers stepped into the rose-colored spots.) 
</P>
<P>
 Champagne and mineral water were proffered on silver trays by 
"Phantom"-attired attendants. The Barry Cole Orchestra played selections from 
"Phantom" and dance classics. 
</P>
<P>
 And everywhere guests looked they saw food -- Chinese food (seafood 
pot-stickers with lemon sauce and Peking duck crepes were huge hits); seafood 
(crab cakes with sauce tarragon, seafood tacos with papaya salsa) and enough 
sweets to keep them dancing for months (truffles, tuxedo strawberries, swan 
puffs, mascarpone tartlettes. Not to mention the white chocolate "Phantom" 
masks that graced table settings.) 
</P>
<P>
 Guests were disappointed that the production's stars -- Grant Norman and 
Adrienne McEwan -- were unable to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Segerstroms were happy for the chance to chat with Sylvia Rhyne, who 
also plays the role of Christine. (The soft-spoken soprano -- who would perform 
the following day -- attended the late-evening event without a wrap. "I don't 
feel any draft," she said. "It's balmy tonight. The only thing I have to worry 
about are stiff, cool breezes across my neck.") 
</P>
<P>
 Playing the role of Christine is at once thrilling and frightening, she said. 
"It is so precious to be able to express myself this way. I adore singing 
'Wishing,' the song Christine sings at her father's grave. I know how it 
touches people who have lost someone." 
</P>
<P>
 But it gets scary up there. "There are many physical moments where I have to 
be very careful," Rhyne said. "We do some very dangerous things -- climbing up 
and down ladders to get to the bridge, for example. And it's a moving bridge. 
Once, my costume broke and there were beads all over the bridge surface. It was 
quite frightening." 
</P>
<P>
 People enjoy asking Rhyne about the complex relationship that the Phantom 
shares with his would-be bride, Christine. "That's really up to everybody to 
decide for themselves," she said. But she has her theories: "Christine's heart 
really breaks for the Phantom . . . she is very torn over him. She loves him 
deeply because he has touched her deeply, opened her up to her gift of singing. 
</P>
<P>
 "But she knows she can't be with him. . . .He has a very deranged and evil 
side. At the end, she sings: 'This haunted face holds no sorrow for me now; 
it's in your soul that the true distortion lies.' He goes crazy, hurts people. 
She cannot bear that." 
</P>
<P>
 Standing on the sidelines, making sure guests were comfortable, was gala 
chairwoman Shari Esayian and her husband, Harry. "There were so many wonderful 
themes we could have captured for tonight," she said. "At first, I wanted 
everybody to slide down a chute into the party, descend into the Phantom's 
lair. But insurance companies do not look on things like that very kindly." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, she went for sophistication, created an ambience that was more sedate 
than 'phantom-asmagoric.' Center chairman Thomas Nielsen pronounced it "just 
right." 
</P>
<P>
 Gala patrons, who attended a pre-performance reception in the Center Room, 
included Susie Bollman Field and Gary Levine, Mark Johnson, Sheila and Ygal 
Sonenshine, Joyce and Tom Tucker and Rick and Nancy Muth.

 Guilds celebrate 15th anniversary: Members of the Guilds of the Center, a 
center support group of more than 2,500 men and women, met at Diva restaurant 
on Friday to celebrate the Guilds' 15th anniversary before they attended a 
special performance of "The Phantom of the Opera." Since the Guilds were 
founded 15 years ago, members have raised $6 million on behalf of the center's 
operating costs. Among guests were Guilds' founder Georgia Spooner, center 
chairman Thomas Nielsen, center president and new guild chairwoman Susan 
Feldman.

JACK SMITH: AHHHH -- SUMMER, BASEBALL, FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Not all teen-age boys are out on the streets defiling garage doors, robbing 
markets and shooting one another. Some of them are expending their energies on 
the great American pastime of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 My wife and I drove out to Santa Monica High School the other day to watch our 
grandson Casey in a game between Samohi and the Brentwood Eagles Baseball Club. 
It was a summer school game played mostly for practice and coaching, no league 
standings involved. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a workday and few spectators were in the bleachers. Our older son, 
Curt, and his wife, Gail, were among them, Casey being their son. Also Casey's 
younger brother, Trevor, was with us. Peter O'Malley, owner of the Dodgers, was 
there in a business suit. His son, Brian, was playing right field, right next 
to Casey, at center field. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean breezes blew across the grass field, making the day surprisingly cool. A 
row of slender eucalyptus lined the outfield, and beyond it stood a large 
hotel. The Santa Monica skyline rose in the distance.  
</P>
<P>
 Casey came up to bat just after we arrived. He is a strong kid; works out with 
barbells. But the Santa Monica pitcher was too big and too good. He blew him 
away with three quick strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 As the game progressed Casey redeemed himself with catches of deep hit balls 
and fine throws to the infield. Then he struck out again. The game went only 
seven innings, Santa Monica winning 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
 After the game, the teams shook hands in a ritual that has been in dispute in 
some high schools, but which to me seemed gentlemanly and mature, and rather 
beautiful to watch. 
</P>
<P>
 There was one exciting play when a Santa Monica batter hit a fly deep to left 
center. Brian tried to scoop it off the ground and flubbed it. Casey picked it 
up and threw to second, probably cutting off a run. I know what happened 
because O'Malley told me. He has a good eye for baseball.  
</P>
<P>
 Probably not one member of those teams will make it in the major leagues, but 
who knows? Maybe Casey will be the next Mike Piazza, if he learns to hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile they were all good-looking boys in their uniforms and batting 
helmets, and they were there to play, not to plunder. The only gangs they 
belonged to were their teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Our plan was to have a family dinner at Marie Callender's on Westdale Avenue, 
where my granddaughter, Alison, recently began work as a waitress. She is 
trying to earn money for college. 
</P>
<P>
 Casey couldn't go. He said he had to do homework. Can you believe it? 
</P>
<P>
 Our granddaughter had the maitre d' seat us at a table where she could wait on 
us. I was eager to see how she handled a rather gauche crowd like us -- her 
mother and father, her grandparents and 11-year-old Trevor, who is rather 
uncivilized. 
</P>
<P>
 She was fine. Patient, quick, pleasant and pretty. The first thing I did was 
ask for a vodka tonic. "We don't serve alcohol," she informed me sweetly. 
</P>
<P>
 But I was in a good mood. After the game, we had stopped by Curt and Gail's 
house in Mar Vista and found they didn't have any vodka, which meant I would 
have to go without my usual evening fix. It has become an inflexible family 
ritual that my wife fixes me a vodka tonic -- one -- each evening before 
dinner, and has one herself. This is usually followed by dinner and a 
sex-and-violence movie. Such is culture in today's world. 
</P>
<P>
 When we found the cupboard bare, my wife volunteered to drive to the market 
and pick up a bottle of vodka, a gesture that I took as a recognition of my 
patience and civility. So I had my fix after all. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the week, Gail and our other grandson, Chris, son of Doug and 
Jackie, came over to our house to take me swimming. I had not been in our 
beautiful pool once this summer, because of my difficulty in managing the 
steps. 
</P>
<P>
 Being a physical therapist, Gail knew how to get me into the water using a 
walker. It was a tedious business, but it worked. I had a good swim, but Gail's 
presence probably kept me from drowning. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris was recently discharged after two years in the Army, mostly in the 
jungles of Panama. He has developed a manly physique, which he improves by 
workouts at a Pasadena gym. Thus I, the paterfamilias, am surrounded and 
supported by exemplary grandchildren. The word family never seems to be used in 
a positive sense anymore, but I would say we are a functional one. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, I never could hit.

MUSIC REVIEWS; SWANN SHOWS THE POWER, GLORY OF CATHEDRAL ORGAN 
</P>

<P>
 The 16,412 pipes and 268 ranks of the Crystal Cathedral's Hazel Wright organ 
-- which reportedly make it the second-largest fully functional organ in 
existence -- can easily seduce a performer into a gratuitous display of power. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday night, however, director of music and artist-in-residence Frederick 
Swann returned briefly from a summer sabbatical in a recital that avoided this 
pitfall, and tapped the potential of the instrument without compromising the 
musical integrity of his program. 
</P>
<P>
 The agenda highlighted the versatility of its mammoth vehicle. "Postlude for 
the Office of Compline," by Jehan Alain -- the French organist and composer who 
died at age 29, in World War II -- floated its Gregorian melodies and romantic 
harmonies, all delicately registered, in quiet reverie. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the strongest works in terms of effect and sonic forcefulness, Cesar 
Franck's B-minor Chorale received an intelligent, deliberately paced and 
rhythmically precise performance that came to an exciting, yet stylistically 
attentive, reed-dominated climax. 
</P>
<P>
 Judging by the degree of earth-shaking volume, though not necessarily of 
musical merit, the Franck work was bested by the last programmed piece: Healey 
Willan's Introduction, Passacaglia and Fugue. Generally recognized as the 
Canadian composer's most notable composition in this genre, it is bound to 
leave a lasting impression through an almost relentlessly growing density that 
culminated here, in its final variation, with a massive encircling aural 
assault. Swann achieved particularly tense excitement as he unraveled the 
intricacies of the fugue that preceded it. 
</P>
<P>
 Variations comprised a major part of the evening. Calvin Hampton's thorny, 
sometimes eerie set, his Prelude and Variations on "Old 100th," offered the

 Still, although Swann informed the audience that he had played it in public 
only once before -- as part of International Organ Week, in Nuremberg last 
month -- he worked his way capably through a thick fabric of wandering 
obbligatos and emerging countermelodies and managed to surround his listeners 
with a big enough wall of sound that they apparently forgave him the moments of 
bitonality in an otherwise traditional-minded program.

MUSIC REVIEWS; PACIFIC POPS EFFORT FEATURES RACHMANINOFF

 Professional observers face different challenges in reporting outdoor 
concerts: The programs can be simpler than winter-season assignments but the 
listening sometimes proves much more complicated. 
</P>

<P>
 A genuine pops program conducted by Carl St.Clair, second event in the Pacific 
Symphony's 1994 summer series at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre, again became the 
occasion for intense self-debate on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Metallic (i.e., tinny) amplification seemed to be the order of the evening; 
adequate bass response appeared only infrequently. The orchestra often sounded 
undernourished and the resident Yamaha grand piano disappointed greatly. This 
was one of those times when believing your own ears was no fun at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, all these drawbacks were even more frustrating since the actual 
performances -- by an orchestra with a few different faces than the one that 
plays at the Orange County Performing Arts Center from fall through spring -- 
seemed decent. Pleasant, even.  
</P>
<P>
 Indoors, music director St.Clair's way with Beethoven's Eighth Symphony might 
seem exuberant and youthfully rushed; in the open air, carried through 
microphones and speakers, it irritated through one-dimensionality and often, if 
not always, became pushed by a gracelessness not dictated by the notes on the 
page. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, one of Beethoven's tackier scores-for-profit -- one which has been 
nonetheless performed at other outdoor sites with some success -- "Wellington's 
Victory," the so-called "Battle" Symphony, also lacked full resonance in this 
setting and emerged only partially effective. This despite the conductor's 
careful and clarifying approach. 
</P>
<P>
 The local debut of 23-year old Meng-Chieh Liu, a recent graduate of the Curtis 
Institute in Philadelphia, in Rachmaninoff's Second Piano Concerto, caused this 
event, called "Rachmaninoff by Moonlight," to live up to its name. As promised, 
the full moon appeared on schedule, after intermission, and the well-trained 
Liu leaped all hurdles in this familiar test-piece. 
</P>
<P>
 He has power and digitality, note-honesty and dynamic resources in great 
abundance. With strong cooperation from St.Clair & Co., he certainly drove this 
vehicle with ease. Of course he should be brought back, preferably in recital, 
wherein his other musical gifts can be ascertained.

ART REVIEW; SANTA MONICA'S EXQUISITE DECEPTIONS; 'ALTERED EGOS' AND 'RETURN OF 
THE "CADAVRE EXQUIS" ' PRESENT WORKS WITH THEIR HEARTS IN SURREALIST-ERA PARIS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The essence of two spirited exhibitions at the Santa Monica Museum of Art, 
"Altered Egos" and "The Return of the 'Cadavre Exquis (Exquisite Corpse),' " is 
pretty well encapsulated in an installation by L.A.-based artist Charles La 
Belle. Working under the pseudonym of Charles Bon, he calls the piece "Seven 
Paris Monuments -- Santa Monica Correspondent." 
</P>
<P>
 La Belle's project, which is part of "Altered Egos," signals exhibitions where 
appearances are decidedly deceptive. Both shows have their hearts in 
Surrealist-era Paris of the 1920s, when the favorite form of cultural sabotage 
was derailing the train of rational thought. 
</P>
<P>
 La Belle's piece consists in part of computer-generated photographs. They show 
such famous Parisian landmarks as the Arch of Triumph and the Eiffel Tower 
weirdly materialized on beaches, malls and boardwalks in Santa Monica. We 
recognize these assertions of colossal ego more readily than our own laid-back 
landscape, although they are equally artificial. 
</P>
<P>
 "Altered Egos" involves nine artists, solo or in teams. All pretend to be 
other people. They play roles ranging from lesbian serial murderer to ambitious 
unknown artist. Hunter Reynolds, for example, has himself photographed 
portraying a woman named Patina DuPrey. Theresa Pendlebury uses numerous alter 
egos to create paintings based on literary descriptions of visual art. 
</P>
<P>
 Organized by the Santa Monica Museum and beautifully framed by curator Karen 
Moss, the exhibition's ruling spirit is that of Marcel Duchamp in drag as his 
feminine mirror image Rrose Selavy. 
</P>
<P>
 The well-known Russian emigre team of Komar and Melamid fares beautifully in 
their visual biography of Nikolai Buchumov, a fictional, academic, Social 
Realist painter of the Revolutionary period. 
</P>
<P>
 Invented by the pair in 1973, Buchumov lost an eye and retired to his native 
province to paint the same landscape over and over for the rest of his life. A 
prominent promontory appears in the left corner of each of the small multiple 
canvases on view. Actually, it's the artist's nose. You see a lot of your nose 
when you only have one eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Tucker presents a mini-exhibition complete with an audio guide. The 
installation documents the life of Richard Sharpe Shaver, an invented visionary 
who believed the center of the Earth is inhabited by sadistic mutants called 
"Dero." Their machinations cause all the trouble on the planet. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaver came to prominence in the 1940s when he was discovered by Ray Palmer, 
editor of the pulp sci-fi magazine Amazing Stories. Palmer translated Shaver's 
theories into a series of yarns for the magazine. Tucker's re-creation is so 
deft that you leave thinking, "Maybe there are evil mutants down there; why 
not?" The piece is a charmer. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one artist on view masks his real identity completely. Annabel Livermore 
is actually a male sculptor from Texas. The rest all fess up to being 
Pendlebury, Kevin Sullivan, Jan Tumlir, Millie Wilson and Vernon Fisher. 
</P>
<P>
 At bottom, they all make the same point. The persona we present to the world 
is but a carapace. Behind it, stored in the subconscious are aspects of 
ourselves that remain troubling monsters unless we come to terms with them. 
</P>

 Among Parisian surrealists a favorite parlor game was "The Cadavre Exquis." A 
piece of paper was folded horizontally, once for each player. In turn everybody 
put a phrase or a fraction of a drawing in his space without looking at the 
rest. The point was to use randomness to create art. One felicitous coincidence 
produced the spontaneous poem, "The 
exquisite-corpse-shall-drink-the-young-wine." That's how the game got its name. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the museum hosts "The Return of the 'Cadavre Exquis,' " a traveling show 
of nearly 100 collaborative drawings organized by the Drawing Center, New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The list of participants includes the likes of John Baldessari, Ellsworth 
Kelly, William Wegman, Mark Tansey and Roy Lichtenstein as well as a gaggle of 
emerging people. At three or four authors per sheet, it's a large cast. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibition is a pleasant curiosity. Evidence suggests that a lot of 
fudging goes on in the game. Many sheets are just too integrated to leave the 
idea of total randomness believable. It also proves that the odds on creating a 
masterpiece this way are about as long as those on a typewriting chimp pecking 
out a great novel. What we get mainly is a series of visual non sequiturs. 
</P>
<P>
 The collective confirms the universal suspicion that humans are preoccupied 
with sex. The exhibition frontispiece should probably be an image in which the 
head of Surrealist guru Andre Breton hovers above a large vagina that extrudes 
snakes with male heads and has the legs of an easel. This chimera was cobbled 
together by Steve Wolfe, Ashley Bickerton and Jan Hashey. 
</P>
<P>
 Slight shortcomings notwithstanding, the pair of shows would not be out of 
place at the Museum of Contemporary Art or the L.A. County Museum. Both come 
with good catalogues and make the little museum look smart and urbane. 
</P>

 * Santa Monica Museum of Art, 2437 Main St.; through Sept. 4, closed Monday 
and Tuesday, (310) 399-0433.
