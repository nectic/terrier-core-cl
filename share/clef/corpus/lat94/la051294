KING'S LAWYERS, JUDGE CLASH OVER TIME LIMIT; COURT: ATTORNEYS SEEK TWO MORE 
HOURS FOR CROSS-EXAMINATION, BUT ARE GRANTED ONLY 53 MINUTES. CASE MAY GO TO 
JURY MONDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Rodney G. King's lawyers, held to a strict schedule by a clock-watching judge, 
nearly ran out of time to cross-examine witnesses in his lawsuit Wednesday and 
were allotted only 53 extra minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyers, who wanted two extra hours, already had prepared to ask the San 
Francisco-based U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to intervene and were urged 
to do so by U.S. District Court Judge John G. Davies. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are being given an extra 53 minutes. That's it. Go file the writ. Run up 
to San Francisco and see if the court will give you the extra hour," Davies 
said, denying a stay of proceedings in the meantime. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute came to a head when all but seven minutes of the 30 hours Davies 
had allotted to King's lawyers had expired. They asked for two more hours and 
Davies relented a bit, allowing one hour, including the remaining seven 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We object to the hour and think it's still insufficient," said John Burris, 
one of King's attorneys. "It does not take into consideration all the work that 
has to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 "You knew from the beginning the order was 30 hours," Davies said. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge also rejected one more attempt by King's attorney, Federico Sayre, 
who offered to not seek appellate review if two more hours were granted. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the six current and former police officers being sued for 
punitive damages in King's beating indicated they had eight more hours of 
testimony from witnesses and objected to giving the other side more time. 
</P>
<P>
 Davies estimated that the case would go to the jury on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyers were down to 10 minutes of remaining time when the defense called 
to the stand one of its powerhouse witnesses, Los Angeles Police Department 
training officer Sgt. Charles L. Duke Jr. who testified that King's March 3, 
1991, beating was justified under police policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Duke, in a second-by-second analysis of King's videotaped actions, contended 
the black motorist was a threat to the white officers who beat him even when he 
was lying on the ground. Every baton blow against him was justified, Duke said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very important witness," Burris said. "We need the time to 
cross-examine him." 
</P>
<P>
 Davies, a former civil lawyer, has angrily castigated lawyers on both sides 
for wasting time and criticized cross-examinations and legal arguments as 
unfocused. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think both sides have tried to be diligent and effective," Burris said. 
"But the judge has his own notions of how the case should be tried. I am 
clearly nonplussed with this man at this time." 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that King's legal team challenged the judge on grounds of bias before 
the trial began but was unsuccessful. The lawyers maintained that Davies, who 
presided at the officers' federal civil rights trial, was biased against King. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had been warned by other lawyers that he is arbitrary, and we would not 
get a fair trial," Burris said. "Those predictions now have come to pass." 
</P>
<P>
 When the trial's punitive damage phase began April 21, Davies granted King's 
attorneys 30 hours and defense attorneys 32 hours to question witnesses. Burris 
asked him to even out the allotment by giving King's attorneys another two 
hours, but Davies refused. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury already has awarded King $3.8 million in compensatory damages from 
the city for his injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial's second phase addresses the question of how much to assess against 
individual officers as punishment and to deter future beatings. Davies 
dismissed a flock of defendants earlier in the week, including former police 
Chief Daryl Gates, ruling that their liability was not established. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the jury was cut from 10 members to nine when a woman juror fell 
ill and was told by her doctor to bow out. She said she was feeling faint and 
was diagnosed with anemia. In civil trials, as few as six jurors can return a 
verdict as long as it is unanimous.

 I am not a fan of conspiracy theories. Nevertheless, I was amazed that in your 
Associated Press article ("Graphic J.F.K. Assassination Car Photos, Records 
Released," May 4) the definite statement is made that the released documents 
"shed little additional light on the assassination." 
</P>
<P>
 This conclusion was reached one day after 50,000 documents in 224 boxes were 
released to the public.

NAVARRETTE ON NEW UFW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "UFW Must March to the Beat of a New Generation," Opinion, May 1: 
</P>
<P>
 How incredibly naive of Ruben Navarrette Jr. to think that those who criticize 
the United Farm Workers are simply acting on "a desire to make an ailing UFW 
'better.' " Who exactly are these good-hearted critics Navarrette is referring 
to? Is it California's powerful agribusiness industry? Is it the California 
Table Grape Commission, which has repeatedly waged disinformation campaigns 
against the union? Is it the bureaucratic Agricultural Labor Relations Board, 
known to stall UFW certifications for years? The grower-backed governors, 
George Deukmejian and Pete Wilson? 
</P>
<P>
 Listen closely to your grandfather's stories, Mr. Navarrette, and you'll find 
that from its beginnings the UFW has been the target of relentless criticism -- 
even violence -- from those threatened by its simple call for justice and 
dignity. A call that has been heeded by many, many young persons like myself 
who find the UFW's message vital and relevant and who are thankful we will 
never have to follow our own grandfathers into the fields. To stand back and 
criticize the UFW in the name of goodwill, as Navarrette perceives himself to 
be doing, is pure hypocrisy. 
</P>
<P>
 BLANCA GALLEGOS 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 Navarrette's article on the United Farm Workers Union presents only a partial 
picture of the union and its supporters. The gutting of the Agricultural Labor 
Relations Board by Govs. Deukmejian and Wilson removed effective legal 
protection for the UFW. Relaxed immigration laws, promoted by then-U.S. Sen. 
Wilson, were effectively used to undercut the union. The tactical decisions the 
union made in relation to the boycott need to be considered in this historical 
context. 
</P>
<P>
 Navarrette is right that the UFW needs to admit past mistakes and learn from 
them. However, I cannot understand why he feels the need to insult the UFW and 
the millions of its supporters by telling them they need to "put to rest the 
spirit of their dead leader and learn to think for themselves again." Long 
after the new generational beat has faded, working Americans of all ethnic 
groups will remember Cesar Chavez as a great American and an inspiration for 
those who organize. And farm workers and non-farm workers alike will be better 
off because of Chavez.

A PRO-LIFER'S ABORTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to "The 'Outing' of a Pro-Lifer," by Susan Carpenter McMillan, 
Commentary, May 4: 
</P>
<P>
 I can certainly understand how Susan Carpenter McMillan could have regrets 
regarding her (legal) abortion 20 years ago. I am sure there are hundreds of 
women who have similar feelings since abortion is something a woman does not go 
through casually. What I do not understand is how she can justify trying to 
eliminate that option for others. Perhaps she made a mistake, but I would 
venture, if all the circumstances were the same, she would do the same again. 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't it wonderful that she lives in a country where one can have a safe and 
legal abortion, and each individual can deal with her own guilt or relief. To 
deny others the same right she took advantage of when she needed it is 
self-serving and hypocritical.

<P>
 The whole point of being pro-choice is, for me, a guarantee that when a woman 
makes that very personal, very private decision her action is not only 
medically safe but legal as well. 
</P>
<P>
 McMillan was fortunate in that she only had to face her own conscience. Those 
of us who made that wrenching choice prior to Roe vs. Wade also faced a jail 
sentence, unsanitary conditions and exorbitant cost. 
</P>
<P>
 The procedure I endured took place on the kitchen table in a stranger's house. 
There wasn't equipment for sterilizing instruments and there certainly wasn't 
time for the luxury of anesthetics! Twelve other women sat in a darkened living 
room hoping that they would get their turn before the police raided. 
</P>
<P>
 McMillan may be interested in overturning a woman's access to a safe, legal, 
medical procedure now that she's had hers. I hope her daughters won't have to 
pay the price.

<P>
 Congratulations to McMillan for confronting the moral dilemma of abortion with 
honesty and courage: Abortion is the "unnecessary death of a child," and "we as 
mothers instinctively know . . . we ended the lives of separate human beings 
growing inside us." 
</P>
<P>
 Women and men alike can know instinctively as well as through science and 
reason that human life begins at conception. Although we invent medical and 
legal definitions to devalue and dehumanize prenatal life, although we declare 
it non-living, non-viable, non-human, or a non-person, from the moment of our 
conception we are never anything less than human life with a human face that 
will manifest itself in due time. 
</P>
<P>
 How can we teach our children to value and respect human life while through 
the example of hundreds of thousands of abortions each year we show them that 
human life has value only if wanted, planned and not inconvenient? How long 
shall we as a people and nation deny the humanity of our entire prenatal 
population in order to justify the termination of human life for the sake of 
personal convenience and the pursuit of recreational sex on the part of women 
and men?

 You feel guilty after an abortion. Everybody does. The woman does, her mate 
does, even the doctor. But we choose the life that is best for us. Better a 
whole life for one, than half a life for each of two people. To a young 
innocent college girl with the world ahead of her, you're in an impossible 
situation with no way out. Many have chosen suicide. Others choose the 
penitentiary of welfare and a sorrowful life thereafter. Life is a fragile 
gift. Better we give this gift with great care, than reproduce a crippled life 
of anguish that loses its soul in a world characterized by the staggering 
injustice of the day.

LOBBYING: CLEANING IT UP ; RIGHTLY, CONGRESS MOVES TO RESTRICT GIFTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The process by which the Congress of the United States makes the laws of the 
country is one in which there are properly many participants other than the 
legislators themselves. Legislators are, after all, representatives, and the 
public has a right to make its views known not just individually but also 
collectively. The name for all this is, hang on, lobbying.  
</P>
<P>
 How does it happen that so legitimate an activity comes to seem so 
illegitimate? This happens when private interests do more than just make their 
views known to the custodians of public welfare but attempt, by spending money 
on them, to turn them into custodians of private welfare. Lobbying in this form 
accounts for the finding, by a 1992 New York Times/ CBS News poll, that 75% of 
Americans believe that government serves a few big private interests rather 
than the people as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 There are broadly two ways to regulate the excesses of lobbying: One is to 
reform the recipients, the legislators; the other is to reform the donors, the 
private interests out to shape public policy. The first way consists mainly of 
measures, codes of ethics and the like, that seek to improve the righteousness 
of legislators. Such codes have proliferated in recent years, and the result? 
Well, the most common result has been a polishing of speeches by legislators 
who insist that though they have accepted favors, they have never allowed them 
to affect their thinking. But the move to "reform" the legislators has taken on 
new strength, thanks to bills passed, against considerable odds, by the House 
and on Wednesday by the Senate. The Senate action, the strictest gift-reform 
measure ever passed by either house of Congress, bans virtually all gifts, 
meals, travel and entertainment paid for by lobbyists, special-interest groups 
and even ordinary constituents. The Senate bill must be reconciled by a joint 
Senate-House conference with the less restrictive House version.  
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes only a fine line separates legitimate participation in 
representative government, with related expenses that are legitimate business 
expenses, on the one hand, and illegitimate attempts to exert undue influence 
on lawmakers on the other. Policing that line will take some doing. Attempts to 
fudge the difference will be many. Along the way, some legitimate activities 
may be tarred as illegitimate. 
</P>
<P>
 But give the U.S. Congress credit for recognizing that it had to clean up its 
act or begin losing the capacity to govern at all. The right to vote may create 
representative government. But what makes the vote work is the public trust 
that, once elected, the representatives will actually represent the people. 
These bills give the public trust at least a fighting chance.

CHARITABLE MAINLY TO THEMSELVES; SOME FUND-RAISERS GIVE ONLY A PITTANCE TO THE 
ADVERTISED RECIPIENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After the recession, after the wildfires and mudslides and after the 
earthquake, two things can be said. The ranks of those in need have swollen, 
and the donating power of those who would help has been greatly diminished. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why it is so important to ensure that every charitable dollar goes as 
far as possible. One way to do that is to get to know the charity of your 
choice and donate directly. It would not make sense to waste money by giving to 
those organizations that are in it not to help others but to help only 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, just such mendacious firms can be licensed and bonded to operate as 
fund-raising organizations. Their clients are charities that are often too 
small to spend much time seeking donations. It's all part of an industry of 165 
groups in the state that raise $100 million annually in charitable dollars . . 
. for profit. Some of them do excellent work; some do not. The law provides no 
limit on how much of that money these companies can keep. In fact, according to 
U.S. Supreme Court rulings, they are shielded from restrictions of that kind by 
the First Amendment.  
</P>
<P>
 A Burbank-based telemarketing firm called Valley Fundraisers is an example of 
what to avoid. It took in $500,000 in charitable contributions, but its client 
charities saw little of it. The American Wheelchair Veterans Assn., for 
example, received just 10.2% of the money Valley Fundraisers gathered on its 
behalf. That was legal. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley Fundraisers is now being investigated by state and local agencies, 
based on a Times story that alleges it received donations for nonexistent 
charities and real charities that it does not represent. 
</P>
<P>
 What should you do? Some fund-raising operations refuse to give you a mailing 
address and offer to send a courier to pick up your check. Watch out for them. 
You could also write to the National Charities Information Bureau for its "Wise 
Giving Guide" at Dept. 341, 19 Union Square West, N.Y., N.Y. 10003. It will 
list charities that spend most of their money on programs and not on 
administration. This is one case in which it pays to be better informed about 
your hard-earned goodwill.

ARAFAT SAYS: WHO, ME?; TRANSITION TO PALESTINIAN SELF-RULE TRIPS UP OVER HIS 
INEPTITUDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Yasser Arafat was in South Africa this week, helping to celebrate the birth of 
a new democratic government. But the peripatetic chairman of the Palestine 
Liberation Organization ought more usefully to have been at his Tunis 
headquarters, trying to put together the Palestinian governing council that was 
supposed to have been ready Wednesday to take over from Israel the 
administration of the Gaza Strip and Jericho. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat's inability to assemble a ready-to-go 24-member council signals an 
undisguised rebuff to his leadership, which can be traced directly to rising 
and increasingly vocal aversion to his autocratic management style. Such 
well-known Palestinian political figures as Faisal Husseini, Farouk Kaddoumi 
and Mahmoud Abbas are said by PLO insiders to have refused to serve on the 
council, which will exercise limited executive and legislative authority until 
a popularly elected governing body is chosen later this year. Arafat will head 
the council, and he has made plain he expects to remain in charge after free 
elections. But the refusal of prominent Palestinians to put themselves under 
his command on the council -- some say bluntly it would be political suicide to 
do so -- along with other signs of his shrinking popularity deepen doubts about 
the prospects for orderly and stable interim Palestinian self-rule. 
</P>
<P>
 The loser in all this isn't Israel, which can't wait to cut itself lose from 
the turbulence in Gaza. The losers are the Palestinians in the territories, who 
want an end to Israeli military rule and the chance to handle their own civic 
affairs but who also desperately need the more than $2 billion in developmental 
and other aid pledged by the World Bank and other donors. Those funds, however, 
won't be released until the governing authority is in place. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat has blamed everyone in sight for his problems, but it's clear where the 
fault lies. The orderly transfer of power called for in last week's Cairo 
accord can't occur until a Palestinian authority is in place, and Arafat so far 
has proved incapable of forming such a body. That not only leaves Palestinian 
political aspirations up in the air, it also leaves the long-term viability of 
the U.S.-sponsored peace process very much in doubt.

A PLACE FOR US

<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your article "Insurers Are Fed Up With Diet Program" (April 10) is filled 
with misleading statements and allegations. The headline alone states that A 
Place for Us is a diet program.You ran a copy of our ad. I think you can 
clearly see that it states "Treatment for depression, not weight loss." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not about the diagnosis of weight loss as depression, this is about money 
so the insurance companies "can have it their way" and not pay on legitimate 
claims. This is a smear campaign that Blue Cross used to destroy a dynamic 
program where the healing process was more than traditional psychiatric 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 All patients admitted to the hospital first had a referral letter from their 
personal physician stating the need for inpatient hospitalization. Also, a 
patient is again diagnosed prior to admission by an attending 
hospital-credentialed physician who was not affiliated with A Place for Us. I 
didn't know these psychiatrists; why would they lie? A Place for Us had a 
management agreement with the hospitals only. As for allegations of enlisting 
doctors and hospital staff to change diagnoses and medical records, do you 
really believe that doctors, nurses, psychologists, etc., are going to put 
their licenses on the line for me?  
</P>
<P>
 The law renders me defenseless against trumped-up allegations by the insurance 
companies, since anything said in a pending lawsuit is protected. I get chewed 
up emotionally and starved financially with attorney fees standing on the 
truth. So in the long run, it's whoever has the most money wins. 
</P>
<P>
 I'll be helping people until the day I die, no matter what the media choose to 
digest.

 In response to Cardinal Roger Mahony's criticism of the Kevorkian decision 
(May 3) and his apotheosis of human suffering ("Ending Pain Shouldn't Mean 
Ending Lives," Commentary, May 9): 
</P>
<P>
 What has he to say to kin of the terminally ill who choose to "play God" by 
pulling the plug or being assisted in doing so? Is there "dignity" in living 
under what Mahony calls "effective pain control" when loved ones are comatose 
or begging to die and will never again be able to relate to themselves or their 
surroundings? My mother hung on for two years under "effective pain control." 
There was no hope for her recovery and she was miserable, as was I for her.We 
did the correct thing and waited for the end. Today I think dignity is served 
by Dr. Jack Kevorkian's option to die and President Nixon's instructions not to 
use extraordinary means.

 Regarding Conrad's cartoon depicting Michelangelo's fresco of the creation

 Is Conrad disturbed that man usurps God's power by extending a mask on a tube

HEALTH WATCH; BLOW AWAY THE SMOKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The cigarette makers have grown fond in recent years of hoisting high the 
banner of so-called individual rights to counter growing concern about use and 
exposure to their dangerous product. Equal access, they argue, guarantees that 
smokers have the right to inhabit the same space as nonsmokers, apparently no 
matter what the consequence. 
</P>
<P>
 But cigarette manufacturers' dogged attempts to inject ideology into this 
debate barely conceal their unvarnished fear for the economic health of their 
enterprise. In the absence, then, of high principles, and given cascading 
scientific evidence as to the clear threat posed by secondhand smoke, 
lawmakers, whether in Sacramento or Washington, who continue to oppose 
reasonable smoking restrictions can offer no credible defense to charges that 
they are "bought and paid for" by tobacco money. 
</P>
<P>
 Today the 24 members of the House health and environment subcommittee will 
vote on HR 3434, sponsored by Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles). The bill 
would restrict smoking in most commercial buildings, public and private, to 
separately ventilated rooms. Proposed amendments will exempt private clubs and, 
perhaps, bars. 
</P>
<P>
 Five former surgeons general, the current surgeon general and the major 
medical groups support Waxman's bill. But so, too, does the Building Owners 
Management Assn., McDonald's, Arby's and, indeed, the National Council of Chain 
Restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet today's vote is expected to be close. Instead, this bill should pass 
overwhelmingly.

A SATIRIST'S SKETCH OF HOW TO TRIGGER A COMEBACK FOR FIREARMS; GUN LOBBY: 
DEFEATED IN A SQUEAKER ON ASSAULT WEAPONS, IT MIGHT TRY WRAPPING ITS COLD-STEEL 
MESSAGE IN SOCIAL-SCIENCE FUZZIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Register's editorial pages, teaches journalism at the University of Iowa.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The gun lobby may be down after its setback on assault weapons, but don't 
count on it. Here is how the firearms community aims to trigger a comeback: 
</P>
<P>
 * Constitutional revamp. The planned rewrite is unique in the annals of 
constitutional reform in that nary a comma would change. The proposal calls for 
the First Amendment and the Second Amendment simply to swap places; the right 
to bear arms thus would become the First Amendment and the freedoms of speech, 
press and religion the Second Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 For the record, spokesmen say that the renumbering is intended merely to 
update the Bill of Rights -- to validate the country's evolution from a handful 
of sparsely populated rural states when expression and worship were priorities 
to an era where densely packed cities and crime demand the primacy of 
self-protection. 
</P>
<P>
 Privately, gun hobbyists-lobbyists admit that they expect wide backing for the 
battle to bear arms from folks who believe they're espousing free speech. 
</P>
<P>
 In this respect, the lobby is counting on history to repeat itself. Pro-gun 
forces years ago chose to name their organization a rifle association, despite 
a large handgun constituency, to capitalize on the high approval rating of the 
New Deal's National Recovery Administration. To this day, much of the National 
Rifle Assn.'s legendary clout comes from old-timers grateful to the NRA for 
rescue from the Depression. 
</P>
<P>
 * Alms for arms. The gun lobby mocks Willie Sutton's maxim, "Rob where the 
money is." If Sutton's advice were sound, they observe, crime would be highest 
in high-income neighborhoods and lowest in low-income areas. The reverse is 
true, the lobby explains, because the well-off are well-armed, whereas those 
too needy to afford arms are easy pickings for thugs and thieves. In fact, 
According to firearms theorists, the lack of access to arms by the law-abiding 
indigent is the root cause of poverty. As one arms thinker commented, "If you 
can't protect it, why earn it?" Firearms analysts calculate that every dollar 
invested in guns by low-income households boosts take-home pay tenfold. The gun 
lobby's anti-poverty remedy: its Equalizer/Pieces for the Poor program in which 
persons at or below the poverty level receive gun stamps redeemable for arms 
from licensed dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Guns for juveniles. The firearms community is convinced that the crackdown 
on gun ownership by minors poses its gravest challenge. School locker searches 
and metal detectors are considered especially destructive of the right of 
juveniles to bear arms. The centerpiece of the campaign will be litigation tied 
to a landmark 1969 Supreme Court decision that said the Constitution "does not 
stop at the schoolhouse gate" and thus protects the right of students to sport 
anti-war armbands. The gun lobby's position: The rights to bear armbands and 
arms are indistinguishable. 
</P>
<P>
 At one time, the gun movement relied exclusively on bare-knuckle lobbying. 
Clearly, it has learned from the assault-weapons debacle the need for finesse, 
for economic and behavioral research and for reaching out to the poverty and 
civil liberties communities. You thought maybe the gun lobby was licked?

O.C. THEATER REVIEW / JAN HERMAN; ART'S 'SEARCH' LOOKS ONLY FOR THE LAUGHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe" has found 
incontrovertible proof of something. Just what, though, is hard to define. 
Maybe it's the notion that outer-space aliens get a kick out of social satire. 
</P>
<P>
 Jane Wagner, who originally wrote the show as a one-woman tour de farce for 
Lily Tomlin, certainly credits them with a sense of humor. "Search" might even 
be retitled "Punch Line Fever." 
</P>
<P>
 As performed at the Alternative Repertory Theatre by a cast of five women 
instead of one, the show maintains a sufficiently high entertainment quotient 
to satisfy any aliens who might happen by. Even earthlings with a taste for 
shtick ought to come away from this production with smiles on their faces. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, a "Search" without Tomlin or some prodigious talent able to impersonate 
all 14 of its characters tends to reveal the script's weakness. 
</P>
<P>
 It plays like a marathon sketch pulsing with wisecracks but packing no 
emotional punch. However heartfelt a scene or character purports to be, the 
script invariably goes for the laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 The show also rambles. It rambled when Tomlin did it, though nobody complained 
because her Tony Award-winning performance was so delicious. And it rambles 
now, clocking in at three hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Trudy, the cosmic bag lady who believes reality is "nothing but a collective 
hunch," provides the evening's philosophical glue. As she waits for aliens to 
land so she can show them around, she pushes a shopping cart back and forth 
across a city street at the corner of "Walk / Don't Walk" -- a latter-day 
version of Grover's Corner. 
</P>
<P>
 Between Trudy's offbeat noodling ("The problem with shock treatments is 
flyaway hair") and beam-me-up trances, we get to meet a constellation of women 
from the self-help '70s whose lives have been shaped by feminist ideals, 
environmental ecology, New-Age consciousness and left-wing politics. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner sends up all of these women, as well as the zeitgeist of the women's 
liberation movement in its heyday, from the first appearance of Ms. magazine to 
the Democrats' nomination of Geraldine A. Ferraro for vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the more memorable caricatures are Chrissy, an aerobics airhead in 
pursuit of spiritual fulfillment and hunky men ("All my life I wanted to be 
somebody. Now I see I should have been more specific"); teen runaway Agnus 
Angst, a punk-style performance artist ("I'm getting my act together and 
throwing it in your face"); and Lynn, the upwardly mobile, have-it-all 
housewife who believes in her husband's "holistic capitalism." 
</P>
<P>
 Playing those three women, Ryan Kray is the show's standout performer, 
delineating each of them with theatrical flair and stylish confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other characters who come in for Wagner's satirical treatment include a blithe 
pair of Manhattan hookers named Tina and Brandi; Kate, a bored socialite with a 
hairdo problem, and Lynn's feminist friends, the macrame artist Marge and the 
radical lesbian journalist Edie. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Patricia L. Terry's staging is clear and direct. There isn't much she 
can do to keep the show from sprawling, especially given her decision to cast a 
handful of players. The flow from one vignette to the next loses the magical 
unity of the original. It flattens out an already narrative-prone script more 
than it would with a single actor in all the roles. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, this "Search" still produces the welcome sound of laughter. And if it 
doesn't yield an awe-struck "goose-bump experience" about the meaning of life, 
as Trudy hopes it will, frankly neither did the original. 
</P>

 Court Woes: Rapper Tupac Shakur, wearing a blue county jail jumpsuit and 
handcuffs, pleaded innocent Wednesday to felony charges of carrying a concealed 
handgun. The plea came a day after he began serving a 15-day county jail term 
for attacking director Allen Hughes on a music video set. Wednesday's court 
appearance stemmed from the rapper's April 30 arrest in Hollywood in which 
police said they found a concealed 9mm semiautomatic handgun under a car seat 
occupied by the rapper. That charge, which carries a maximum penalty of five 
years in state prison, was filed as a felony because Shakur had a previous 
weapons conviction. Shakur, 22, who co-starred with Janet Jackson in the film 
"Poetic Justice," also faces two probation violation charges filed last week 
that carry a potential sentence of 18 months in county jail. In the Hughes 
assault and battery case, Shakur must follow his 15 days in jail with another 
15 on a Caltrans work crew, then 30 days of community service. The rapper also 
faces two assault cases in Atlanta and sexual assault and weapons charges in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sales Talk: Riding the crest of last week's Academy of Country Music Awards, 
performers on the NBC-TV show saw substantial sales gains at record retail 
outlets across the nation. Co-host Reba McEntire's "Read My Mind" album sold 
about 120,000 units last week to finish in the No. 2 position on the nation's 
pop chart -- just behind country newcomer Tim McGraw's "Not a Moment Too Soon," 
which sold about 133,000 copies. Sales for co-host Alan Jackson's "A Lot About 
Livin' (And a Little 'Bout Love)" doubled from the previous week to rank No. 
44, with 25,000 units sold. Garth Brooks' "In Pieces" also shot from No. 62 to 
No. 34, selling 29,000 units. . . . In other country music news, singer Billy 
Ray Cyrus and his wife Leticia have a new baby boy. Braison Chance Cyrus was 
born Monday at Nashville's Baptist Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 * It's Over: Only hours after her publicist said she was happily married, 
actress Drew Barrymore filed papers in Los Angeles Superior Court Tuesday to 
end her marriage to British bar owner Jeremy Thomas. Barrymore, 19, and Thomas, 
31, were married March 20 and separated April 19, according to the petition. 
Barrymore, the former child star of "E.T.," currently appears in the movie "Bad 
Girls." ART

 'Scream' in Place: Edvard Munch's masterpiece, "The Scream," was returned to 
its place at the National Art Museum in Oslo, Norway, on Wednesday after nearly 
three months in the hands of thieves. Norway's most famous painting, recovered 
Saturday, was stolen from the museum Feb. 12. Two thieves climbed a ladder, 
broke a second-floor window and climbed in to grab the painting. The 1893 work, 
which on Wednesday was hung away from windows in an alcove on the more secure 
first floor, shows a waif-like figure standing on a bridge with his hands over 
his ears and his mouth open in a scream. 
</P>
<P>
 * Auction Blues: An early 20th-Century painting by Maurice de Vlaminck fetched 
$6.8 million at Christie's Tuesday night, easily topping its $3-million to 
$4-million pre-sale estimate and becoming the top seller in an otherwise 
disastrous showing. Although the bidding started out heavy, taking in $17.8 
million on the first seven works, the New York auction of Impressionist and 
modern art soon turned slow, with only 38 of the 76 lots offered finding 
buyers. That 50% sale rate is astoundingly low by conventional standards, and 
among those pieces that didn't sell were important works by Monet, Leger, 
Modigliani, Miro and Cezanne. Christie's Chairman Christopher Burge called the 
sale the most "disappointing show" since 1981. In all, the sale brought in 
$50.7 million, far short of Christie's pre-sale estimate of $89 million to $119 
million. TELEVISION 
</P>
<P>
 Leveling Off: David Letterman, who is broadcasting his late-night CBS comedy 
show from Los Angeles this week, apparently wore out his welcome with 65,000 
Southern Californians after one night. His Los Angeles ratings dropped 16% 
Tuesday from the night before, from 400,512 homes to 335,428. Still, that was 
well above the 205,262 homes that "Late Show" had been averaging, and far ahead 
of the 195,249 homes that tuned in Jay Leno on "The Tonight Show" Tuesday. "The 
Tonight Show" had been seen in 165,211 homes Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 * Entertainment Battle Date Set: Warner Bros. Domestic Television Distribution 
has changed the name of its new entertainment news program from "Entertainment 
News Television" to "EXTRA -- The Entertainment Magazine." On Sept. 5, the 
syndicated "EXTRA" will replace "Entertainment Tonight" locally on KNBC-TV 
Channel 4, with "E.T." moving over to KCBS-TV Channel 2. Although Warner Bros. 
reportedly won a court battle with cable network E! Entertainment Television, 
which felt "ENT" was a copyright infringement on E!, Warner Bros. changed the 
name anyway to avoid confusion with the competition, including "E.T." Warner 
Bros. also announced that its series, "Kung Fu: The Legend Continues" and 
"Babylon 5," which air locally on KCOP Channel 13, will return in November for 
new seasons. "Time Trax" will not.SHAUNA SNOW

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; PAM TILLIS SHOWS GROWTH, DEPTH AT CRAZY HORSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "This is year number three," Pam Tillis crowed at the Crazy Horse on Monday, 
"and we're still out there making records and having hits. It's amazing, I've 
still got a job!" 
</P>
<P>
 More than that, the country star's performance showed she has grown to fill 
that job remarkably well. The bit of spunk that was hinted at in her singing 
three years ago has blossomed, so that she now spices up a novelty lyric with 
the sass of a mid-career Dolly Parton, and her serious singing has become a 
thing of its own. 
</P>
<P>
 In her 14-song set, Tillis was often able to make even microwaved Nashville 
fare seem like home cooking. She took the hackneyed "Do You Know Where Your Man 
Is" and dragged it into serious Tammy Wynette country with a vocal that seemed 
heartfelt, if acknowledgedly indebted to Wynette in its phrasing. 
</P>
<P>
 The acoustic setting of a brief "unplugged" segment was ideal for her voice, 
which proved to have far more nuance and character than her typical belting 
allows to shine through. Its highlight was "Melancholy Child" -- clearly a 
personal lyric, telling of a young mother, a father on the road and a child 
with "a black Irish temper and some solemn Cherokee." 
</P>
<P>
 Tillis sang it as such, with a sad ache and a dollop of hope. If more of her 
performance could connect with the emotion she found here, Tillis would be in a 
class with Emmylou Harris. JIM WASHBURN

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; ALLMAN BROTHERS HAVEN'T LOST THEIR EDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For decades, supporters of the Grateful Dead and the Allman Brothers Band have 
been debating which group is better at blues-rock instrumental jams. The 
Allmans always seemed to have an edge, an opinion that was supported by their 
show at the Wiltern Theatre on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in peak form, the Dead never quite soared like that. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than three hours, the Allmans, featuring original members Gregg 
Allman (organ), Dickey Betts (lead guitar) and drummers Butch Trucks and 
Jaimoe, tirelessly delivered jam after glorious jam and had the audience 
screaming for more. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening its four-night engagement, the seven-man unit played both old material 
and tunes from their new album, "Where It All Begins." But the songs didn't 
matter. They were just jumping off points for those marvelously rambling 
improvisations. At times the musicianship was simply stunning. 
</P>
<P>
 These intense and seamless jams, powered by a three-man percussion crew, 
roared in many different directions -- encompassing jazz, soul, country and 
folk -- but were always drenched in blues. Occasionally Betts and Allman 
provided vocals that were really just needless decorations. The jams would have 
worked just as well without them. 
</P>
<P>
 For the nostalgia-oriented, the show had an early-'70s feel, with psychedelic 
images pulsing on the screen at the back of the stage and pot smoke enveloping 
the theater. In keeping with that theme, the Allmans played about as well as 
they did back in those days. 
</P>
<P>

3790 Wilshire Blvd., 7:30 p.m. $40 and $25. (213) 380-5005. Sunday at Hyatt

CLUB REVIEW; HOLLYWOOD'S HIP THREE CLUBS IS ACES FOR THE SINGLES CROWD

 A sparkily black low ceiling. A rich burgundy bar enveloped by cozy black 
booths. Each room just barely lit in red, enhancing the features of all who 
enter.Billie Holiday sings in whispers in the background.  
</P>
<P>
 This may sound like a set design for Quentin Tarantino's latest gangster opus, 
but it's actually the reality for Three Clubs -- a 2-year-old Hollywood venue 
popularly known as the Three of Clubs. Defying the odds, Three Clubs -- which 
revamped a veritable hole-in-the-wall bar to become the Hollywood place for 
singles -- has gotten only trendier as the venue has aged. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-room bar puts people in the mood by playing jazz that's not standard, 
avoiding predictable numbers in favor of more obscure tracks from the likes of 
Sinatra or Holiday. As the weekend approaches, vintage Rolling Stones can be 
heard alongside "James Bond" covers and Tom Waits, and Sunday night offers live 
jazz performances. The clarity of Three Clubs' sound system makes the music an 
unavoidable part of the room's experience, and as the evening wears on, and 
singles are making their last attempt to mingle, each song takes on a more 
personal edge.  
</P>
<P>
 One recent last call, as if on cue, a Waits ode to a woman who sits near him 
in a bar came over the speaker system. "I hope that I don't fall in love with 
you," sang Waits, " 'Cause falling in love just makes me blue." 
</P>
<P>
 To those still attempting conversation around the oval-shaped bar, the irony 
wasn't lost.

THEATRE REVIEW; WORDS ARE STILL THE THING WITH 'ANGELS' IN CERRITOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 "City of Angels" has reached Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts in a 
scenically slim, non-union touring version -- but its reduced circumstances 
don't affect it as much as you might expect. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike "Grand Hotel" -- which was shorn of its grandeur in a similarly 
lower-budget version at Cerritos last year -- "City of Angels" doesn't suffer 
much by scenic compression. Its strength is the wit of Larry Gelbart's book and 
David Zippel's lyrics, as sung to Cy Coleman's intricately jazzy rhythms. It 
never probes too far beneath its satirical surface about the fate of 
screenwriters and private eyes in '40s Hollywood. It's not about big characters 
or big scenery. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be fun to see a top-flight "City of Angels" in a much smaller hall -- 
the closer you are to all that wordplay, the more you're likely to appreciate 
it. That may be why the show didn't do as well as hoped in its first Southland 
outing at the 1,825-seat Shubert in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the 1,340 seats in this configuration of the Cerritos hall are also 
too far from the stage. But most of those all-important words are heard 
distinctly, and the cast delivers them with style. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth of this cast is especially evident in the two leads, Stone (Mark 
Blackburn), the fictional private eye, and Stine (Randy Lake), the novelist 
turned screenwriter who gives Stone life. Blackburn looks like a recent 
graduate of gumshoe school. He lacks the well-worn mug that James Naughton 
brought to the original. Lake looks as if he should be graded, not paid, for 
his writing. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Lake's strong, soaring singing voice adds maturity to his 
performance, and he manages a playful scrappiness. Blackburn's singing isn't as 
notable, but he delivers the lines with a throaty growl and the proper genre 
timing. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the other actors play characters in both a movie-within-the-play as 
well as the play-outside-the-movie, and most of them do it well. If the program 
didn't say so, you'd never know this is the first professional role for assured 
Ellen Brennan as Donna and Oolie, matching secretaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Adam Graham's studio mogul has a commanding bonhomie. Vee Ringo brings a 
tortured sound to Bobbi's torch song and authoritative bite to Gabby's "It 
Needs Work." Jill Monaco draws a clear line between her make-believe Mallory's 
sizzle and her Hollywood starlet's would-be sizzle.  
</P>
<P>
 James Bush's adaptation of Robin Wagner's sets retains the script's classic 
colors. But it also replaces some of the original design with pallid 
photographic imagery, and the L.A. skyline doesn't protrude into the hall as it 
did at the Shubert. Joe Leonardo directed for the Troika Organization. 
</P>

SCREENING ROOM; DEREK JARMAN RETROSPECTIVE CHARTS ARTIST'S EVOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The centerpieces of "Dancing on the Ledge: Derek Jarman," a retrospective 
starting today at the Nuart honoring the late British experimentalist, are his 
two final features, "Wittgenstein" (Tuesday through May 22) and "Blue" (May 
22-25). 
</P>
<P>
 In his all-too-brief, courageous life and career as an artist and gay 
activist, Jarman moved way beyond the tediousness of his early 
Shakespeare-inspired films -- "Jubilee (screening Monday) and "The Tempest" 
(screening Friday) -- to an ever-increasing accessibility with no loss of his 
venturesome style.  
</P>
<P>
 Opening the series is one of his finest, "The Garden," a dazzlingly surreal 
retelling of the story of Christ juxtaposed with the fate of a pair of gay 
young lovers, who are similarly crucified. Jarman's images here are among his 
most glorious, celebrating the beauty of nature and the joy of being alive, 
ever at odds with the forces of a darkly repressive society. It will be shown 
with his most widely distributed film, "Edward II," a modern-dress version of 
Christopher Marlowe's Elizabethan tragedy that he has transformed into a 
timely, fiery attack on homophobia. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the beautifully acted "Wittgenstein," Jarman's sprightly, witty 
75-minute gloss on the life of philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, is among his 
most accessible films. In minimalist settings, Jarman sketches the influential 
philosopher's life in a series of key encounters as we see him move from his 
native Vienna, where he was born into wealth in 1889, out into the world, 
principally Cambridge, where he sparred with Bertrand Russell (Michael Gough) 
and was nurtured by a fellow gay, economist John Maynard Keynes (John Quentin). 
In essence, we witness Wittgenstein (Karl Johnson) engage in a lifelong battle 
with the tantalizing limitations and possibilities of language in relation to 
philosophy. As for his own homosexuality, Wittgenstein found his desire to be 
open about his life at war with the need for secrecy because of the oppressive 
laws of his era. 
</P>
<P>
 As the ravages of AIDS, which claimed Jarman's life Feb. 19, began to rob this 
most visual of filmmakers of his sight, he took on the most formidable 
challenge imaginable: to make a movie that would be entirely aural except that 
the screen would stay a sky blue -- for 76 minutes. Jarman may have lost his 
sight but not his vision, for "Blue" is amazingly involving, an oratorio of 
soaring and richly varied sound and music as well as prose that verges on the 
poetic. Jarman charts the progress of his terminal illness with a terse, 
clinical detachment; these diary-like remarks punctuate an impassioned 
celebration of life and love in the face of a forthrightly accepted impending 
death.  
</P>
<P>
 Filmforum will sponsor a program of Jarman short films made in the late '70s 
and early '80s Sunday at the Nuart at 4 p.m. and again at 7:15 p.m. Although 
vibrant and watchable, they are surprisingly typical of much experimental work, 
collages with lots of stop motion, layered and fragmented images. The most 
distinctive and ambitious of the group, "The Dream Machine" (1984), is a 
determinedly pagan homage to gay love as a young man is gradually transformed 
into a glittery angel with filigree wings. It has been described as "a 
meditation on the works of William S. Burrough and Brion Gysin," and it 
resembles nothing so much as the sweetly campy underground films of Jack Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the other notable Jarman films screening are his 1966 debut feature 
"Sebastaine," a retelling of the martyrdom of St. Sebastaine with much nudity 
-- and in Latin! (Friday at 5:45 and 9:15); "Caravaggio" (Saturday at 4 and 
7:45), a highly idiosyncratic tribute to the 16th Century gay artist; and "The 
Last of England" (Monday at 5:45 and 9:30), an apocalyptic, surreal vision of 
Britain after the fall of government that expresses a deep love of his country 
and its people.

PAUL MCCARTHY'S PRECIOUS BODILY FLUIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KANDEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Tomato Heads," Paul McCarthy's new exhibition at Rosamund Felsen, represents 
a departure for Los Angeles' eminence grise of the grotesque. McCarthy is 
best-known (though hardly well-enough) for the performances, films and videos 
he has created since the late 1960s. These works are fiercely idiosyncratic: 
simultaneously revolting and liberating, chaotic and finely calibrated, 
visceral and ironic. 
</P>
<P>
 Bodily fluids, blood, saliva, sperm and vomit, are represented by buckets of 
ketchup, mounds of raw hamburger and pots of greasy hand creams. In other 
instances, such fluids appear undisguised -- in the process of being excreted, 
rudely dangling from orifices, or boldly making their way back inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing a cheap wig and a gruesomely smiling mask, McCarthy has long 
personified an impossible-to-romanticize brand of abjection. His work messes 
with critical commonplaces, despoils philosophical niceties, and makes 
ketchup-soused mincemeat of neat psychoanalytic scenarios. In "Tomato Heads," 
however, McCarthy has cleaned up his act -- and the results are somewhat 
disheartening. Within the antiseptic gallery space, McCarthy's newly sanitized 
perversity is far too comfortable, trading on the cute rather than the uncanny. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not to say that there aren't shocks here of a more sanguine sort. The 
room is dominated by three life-sized, rubbery mannequins, each clothed in a 
turtleneck sweater -- but no pants; and each sporting an enormous, red, tomato 
head -- complete with delicate, green sprout. One figure has two flesh-toned, 
plastic vaginas for eyes; a prosthetic penis for a nose; and a yellow cube for 
a mouth. Another has a carrot inserted into its rear end; a blue cube for its 
genitals; and a hoe speared through its head, making for a decidedly mismatched 
pair of ears. 
</P>
<P>
 Scattered on the floor are additional, interchangeable parts, all made of 
fiberglass and/or urethane rubber: more carrots, dozens of pink penises and 
vaginas, disembodied ears and eyes, and knives and forks. Yet despite the 
plethora of options, one isn't compelled to play with this adult version of Mr. 
Potato Head. The work is complete unto itself, oddly circumscribed, a statement 
rather than a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 If we are let off the (meat) hook, McCarthy isn't altogether willing to do the 
same for himself. The other rooms of the gallery are filled with large, color 
photographs of masks McCarthy has used in performances from 1976 to 1983. These 
squashed, sullied, befouled and disintegrating personas -- the "Monkey Mask 
Inside Out," the "Popeye Mask," the "Pig Mask" -- stand in sharp contrast to 
the sweet and spanking new, tomato-headed creatures. It is interesting that at 
the very moment in which the artist backtracks into unblemished respectability, 
he sets free his decidedly anti-social ghosts, as if to undermine his own 
program. Such aggressive waywardness and deliberate illogic are indeed 
characteristic of McCarthy's art at its very best -- and make it impossible to 
swallow this new work without some regret.

<P>
 * Pantyhose Artistry: For feminist artists seeking to critique gendered 
stereotypes, clothing has lately proven a seductive -- and highly tenacious -- 
metaphor. Tenacity, however, doesn't always connote resilience. Indeed, in too 
many group shows, we have seen too many nightgowns, brassieres, and evening 
gowns crumpled, shrunk, shredded and otherwise altered -- and in the process, 
watched something which began as a provocative strategy degenerate into a 
tiresome mannerism. 
</P>
<P>
 At 1529 Wellesley, LouAnne Greenwald infuses the last bits of life into this 
fatally overstuffed genre. Greenwald makes art out of pantyhose -- in shades as 
subtle as coffee, nude and suntan, or as garish as fuchsia, yellow and pink. 
With these culturally coded pieces of stretch nylon, she creates rather 
fantastic things: a gossamer "spider web" hidden in an out-of-the-way corner; a 
beautiful, multicolored flower, right out of a hosiery department display -- 
except for its phallic stamen; and a Gothic-style arch of stretched, white 
stockings, whose purity is highly suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenwald's trump card is her artistry: Her archway represents a considerable 
feat of engineering; a pantyhose "pelt" of synthetic skins is marked by a 
tongue-in-cheek precision. And along the way, she does offer minor epiphanies. 
An elaborate corner piece of tightly stretched, black stockings, for example, 
mimics Robert Morris' hanging felt pieces, while revealing the premeditated 
exactitude of so-called "Anti-Form." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet one can't help but feel that Greenwald should be moving in another 
direction, away from such well-trodden territory and materials, and toward a 
newer aesthetic. Her work thus far certainly suggests that she possesses the 
cleverness, the sensitivity, and the sense of direction to do precisely that.

<P>
 * Abstract Photos: At G. Ray Hawkins, Sally Gall's black-and-white landscape 
photographs work against type. Here, place is rendered all but irrelevant. 
Instead of heightening the beauty of the lagoons of Bali, the vertiginousness 
of the cliffs of Etretat, or the moodiness of the coast of Scotland, Gall 
transforms these sites into components of her own conceptual schemes. 
</P>
<P>
 For a die-hard romanticist, Gall is unusually enamored of geometric 
abstraction. And so, a patch of water in a grassy field in Harris becomes an 
inverted triangle of white against black; a pair of mountaintops in Glen Coe is 
transmuted into a cycle of endless regression; and the famous cliffs at 
Etretat, seen from above, carve out a near-perfect ellipse. 
</P>
<P>
 Gall is also interested in the kind of trompe l'oeil effects generated by 
reflections in water. In one astonishing scene at Bukit Jata, a mirror image of 
clouds in a lagoon is so uncanny one cannot be sure the photograph isn't upside 
down. Trees reflected in the water in Bayou make up another optical illusion; 
it is impossible to determine where the sinewy trunks end and the wavering 
reflections begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly Gall's favorite visual conceit, however, is freezing fluid or 
ephemeral forms -- a river as sleek and unruffled as a pane of glass; a 
waterfall as solid as the rocky mass behind it; a line of surf stitched as 
tightly as a seam. Transforming the dynamic into the static is, of course, 
photography's mandate; Gall takes this generic truth and transforms it, in 
turn, into poetry. Admittedly, the work is undercut by Gall's rather formulaic 
approach to conceptualism -- and thereby, to beauty. It is, however, her 
insistence upon the poetic that redeems it. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 * Lightbody's Collages: Along with Byzantine mosaics, the spires of Salisbury 
Cathedral and Bruce Conner's inkblot drawings, Joyce Lightbody's new work 
stands as a monument -- albeit microcosmic -- to the magnificent obsessiveness 
of the artist. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine, small collages now on view at Food House are composed of tiny bits 
of stamps: free-floating numerals and neoclassical facades; decorative borders 
and fierce animals; Lincoln's profile and luscious fruits. These miscellaneous 
image fragments are interspersed with tightly plotted graphs of x 's and o 's, 
musical notes, accented phonemes and mathematical formulas -- all of which, 
like a lure, dangle meaning before us, only to trap us within someone else's 
private reverie. 
</P>
<P>
 These frustratingly beautiful works demonstrate not only the artist's 
paradigmatic compulsiveness, but the viewer's insatiable perversity. We 
willingly succumb to Lightbody's demand for intimacy, moving in so close that 
we practically caress the images with our eyes. Yet all we see is a promise 
fated to remain unfulfilled. Here, our own desire is swallowed up by the desire 
of another, masquerading as an explosion of colors, forms and symbols. In 
brilliantly condensed strokes, Lightbody sketches a picture of the interaction 
between artist and viewer that rings so true it's frightening.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Funeral services will be held today for Donald A. Sears, 70, professor 
emeritus of English at Cal State Fullerton.  
</P>
<P>
 Sears, who joined the Fullerton faculty in 1967, died Sunday of heart failure 
at his home in Montecito, Cal State Fullerton officials said.He won the 
university's outstanding professor award in 1981 and served as the chairman of 
the linguistics department and Faculty Council (now the Academic Senate).

 The author of hundreds of books, poems, monographs, articles and book reviews, 
Sears earned his doctorate from Harvard University, Cal State Fullerton 
spokeswoman Pam McLaren said. He taught at Dartmouth College, Howard University 
and Ahmadu Bello University in Nigeria, among other institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Poetry anthologists have called Sears a master of craftsmanship, McLaren said. 
His poetry won awards in the All Nations Poetry Contest, the New Worlds Poetry 
Contest and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Topic of his articles have ranged from American values and frontier history to 
music, McLaren said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his "Winter Solstice," Sears pondered about solitude affecting people on a 
rainy day. 
</P>
<P>

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; RESCUE A NOVEL SCHOOL PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's hard to figure out just how such a promising gain for Santa Ana as the 
state's first designated "space-saver" school project has turned into a 
potential loss.  
</P>
<P>
 The state officials who must approve a public school in a mall have moved 
closer than ever to sounding the death knell for the project. There may be 
blame to go around both in Sacramento and in Santa Ana for not previously 
communicating more effectively. But what the Santa Ana Unified School District 
must do now is come to terms with the state's objections and try somehow to 
salvage victory. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Leroy A. Greene (D-Carmichael) was author of the enabling 
legislation in 1989, but after Santa Ana was well along the way to becoming the 
first district to build a space-saver school, things turned suddenly sour. Two 
months ago, when The Times reported on local and state concerns about the cost, 
Greene said he doubted the state would spend that kind of money for the type of 
school he envisioned. Santa Ana officials appeared not to have heard the 
senator clearly. This week, Greene objected to Santa Ana's plans to tear down 
two stores in the mall and rebuild them at state expense. 
</P>
<P>
 Space-saver schools would be several stories high, located in malls or perhaps 
an industrial park and share facilities such as parking lots. The intent was to 
avoid the expense, length and trauma of condemning residential property to 
build schools. The concept is good, but the $22.7-million price has raised 
legitimate concerns at the local and state level. Yet this week, the school 
district's top facilities planner said he was not aware of the state's concerns 
about tearing down stores despite earlier warnings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana Unified School District desperately needs new schools and state 
money to build them. Although the district said the mall is the only adequate 
site, it should look again at other locations and ask the state for more time 
to make the space-saver concept work. And if it gets an extension, it should 
make sure Sacramento knows what is going on in Santa Ana every step of the way.

RANGERS, DELAY CAN'T STOP ANGELS; BASEBALL: SMITH, FABREGAS PROVIDE KEY 
10TH-INNING HITS TO BEAT TEXAS, 8-6, IN COMPLETION OF SUSPENDED GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Dwight Smith hit a run-scoring single and Jorge Fabregas hit a two-run double 
in the 10th inning Wednesday night as the Angels defeated the Texas Rangers, 
8-6, in the completion of a suspended game. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams were tied after eight innings, 5-5, when the game was suspended at 
1:10 a.m. Wednesday because of the American League curfew, which prevents an 
inning from starting after 1 a.m. on a team's first trip in. 
</P>
<P>
 Salmon, who went four for five with a triple and a double, singled with one 
out against Kevin Brown (2-6) and Chili Davis walked. Smith, batting for Spike 
Owen, singled to left for the go-ahead run. One out later, Fabregas doubled to 
right-center. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Butcher (2-0) pitched 3 1/3 innings, giving up a 10th-inning run-scoring 
single to Manuel Lee. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was delayed 2 hours, 48 minutes by rain Tuesday night. Bruce Hurst 
made his Ranger starting debut and gave up two runs and six hits in 2 2/3 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
 The 36-year-old left-hander, making his first American League appearance since 
1988, agreed to a minor-league contract on Dec. 21 and was purchased from the 
Rangers' Oklahoma City farm club prior to Tuesday's start after three effective 
minor-league outings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels tied the score at 5-5 in the seventh when Gary DiSarcina singled 
and Damion Easley followed with his fourth home run of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Henke pitched to the final batter Tuesday night, but he felt discomfort in 
his right shoulder Wednesday and was replaced by Brown, who had been scheduled 
to throw on the side.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Andre Agassi was ousted in the second round of the Italian Open by unseeded 
Stefano Pescosolido, 6-3, 1-6, 6-3, Wednesday in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 Agassi had lost in the first round of the Monte Carlo Open in April. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't been comfortable on clay yet," Agassi said. "I wouldn't expect to 
do well at the French playing this way." 
</P>
<P>
 The French Open begins May 23. 
</P>
<P>
 Agassi, who was seeded only No. 12 because of his five-month absence from the 
tour because of an injury, joined fifth-seeded Michael Chang on the Italian 
Open sidelines. Chang bowed, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4), to Jacco Eltingh. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-seeded Pete Sampras and second-seeded Michael Stich won to reach the round 
of 16. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Two-time defending champion Steffi Graf beat Ginger Helgeson, 6-2, 6-2, to 
move into the quarterfinals of the German Open on clay in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
 Gabriela Sabatini was a 6-4, 6-0 winner over Kimberly Po, moving into the 
third round.

BLUE CHIPS TUMBLE ON WEAK AUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stocks prices tumbled and bond yields soared Wednesday as Wall Street reacted 
to a disappointing Treasury auction. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 27.37 points to end at 3,629.04 as 
skittish traders found no incentives to follow through on Tuesday's 27-point 
gain. Tuesday's rise had snapped a four-session losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, losers swamped gainers by about 7 to 3 in the closing 
New York Stock Exchange tally. Big Board volume came to 277.41 million shares, 
up from Tuesday's 295.62 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping with the recent pattern, stocks were tied to bonds, which sold off 
after a 10-year notes auction met with soft demand. 
</P>
<P>
 The bellwether 30-year Treasury bond yield hit 7.64%, the highest since 
November, 1992, before giving up some gains later to end at 7.59% up from 7.49% 
at Tuesday's close. Its price, which moves in the opposite direction, dropped 1 
3/32 point, or $10.94 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond prices crumbled after the Treasury issued the poor results of its 10-year 
note auction, the second sale in a two-part financing operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Fewer buyers than expected were attracted to the auction and the average yield 
on the new notes rocketed to the highest level in two years, hitting 7.36%, up 
from 5.92% at the last auction on Feb. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact on the bond market was immediate; the 30-year Treasury issue 
retreated sharply before recouping a bit. 
</P>
<P>
 Also dragging down the prices of long-term bonds was a spike in precious 
metals prices, a harbinger of inflation. Gold prices gained $3.00 an ounce to 
$381.80 on the New York Comex. Silver closed at $5.434, up 15 cents from 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no catalyst that would make one want to buy stocks here," said Guy 
Truicko, equity portfolio manager at Unity Management. 
</P>
<P>
 Market sentiment was briefly buoyed after Germany cut a half point off its key 
discount and Lombard rates Wednesday, raising speculation that the Federal 
Reserve would follow quickly with an interest rate hike in a coordinated 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 Tumbling technology stocks led to a sharper drop in secondary stocks. The 
Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller stocks, fell 8.00 points to 717.00. 
</P>
<P>
 After Germany's Bundesbank cut a half point off its discount and Lombard rates 
on Wednesday, stock market traders speculated that the Fed would follow up 
quickly to raise interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 But the lack of a Fed action added to investors' anxiety over how aggressively 
the central bank would move to cool the economy, analysts said. "There's still 
a lot of question in a lot of people's minds as to when the Fed is going to 
come in here and what they're going to do," said Philip Orlando, senior vice 
president of First Capital Advisers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed is widely expected to announces a hike in rates by the May 17 meeting 
of its Federal Open Market Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Utility stocks continued to spiral downward, hit by deregulation and 
competition leading to concern over the group's dividends. Commonwealth Edison 
fell 1 to 22 1/8, Houston Industries dropped 1 3/4 to 30 and Public Service 
Enterprise Group tumbled 1 to 25 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Computer disk drive makers fell after the brokerage house Robertson Stephens 
downgraded Conner Peripherals, which fell 1 5/8 to 12 1/4, and Quantum, which 
slipped 1 1/4 to 14 1/2. Other disk drive stocks weak on the day included 
Western Digital, down 1 1/2 to 13 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Caterpillar gained 3/8 to 107 1/8 after Merrill Lynch upgraded the stock's 
investment rating. 
</P>
<P>
 * Philip Morris dropped 1 3/4 to 47 1/2 and American Brands retreated 1 3/8 to 
30 3/4 after the brokers, Wheat First Butcher Singer downgraded the group, 
citing a negative atmosphere for the industry in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Trading overseas offered little to inspire Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico City's Bolsa index, weighed down by falling U.S. stock prices and 
concerns U.S. interest rates, fell 33.52 points, or 1.51%, to close at 2179.57. 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei average closed up 232.35 points at 20,150.13. In 
Frankfurt, the 30-share DAX average rose 8.48 points to end at 2,243.63, while 
London's Financial Times 100-share average fell 5.8 points to 3,130.5. 
</P>
<P>
 Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index surged through the 8,900 resistence level as 
institutional buying intensified. The blue-chip indicator climbed 366.07 points 
to close the day at 8,906.16. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the dollar closed mostly lower despite the cut in key German 
interest rates. In New York, the dollar fell to 104.33 Japanese yen and 1.669 
German marks, from 104.40 yen and 1.674 marks respectively on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar reversed Tuesday's sharp climb, which had represented the first 
significant strength in the U.S. currency in a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said the dollar's decline Wednesday began shortly after Germany's 
central bank lowered two key interest rates by a half percentage point to their 
lowest levels in five years. Other European central banks followed suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders had expected that would help the greenback as well as stimulate 
business activity in Europe. Lowering German interest rates tends to make the 
German mark less attractive against other currencies and thus helps the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the dollar failed to rise, traders sold despite the good news, said 
Bob Lynch a currency analyst at MMS International.

LAUGH LINES; SEEKING A KERNEL OF TRUTH IN OILY SITUATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So, popcorn makes you fat as a house. Wow. Maybe that's why they call it a 
"medium-sized tub." 
</P>
<P>
 According to a survey by the Center for Science in the Public Interest: You go 
to a theater, and you've got your eye on a bag of Milk Duds about the size of a 
collie, but you spurn the candy and buy popcorn instead, thinking you're on 
high moral ground. Except it turns out the stuff is popped in coconut oil, 
which is so full of grease that eating it is like lying under your car, 
loosening the crankcase nut and opening your mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of extremely oily things, I cannot help but wonder whether the 
President of the United States might need a little work on his romantic 
technique. 
</P>
<P>
 (Urgent fairness alert: The editors of this column wish to make it clear that 
the sexual harassment lawsuit filed against the President is merely an unproven 
allegation, and it would be wrong to draw from it any conclusions whatsoever 
about his guilt, or his character, or his personality, or whether or not he has 
all the savoir-faire of a hippopotamus. Thank you.) 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, if we are to believe the allegations of this accuser (a woman who 
looks like the neighborhood girl even Tonya Harding's mother warned her to stay 
away from), then we must believe that Clinton had an intermediary tell her that 
she "made his knees knock," passed her a note with his hotel room number and 
then, by way of introduction, removed his pants. 
</P>
<P>
 God, that's smooth. 
</P>
<P>
 What about dinner? What about conversation? "You make my knees knock" isn't 
conversation -- it's a Little Richard lyric. 
</P>
<P>
 What about poetry? Writing a hotel room number on a piece of paper and sending 
it over with a state trooper is not exactly, "But soft, what light through 
yonder window breaks? 
</P>
<P>
 It is the East and Juliet is the sun." It just wouldn't have been the same if 
Romeo had said, "Babe! Room 1732." 
</P>
<P>
 But simply dropping your pants? Who'd he call for advice on that one, Teddy 
Kennedy? 
</P>
<P>
 If it's true, that would make Clarence (Coke Can) Thomas look like David 
Niven. 
</P>
<P>
 I want to sign up for the Arkansas School of Smooth Seduction, where you too 
can learn how to score big with babes who get their hair curled with a 
Fry-Baby. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's take the most common dating situation: You're in a bar. You spot a woman 
with enough lipstick to paint a barn. 
</P>
<P>
 Step 1. You say you're the governor of Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 Step 2. You compliment her on how good she looks in artificial light. 
</P>
<P>
 Step 3. You take your pants off. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, say you're at the billboard convention, and you see a woman who makes your 
knees knock. 
</P>
<P>
 Step 1. You say you're the governor of Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 Step 2. You ask, "What's your sign? Get it . . . What's your sign?" 
</P>
<P>
 Step. 3. You take your pants off. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, toughest conquest of all, you meet a woman at the law library and fall 
head over heels in lust with her. You know she's classy, and you want this to 
be perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 Step 1. You painstakingly research her schedule and find out she's an honors 
graduate from Vassar who leads a study group in Interpreting the Uniform 
Commercial Code. 
</P>
<P>
 Step 2. You quit your job at Blockbuster Video, take and pass the law boards, 
buy a custom-tailored Brooks Brothers suit, enroll in her class, join the study 
group and wangle your way into the seat next to hers by telling her you are the 
son of Antonin Scalia. 
</P>
<P>
 Step 3. You take your pants off. 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, this subject of clumsy seduction brings to mind that scene in the 
movie "Diner" when Boogie Sheftel, played by Mickey Rourke, comes on to a girl 
in a rather crude though straightforward fashion in a darkened movie theater. 
Remember? It involved the strategic utilization of a box of popcorn. 
</P>
<P>
 Didn't think I'd find a way back, did you?

 The Look: The most elegant pantsuit has to be the one TV's Murphy Brown is so 
fond of -- double-breasted, with a plunging shawl collar. The most daring 
working girls wear nothing but an amazing necklace underneath. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Do It Big: Giorgio Armani does a rich lightweight wool crepe pantsuit in 
taupe, white, creme, navy and, of course, black. It costs $1,975. The glass 
bead lariat necklace is $350. At $16.50, the macrame shoulder bag is a bargain. 
The whole ensemble is available at the Giorgio Armani boutique on Rodeo Drive 
and at I. Magnin, both in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Total price: $2,341.50.

 Do It Budget: It's rare to find an inexpensive pantsuit that looks as if it's 
been made by expert Italian tailors. This jacket in a blend of 50% wool and 50% 
polyester is only $39.95 at the Hit or Miss store in Century City's ABC 
Entertainment Center. (A matching short skirt is $14.99.) The pleated pants in 
100% taupe wool gabardine are by San Francisco designer Ceceilia Hsu for CEZU. 
They're cut beautifully for $118, and can be special ordered through B. Magness 
in Newport Beach. The glass beaded necklace is a handmade concoction fashioned, 
for a total of $50, from a necklace, two bracelets and a pair of earrings from 
Pier 1 Imports, citywide. This $10 macrame bag is from Bun-Ka Do, a little shop 
in Little Tokyo.

FASHION / SCREEN STYLE: WIDOW DRESSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY GOODWIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Movie: "Widow's Peak." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Setup: Glamour girl Edwina Broome (Natasha Richardson, pictured above 
right) moves into a small Irish town called Widow's Peak, in reference to its 
population skew, and sets tongues a-wagging. Among the townsfolk in this '20s 
comedic whodunit are grande dame-ish Mrs. Doyle-Counihan (Joan Plowright, above 
left) and Miss O'Hare (Mia Farrow, below), a poor spinster. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Costume Designer: Dublin-based Consolata Boyle, who works regularly in the 
Irish theater and whose movie credits include "The Playboys," "The Snapper" and 
"Into the West." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Look: Whose clothes will elicit more oohs and aahs? It's a tossup. Edwina 
wears streamlined shifts (predecessors of today's raging hot slip dresses), 
some tasseled, some heavily beaded and some unadorned. Miss O'Hare dresses in 
more humble Irish linen and crocheted ensembles, topped with floppy hats and 
cloches. As head widow, so to speak, Doyle-Counihan dresses all in black but 
without relinquishing her own glamour. She sports almost-mad-looking black hats 
overladen with decoration. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia: Edwina is a seductress, but Boyle doesn't exploit the obvious. She 
does make her coatless, so as not to conceal her shape and "to give the feeling 
that she's not affected by the elements, that she's not quite grounded, that 
she's lighter than air," Boyle explains. And she does give her dresses that are 
always slipping off her shoulders, plus the appearance that she isn't wearing 
any underwear. (She's actually wearing a slip.) "Just by Natasha's sheer 
physical presence in a (conservative) town, you almost have to do nothing. 
That's what designing is ," Boyle says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Good Hair Day / Bad Hair Day: Richardson is naturally endowed with gorgeous 
hair, and Edwina's feminine dos take full advantage. Her hair is either coiled, 
twisted or pinned in place with combs of bone, ivory or Bakelite. Farrow, not 
so fortunately blessed, gets stuck for the whole movie with a sort of 
frizzed-out Manhattan bob. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Inspiration: "I do a vast amount of research," Boyle says, including 
consulting private photo albums, period Irish pictorial magazines and other 
visuals found in Dublin at the National Library, Trinity College Library and 
the department of folklore at University College. Also, in London, the British 
Museum, the Victoria & Albert Museum and Hulton Picture Library. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sources: All of Edwina's dresses were made from period fabrics, then sewn 
together in London and Dublin, along with the other principal costumes. 
Crocheted pieces and jewelry are all period, including Bakelite bangles, pearls 
and garnet, jet and glass beads. BETTY GOODWIN

BOOK REVIEW / NONFICTION; WHY WE LIVE WHERE WE LIVE AND WHY THAT EVEN MATTERS; 
TO MAKE A HOUSE A HOME BY JANE DAVISON AND LESLEY DAVISON ; RANDOM HOUSE 
$27.50, 320 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 I love this book, which is not to say that it's perfect -- only that it's 
perfectly wonderful, for all its imperfections, just like a cozy family 
homestead. 
</P>
<P>
 Author Jane Davison published an earlier edition of this book as "The Fall of 
a Doll's House" in 1980, and her daughter, Leslie, has updated it for this 
republication with a single, final chapter about how her generation regards the 
family domicile differently than her mother, and her mother's mother, did.  
</P>
<P>
 The important part of the text is what the late Jane Davison wrote -- about 
why we live where we live, and how women's lives are tied up in that place, 
whatever it is. The downside of the relationship -- the aspect of it that's 
gotten all the loud press for the past 20 years -- is that women have been 
considered wholly responsible for the home, often to the exclusion of anything 
else they might want to do. 
</P>
<P>
 But well-publicized domestic oppression has an interesting, under-explored 
flip side: Some women who give themselves over to their homes develop an 
intimate, idiosyncratic appreciation of their environment. Some fall in love, 
not because society told them to, but because they couldn't help themselves. 
Men, by comparison, seem like transients, and worse off for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Davison's various homes are like people -- demanding, undependable, sometimes 
overbearing. She broke off love affairs because one too many things went wrong, 
or because suddenly she felt like she needed a change. 
</P>
<P>
 And she was always curious, always looking at people and their habitats: She 
once got on a bus from Boston to Los Angeles "full of faith that a brief but 
panoramic trip away from home would provide "insights" and above all 
"perspective," that wonderful all-purpose commodity. 
</P>
<P>
 When she ran errands she drove home not by the most efficient route but along 
surface streets, so she could see people, at dusk, when house lights were on, 
inhabiting their spaces. She was fascinated by the way we all fit on the 
domestic stage. 
</P>
<P>
 It's Davison's quirky passion that makes the book so irresistible (at least to 
those of us, like the author, who have always dreamed of someday building a 
house). 
</P>
<P>
 She understands that women have strained to free themselves from compulsory 
housework since time immemorial; in her opening chapter she considers Nora, who 
walked out on house and family in Ibsen's play, "A Doll's House," and discusses 
her own decision to move her family out of a house, as though the structure 
would suffocate them.  
</P>
<P>
 But she also knows -- deeply, emotionally, illogically -- how a woman can be 
in thrall to her house, how her emotional life manifests itself in blue trim 
for the French doors or a Pegboard in the kids' room. 
</P>
<P>
 And one fond nod to her writing style: Reading Jane Davison is like having an 
endless cup of coffee with your most articulate, sarcastic, cunning friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Her prose seems to me the literary equivalent of a vast, florid paisley shawl 
-- colorful yet disciplined, emotional but precise, mindful of the restrictions 
of the form but never a slave to them. Yes, she goes on too long, and yes, she 
gets off track for so long that the detour becomes the main drag, but I didn't 
much care.  
</P>
<P>
 Her daughter Lesley is perhaps more cautious than her mother was. She made her 
first renter's mistake early on, renovating an apartment with such verve that 
the landlord upped the rent and forced her and her roommate to find another 
place. Since then she has moved often, refusing to make a commitment to a home 
lest her heart be broken. 
</P>
<P>
 The one priceless contribution she makes to the text is a note her mother had 
written to herself six months before her death. I won't spoil it by 
paraphrasing her observations on "death as a destination." I will only say that 
her notion of the final scene she'd like to play is one of the most endearing 
bits of end game prose imaginable, a perfect fantasy for a woman to whom 
environment was all. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is a God, and if he or she has time to attend to the occasional 
individual exit, I only hope Jane Davison got what she wanted. Her book will 
make you think long, hard, and with humor about where you are and whether 
you're happy.

O.C POP BEAT / MIKE BOEHM: PLENTY OF ROCK ALBUMS TELL STORY, TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Both the trophy cases and the cutout bins of rock history are well-stocked 
with efforts to turn the simple rock 'n' roll album into something much bigger: 
a story, a play, an opus. The Who's "Tommy," currently at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center, was the first to go legit with a Broadway staging. 
</P>
<P>
 With "Tommy" on the local boards, here is a rundown -- not intended to be 
comprehensive -- of some other rock albums you can hunt up if you feel like 
hearing a story and a big beat at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 For our purposes, only albums written and preformed by bona fide rockers 
count; no theatrical interlopers like Andrew Lloyd Webber and the "Hair" gang 
allowed. We're also sticking to albums that, while they may not have been 
staged, manage to include enough story development to have made a theatrical 
adaptation possible. Excluded are albums such as Prince's "Purple Rain" that 
don't stand alone as narratives but rely on accompanying films or texts for 
most of their plot and character development. 
</P>
<P>
 Ratings range from * (poor) to ***** (a classic). Three stars denote a solid 
recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 ***** The Beach Boys, "Pet Sounds" (1966). The first rock album to hang 
together as a story. Working with lyricist Tony Asher, Brian Wilson told a tale 
of young love that blooms ("Wouldn't It Be Nice"), staggers ("You Still Believe 
in Me") and ends in crushing disillusionment ("Caroline, No"). Along the way, 
the song cycle captures much of the idealism, anxiety, self-doubt and elevated 
passion that come with growing up. One of rock's most moving and beautiful 
achievements. 
</P>
<P>
 *** Pretty Things, "S.F. Sorrow" (1968). One of the original British Invasion 
bands, the Pretty Things made the then-common, but in retrospect remarkable, 
progression from imitating their blues and R&B influences to broadening rock's 
possibilities with a swirl of folk, psychedelic and music hall-ish elements. 
This album's nebulous story sends protagonist S.F. Sorrow off to World War I, 
where he apparently is killed off by the end of Side 1, setting the stage for 
much metaphysical and darkly philosophic musing the rest of the way. This is 
worth hunting up as a musically well-wrought artifact of the period, with 
strong parallels to the sound that Traffic and the Who were creating around the 
same time. 
</P>
<P>
 ***** The Who, "Tommy" (1969). A story this preposterous could only be carried 
by music this strong. Catatonic kid becomes pinball-playing savant, wakes up, 
gathers cultic following, and is overthrown when he starts making testy demands 
of his disciples. In terms of dramatic development, Tommy himself is virtually 
a cipher; some of the more vivid scenes belong to his tormentors, Cousin Kevin, 
Uncle Ernie and the Acid Queen. Ultimately, Townshend has a valid point to make 
about the solitary nature of spiritual questing: Disaster befalls Tommy when he 
tries to bring others along on his spiritual journey, but even after his fall, 
he remains a faithful searcher on his own personal path to enlightenment. The 
album is based on riffs and melodies of enduring appeal and is brilliantly sung 
by Townshend, Roger Daltry and John Entwistle (Keith Moon is wonderful, too, in 
his comic turn as Uncle Ernie). The main problem is the production, which is a 
tad too neat. The thunder and ferocity the Who could muster in the late '60s is 
largely absent. Get "Tommy," by all means, but also get "The Who Sell Out" and 
"Live at Leeds" for the full picture. 
</P>
<P>
 **** 1/2 The Who, "Quadrophenia" (1973). Townshend set aside messianic musings 
and wrote about something he knew: the teen-subculture conflicts of mid-'60s 
England that swirled around the Who during its formative days. "Quadrophenia" 
traces the progress of one mixed-up kid trying to find himself amid the 
brawling and boozing of the rival Rocker and Mod factions. Such peak rock songs 
as "The Real Me" and "5:15" find the Who in good, brawny form. But Townshend 
had fallen in love with synthesizers by this point, which left some selections 
sounding a bit overstuffed. 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Townshend, "The Iron Man" (1989, * 1/2) and "Psychoderelict" (1993, ***). 
As he moved into a post-Who career, Townshend remained bitten by the 
theatrical-album bug. A 1985 album, "White City," had a unifying concept (a 
visit to a housing project in a hard-pressed section of London), but the story 
didn't take shape without Townshend's accompanying notes. "The Iron Man," his 
adaptation of a children's story by Ted Hughes, stands as an example of just 
how bad rock can be when it aspires to be theater first and rock 'n' roll 
second. The music is toothless and diffuse; the only memorable moments in the 
whole bland affair are cameos by John Lee Hooker (as the heroic Iron Man, who 
chomps on anything made of metal that's threatening to humanity) and Nina 
Simone. With "Psychoderelict," conceived as a radio play, Townshend once again 
wrote whereof he knew, telling the tale of a jaded, aging rock superstar's 
attempt to make a comeback and recapture an idealistic spark. It's a plot-heavy 
potboiler, but a number of sharp rock songs and attractive ballads make it a 
partial comeback for Townshend himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kinks, "Arthur (or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire" (1969, 
*****) and "Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround (Part One)" (1970, 
*****). The excellent "Arthur" offers rich historical sweep and a funny and 
poignant portrait of a struggling British Everyman who watches his family fall 
apart as his nation's economy hits the skids. Written as the soundtrack for a 
television drama, it's more a "Purple Rain"-style companion piece than a 
stand-alone work, but it is perhaps the most insightful and least escapist of 
all rock concept albums, and it launched bandleader Ray Davies on a long string 
of narrative works. "Lola Versus Powerman" tells the story of a young British 
rocker of humble beginnings and high ambition who achieves stardom only to wind 
up feeling used and abused by the music business in particular and modern life 
in general. It's carried by excellent and varied material, coupled with the 
Kinks' lean, bristling performances. The song "Lola" appears in the middle of 
the tale as the protagonist's career-making hit -- a function it also filled 
for the Kinks in real life. 
</P>
<P>
 *** The Kinks, "Preservation" (1973-74). The Kinks issued this opus in two 
parts, then took the show on the road, becoming one of the rare bands to record 
a theatrical album and turn it into a self-produced, self-contained piece of 
live theater. As a rock album, "Preservation" is a middling effort by the 
Kinks' standards. But as a stage production, it was a marvel. Davies, one of 
rock's warmest performers and biggest hams, clearly relished the central role 
of Mr. Flash, a greedy but charming scalawag who rises from petty gangster to 
crooked real estate tycoon. Flash gets his comeuppance at the hands of Mr. 
Black, a moralizing crusader who roots out Flash's colorful brand of corruption 
only to install a bleak, totalitarian regime. Not bad as political parable, OK 
as rock music, splendid as theater. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kinks, "Soap Opera" (1975, ** 1/2) and "Schoolboys in Disgrace" (1975, 
***). "Soap Opera" was sub-par musically but, again, the Kinks redeemed it with 
a vibrant and imaginative stage show that relied on Davies' aplomb as a showman 
(the band wasn't big enough to afford elaborate, pricey technical effects). The 
piece satirizes the concept of celebrity with its tale of a glitzy show-biz 
hero, the Starmaker, who turns out to be a mere construct of a humdrum 
white-collar working man's imagination. "Schoolboys" is a catchier collection, 
but its premise is thin: Davies, overly infatuated with his "Preservation" 
protagonist, spun a little tale about the boyhood trauma that started Mr. Flash 
on his criminal career. 
</P>
<P>
 *** 1/2 David Bowie, "The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From 
Mars" (1972). Not much of a plot here, as Bowie sketchily depicts the meteoric 
career of the decadent, sexually ambiguous, possibly extraterrestrial Ziggy. 
The album served mainly as a springboard for the decadent, sexually ambiguous, 
mock-extraterrestrial persona that Bowie rode to stardom. Although "Ziggy" 
includes the pounding "Suffragette City," Bowie was more concerned here with 
stagy musical settings that gave free rein to his theatrical vocal style. 
</P>
<P>
 ***** Lou Reed, "Berlin" (1973). One of the most sordid stories ever told in 
rock music, "Berlin" soars (or wallows) on the strength of Reed's brilliant 
characterization of its narrator. Set to a combination of edgy, sparse rock 
songs and deliberately bombastic orchestrations, the story depicts a couple 
bent on mutual humiliation and destruction. Caroline, a drug-addled, habitually 
unfaithful nightclub singer, drives her husband (the narrator) to a vengeful 
betrayal of his own. She winds up a suicide but maintains some dignity during 
her descent. Dubbing himself "the water boy" ("I'm just the water boy/the real 
game's not over here"), the narrator appears in the end as a morally shriveled, 
hollow man unable to take responsibility for the disaster he has brought down. 
An album with the richness of a fine prose story, but not for the squeamish. 
</P>
<P>
 **** Electric Light Orchestra, "Eldorado" (1974). One of the best marriages of 
a rock band with a sweeping orchestra, "Eldorado" is an ode to the power of 
fantasy. A bank clerk dreams away his dull life, escaping into a world of 
dashing adventure that's part Oz, part Camelot. By the end, his escape is 
complete, as he enters the world of imagination vowing never to return. 
</P>
<P>
 ** 1/2 Genesis, "The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway" (1974). Despite some prime 
progressive rock moments, this opus ultimately founders on a flimsy story by 
Peter Gabriel that is both nebulous and outlandish. A New York street kid named 
Rael is spray-painting his tag all over Times Square when he suddenly is 
swallowed into a subterranean world. There, he is alternately imprisoned, 
enchanted and tormented until, unaccountably, he discovers the true meaning of 
life (which Gabriel doesn't bother to spell out). Gabriel left Genesis after 
"The Lamb" and sharpened his focus considerably by the time he launched his 
much-praised solo career in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 *** Willie Nelson, "Red Headed Stranger" (1975). Driven mad by a romantic 
betrayal, lovable Willie's fictitious alter-ego goes on a bloody rampage 
throughout Side 1, gunning down his wife, her lover and a prostitute (and you 
thought gangsta rap was bad). On Side 2, he finds a new territory, a new love, 
and a new lease on life. This is a heartwarming tale of redemption -- or a 
morally bankrupt, willfully anti-tragic farce, depending on how you look at it. 
More important than the story is the musical style Nelson used to tell it: a 
low-key, simply arranged, almost folkish approach that marked a radical break 
from the overheated production style common in '70s Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
 ** Emmylou Harris, "The Ballad of Sally Rose" (1985). Harris has had a 
marvelous career in country music, but this labored song-cycle isn't one of its 
high points. There's many a plot twist but little memorable music. The songs 
recount the career of an unwanted girl who finds love with a musician and loses 
him, first to infidelity and then to a fatal car wreck, whereupon she labors 
mightily to become a star herself so she might keep alive the flame of her dead 
husband's greatness. Some of this unlikely myth is spun loosely from Harris' 
relationship with her own ill-fated mentor, Gram Parsons. 
</P>
<P>
 **** Pink Floyd, "The Wall" (1979). Roger Waters' bitter dystopia of the mind 
portrays an isolated rock star sinking into madness and megalomania. Pink Floyd 
performed it on stage with the help of a lavish array of props, then saw it 
expanded into a film. The album is laden with prosy filler delivered in Waters' 
half-spoken bark. But there are enough memorable songs, among them "Another 
Brick in the Wall" and "Comfortably Numb," to justify its legendary status. 
</P>
<P>
 ** Roger Waters, "Radio KAOS" (1987). After "The Wall," Waters kept the 
concept albums coming. "The Final Cut," his forgettable last album with Pink 
Floyd, was a screed against militarism. "The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking," his 
solo debut in 1984, was an album-length dream sequence on the theme of sexual 
desire and marital infidelity, distinguished chiefly by some excellent lead 
guitar work by Eric Clapton. Scenes from "Pros and Cons" might have played 
theatrically, but the album is too vague to qualify as a narrative work. "Radio 
KAOS" does sustain a plot as Waters imagines his hero, an electronics and 
computer wiz named Billy, seizing control of the global communications grid to 
create a fearsome illusion of nuclear destruction. It is Waters' most hopeful 
album: In the end, it appears that the world's powers have been scared off 
their path of mutually assured destruction. With "Amused to Death," from 1992, 
Waters was again conceptualizing bleakly, envisioning a humanity dulled by its 
own mass-entertainment options. Like all of his work since "The Wall," it is a 
melodically dry album that underscores how important former partner David 
Gilmour's melodic gifts had been.

 'Til dessert do they part: Actress Drew Barrymore, we're sure you heard, has 
filed for divorce in L.A. Superior Court to end her marriage to British bar

SCOTT HARRIS: THE DARK FEARS BEHIND THE CLAS TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The chicken and dumplings were on the stove; the propaganda on the dining 
table. The pot was boiling and so were the parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Debbie Greenfield makes no secret about her dumpling recipe; it requires the 
shredding of flour tortillas. If she could, she'd shred the California Learning 
Assessment System test, and so would her friend Gary Thomason. 
</P>
<P>
 To them, CLAS isn't confidential; it's secretive. To them, CLAS isn't a test; 
it's a tool of Big Brother. It's the worst kind of propaganda, they say: A 
sneak attack on the American family. That's why these West Hills parents won't 
allow their kids to take the exam at Justice Street Elementary School. That's 
why they sued the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the agenda," says Debbie, a 46-year-old mother of three, "is to split 
the family." 
</P>
<P>
 For some parents, Gary worries, "the end result is that . . . Social Services 
comes to your house and your child is taken away." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Such are the darkest fears that fuel the CLAS debate. What began as the ripple 
of protest among the religious right has become a tidal wave of suspicion. Not 
many parents, one suspects, seriously fear that CLAS tests will strip them of 
their children; after all, child abuse may be revealed in a paper titled "My 
Summer Vacation." But plenty of people wonder why the schools won't show 
parents something that is being shown to their kids. 
</P>
<P>
 That's Debbie Greenfield's first complaint. It was only three weeks ago, she 
says, that she heard something on talk radio and asked some questions that made 
her an anti-CLAS firebrand. 
</P>
<P>
 To Debbie, it matters little that a Superior Court judge ruled Tuesday that 
the exam questions do not violate state privacy laws. "It's not over," Debbie 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 That much is obvious. On Wednesday, state Sen. Bill Leonard released copies of 
the CLAS tests. The Department of Education says that would compromise the test 
and cost taxpayers millions of dollars. But at least disclosure should help 
separate the facts and the fantasy of CLAS. 
</P>
<P>
 On this day in Debbie's dining room, there was no way to tell. To Debbie, the 
short story "Just Lather, That's All," by Hernando Torres, should be "R-rated" 
because it depicts a barber's vivid contemplation of slashing an evil 
customer's throat. To Debbie, "The Filipino and the Drunkard," by William 
Saroyan, is "an insult to the American veteran" because, after all, the 
antagonist is a racist drunk who served in World War I. And to her, "Teeny, 
Tiny, Tinny Visitors" by Fonda Crews Bell is the most offensive, because it 
describes little metallic E.T.s who tell a girl that they will "melt ourselves 
down" if not allowed to colonize the Earth. Debbie points out the girl's 
sympathy toward immigrants, but what really bothers her is the reference to 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Debbie admits, any story can be nit-picked. "Little Red Riding Hood," 
after all, features a cross-dressing wolf. And is there a story more rife with 
teen rebellion, gang violence, homicide and suicide than "Romeo and Juliet"? 
</P>
<P>
 But what really angers Debbie are the questions that follow. When students are 
asked to relate these tales to their own life, she asks, isn't that a violation 
of privacy? "It's not the reading material, per se. It's the pumping by the 
state for information," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Susie Lange, a spokeswoman of the state Department of Education, has the 
difficult task of defending CLAS without revealing its contents. Reporters play 
games with her. She can say, for example, that "Just Lather, That's All" and 
"The Filipino and the Drunkard" are not on the CLAS test, but have found their 
way into the CLAS mythology. Another common misconception, she says, is that 
students are asked whether their families own guns. This apparently grew out of 
a pilot exam that included essays that were pro- and anti-gun control. The real 
propaganda, Lange says, is the misinformation spread by the opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Lange tends to talk around some questions, such as the excerpt from Richard 
Wright's "Black Boy," directed toward eighth-graders. This is a first-person 
tale in which a hungry boy, robbed of grocery money by a gang of bullies, 
receives first a slap from his mother and then a stick with which he violently 
defends himself from future attacks. This exercise, it seems, also includes a 
poem called "My Parents" and another titled "Woman With Flower," by Naomi Long 
Madgett: 
</P>
<P>
  
</P>
<P>
 I wouldn't coax the plant if I were you.  
</P>
<P>
 Such watchful nurturing may do it harm . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The leaf's inclined to find its own direction;  
</P>
<P>
 Give it a chance to seek the sunlight for itself.  
</P>
<P>
  
</P>

kids that their parents should learn to leave them alone?

PERSPECTIVE ON AFRICA; A POLICY OF FINE WORDS, NO ACTION; THE CONTINENT IS OFF 
OUR NATIONAL-INTERESTS MAP, BUT ISN'T PUTTING OUR PRINCIPLES TO WORK ALSO IN 
OUR 'INTEREST'? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADONIS E. HOFFMAN, Adonis E. Hoffman is an international lawyer in 
Washington and the the former director of African affairs for the U.S. House of 
Representatives. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The ongoing, but not unpredictable, tragedy in Rwanda -- and America's 
hands-off policy on African conflicts generally -- points up one of the most 
glaring contradictions in U.S. policy on Africa: Officially, the Clinton 
Administration has pledged an "activist approach to disasters in the making" by 
supporting the democracy movement on the continent and helping Africans to deal 
with problems before they became crises; unofficially, the Administration 
regards Africa as not important to our national interests, not even when it 
comes to conflict resolution and preventing loss of life. 
</P>
<P>
 Until a few years ago, U.S. interest in Africa was largely confined to 
supporting friendly -- and frequently repressive -- regimes as bulwarks against 
Soviet adventurism. As the Cold War ended, the United States took even a lesser 
role in African affairs. Somalia was a radical departure, and if the debacle 
there accomplished nothing else, it helped to crystallize the concept that U.S. 
policy in Africa would no longer be interventionist. 
</P>
<P>
 In testimony before Congress in February, the assistant secretary of state for 
African affairs, George Moose, spelled out the Administration's policy goals in 
Africa: "fostering democracy and respect for human rights; promoting peace by 
preventing or resolving conflicts; supporting economic growth and sustainable 
development; providing humanitarian assistance to alleviate suffering and 
hunger; increasing American private-sector involvement in Africa, and 
integrating Africa into the global economy." 
</P>
<P>
 When measured by its own yardstick, U.S. policy toward Africa has fallen 
abysmally short. In practice, it has been little more than a series of adhoc 
equivocations, omissions and missed opportunities that accentuate America's 
global myopia and aversion to leadership, especially in the developing world. 
</P>
<P>
 To give just one example: Last June 12, the people of Nigeria elected their 
first civilian government in a decade. This achievement was promptly negated by 
a military takeover. Nothing about the duly elected government warrants 
Washington's rejection, yet the Administration continues its dalliance with the 
dictators. Nigeria's situation is remarkably similar to Haiti's, with one main 
difference: The United States has pursued a policy of engagement to restore 
democracy in Haiti, a policy of neglect in Nigeria. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside-the-Beltway critics of Clinton's foreign policy ascribe the failures to 
the Adminstration's trepidation, vacillation and inexperience on most matters 
foreign. Foreign-policy experts, however, cite a more callous reason: Matters 
pertaining to Africa are deemed of no importance to our national interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who defend a posture of distance frequently cite a litany of African 
failures: misguided macroeconomic policies; debilitating foreign debt and 
fiscal dependency; incessant internecine strife; corruption; repression and 
human-rights abuses, and abysmal performances on developmental matters such as 
population control, literacy, health and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Others would explain the lack of an engaged policy in purely pragmatic terms: 
Except for South Africa, the United States has no significant economic, trade, 
commercial, military or strategic interests in any country in sub-Saharan 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Objectively, this is true -- at present. Most African states have been at the 
margins of world trade and commerce since achieving their independence 30 years 
ago. For the first 20 of those years, Africa's economic umbilical cords 
remained connected to the former colonial powers. Since 1980, however, Africa's 
role in the world economy has become marginalized as the economies of Western 
and newly industrialized countries bypass African participation. The 
continent's world market share for primary products other than oil dropped from 
7% to 3% between 1970 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Given these post-Cold War economic and political realities, it is clear that 
traditional notions of the national interest will be insufficient to base a 
clarion call for purposeful American participation in Africa's trouble spots. A 
new model must be developed, one that transcends facile contemporary analyses 
that, in their construction and suppositions, always lead to the conclusion 
that America should continue its de facto policy of disengagement.  
</P>
<P>
 Inherently, U.S. foreign policy must be prospective. As it was impossible five 
years ago to envision the break-up of the Soviet Union or the advent of 
majority rule in South Africa, it is not possible to predict where the next 
conflagration in Africa will occur. Even so, a few projections based on fact 
are easy to make: Burundi is headed for the same level of ethnic turmoil as its 
Rwandan twin unless preventive measures are taken. Zaire's wily Mobutu Sese 
Seko will fall or be tumbled, pushing Zaire into even greater anarchy and 
perhaps ethnic bloodshed. Repressive regimes in Uganda, Malawi and Cameroon are 
destined for upheaval. The suppression of a democratically elected civilian 
government in Nigeria is headed for a turnabout. 
</P>
<P>
 These and other potential trouble spots in Africa will cry out for enlightened 
American leadership, if not intervention, either bilaterally or in concert with 
a multilateral authority. Recognizing Frederick the Great's admonition, "He who 
defends everything defends nothing," it is inane to suggest that the United 
States intervene in every sub-national or internecine conflict that flares up 
in Africa or any place else in the world. But unstable political situations 
that portend dramatic loss of life -- as in Rwanda -- should vitiate any notion 
of American detachment or insularity, particularly when doing something would 
be more consistent with our principles than doing nothing.

<P>
 Andre Agassi's clay-court season suffered another jolt Wednesday when he was 
ousted in the second round of the Italian Open at Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 Agassi, committing an unusual number of unforced errors, was eliminated by 
unseeded Stefano Pescosolido of Italy, 6-3, 1-6, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Agassi, who returned to competition this year after a five-month layoff 
because of a wrist injury, also lost in the first round of the Monte Carlo Open 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't been comfortable on clay yet," said Agassi, a two-time French Open 
finalist. "I wouldn't expect to do well at the French playing this way." 
</P>
<P>
 Also losing was fifth-seeded Michael Chang, who was eliminated by Jacco 
Eltingh of the Netherlands, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4). 
</P>
<P>
 Top-seeded Pete Sampras defeated Spaniard Alex Corretja, 6-3, 3-6, 6-3, to 
reach the round of 16. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Bryan Shelton, his powerful serve undeterred by the slow clay courts, upset 
third-seeded MaliVai Washington, 6-3, 2-6, 7-5, to advance to the quarterfinals 
of the America's Red Clay Championships at Coral Springs, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelton, who hadn't made it past the second round in nearly three months, had 
15 aces, including one on match point. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Two-time defending champion Steffi Graf and fourth-seeded Gabriela Sabatini 
rolled to easy straight-set victories in the German Open at Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
 The top-seeded Graf defeated No. 13 Ginger Helgeson, 6-2, 6-2, and Sabatini 
defeated Kimberly Po, 6-4, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixth-seeded Natalie Zvereva of Belarus withdrew because of stomach cramps 
after losing the first set to Ines Gorrochatequi of Argentina, 7-6 (7-4).

SUNS BLISTER ROCKETS WITH RECORD RALLY; NBA PLAYOFFS: BARKLEY SCORES 34 AS 
PHOENIX OVERCOMES 20-POINT DEFICIT IN FINAL QUARTER TO TAKE 2-0 LEAD IN SERIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the biggest fourth-quarter comeback in NBA playoff history, the Phoenix 
Suns rallied from 20 points down Wednesday night to beat the Houston Rockets, 
124-117, in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory gave the Suns a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven series. Only one 
team -- the 1969 Lakers -- has rallied to win a seven-game series after losing 
the first two games at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Games 3 and 4 are Friday and Sunday in Phoenix, where the Suns have won their 
last 13 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't win it now, it's our own fault," said Charles Barkley, who led 
Phoenix with 34 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Johnson had six of his 27 in overtime and Dan Majerle added 22. Hakeem 
Olajuwon led the Rockets with 34 points and 17 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston was leading, 104-84, with 10 minutes left, but the Rockets scored only 
one more field goal in the quarter -- a three-pointer by Sam Cassell with 2:35 
to go. The Suns closed the quarter with a 24-4 run. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach said there isn't anybody over there who wants to shoot, so when Hakeem 
got it, we were all over him like a cheap suit," Barkley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a lot of three-point shooters, we got our fast break going and we 
came back." 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Ainge made a three-point basket with 32.9 seconds left in regulation to 
tie the score, 108-108, and Olajuwon missed one of his trademark fadeaway 
jumpers with 15 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Barkley had a chance to win the game at the end of regulation, but his 15-foot 
high-arching turnaround bounced out at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
 In overtime, Phoenix scored 12 of the first 15 points and the sellout crowd at 
the Summit began to file out with more than a minute left. But Robert Horry and 
Scott Brooks hit consecutive three-pointers to make it 120-117 with 36 seconds 
left. Johnson and Ainge then hit two free throws each to hold off Houston's 
comeback attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Otis Thorpe had 20 points and 10 rebounds, but he fouled out with 1:28 left in 
regulation. His replacement, Carl Herrera, fouled out with 1:36 left in 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston scored only eight points in the fourth quarter, equaling the playoff 
record-low set by the New Jersey Nets against Cleveland last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix trailed by 18 entering the final period, and the Suns' ensuing 
comeback broke the record set by the New York Knicks in 1973 when they 
rebounded from a 16-point deficit after three quarters to beat the Boston 
Celtics in double overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 The two teams combined for 42 three-point attempts in Game 1, setting an NBA 
playoff record. This time, they easily broke that mark by shooting a combined 
22 of 56.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; TEWKSBURY METHODICALLY BEATS YOUNG, CUBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anthony Young throws hard and his record is 6-38 in a major league career that 
began in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Tewksbury throws pitches that wouldn't break the speed limit in a school 
zone, and he is 51-27 since 1991. He also is the first National League pitcher 
to win seven games this season, joining Ben McDonald of the Baltimore Orioles 
as the only seven-game winners in the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't mean anything to me," Tewksbury (7-0) said after scattering seven 
hits in eight innings as the Cardinals beat the Chicago Cubs, 3-2, Wednesday 
night at St. Louis. "When the season's over, I'll look at the total. That will 
mean something to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Tewksbury struck out six and walked two to win for the 11th time in 14 starts 
dating to Aug. 28, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Young (1-3) worked six innings and gave up three runs and nine hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Tewksbury is 9-3 in his career against the Cubs, for whom he pitched in 
1987-88, and he thoroughly frustrated the Chicago hitters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes you think you've got him, and then he makes the good pitches when 
he has to," Cub Manager Tom Trebelhorn said. "He picks the corners and entices 
you to swing at balls. Really, there's nobody like him." 
</P>
<P>
 John Habyan pitched the ninth inning for his first save. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 4, New York 3 -- Darrin Fletcher had three hits and drove in two runs 
to lead the Expos at Montreal and stop the Mets' four-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedro Martinez (2-3) struck out eight in seven innings. Mel Rojas earned his 
ninth save in 10 tries. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco 6, Colorado 1 -- Bill Swift remained perfect in four decisions 
against the Rockies and hit a run-scoring double at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Swift (5-3) scattered 10 hits in six-plus innings, allowing at least one per 
inning. He struck out five and walked two. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Harkey (0-4), who changed uniform numbers from 32 to 27 to try to improve 
his luck, had no luck at all. He gave up four runs and nine hits in four 
innings as Colorado lost for the fourth time in six games. Harkey had been 5-0 
against San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants held a 2-1 lead in the fourth inning, then added three runs on Kirt 
Manwaring's RBI groundout, Swift's run-scoring double over left fielder Howard 
Johnson and Darren Lewis' RBI bunt single to the right side with two out. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 4, Philadelphia 2 -- Deion Sanders weighed his new bats, found they 
were heavier than he was used to, then borrowed David Justice's lighter model 
and hit a two-run homer in the Braves' victory at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred McGriff hit a bases-empty homer in support of Greg Maddux (6-2), who gave 
up both runs and six hits in 6 2/3 as the Braves finished a three-game sweep. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg McMichael pitched two innings for his seventh save in eight chances. 
</P>
<P>
 Curt Schilling (0-6), the MVP of last year's playoffs, gave up all four runs 
and nine hits in seven innings. The Phillies have lost seven of eight overall 
and 11 of 12 road games. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh 5, Florida 1 -- Denny Neagle pitched 7 2/3 strong innings and tied 
a personal best with eight strikeouts, helping the Pirates win in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Neagle (3-4), who began the game with an earned-run average of 5.57, allowed 
four hits, three walks and one run. Rick White completed the five-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Slaught's two-run single capped a three-run fourth inning for the Pirates, 
who snapped Dave Weathers' five-game winning streak. Weathers (5-2) gave up 
nine hits, three walks and three earned runs in 6 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati 9, San Diego 5 -- Bret Boone scored on Barry Larkin's single in the 
sixth inning to put the Reds ahead for good in a comeback victory over the 
Padres at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 The Reds, who trailed 4-0 in the second inning, had tied the score, 5-5, at 5 
in the fifth inning on Roberto Kelly's two-run homer, which scored Hal Morris.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; ORIOLES' MESSAGE TO BLUE JAYS ARRIVES EARLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a case of major league cool colliding with youthful enthusiasm. 
Depending on which member of the Baltimore Orioles was asked, their three-game 
sweep of the Toronto Blue Jays was either no big deal or a coming-of-age 
milestone. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Mussina is part of the Oriole youth. To him, beating Toronto, 4-1, 
Wednesday night at Baltimore to finish their first three-game sweep of the Blue 
Jays in 12 years was a sign of the team's maturing. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time, we are believing that we're going to go out there and 
beat these guys," he said. "In the past, we thought we could beat them." 
</P>
<P>
 To Manager Johnny Oates, the sweep happened too early in the season to get 
excited. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's three wins," he said. "That's all it is -- three wins." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the case, it was another solid game by the Orioles, who trail the 
first-place New York Yankees by half a game in the American League East. 
Baltimore won its fourth in a row and 11th in 14 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Harold Baines and Chris Hoiles homered. Mussina (6-1) struck out five and 
walked two. 
</P>
<P>
 Losing pitcher Todd Stottlemyre (3-1) was working on three days' rest and 
lasted 5 2/3 innings, giving up seven hits and three walks. 
</P>
<P>
 The score was tied, 1-1, in the sixth inning when Baines led off with his 
fourth home run. Cal Ripken singled, and Hoiles hit a two-run shot to left for 
a 4-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last couple of years, they seem to be able to beat us in the late 
innings," Hoiles said. "They've broken our hearts in the late innings. This 
time, we were able to come back and beat them." 
</P>
<P>
 This time. Stottlemyre agreed with Oates that the sweep needed to be kept in 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 "The funny thing about this game is that you play 162 games," Stottlemyre 
said. "It's a marathon; it's not a sprint." 
</P>
<P>
 New York 6, Cleveland 3 -- Danny Tartabull homered and Paul O'Neill got two 
more hits at New York to raise his average to .473 as the Yankees won their 
sixth in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy Key (6-1) gave up three runs and seven hits in seven innings. Bob 
Wickman finished for his first save as the Yankees improved to 22-10, their 
best start since 1956. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill hit an RBI double in a three-run fifth inning that gave the Yankees a 
4-1 lead against Dennis Martinez (1-4), who gave up five runs and eight hits in 
5 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 14, Seattle 6 -- Ron Karkovice hit a grand slam and Julio Franco a 
three-run homer as the White Sox scored seven runs with two out in the third 
inning at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City 9, Minnesota 0 -- David Cone pitched a three-hitter to win his 
sixth consecutive start, leading the Royals at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 Wally Joyner, Terry Shumpert, Dave Henderson and Greg Gagne each drove in two 
runs. The Royals had 14 hits, at least one by each starter. 
</P>
<P>
 Cone (6-1) pitched his first complete game this season, striking out six. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 7, Milwaukee 1 -- Aaron Sele pitched the first complete game of his 
career and Mo Vaughn homered and drove in three runs at Boston as the Red Sox 
ended their five-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Sele (4-1) gave up seven hits, struck out four and walked four. In his 25 
starts in the major leagues, he has given up three earned runs or fewer 24 
times; in the other game, he gave up four. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 6, Oakland 2 -- Cecil Fielder, Kirk Gibson and Eric Davis hit solo 
homers in the third inning at Detroit as the Tigers dealt Oakland its 19th loss 
in 21 games. 
</P>
<P>
 John Doherty (4-2) pitched a seven-hitter for his third victory in a row and 
second consecutive complete game. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Welch (0-5) was tagged for six runs and eight hits in 5 1/3 innings. His 
earned-run average rose from 7.71 to 8.10.

PREP BASEBALL ROUNDUP; SAVANNA BYPASSES TROUBLE SPOTS, WINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON H. REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After being continually challenged to overcome itself , Savanna proved too 
much to handle for host Brea-Olinda. 
</P>
<P>
 Savanna, which side-stepped potential disaster in almost every inning, scored 
four runs in the eighth inning of its 7-3 Orange League baseball victory over 
the first-place Wildcats on Wednesday. In the process, Savanna remained in the 
lead for the league's third and final automatic Southern Section Division II 
playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt we were really lucky," Rebel Coach Hack Mitchell said. "They are a 
real good hitting team, but they had some problems cashing in on their scoring 
chances. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were real fortunate, because it could have been a long day." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rebels (10-14, 7-7 in league play) are tied with Magnolia for third place. 
Savanna will clinch a playoff berth with a victory at Anaheim on Friday because 
it holds the tiebreaker advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea-Olinda (20-4, 10-4) and Valencia have secured the other two berths and 
are tied for first with one game remaining Friday. Valencia, which holds the 
tiebreaker advantage, plays host to Western and Brea-Olinda travels to 
Magnolia. 
</P>
<P>
 If Savanna is to clinch the final spot, it has to cut down on self-inflicted 
damage. The Rebels walked nine -- six in the first two innings -- and committed 
two errors. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea-Olinda, though, was having its own problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually a prodigious hitting team, the Wildcats managed only six hits and left 
12 runners on base. Brea-Olinda left the bases loaded in the first and second 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats had a runner thrown out at the plate in the fifth inning and left 
the potential winning run stranded at third in the seventh inning -- albeit 
thanks to a spectacular play. 
</P>
<P>
 Savanna center fielder Mike Hynes robbed Dan Anderson of at least a double by 
making a diving catch on a ball Anderson hit to the gap in left-center field. 
The out ended the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Hynes also contributed at the plate. He had two doubles in four at-bats, one 
of which drove in a run in the pivotal eighth. He also scored one run. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a really big game; that's what we need from our seniors," Mitchell 
said. "He made that great catch in center and then he comes through with a 
clutch hit to help us win. That was really big." 
</P>
<P>
 The support helped make a winner out of Russ Hartman (4-4), who relieved 
starter Jose Vasquez in the fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea-Olinda played shoddy defense behind previously undefeated ace Mike 
Trombly (9-1). The Wildcats committed four errors and made several mental 
mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Wildcat left fielder Matt Weyant did play well. Weyant was three for four with 
a run scored. 
</P>
<P>
 In another league game: 
</P>
<P>
 Magnolia 6, Valencia 4 -- Magnolia (10-11, 7-7) remained in the playoff hunt 
with the victory over the Tigers (11-12, 10-4). Valencia is tied for first with 
Brea-Olinda. Josh Reding (6-2) went the distance, striking out seven for the 
Sentinels.

<P>
 Garden Grove 2, Santiago 0 -- Justin Lewis hit the first pitch of the game for 
a home run for visiting Garden Grove in a make-up game from Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Olympic League baseball: 
</P>
<P>
 Calvary Chapel 3, Orange Lutheran 1 -- Eric Donelson's two-run single in the 
third inning provided the winning margin for Calvary Chapel (15-8, 7-4), which 
moved alone into third place. Orange Lutheran is 10-13, 6-5.

 Navarone ended a 19-month drought Wednesday with a one-length victory over 
Idle Son in the $61,400 Spence Bay Handicap at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridden by Patrick Valenzuela, Navarone covered 1 1/16 miles on the turf in 
1:41 3/5.The 6-year-old rallied from next to last in the six-horse field, 
catching Idle Son near the wire. 
</P>
<P>
 Navarone paid $9.40, $3.20 and $2.80 as the second choice in the wagering. He 
was named horse of the meeting at Del Mar in 1992 before injuries interrupted 
his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Valenzuela broke a losing streak of his own, winning for the first time in 41 
mounts at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Idle Son, making his first start since last August, returned $2.60 and $2.20 
as the 7-10 favorite. British-bred Profusion was another nose back in third and 
paid $3. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory, worth $34,400, increased Navarone's career earnings to $561,575 
with seven victories in 16 starts.

CAIN ABLE TO CLOSE OUT NORTHRIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Steve Cain sounded like a paramedic, ticking off the details of his job 
description. 
</P>
<P>
 Trouble was, his role as UC Santa Barbara pitcher changed a bit Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "My job as a middle reliever is to put out the fire," Cain said. "To stop the 
bleeding." 
</P>
<P>
 Cain applied the tourniquet, choking off the Cal State Northridge offense as 
the Gauchos hung on for an 11-7 victory in a nonconference game at Matador 
Field. 
</P>
<P>
 Cain, a redshirt freshman from Montclair Prep High, pitched three scoreless 
innings of relief, allowing two hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet this time, Cain wasn't the middle man. He replaced reliever John Bretza to 
open the seventh and recorded his first save. 
</P>
<P>
 Stop the bleeding? More like close the wound. Thanks to Cain, the Gauchos 
(21-30) recorded their first victory in five games against the Matadors. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Northridge (25-27) should have seen it coming. Cain, a 5-foot-10 
left-hander, has thrown 9 2/3 innings of scoreless relief against the Matadors. 
</P>
<P>
 Keep in mind that Northridge averaged 10 runs a game against his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish it was just Northridge all year," Cain cracked. "I've been 
inconsistent. I want to end the year on a strong note." 
</P>
<P>
 Cain escaped his nastiest jam in the eighth, when Northridge had runners at 
first and second with one out. The Gauchos held an 11-7 lead, but cleanup 
hitter Jason Shanahan was in the batter's box. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only did Cain retire Shanahan, he got two outs for the price of one. With 
the baserunners in motion, Shanahan lined out to right. Eric Gillespie was 
doubled off first. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge trailed, 8-6, entering the sixth but loaded the bases with one out. 
Bretza (2-1) struck out Shanahan, and after an infield error allowed a run to 
score, he fanned Josh Smaler. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gauchos put the game away in a wild seventh. Wynter Phoenix opened the 
inning with a double off Rick Orr (2-3) but was erased when Jared Janke sent a 
grounder to Shanahan, making his first start at third base. Shanahan fired to 
first baseman Brian Vasey, who pulled his foot off the bag for an error, then 
fired back to Shanahan to nail Phoenix in a disputed play at third. 
</P>
<P>
 Both coaching staffs complained at length. It only got more strange. 
</P>
<P>
 Consecutive singles loaded the bases, and after Orr forced home a run with a 
walk to hand the Gauchos a 9-7 lead, he was relieved by Shanahan. A groundout 
scored another run before Santa Barbara executed a first-and-third double 
steal, with Matt Bazzani scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Barbara received five walks and had 14 hits.

UNEXPECTED POP FROM GUNN LIFTS CHAMINADE OVER CRESPI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRBY LEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The batter was John Gunn and the call was hit and run. 
</P>
<P>
 Gunn tried to hit a ground ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the Chaminade High senior second baseman smacked the first home run 
of his career, a three-run shot in the sixth inning, to lift the Eagles to a 
5-2 victory over Crespi in a Mission League game Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Gunn's home run, a curving high fly ball that sailed over a 35-foot screen 
above the right-field fence 300 feet from home plate, capped a four-run inning 
to help the Eagles erase a 2-1 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've only hit a handful off the net in my career and never one really high 
off the net," Gunn said. "I got jammed and I didn't really extend the way I 
wanted. I don't know how it happened. It's hit and run, you just try to put the 
ball in play." 
</P>
<P>
 Chaminade (16-8) improved to 8-5 in Mission League play to open a one-game 
lead over Crespi (15-9, 7-6) in the battle for third place. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was also the first against Crespi for third-year Chaminade Coach 
Dave Desmond. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you play in a funky ballpark like ours, it's a flip of the coin who is 
going to get the breaks," Desmond said. "We just happened to get a ball lofted 
over a net on a hit and run play. It would be a routine out anywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 It will be anything but a routine game when the teams meet Friday at Valley 
College in the league finale. A victory by the Eagles would secure their first 
postseason appearance since moving to the Mission League in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 A victory by Crespi would force a tiebreaker Saturday for the league's final 
playoff spot and an early end to Chaminade's post-prom celebration Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the prom coming up and we don't want to have the situation of playing 
a game afterward if we lose," Gunn said. "We had to win. Nobody likes the 
pressure of being one down in a three-game series." 
</P>
<P>
 Gabe Crecion drove in Franco Leonor with a sacrifice fly to tie the score, 
2-2, setting the stage for Gunn's home run. 
</P>
<P>
 Joel Orme (7-3) pitched his ninth complete game, striking out six. Orme and 
Jason Giovannettone each had two hits. Orme's run-scoring single in the third 
inning gave the Eagles a 1-0 lead.

 Last week Mexican-produced "Like Water for Chocolate" became the 
biggest-grossing foreign language film in American history, beating the $20.1 
million record set in 1969 by "I Am Curious Yellow." The reason for its success 
is obvious to us -- like Laura Esquivel's best-selling novel of the same name 
(which actually contains a number of recipes), "Like Water for Chocolate" is 
saturated with food. If you've got another explanation, explain away the 
persistent rumors of a forthcoming "Like Water for Chocolate" cookbook. The

AMERICAN ETHNIC; SHEILA LUKINS: THE SINGLE PALATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's October and Sheila Lukins is feeling harassed. Her first solo book is 
supposed to be published in April, and the galley proofs have just come back 
from the copy editors with a thousand questions still to be answered. 
</P>
<P>
 What size tomato? 
</P>
<P>
 What kind of apple? 
</P>
<P>
 How much does that fennel bulb weigh?  
</P>
<P>
 Now she has to go to a market, buy a bulb of fennel and weigh it. Her physical 
therapist is coming by four times a week to work on the muscles she screwed up 
by not walking correctly after a stroke. And she still has to find the time to 
pack for a quick trip to Paris to visit her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of that, she's worried about how the book will be received. Just last 
spring her one-time business partner and former co-author Julee Rosso put out a 
solo book, "Great Good Food," and got trashed in the press. 
</P>
<P>
 The consensus on Rosso's book: Anything but great. Disappointing. Thumbs down. 
Cook's Illustrated called it "a hodgepodge of somewhat contrived recipes." The 
New York Times said too many of her recipes were "flawed by errors and lapses 
that could cause consternation in the kitchen and chagrin at the table." 
Newsweek said food prepared according to Rosso's recipes tasted "lousy." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosso, who pocketed an advance reported to be $625,000, insisted that she and 
four assistants tested 1,500 recipes in 10 months to select the 800 used in the 
book. Her detractors said that was impossible. No matter, Crown Publishing 
won't talk specifics but reveals that the thick paperback of low-fat recipes 
has been a fast seller: Since last April the book has sold about 500,000 
copies. 
</P>
<P>
 So was the book really that bad, or was it a matter of the food establishment 
-- the "Food Mafia," as many call it -- taking sides in the professional 
divorce of a couple that helped change the way America eats? 
</P>
<P>
 In 1977, the dynamic duo -- Lukins the caterer and Rosso the marketer -- 
co-founded the Silver Palate in Manhattan, one of the first gourmet take-out 
shops in the country. The highfalutin home cooking they pioneered contributed 
to a radical change in baby boomer eating habits. Sauteed chicken livers with 
blueberry vinegar, caviar eclairs, pizza pot pie and pesto by the quart were 
suddenly the rage from Boca Raton to Bellingham. To date, their three Silver 
Palate cookbooks have sold more than 5 million copies. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the partnership ended, shortly after the sale of their shop in 
1988, the pair were barely speaking. "We were great friends," says Lukins, 
"It's over now." 
</P>
<P>
 After the breakup, Rosso moved to Michigan and discovered yogurt cheese, while 
Lukins began traveling and researching her "All Around the World Cookbook" for 
Workman, the publishers of the original Silver Palate books. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish with all my heart that Julee's book had been nicely received because 
everyone is going to want to see how the other one did," Lukins says. "I'm sure 
I'll be scrutinized plenty. . . . And I did not get a huge advance!"  
</P>
<P>
 But make a few calls to key people in the food world and you'll find no one 
filing their nails in anticipation of the Lukins release, as they did with 
Rosso's book. Lukins, who is 51, suffered a massive cerebral hemorrhage in 1991 
and, according to Pat Adrian, who buys books for the Book of the Month Club, 
the "Food Mafia" rushed to be loyal to her. "A lot of people were jealous of 
both women for a long time," says Adrian. "(Blasting Rosso's book) should have 
been a great chatty lunch at La Cirque rather than (the media event) it ended 
up being. After all, it's just a cookbook. It's not going to change the world." 
</P>
<P>
 The food world has changed dramatically, though, in the 30 years since Julia 
Child first showed a generation of cooks how to make coq au vin . Before the 
gastronomic revolution, Americans cared more about convenience than quality. 
Cookbooks were for newlyweds -- the red-and-white checkered "Better Homes and 
Gardens Cookbook" or, for those reaching for a higher shelf, "The Joy of 
Cooking." Canned cream of mushroom soup was a staple and tuna casserole an 
achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late '60s and into the '70s and '80s, the newly affluent and globally 
mobile rediscovered the cuisines of Europe and the Far East. Sensitive palates 
rejected Tang, Velveeta and Baco-Bits. Suddenly, they wanted osso buco , not 
beef stew, and mee krob instead of macaroni. Egged on by foreign chefs who 
opened restaurants and cooking schools in America, the baby boomers tried such 
esoterica as foie gras- stuffed duck hearts and lamb fillet with kiwi sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 The Silver Palate books made this aesthetic accessible to home cooks around 
the country by reinterpreting -- some say watering down -- the revolution with 
friendly, easy-to-use recipes. Finally, as the '80s came to an end, the 
pendulum swang away from haute cuisine toward simpler, less expensive regional 
and ethnic cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Lukins is hoping mainstream America is ready for Peloponnesian lamb 
shanks and Moroccan marmalade, but she's not sure. Her publisher thinks so -- 
it has announced a first printing of 350,000, believed to be a record for a 
cookbook. "A huge amount of my pride is involved in this book," says Lukins. "I 
just didn't want this book to be another clone (of the others). Those books are 
great, fun, and fine but they are what they are. I wanted to do something 
different." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, the book is unmistakably in the Silver Palate format, down to the little 
drawings (although Lukins wasn't the illustrator on this book, as she was on 
the others) and boxed sidebars. Even the ethnic-inspired recipes are 
reinterpreted for the American kitchen, in Silver Palate fashion. There are 
very few ingredients called for in the book that aren't readily available in 
Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
 But then Lukins did not intend to go around the world and bring back the 
strictly authentic recipes of each country. Instead, she took the best of what 
she found and created food. "I don't know what it's called," she says, "I guess 
it's Sheila's cooking. I didn't go looking for chefs' recipes or into people's 
homes to cook. Paula Wolfert does that and I would never try to rival her."  
</P>
<P>
 One thing she is secure about: The recipes work. "Every cookbook has a couple 
of mistakes, you just can't help it," she admits. "But you can't forgive an 
entire book that doesn't work. What's the point of having cookbooks?"  
</P>
<P>
 In other words, she's confident of her cooking ability. But she didn't start 
out that way. Lukins was born in Philadelphia and grew up in Connecticut. She 
attended high school in Westport, a.k.a Martha Stewart-land. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was there before she was," says Lukins. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time she was well into her 20s, Lukins was married and had a degree in 
art education from New York University. Her first job out of college was inking 
patterns for McCalls. The only cooking she did was to throw something together 
at the end of a long, tedious day. 
</P>
<P>
 That changed when her husband, Richard, who ran a security business, was 
transferred to England. A bored housewife, Lukins enrolled in cooking classes 
at Le Cordon Bleu to occupy her time. The following year, Richard was 
transferred to Paris, and Lukins signed up for more classes. "That's the way to 
learn," she says. "In Paris I took cooking lessons and French lessons during 
the day and then cooked for my darling husband at night." 
</P>
<P>
 Back in New York and raising two daughters in the Dakota Apartments (John 
Lennon's last address), a bachelor in the building called one night in a panic. 
He had invited a group over for dinner and the superintendent's wife, who 
usually cooked for him when he had guests, was on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Don't worry, I'll cook you dinner,' " Lukins remembers. "So as was 
the fashion in the mid-'60s, I cooked moussaka, a Greek salad, some stuffed 
grape leaves and sent it over. I charged him $50 plus the cost of the food. He 
ended up with a great dinner and I wound up with $50." 
</P>
<P>
 She also wound up with a new career. One of the guests at the bachelor's 
dinner party was Gael Greene, restaurant critic for New York magazine. Greene 
loved the party food and mentioned it to her friend, Joan Kron, who immediately 
called Ellen Stern, who at the time wrote the "Best Bets" column for the 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was New York telephone at its best," says Lukins now. "Ellen Stern ran a 
half-page picture of me and my kitchen with a headline: 'Eat, Drink and Be 
Murray.' " The article portrayed Lukins as a bachelor's best cook. "I got 200 
calls from single men," she says. Six months later, the Other Woman Catering 
Co. was born. A year later, Lukins teamed up with Julee Rosso to open the 
Silver Palate. The two met when Rosso, an advertising executive for Burlington, 
hired Lukins to cater a press breakfast introducing Oleg Cassini sheets. 
</P>

<P>
 It's April, "Sheila Lukins Around the World Cookbook" is about to hit the 
stores and Lukins' mood has lifted considerably. She's almost giddy. Vanity 
Fair, a magazine known more for its profiles of Roseanne Arnold, Jack Nicholson 
and Demi Moore, has just printed a flattering article on her. She even cracks a 
few jokes at her own expense. Doing research for the book, she persuaded the 
curator at the Carmen Miranda Museum in Rio de Janeiro to open one of the glass 
showcases so her husband could take a picture of her posing with a life-like 
mannequin of her longtime idol. She sent the snapshot, along with several other 
photos, to illustrate her book. But the publishers rejected it because Lukins 
had pulled up her T-shirt and revealed her bellybutton. 
</P>
<P>
 She's proud of her figure, and why not? She's taken off almost 30 pounds 
(going from a size 12 to a size 8), partly from the stress of traveling to 33 
countries in two years. The water in Russia made her sick. Bad shrimp in 
Bangkok gave her food poisoning. While she was in South America, there was a 
cholera epidemic. Terrorists bombed Bombay during her visit there. To get to 
Cuba, she had to fly in a pre-World War II prop plane via Jamaica. And she 
missed out on the best food in Russia when Gorbachev was ousted just as she was 
headed to Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
 Actress-turned-infomercial host Victoria Principal is also partly responsible 
for Lukins' weight loss. "I remember someone coming into the Silver Palate 
kitchen one morning and telling us that Victoria Principal said she never , 
never , never ate cheese," says Lukins. "We laughed, but since then I've never 
, never , never eaten cheese" (though cheese does show up in her cookbooks). 
She's cooking healthier too. She has practically eliminated red meat and dairy 
products from her diet, eating mainly fresh fruits and vegetables, pastas and 
grains, fish and chicken. She keeps five bottles of olive oil and three kinds 
of vinegar near her stove. "What do I need butter for?" she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Does this mean her next project might be a book on low-fat cooking? Like the 
one her former partner did? 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh please," she says. "I don't know what's the big deal about low-fat books. 
They make me sick." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, health is a big concern now for Lukins. Her life almost ended in 1991 
when a blood vessel in her brain burst without warning. It took two operations 
and weeks of therapy before she was able to leave a wheelchair. "I'm happy not 
to be dead," she says. She hasn't driven since the hemorrhage and takes 
anti-seizure medication to control tremors that occasionally occur in her left 
hand. "There was a time I was crying plenty, but I have had quadrillion hours 
of therapy," she says. "I'm OK now." 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 One week later Lukins' book comes out and it's already received its first 
review. Cook's Illustrated tested 30 recipes from the 450 in the book. Its 
verdict: "We were underwhelmed." Plus, the reviewer brought up the Rosso book 
in the first paragraph. Afterward Lukins is subdued and never mentions the 
story. But she wonders aloud if her name will be linked with Rosso's forever. 
"Will anyone ever write a story about me without mentioning her ?" she asks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know everyone will compare the two books," says Nach Waxman, owner of 
Kitchen Arts and Letters bookstore, gossip central to the New York food world. 
"The Julee business will do no good for Sheila's book. Well, Simon and 
Garfunkel made it -- separately. Of course, all everyone has wanted to do since 
is put them back together again."  
</P>
<P>
 Lukins has been around a long time, though, and she's philosophical about the 
world of cookbook publishing. "When you put yourself before the public and say, 
'this is my work, here it is,' " she says, "I think they look hard."  
</P>
<P>
 With her book in the stores and more reviews to come, Lukins can only wait and 
see what the consensus on her solo project will be. And maybe, a few books from 
now, her work will be reviewed without the mentions of her past life as half of 
a famous "foodie couple." For now, she is content in the knowledge that she has 
done the best book she could . . . on her own. 
</P>

 When Lukins was asked to name her favorite recipe in the book, without 
hesitating she answered, "Peloponnesian lamb shanks." She recommends serving 
them with orzo or a vegetable couscous. The fresh mint stirred in just before 
serving adds not only color but great flavor.  
</P>
<P>

 Lukins first came across the Indonesian version of chicken noodle soup in 
Banjarmasin, South Kalimantan (Borneo), where cinnamon and cardamom are 
essential ingredients. This is her interpretation.  
</P>
<P>
 INDONESIAN CHICKEN NOODLE SOUP 
</P>
<P>
 (Soto Banjar) 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 1 whole chicken breast, rinsed well 
</P>
<P>
 3 medium waxy potatoes, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 pound shallots 
</P>
<P>
 4 large cloves garlic 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon fresh ginger, peeled and minced 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon ground cardamom 
</P>
<P>
 1 (3-inch-long) cinnamon stick  
</P>
<P>
 Coarse salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup fresh cilantro leaves 
</P>
<P>
 1 lime, thinly sliced 
</P>
<P>
 Combine chicken broth, water, parsley and cilantro sprigs in medium-sized soup 
pot. Bring to boil. Add chicken breast. Reduce heat and simmer, partially 
covered, until chicken is just cooked through, about 30 minutes. Do not boil. 
Remove chicken and let cool slightly. Shred meat from bones in 1 1/2x1/2-inch 
pieces, discarding skin and bones. Set aside covered. 
</P>
<P>
 Strain broth and return to pot. Add potatoes to broth. 
</P>
<P>
 Cut half shallots and half garlic lengthwise into very thin slices. Heat oil 
in medium-sized non-stick skillet over low heat. Add sliced shallots and garlic 
and cook stirring, until lightly golden and crisp, about 10 minutes. Remove 
with slotted spoon to paper towels to drain. Reserve for garnish.  
</P>
<P>
 Finely mince remaining shallots, garlic and ginger together with cardamom. Add 
to skillet and cook uncovered, stirring over low heat until aromatic, 3 to 4 
minutes. Add shallot mixture to broth along with cinnamon stick and salt and 
pepper to taste. Cook covered over medium heat until potatoes are tender, 12 to 
15 minutes. Remove potatoes from broth with slotted spoon. 
</P>
<P>
 To assemble, lay out shallow soup or pasta bowls. Arrange chicken, pasta, eggs 
and potatoes in section in each bowl, to make 4 wedges.  
</P>
<P>
 Heat broth until piping hot. Adjust seasonings to taste. Discard cinnamon 
stick. Ladle broth into bowls. Sprinkle with fried shallots, fried garlic and 
cilantro. Float lime slice in center of each bowl. Makes 4 servings.

 Baking the ribs first cooks off some of the fat so ribs will not scorch when 
finished on the grill. Be sure to make the jerk sauce at least an hour ahead so 
the flavors can meld before marinating.

 In Turkey, the boreks weren't filled with lamb, as Lukins expected, but rather 
bastirma, a cured beef covered in spices. When Lukins came back, she made her 
filo pies with pastrami, a cousin of bastirma. PASTRAMI BOREKS 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 4 Italian frying peppers, stemmed, seeded and cut into 1/4-inch dice 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 pound pastrami, excess fat removed, cut into 1/4-inch dice 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup shallots, coarsely chopped 
</P>
<P>
 4 plum tomatoes, cored, seeded and cut into 1/4-inch dice 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons dried oregano 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Coarsely ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup clarified butter 
</P>
<P>
 1 pound filo dough 
</P>
<P>
 Heat oil in skillet over low heat. Add peppers and cook, stirring until 
tender, 8 to 10 minutes. Add pastrami and shallots and cook 5 minutes. Stir in 
tomatoes and oregano. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Cook 5 minutes 
more, stirring occasionally. Stir in parsley and cool mixture to room 
temperature. 
</P>
<P>
 Clarify butter by melting over low heat in small sauce pan. As soon as melted, 
remove from heat and set aside about 5 minutes. Using spoon, carefully remove 
and discard foamy white butter fat that has risen to top. Spoon or pour off 
clear liquid and reserve. Discard solids that remain on bottom of pan. 
</P>
<P>
 Lay filo pastry sheets on clean dish towel. Keep covered with wax paper and 
dampened dish towel so filo does not dry out. Place 1 sheet of filo lengthwise 
on clean work surface. Using pastry brush, lightly cover surface with clarified 
butter. Cover with second sheet of filo and brush again with butter. Cut filo 
into 6 (3-inch-wide) strips. 
</P>
<P>
 Place 1 teaspoon of filling in center of each strip. Fold corner across 
filling, then continue to fold triangle, as if folding flag, to end of strip. 
Tuck ends under. Place triangles as you finish them on baking sheet. Brush with 
butter. Bake until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Serve hot. Makes 48 
triangles.

AMERICAN ETHNIC; BOOK REVIEW; TESTING THE MERITS OF SHEILA CUISINE; SHEILA 
LUKINS ALL AROUND THE WORLD COOKBOOK, BY SHEILA LUKINS ; ( WORKMAN PUBLISHING 
CO., INC.: $18.95; 591 PP. )

<P>
 Reading this cookbook is like traveling with a breathy, energetic, chronically 
enthusiastic, but disorganized companion. At first, the frothy prose, madcap 
graphics, endless sidebars and dippy handwritten postcards present a seemingly 
impenetrable surface of cuteness and clutter. I spot recipes that intrigue me, 
but promptly lose them in the visual stew. I begin thinking that a more 
appropriate title might be: "Sheila Lukins All Over the Map Cookbook." 
</P>
<P>
 To beat a path through the jumble, I had to sit down, concentrate, and 
consciously figure out how the book worked. Once I located the page numbers 
(they were under my thumbs) I felt a little better. I also learned to insert a 
bookmark whenever I came across a recipe I wanted to try. 
</P>
<P>
 Lukins writes in the introduction, "I have arranged the book somewhat 
traditionally." But this is true only in the loosest sense: Recipes are 
organized by type -- appetizers, salads, soup, grains and breads, etc. Recipes, 
however, make up approximately half the material in this cookbook. Other 
material consists of 1) essays by Barbara Ensrud on the wines and beers of the 
world; 2) short specific travel experiences Lukins writes about and lumps under 
the heading "Souvenir to Savor"; 3) food tips that appear in boxes entitled "My 
Kitchen Diary"; 4) too-often inane postcards ("Rock," reads one, "This was the 
King of Siam's summer palace just outside of Bangkok -- shall we dance? Love, 
Sheila"). There are also 5) Lukins' longer essays on breakfasts, marketplaces, 
cheeses and teas; 6) many photos and snapshots and 7) "palettes," one-page, 
cartoon-illustrated diagrams of a country's predominate foods, spices and 
cultural icons (Russia's palette, for example, shows an onion-domed church, 
beets, horseradish, vodka, sour cream and a woman in a babushka). 
</P>
<P>
 The recipes may be in some kind of order, but all this additional material is 
inserted in a scattershot fashion. Palettes for some countries are placed near 
the beer or wine essays for that country, while other palettes are more 
randomly located. The Moroccan palette is closest to "The Wines of Chile" 
essay, and the Chinese palette immediately precedes "The Wines of Italy." In 
short, the book is a big lively mess. By the time I figured this out 
conclusively, I also had a tuft of bookmarks sticking out the top of it and was 
ready to start cooking.  
</P>
<P>
 Making food from this cookbook is what finally wore away the crankiness 
engendered from reading it. The spirit of this food is consistent with what 
we've come to expect from the "Silver Palate" cookbooks and "The New Basics," 
which Lukins co-authored: There's a gloss, a flourish to this food. Recipes do 
not involve tricky or complicated techniques, but they do often call for many 
ingredients and a fair amount of "prep work." 
</P>
<P>
 There is, generally, a good return on the effort involved. The finished 
product usually looks terrific: a pissaladiere , or onion tart, has a cunning 
lattice of anchovies; beet bread pudding has a golden crust with gorgeous 
magenta beets bubbling at the sides. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not, however, a cookbook of authentic ethnic recipes. The book's cover 
promises "Global cuisine, one-world cuisine, fusion cuisine -- Sheila cuisine," 
of which "Sheila cuisine" is the most apt description. This is one distinctive, 
talented American cook's take on things. Lukins essentially went around the 
world and ate for inspiration; she collected recipes when possible, then came 
home, worked with them, amped them up or toned them down to accommodate 
mainstream American tastes, gave them a twist here and a flourish there until 
whatever dish bore her now-unmistakable touch. The cookbook index lists food by 
country in the following fashion: "Swedish and Swedish-inspired dishes . . . 
Thai and Thai-inspired dishes . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "One-world cuisine" by a Jamaican cook, or "fusion cuisine" by a Chinese cook 
would be significantly different from the food Lukins presents in this book. 
</P>
<P>
 As a friendly move and possibly a publishing necessity, Lukins includes her 
own version of many old standbys American cooks have come to expect in an 
international cookbook: ratatouille, moussaka, coq au vin , even Swedish 
meatballs. ("I scoured Sweden for the real McCoy but, alas, all I found were 
meekly spiced meatballs with no sauce . . . so I made a version that will send 
you searching for that chafing dish.") 
</P>
<P>
 One need only consult "Betty Crocker's New International Cookbook" to get an 
idea of how Lukins works. Betty Crocker's recipe for spinach pie, or 
spanokopita , calls for spinach. Lukins, in an attempt to replicate Greek 
cooks' use of wild greens called horta in this dish, calls for a combination of 
chard, dandelion greens and fennel in place of the spinach. 
</P>
<P>
 Those cooks who want only truly authentic ethnic recipes still need to look to 
other cookbooks. But those who want to bring more ethnic range to their 
contemporary American cooking will be well served by this book. Lukins 
demystifies some of the most exotic cuisines; now, virtually anyone from 
Fairbanks to Lake Charles to Bar Harbor, given patience and a reasonably 
well-stocked grocery store, can make a reasonable facsimile of Thai fish sauce 
(five ingredients), three different Indian masalas , or spice mixes (four to 
nine ingredients), Indonesian peanut sauce (16 ingredients) or Jamaican jerk 
sauce (18 ingredients). Thus, this cookbook is a great way to ease into 
cuisines that one finds intimidating. I, for example, who had never before 
attempted Thai food, made the Thai seafood salad. (While I made my own fish 
sauce, I did need to go to a Thai market for fresh lemongrass.) The finished 
product, a mound of lightly poached and seasoned shrimp, clams and bay 
scallops, bore but mild resemblance to the juicy, fiery seafood salads I love 
at my local Thai restaurant, but this gentler, blander version will definitely 
please less jaded palates. I did, however, get my foot in the door of Thai 
cooking, and next time I make a Thai seafood salad, I'll squeeze in more lime, 
spoon in more fish sauce and be less chary with those red hot chiles. 
</P>
<P>
 I did find a few small technical problems and inconsistencies. In making the 
small potato croquettes, I put the grated potatoes into boiling water to cook 
for two minutes, as per instructions. But the potatoes so reduced the water 
temperature that the water was barely boiling again when two minutes were up, 
and it was unclear if the potatoes needed to actually boil for two minutes or 
if they only needed this brief parboiling. As it happened, they did require 
more cooking in order to be softer and more pliable in forming the croquettes.  
</P>
<P>
 In the recipe for the orange-rosemary mayonnaise, the instructions say it 
takes about 10 minutes to reduce one cup of orange juice to 1 1/2 tablespoons. 
As I found out, this is simply way off the mark, a fact that is reflected in 
the recipe for orange flan, where the instructions say, more accurately, that 
it takes 15 to 20 minutes to reduce 2/3 cup of orange juice to two tablespoons. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite these little trouble spots, the small potato croquettes are wonderful 
-- garlicky, crispy, spiked with rosemary. The accompanying orange-rosemary 
mayonnaise is so rich and tasty it's a bit like gilding a lily, but neither I 
nor any of my tasters actually refused it. I also had great luck with the beet 
bread pudding whose recipe Lukins revised from a Russian recipe card. 
</P>
<P>
 Caribbean-inspired mambo fruit salad is a luscious combination of dressed 
greens and juicy ripe fruit. Flavorful and tender Hong Kong chicken is first 
marinated in Lukins' excellent teriyaki sauce, then dusted simply with corn 
starch, salt and pepper and pan-fried. 
</P>
<P>
 In the long run, after weathering countless superlative adjectives in Lukins' 
prose, losing my place at least a hundred times, buying bales of cilantro, 
pounds of shallots, and manufacturing miles of citrus zest, I finally 
surrendered and began to enjoy the whole darn mishmosh this cookbook offers. It 
was like giving into the languor and disorientation of jet lag, or finding out 
that the person with the funny voice actually has some good things to say. OK, 
OK: Some of those photos are pretty entertaining -- and I did learn how to sex 
an eggplant.

IN THE KITCHEN; BRIOCHE IN THE MACHINE AGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS PARSONS, TIMES FOOD MANAGING EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I'm normally not a great fan of the multitude of convenience-oriented 
machinery you can buy for your kitchen. This is an informed opinion, believe 
me. I have tried them all. And I have the full cabinets to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
 My dislike is partly because one of the most pleasurable parts of cooking is 
the process, and the assorted gadgets only distance you from that. And it's 
partly out of a different definition of convenience -- it makes no sense to 
spend 15 minutes assembling, disassembling and cleaning the machine parts 
necessary to slice five minutes' worth of bell peppers. 
</P>
<P>
 But for pastry and bread making, I'm a firm believer in machinery. Some may 
recoil in horror. How can you get the same delicate touch out of a food 
processor that you can by hand? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe you can't. But one of my first cooking jobs entailed making brioche at a 
small restaurant. First, my boss said, I had to make it by hand to get the 
feel. There is nothing like beating butter into a big work bowl full of bread 
dough and then slapping that sticky, slippery stuff around on a table for 10 
minutes or so to make you think twice about the spiritual purity of handmade 
pastries. 
</P>
<P>
 When I graduated to a machine, it was a huge Hobart mixer that came up to my 
waist and had a work bowl as big as an industrial sink and as heavy as lead. 
Wrestle that around for a while and you're ready to give up pastry making for 
good. 
</P>
<P>
 And so, when I got my first decent food processor, it was with some skepticism 
that I tried a recipe for brioche adapted for the machine by James Beard. 
"Yeah, right," I thought. "This will be either the worst pastry in the world or 
take some incredibly intricate technique that will turn out to be another huge 
waste of time." 
</P>
<P>
 I put the flour in the work bowl, cut in the butter and added the yeast 
mixture and a couple of eggs. Not more than two minutes later, there was the 
brioche dough. Another two minutes of hand kneading and I had the prettiest, 
silkiest dough you've ever felt. 
</P>
<P>
 This was clearly too good to be true. 
</P>
<P>
 And in a way, it was. When I employed this technique with the typical amount 
of butter used in a brioche, the bread was fairly heavy -- I honestly don't 
know whether you really can get the delicate texture and buttery richness of a 
real pate a brioche fine in the food processor. For that you need the more 
delicate handling that power mixers -- or your hands -- provide. 
</P>
<P>
 But this food processor recipe is fantastic for the multitude of little pastry 
bites you can build on the more plebeian pain brioche commun , which is made 
with half the amount of butter. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, I find that this dough falls somewhere between the two -- less 
delicate than the real stuff but still finer than the normal brioche bread. 
That's because of a neat little trick Beard used. In real brioche, the liquid 
ingredients are added to the flour first, forming the tough gluten strands that 
then capture and hold the butter in place.  
</P>
<P>
 But in this version, Beard uses the food processor to thoroughly cut the 
butter into the flour before adding the liquid ingredients. When you do this, 
the fat interrupts the formation of much of the gluten structure, giving you a 
softer, more delicate bread. 
</P>
<P>
 What's even better, it's practically foolproof. This dough couldn't be easier 
to put together, and it can be made the night before and left to rise slowly in 
a plastic food bag in the refrigerator. Pull it out the next morning, let it 
warm briefly, then roll it out and bake it. You can have freshly made cinnamon 
brioches on the breakfast table in just over a half-hour. 
</P>
<P>
 And if that isn't enough to erase any lingering prejudices against machinery, 
I don't know what is. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This recipe, adapted from the brioche loaf in James Beard's "New Recipes for 
the Cuisinart" (Cuisinarts: 1976), can be varied in many ways. Sprinkle raisins 
over the cinnamon sugar, for example. Or sprinkle the rolled - out dough with 
chocolate chips, fold it in the same way and you'll end up with a nice pain au 
chocolat. Or spread the dough with any kind of fruit jam. . . . You get the 
picture.  
</P>
<P>
 CINNAMON BRIOCHE 
</P>
<P>
 1 package dry yeast 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup warm milk (95 to 105 degrees) 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups flour 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup frozen butter, cut into pieces 
</P>
<P>
 2 eggs 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons melted butter 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons sugar mixed with 2 teaspoons cinnamon 
</P>
<P>
 Combine yeast, sugar and milk in small bowl. Set aside to proof. 
</P>
<P>
 In food processor combine flour, salt and butter and pulse to cut in butter 
finely. Add yeast mixture and pulse again, then add eggs and process until 
dough gathers in ball that comes cleanly away from sides of work bowl and rides 
around on top of blade. Process 1 minute. Then remove ball to lightly floured 
board and knead 1 to 2 minutes until smooth.  
</P>
<P>
 Form dough in smooth ball and place in lightly oiled bowl, turning to coat all 
sides of ball. Cover loosely with plastic wrap. Set aside in warm place to rise 
until doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Alternatively, place kneaded dough ball in tightly sealed plastic food bag and 
refrigerate overnight. Dough will rise slowly in plastic food bag and just need 
to be brought to room temperature before rolling out. 
</P>
<P>
 When risen, punch dough down and flatten into rectangle. On lightly floured 
board, roll out to 1/2-inch thick. If dough is square, cut in half. Brush top 
surface with melted butter and sprinkle with cinnamon sugar. Fold long side of 
dough rectangle 2/3 of way across dough. Fold remaining 1/3 of dough over as in 
letter. Brush top with butter and sprinkle again with cinnamon sugar. Cut into 
2-inch-wide sections, transfer to ungreased baking sheet. Let rise again until 
puffy, 15 to 20 minutes. Bake at 350 degrees 20 to 30 minutes, until 
light-brown. Makes 18 to 20 cinnamon brioches.

<P>
 Each of 18 brioches contains about:

SPECIAL TEAS FROM VIETNAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA HANSEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Something new is brewing for American tea drinkers -- rare teas from Vietnam 
that will be ready for distribution here this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The specialty teas, some exotically flavored and packaged in handcrafted, 
folk-art containers, are worlds apart from the mass-produced, serviceable tea 
used for everyday drinking in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider a sparkling cup of Shan tea, brewed from leaves that once fluttered 
on century-old trees growing in the northernmost provinces of Hoang Lien Son 
and Ha Puyen, near the Chinese border. Most tea comes from low-growing bushes, 
but these are genuine trees, sturdy enough to climb. 
</P>
<P>
 How about a tea that has been nourished by a high mountain waterfall; a 
Central Highlands tea scented with lotus flowers; tea flavored with mango, 
coconut and ginger; black tea packed in a hand-carved container of cinnamon 
bark that gently spices the leaves, or in canisters of 2-year-old bamboo, 
trimmed in exquisite braiding by the Hmong people of North Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 The importer is the Los Angeles-based Indochina Tea Co., which sounds like a 
conglomerate of office personnel, tea buyers, tasters and food brokers. But 
it's the work of a single determined, slim, blond woman who two years ago was 
out of a job. 
</P>
<P>
 Gabriella Karsch was national sales and marketing manager for Mitsubishi 
International. Then, like so many others, she was out on the street, without an 
income but not without vision and hope. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaving her office for the last time, Karsch climbed to her airy, hillside 
home off Laurel Canyon and did the only thing she could think of. She brewed a 
pot of tea. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be fine," she assured herself, wondering if it really would be. 
Then, getting businesslike, she drew up a simple agenda: "I've got to find a 
product, and I've got to find a market." 
</P>
<P>
 And, behold, there was the product -- in her cup. Descended from a long line 
of hardy Vermont tea drinkers, Karsch sips tea like others breathe air. And 
she's been crazy about Vietnam since the 1960s, when she was there with the 
USO. When Karsch left Saigon (now Ho Chi Minh City) in 1972, she swore to a 
sign in the airport that she would be back. "I felt a real affinity to the 
land, for some reason," she says. She even settled for awhile in Florida to 
envelop herself in a similar humid climate. 
</P>
<P>
 Karsch learned from census figures that more than one million Vietnamese 
people live in the United States. "If they each have a cup, I'll be in good 
shape," she concluded. Never mind that a trade embargo prohibited imports. 
(That embargo was lifted in February.) Meanwhile, Karsch kept going on faith, 
making contacts in Vietnam, inspecting tea plantations and setting up the 
mechanics of an import business, which included taking on a partner, Stephanie 
Roth of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Spurring her on was her own devotion to the product. "I love the tea over 
there," she says. "I like the taste of it. I like the ceremony of it. Every 
time you have a happy experience you have tea." 
</P>
<P>
 Karsch is due back shortly from her sixth trip to Vietnam since the late 
1980s. When she first went back, traveling on a medical aid project, she was 
amazed to find the sign to which she had bade farewell still in place at Ho Chi 
Minh City's Ton Son Nhat airport. Fine tea, she soon learned, was a luxury 
impractical in post-war Vietnam. In order to produce enough to satisfy demand, 
leaves had to be pulled indiscriminately from the bushes, the fine buds and 
first leaves squashed in with leaves of lesser quality. 
</P>
<P>
 Karsch, however, wants only a premium plucking, and only from special sources. 
Getting the tea processed is no problem. "The Vietnamese say they need lots of 
capital for new machines. This is not true," she says. "They just need to clean 
the old machines." 
</P>
<P>
 Karsch is working in cooperation with Vinatea, the government agency in charge 
of Vietnam's tea industry. She plans to buy the tea from farmers with small 
private plots, then have it processed at government facilities.  
</P>
<P>
 About 200,000 acres are now planted to tea, and the country is exporting 40 
tons a year. "This is under extreme conditions, I would guess, looking at the 
bomb craters in the tea fields (outside Hanoi)," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 When Karsch goes to Vietnam she flies to Hanoi, stays in a government guest 
house, then travels by truck over the rough roads to what were once French tea 
plantations. In the city she wears the ao dai , the graceful costume of 
high-necked, flowing long top over pants. But in the field, she's dressed in 
pants, with leather boots to her knees. "I'm not real partial to snakes and 
bugs," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Karsch has learned Vietnamese -- "the hardest thing I ever had to do in my 
life," she says. She speaks with a strong northern accent picked up from her 
tutor. "I amuse everyone I talk to," she laughs. But that is only in Southern 
California, where most Vietnamese come from the south. 
</P>
<P>
 Karsch has a computer software program that enables her to send faxes in 
Vietnamese. And she is so immersed in the culture that she goes to Chinatown 
every weekend to eat in a favorite pho shop ( pho is Vietnamese noodle soup). 
</P>
<P>
 Karsch was recently named to head a Vietnamese outreach committee at the 
Pacific Asia Museum in Pasadena. A volunteer, she has written a leaflet on tea 
for the museum and formulates and packages a spice tea mixture that is sold at 
the bookstore there. 
</P>
<P>
 If her venture turns a good profit, Karsch plans to open an Asian-style tea 
house where customers can relax and listen to the peaceful sounds of flowing 
water. She remembers how her boss at Mitsubishi would seclude himself before an 
important meeting to drink tea, clear his mind and become focused. "He was a 
lot more effective than people who came in from a two-martini lunch," she says. 
"This is such a competitive world. You have to have your wits about you. You 
can't do it with coffee, and you certainly can't do it with booze."  
</P>

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: URBAN THAI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hard by a Silver Lake swarm of Colombian, Salvadoran and Filipino dives, 
kitty-corner from the famous wounded-foot sign that spins outside a 
podiatrist's office, Mae Ploy is the kind of neighborhood Thai restaurant that 
should be in everybody's neighborhood, a place with egg rolls and stir-fries 
and pad Thai noodles, but also with terrific Bangkok-cosmopolitan food: hot 
curries, Isaan-style salads, complex, vegetable-laden soups. 
</P>
<P>
 Thai customers seem mostly to order to-go food from a steam table out front, 
stocked with the usual curries and chile-speckled fried fish; everybody else -- 
black and white, Asian and Latino, gay and straight, affluent and slacker -- 
crowds into the separate dining room, pounding Thai iced tea, crunching 
sweet-sauced wedges of fried bean curd. Mae Ploy's clientele looks like L. A. 
</P>
<P>
 The cooking may not be quite as sharp as it can be at a couple of other 
Southland Thai restaurants -- Hollywood's Dee Prom and Norwalk's Renu Nakorn 
come to mind -- but it is mostly fine, and the interesting things on the menu 
here are translated into English . . . ordering the best stuff at Dee Prom 
sometimes feels like an oral midterm exam. At Mae Ploy it is easy to find 
good-tasting obscurities like chewy tripe salad or fried whole fish curled in a 
tart tamarind broth. Turn to the page of specialties at the menu's end. 
</P>
<P>
 As at a lot of Bangkok-style restaurants -- ones with as large a range of the 
fresh, fiery-hot cooking of northeastern Thailand as Shanghai-style Chinese 
restaurants tend to have of the sweet-hot food of Sichuan -- much of the best 
food involves salads and snacks. Eggplant salad is smoky and warm, garnished 
with red onion slivers and crumbles of soft tofu; a warm duck larb is nice but 
a little liver-y; bamboo-shoot salad, gritty with toasted rice, has the pungent 
gaminess peculiar to that vegetable. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a good version of the northern Thai salad nam sod , ground pork 
sauteed with chiles, peanuts, citrus, onions and vegetables. It's served barely 
warm, with the traditional garnish of pig's ear that most places leave out, but 
whose crunchiness and slight gelatinous richness gives the dish its special 
character. Another salad, coarsely chopped catfish mixed with slivers of hot 
chile, is fried into something that looks like a marine version of Rice 
Krispies marshmallow treats -- rich, yet not too oily, dressed with chile, fish 
sauce and citrus, superbly crunchy, the essence of fried food. 
</P>
<P>
 Sticks of deep-fried Thai beef jerky, powerfully beefy without having the 
unpleasant overcooked taste common to this dish, come with a smoky chile 
dipping sauce that may remind you of good chipotle chile salsa. Hot-and-sour 
seafood soup, filled with shrimp, rings of squid, green-lipped mussels and 
chunks of fish poached by the heat of the broth is almost citrus-y enough to 
pass for limeade; another, more pungent version made with tamarind seems less 
refreshing, but more balanced. 
</P>
<P>
 And if the main dishes tend to be less interesting than the specials and the 
first courses, most of them -- whole fried pompano served with the usual 
sweetish chile sauce, chicken in a gentle green curry, pepper-garlic shrimp -- 
are at least competently prepared.

GOOD COOKING: CHICAGO'S DEEP-DISH BURRITO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There comes a time when we just want to stay home on a Saturday night, wear 
jeans and have a great-tasting meal that doesn't take itself seriously, let 
alone take much time to prepare. 
</P>
<P>
 The following menu fits the bill. Burritos filled with vegetables, rice and 
beans, served with a refreshing jicama salad, make the kind of feast that is 
perfect for informal dining. The burrito filling -- a sort of Chicago-style 
deep-dish layered casserole of spinach, neon yellow rice, beans and cheese -- 
may not be authentic, but it tastes about as good as any mixture can be. 
Conclude the meal with crisp peppered chocolate wafers that can accompany fresh 
fruit, frozen yogurt or sherbets. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This is a casserole burrito mix that is spooned out onto tortillas -- it's a 
mess to eat but well worth it; each component stands out fresh and clear. If 
you keep the frozen spinach very moist, it works well in place of the 16 cups 
of fresh leaves you would have to cook in order to come up with the same 
quantity. The casserole can be set up a day ahead and baked at the last minute. 
 
</P>
<P>
 BURRITO CASSEROLE WITH SPINACH, BLACK BEANS AND NEON RICE 
</P>
<P>
 1 (15-ounce can) black beans, rinsed and drained 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon chili powder 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Salsa 
</P>
<P>
 In bowl mix beans and chili powder. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>

on top, then beans, then remaining spinach and, finally, cheese. Can be made to 
this point day in advance and refrigerated, covered airtight. 
</P>
<P>
 To serve, bake casserole at 375 degrees, covered, until sizzling, about 45 
minutes.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, heat tortillas. Sprinkle tortillas with hot water, wrap in foil and 
bake 10 to 12 minutes. Alternatively, layer tortillas between paper towels and 
microwave on HIGH power about 45 seconds. Garnish casserole with cilantro 
leaves, place on table, accompanied by tortillas, Guacamole, sour cream and 
salsa in separate serving dishes. Spoon casserole mixture onto tortillas, 
garnish as desired and roll up. Makes 4 servings.

 These cookies are light in fat but high in satisfaction. They work well with 
desserts such as ice cream, frozen yogurt or sorbets as well as fresh fruit. 
They are most efficiently made in the processor, since the chocolate does not 
need to be melted when it is finely chopped.

GARDEN FRESH; SUPER TOMATOES: BEYOND BEEFSTEAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIA THOMPSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once upon a time, tomatoes were strictly a summer and autumn treat; now we can 
buy luscious-looking tomatoes even in May. The problem is that they have all 
the flavor of colored water. Until there are tomatoes that ripen magnificently 
in cool seasons, I wish those in tomatoland would stop sending us impostors. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, if we can't eat great-flavored tomatoes in May, we can at least have 
the promise of them, for May is the time to start tomatoes growing. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomatoes are among the easiest and surest crops in the garden. Start yours 
from seed -- you can grow tomatoes with flavor you never dreamed existed. Even 
if it's just one plant in a tub. 
</P>
<P>
 Which are the best-tasting? 
</P>
<P>
 A friend once remarked that talking favorite tomatoes with cooks and gardeners 
can be more dangerous than politics and religion. She's seen fistfights. But 
rather than a punch in the mouth, I played adorable when someone told me he 
thought my favorite tomato variety was insipid. I was adorable because I know 
that the strain of seed, the soil and the climate in which the plant grows -- 
not to mention quirks of the individual palate -- make it impossible to predict 
who'll like what. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are tomatoes generally esteemed for their flavor -- many have 
exceptional looks as well. 
</P>
<P>
 For long-lasting harvest of delectable fruit, start with Yellow Currants. 
These are a wild species -- the closest to the original tomatoes from the Andes 
we're ever likely to taste. Pea-size and golden yellow, they're borne in 
clusters, their flavor sweet and true. Another brightly flavored fruit is Green 
Grape. I love the clusters of translucent yellow-green tomatoes that taste and 
look like colossal Muscats. 
</P>
<P>
 Tang-tempering sweetness is not everybody's idea of perfect tomato flavor. 
Like supersweet corn, Sweet 100 cherry tomatoes are so sweet some find them 
cloying (I do). But they're the favorite tomato of many, regardless of size. 
Gardener's Delight (aka Sugar Lump) is a super-sweet cherry tomato touched with 
tang. 
</P>
<P>
 weet, but not too sweet, is medium-sized White Wonder, which is stunning with 
ribbons of basil and shreds of lemon zest. And I'm especially partial to yellow 
Taxi, another medium-sized tomato whose vibrant flavor matches its color. Then 
there's rosy-orange Persimmon, which looks like one and is as richly flavored. 
With what's called an oxheart shape, Verna Orange is fleshy and meaty, with 
very few seeds and a marvelous old-fashioned taste. 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps the most exciting of the large, unusually colored great-tasting 
tomatoes is Big Rainbow. When nearly ripe -- at the salad slicing stage -- the 
fruits have green shoulders, a golden middle and red bottom. Weighing in at two 
pounds, these tomatoes ripen to a blend of gold and red on the outside and 
inside. In a taste test of octogenarians who remember what homegrown tomatoes 
really taste like, Big Rainbow even nudged out the beefsteak-size Brandywine, 
an Amish heirloom considered one of the finest-tasting tomatoes of all time. 
</P>
<P>
 What to do for flavorful tomatoes when you live where summers are cool? Dwarf 
but productive Czechoslovakian Stupice will give small very sweet tomatoes even 
in San Francisco! Gold Nugget, a yellow cherry tomato I'm crazy about, was also 
developed for short cool seasons but does equally well where it's warm. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for Sweet 100, all the above are heirlooms -- tomato varieties that 
have been grown for decades, if not longer, and whose seeds you can save and 
grow true the following year. But there are hybrids with fine taste, too. 
Although the tomatoes I've mentioned are trouble-free under most conditions, 
hybrids with resistance to disease can mean the difference between success and 
failure. Since 1949, Burpee's Big Boy has been a favorite hybrid with wonderful 
taste. Stokes' nearly one-pound Ultra Magnum VFT (great disease protection) 
recently was a winner in a taste test along with Yellow Brandywine and Green 
Grape. 
</P>
<P>
 To help keep diseases at bay, always rotate tomatoes through the garden, 
waiting three or four years before returning them to the same spot. 
</P>
<P>
 So order seeds at once. The moment they arrive, start the germinating process. 
I dampen a paper towel, then sprinkle over seeds. If I want to end with just 
one ferociously healthy plant, I'll germinate six seeds. This is spendthrift, 
but there are six to eight weeks between germinating and planting, so why take 
chances? 
</P>
<P>
 I fold up the paper towel and tuck it in a plastic sandwich bag. I press out 
most of the air, zipper the bag closed, and write the name of the tomato on the 
bag. Now I put the bag on a baking sheet and set it in a gas oven with just the 
heat from the pilot light. I prop the door open three or four inches with 
something sturdy and warn all comers that the oven mustn't be closed or 
lighted.  
</P>
<P>
 I check the seeds every day, sprinkling a little water over the towel if it's 
drying. In three to six days, the seeds will germinate -- this is at about 80 
degrees, the ideal temperature. If your oven is electric, other traditional 
warm dark germinating places are the tops of the refrigerator and hot water 
heater. 
</P>
<P>
 Once seeds have sprouted, drop them tails-down into rich potting soil (not 
garden earth) in a container four inches wide and as deep. Grow the seedlings 
where days are filled with light (sun or fluorescent) and nights are dark and 
between 55 and 60 degrees. Keep moist but not wet, and every few days water 
with liquid fish alternating with kelp solution, both at quarter strength. 
</P>
<P>
 When the days are warm and settled, plant the seedling, burying its first pair 
of leaves and setting plants 1 1/2 to 2 feet apart. 
</P>
<P>
 What I've described is somewhat fussy, but it is likely to give you the best 
tomatoes from your seed. If you're busy now but can expect four months of 
growing weather ahead once your soil warms up, you can just tuck tomato seeds 
into the soil, water them, and they'll do beautifully -- especially the smaller 
sorts like cherry and currant. 
</P>
<P>
 What tomatoes must have is full sun and soil that's half manure and enriched 
with a sprinkling of bone meal and rock phosphate. Or set one tomato plant in a 
deep container filled with 1 1/2 cubic feet of best potting soil. A strong 
stake for support (even if the tomato has only medium-long vines) will keep the 
crop freer of problems than were it draped along the ground. It's also crucial 
that no weeds compete with it for water and nutrients. Once the soil is warm, 
mulch with several inches of newspapers or old straw, leaving a few inches 
around the stalk so it can breathe. 
</P>
<P>
 To harvest, pick a tomato when it smells ripe, gently twisting the fruit from 
the vine. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first tomato of the season, I sit down on the front stoop and eat it 
then and there. Sometimes I share it. It's been a long time in coming, but it's 
the real thing.

 T artine is the French word for a slice of bread spread with something, and 
inspiration for this recipe came from a Nicoise book. This is the simple but 
rapturous sort of thing that requires sensational tomatoes. So clip the recipe 
and put it in your calendar for August. Then serve the tartines with drinks, 
accompanied by bowls of roasted pistachio nuts in the shell and a basket of 
golden wedges of lemon cucumbers, raw purple pod beans (neither topped nor 
tailed), white icicle radishes (ditto), clusters of grapes and a bouquet of 
arugula or watercress moist from rinsing.  
</P>
<P>
 To be their freshest, all ingredients may be in readiness, but the tartines 
should be put together and heated just before serving. They go quickly.  
</P>

WINE: GALLO AND MONDAVI TAKE ON KENDALL-JACKSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Consumers will see two new moderately priced lines of wines this summer as the 
Robert Mondavi and E&J Gallo wineries launch brands that will hit store shelves 
at prices between $6 and $9 per bottle. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say both wineries are targeting Kendall-Jackson Winery's dominance in 
affordable upscale wines, primarily its Vintner's Reserve Chardonnay. 
</P>
<P>
 Mondavi, a well-regarded Napa Valley winery, said last week it would release a 
line of wines under the name "Robert Mondavi Coastal." This week it was learned 
that Modesto-based Gallo, the world's largest winery, will release a line of 
Sonoma County wines in the same price category -- and at the same time the 
winery said it will buy grapes from Sonoma County growers at prices higher than 
Gallo traditionally has paid. 
</P>
<P>
 Both wineries seem to be taking dead aim at Kendall-Jackson, which, according 
to figures from Gomberg, Fredrikson & Associates of San Francisco, shipped 
1,265,000 cases of wine last year. A huge percentage of it was the Vintner's 
Reserve Chardonnay, which has a suggested retail price of $13 but is often seen 
discounted to $7.99. 
</P>
<P>
 Says one analyst, "K-J now has a grip on that (Chardonnay) niche, but Gallo 
and Mondavi are major players. This will be one hell of a battle." 
</P>
<P>
 The Gallo program has wine industry analysts buzzing since the firm apparently 
intends to release more than 1 million cases of wine from four grape varieties, 
all with a Sonoma County designation. Gallo, which routinely declines to 
comment on any news story, wouldn't confirm reports of a new line. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say they expect Gallo to support this launch with a major advertising 
campaign that will include print (magazines and newspapers), television and 
perhaps even a coupon offer, similar to the successful coupon offer Gallo used 
in the launch last year of its Peter Vella line of bag-in-box wines. 
</P>
<P>
 It was three years ago, at the Sonoma County Wine Auction, that Ernest Gallo, 
chairman of the winery, chatting with reporters, casually asked, "How would you 
improve the image of Sonoma County wines, which we all know are better than 
Napa Valley's?" 
</P>
<P>
 The ensuing discussion showed Gallo's strong commitment to Sonoma County, 
where the winery owns some 5,000 acres of land including more than 2,000 acres 
of vineyards, making Gallo by far the single largest grape grower in the 
county. In addition, Gallo has, over the last two years, bought huge amounts of 
grapes from other Sonoma County growers. Many such purchases in the past were 
at prices well above what Gallo usually paid. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, a Gallo spokesman confirms that the winery is offering top dollar 
for grapes from this year's harvest, which starts in August. It is an earlier 
commitment than Gallo has ever given growers, and the prices Gallo says it will 
pay surprise experts -- up to $1,150 per ton for Sonoma County Chardonnay 
grapes. Last year's base price for Chardonnay in Sonoma County was $1,092 per 
ton. 
</P>
<P>
 One industry source said: "The price Ernest is paying does two things. It 
gives him better-quality fruit for his better wines, and it puts the squeeze on 
(other wineries that) need good-quality fruit." 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Everett, a San Francisco wine industry consultant, says the huge amount of 
wine Gallo reportedly will release "is in keeping with Gallo's style. They 
don't do anything on a small scale." 
</P>
<P>
 Everett also said the move by both Mondavi and Gallo into a more upscale price 
niche wasn't unexpected. "It's common wisdom in the industry that the most 
important price category now is the $5.99 to $8.99 range," said Everett. "We 
know that many consumers feel they have to shop in that range to get anything 
good." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Gallo and Mondavi (the latter using a Woodbridge designation) have wines 
in the so-called "Fighting Varietal" price niche ($4 to $6 per bottle), but 
it's becoming increasingly difficult to make fine wine in that price range 
because of recent increases in the prices of bottles, corks, label printing and 
labor. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither winery had a product in the growing $10 to $12 area. (With the 
upcoming wines, each will be able to offer wines that discounters will carry 
for $6 to $9.) 
</P>
<P>
 One San Francisco wine industry financial analyst is skeptical of the 
impending Gallo release. "I'm surprised that the wines are that high in price," 
he says. "The 'action' in the wine business today seems to be in a much lower 
price range. This is coming at a surprisingly high price range, especially 
considering the brand in question." 
</P>
<P>
 He speculated that Gallo would initially discount the wines more deeply than 
Mondavi because of Gallo's closer relationship with the wholesale trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Gallo grows a lot of grapes from its own vineyards in Sonoma County 
-- including 300 acres of Cabernet Sauvignon; 530 acres of Chardonnay, and 120 
acres of Zinfandel. Those three varieties will be among the first releases in 
the Gallo-Sonoma line. A Sauvignon Blanc also is planned. 
</P>
<P>
 The first Mondavi wines in the new line will be a 1992 Robert Mondavi Coastal 
Chardonnay and a 1991 Robert Mondavi Coastal Cabernet Sauvignon. 
</P>
<P>
 A winery source said the reason for the line was to give the Mondavi winery 
entry into the under-$10 super-premium category, "so we can get the Napa Valley 
varietals back above the $10 price." Discounters, said the source, had been 
selling some of Mondavi's Napa Valley wines too cheaply. Wine of the Week 
</P>
<P>
 1993 Canyon Road Sauvignon Blanc ($6) -- Wonderful fresh fruit aroma of melons 
and citrus, a graceful fruitiness in the mouth and a soft/crisp balance in the 
aftertaste. Winemaker Mike Draxton did a masterful blending job to accent the 
fruit and not the grassy elements in this exceptional value. Usually found at 
less than $5 a bottle.

LOW-FAT COOKING; SEAFOOD CREPES: SIMPLY DIVAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Cakes (Chapters Publishing; 1993: $9.95).

<TEXT>
<P>
 These luscious crepes filled with seafood and smothered with creamy Sherry 
sauce(plus some healthful broccoli, a la chicken divan) may look as if they're 
loaded with fat, but they contain only three grams of fat per serving. 
</P>
<P>
 The base for the rich-tasting "cream" sauce is chicken broth and nonfat milk. 
Instead of making a roux out of butter and flour, first blend the flour with 
some chicken broth to form a smooth paste. Gradually whisk in the remaining 
broth and nonfat milk. It is necessary to stir the sauce while it heats, to 
prevent lumps from forming. After coming to a full boil and thickening, add egg 
substitute both for richness in flavor and consistency. Lemon zest and tarragon 
go well with the Sherry-flavored sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 The crepes can be baked in a large gratin dish or in individual baking dishes. 
If the sauce is not as brown as you would like after baking, put the crepes 
under the broiler for a few minutes. Baby carrots and a watercress garnish are 
colorful accompaniments.  
</P>
<P>
 * BAKED SEAFOOD CREPES

<P>
 1 cup chicken broth 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup flour 
</P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 1/4 pound flaked cooked crab meat 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup broccoli florets, blanched 
</P>
<P>
 Crepes 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese 
</P>
<P>
 Blend some chicken broth into flour in medium saucepan to form smooth paste. 
Stir in remaining broth and milk to form smooth paste. Heat to boiling, 
stirring constantly. Boil and stir until thickened, about 1 minute. Add little 
hot broth to egg substitute in bowl and stir until blended. Pour egg substitute 
mixture into saucepan with flour and broth. Heat just until slightly thickened, 
being careful not to curdle. Stir in Sherry, lemon zest, tarragon and salt and 
white pepper to taste. Let sauce cool until ready to assemble Crepes. 
</P>
<P>
 Combine shrimp, crab, broccoli, 1/2 cup cooked sauce, salt and white pepper to 
taste. Spoon filling into filled Crepes and roll up. Arrange in large serving 
dish or individual baking dishes. Spoon remaining sauce over filled Crepes. 
Sprinkle Parmesan cheese over. Bake at 375 degrees 15 to 20 minutes until hot 
and lightly browned on top. Makes 6 seafood crepes.

PORK AND FENNEL SPECIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY ROSBOTTOM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 These pork tenderloins, with a delicious fennel and orange-scented bread 
stuffing, look as if they are complicated and time-consuming to make. But, in 
fact, they can be easily assembled a day in advance and need only 40 minutes in 
the oven. Served with a sauce made with chicken stock and white wine, which are 
used to baste the roasts, the sliced tenderloins make a very attractive entree 
for special menus. ROASTED PORK TENDERLOINS WITH FENNEL AND ORANGE-SCENTED 
STUFFING 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 2 1/4 cups chopped onions 
</P>
<P>
 3 cups fresh bread crumbs 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon fennel seeds, crushed 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon grated orange zest 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 3 cups chicken stock 
</P>
<P>
 3 (12-ounce) pork tenderloins, trimmed of all fat 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup dry white wine 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 tablespoons flour 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons chopped parsley 
</P>
<P>
 Heat 3 tablespoons oil in medium-heavy skillet over medium heat. When hot, add 
onions and saute, stirring, until tender, about 5 minutes. Mix in bread crumbs, 
fennel seeds, orange zest, 3/4 teaspoon salt and 3/4 teaspoon black pepper. 
Remove from heat. Add 3 to 4 tablespoons chicken stock and mix just to moisten 
stuffing slightly. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Place pork on work surface. Using sharp knife, make lengthwise cut down center 
of 1 tenderloin, cutting 2/3 of way through. Open flaps as for book. Make 
lengthwise cut down center of each flap, cutting 1/3-inch deep. Use meat mallet 
or rolling pin to pound pork to 1/4-inch thickness. Season to taste with salt 
and pepper. Repeat process with remaining 2 tenderloins. 
</P>
<P>
 Spread tenderloin with 1/3 of stuffing, leaving 1/2-inch border on all sides. 
Start on long side and roll meat up, jellyroll style. Tie pork with string at 1 
1/2-inch intervals. Repeat with remaining pork and filling. (Pork can be 
prepared day ahead. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate.) 
</P>
<P>
 Place heavy roasting pan over high heat and add remaining 1 tablespoon oil and 
butter. When hot, add meat and brown on all sides, 5 to 6 minutes. Remove pork 
from pan but do not clean pan. Place roasting rack in pan and place pork on 
rack. Pour all but 3 tablespoons remaining stock over pork. Roast on middle 
rack at 350 degrees, basting pork with pan juices every 10 minutes, until meat 
thermometer registers 150 degrees, 35 to 40 minutes. Transfer pork to platter 
and tent with foil to keep warm. 
</P>
<P>
 Strain liquid from roasting pan and discard solids. Return strained liquid and 
wine to roasting pan. Place pan over high heat and bring to boil. Reduce heat 
and simmer 5 to 7 minutes. Mix flour with remaining 3 tablespoons stock to make 
thin paste. Whisk into liquid in pan and cook until sauce thickens, 3 to 4 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove strings from roasts. Cut meat into 1/2- to 3/4-inch slices. Overlap 
slices on platter. Nap with sauce. Sprinkle with parsley. Serve extra sauce 
separately. Makes 8 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Note : To crush fennel seeds, place in plastic food bag and pound with rolling 
pin or meat mallet.

POTATO SALAD: HOLD THE MAYO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FAYE LEVY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Supermarkets sell potato salad by the bucket, but these salads often have too 
much fat, sugar and salt. When we make potato salad in our own kitchen, we can 
control the taste and nutritional content. 
</P>
<P>
 The potato salad most familiar to us is heavily coated with mayonnaise. Yet 
there is another kind of potato salad, popular in Mediterranean countries, that 
many people will be glad to discover. These potato salads are dressed with 
vinaigrette. In spite of being much lighter, they are just as delicious as our 
creamy ones. A case in point is the colorful Lebanese potato salad with 
tomatoes, mint and green onions, or the French potato salad with watercress 
with a touch of white wine. 
</P>
<P>
 Vinaigrette is lighter-textured and lower in fat and cholesterol than 
mayonnaise. Besides, it's more fluid; therefore, a smaller amount of it is 
needed to moisten the potatoes. By choosing buttery-tasting Yukon Gold or other 
flavorful, good-quality potatoes, you can be frugal with the amount of dressing 
you add so that the salad is light. 
</P>
<P>
 Basic potato salad is usually accented with onion. You can use yellow onions, 
but red, sweet or green onions make a finer salad. Parsley adds a fresh accent, 
and other herbs such as chives, mint, cilantro, tarragon and basil produce 
delectable variations. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorful cooked vegetables such as beets, carrots or peas are a welcome 
addition; add all three and you have traditional Russian potato salad. Zesty 
condiments such as pickled cucumbers, capers, black olives or chopped anchovies 
ensure that the salad won't be bland. 
</P>
<P>
 A French trick for adding flavor to potato salads is to marinate the potatoes 
briefly while they are still warm. Mix a little white wine and oil for the 
marinade or simply sprinkle the potatoes with part of the vinaigrette dressing. 
</P>
<P>
 For easy preparation and good flavor, cook the potatoes in their skins and 
peel them after cooking. To speed up the cooking, cut large potatoes in half. 
Be sure the potatoes are cooked just right by checking them with a knife. 
Undercooked potatoes do not taste good; but if the potatoes are overcooked, 
they fall apart when cut and tossed with the dressing. 
</P>
<P>
 You can make the vinaigrette dressing according to the classic proportions of 
three tablespoons oil for every tablespoon of vinegar or lemon juice. For a 
lower-fat result, use only two tablespoons of oil and, if the dressing tastes 
too sharp, add a teaspoon or two of water. Vary the flavors by using walnut oil 
or extra-virgin olive oil and tarragon vinegar or other herb vinegars. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of us tend to serve potato salad cold. However, very cold dressing 
usually congeals and makes the salad appear dry. If you taste the salad 
straight from the refrigerator, you might think it needs moistening and you'll 
be tempted to add more dressing. The salad tastes best if you let it stand at 
room temperature for about 15 minutes before serving. 
</P>
<P>
 Potato salad is perfect for home cooking. It's easy to make and inexpensive. 
Most important, your own potato salad can be more tasty and healthful than 
anything you find at the store. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh mint and green onions give this refreshing salad a lively flavor, and it 
needs only a small amount of zesty lemon juice and olive oil dressing.  
</P>
<P>
 LEBANESE POTATO SALAD WITH TOMATOES AND MINT 
</P>
<P>
 2 pounds Yukon Gold or red-skinned potatoes, scrubbed but not peeled 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons strained fresh lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon water 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Cayenne pepper 
</P>
<P>
 2 to 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 1/3 cup chopped green onions 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup chopped fresh mint 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup parsley 
</P>
<P>
 3 to 4 plum tomatoes, cut into small dice 
</P>
<P>
 Place potatoes in large saucepan. Cover with water by about 1/2 inch and add 
salt. Bring to boil. Cover and simmer over low heat until knife pierces center 
of largest potato easily and potato falls from knife when lifted, about 25 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, whisk lemon juice with water and salt, black pepper and cayenne to 
taste in large bowl. Add 2 tablespoons olive oil and whisk again. 
</P>
<P>
 Drain potatoes. Rinse briefly and leave just until cool enough to handle. Peel 
potatoes and cut into 1-inch dice. Add to bowl. Fold gently but thoroughly with 
dressing. Let cool. Fold in green onions, mint and parsley. Adjust seasonings 
to taste. Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil, if desired. Gently fold in tomatoes. 
Serve at room temperature. Makes 4 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A generous amount of fresh watercress lends a tasty accent to this salad. Buy 
very fresh watercress and use within a day or two, so the color remains bright 
- green. For a variation popular in France's Perigord region, make the 
vinaigrette with walnut oil and substitute two tablespoons chopped fresh 
tarragon for the watercress.

MAN IN PHOTO COULD BE KEY TO FIRE INVESTIGATION; EVIDENCE: SUSPECTS IN MALIBU 
BLAZE SAY HE LENT THEM A DEVICE TO HOOK A HOSE TO A HYDRANT. MYSTERY PLUMBER OR 
CONTRACTOR HAS NOT COME FORWARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON and ROBERT J. LOPEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two firefighters suspected of setting last year's Calabasas/Malibu fire have 
told friends that a man pictured in last week's Los Angeles Times may have key 
evidence to bolster their account. 
</P>
<P>
 But sources close to the investigation say the man has not come forward 
despite an avalanche of publicity, and investigators are not convinced that he 
could offer any significant information. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven R. Shelp and Nicholas A. Durepo, both of whom were volunteer 
firefighters at the time of last year's blaze, have told investigators that 
they stopped a passing plumber as the fire was spreading and borrowed from him 
a device that allowed them to hook a garden hose to a nearby fire hydrant. At a 
news conference last week, Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block questioned 
that aspect of their story, noting that investigators have been unable to 
locate the plumber. 
</P>
<P>
 In Saturday's editions, The Times published a photograph of a man drinking 
from the hose, and Shelp has told his friends that the man in that photograph 
is the mystery plumber, who Shelp has said was driving a white pickup truck 
along Old Topanga Canyon Road and stopped to help. People close to Durepo say 
he has told them roughly the same thing, adding that the man might be a 
contractor rather than a plumber. 
</P>
<P>
 If their accounts are correct, the unidentified man in the picture could have 
evidence that would help corroborate the firefighters' accounts of what 
happened Nov. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 The friends of Durepo and Shelp spoke on condition of anonymity because some 
work for area fire departments and say they fear for their jobs. The friends 
also cited a strict no-comment policy that lawyers for Shelp and Durepo have 
imposed on the two suspects and people close to them.

<P>
 Although they have declined to discuss their case publicly, investigators 
doubt many aspects of the version of events told by Durepo and Shelp, sources 
familiar with the investigation say. They note that Shelp and Durepo failed lie 
detector tests (such tests generally are inadmissible in court because of their 
unreliability) and say that, during a break in their interviews with 
investigators, Shelp was overheard to say to Durepo: "Don't sweat this. I won't 
give you up." 
</P>

 Block has said he is confident that the Sheriff's Department has identified 
the right suspects. Meanwhile, the Los Angeles County district attorney's 
office has scheduled three days of grand jury hearings for next week, and at 
least half a dozen people have been ordered to appear. 
</P>
<P>
 Details of the case came to light last week, and since then, investigators and 
prosecutors have engaged in a tense faceoff over how to proceed. While Block 
was publicly discussing some aspects of the case, Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti was 
out of town and his office has generally declined official comment. However, 
sources there have expressed some doubts about the strength of the Sheriff's 
Department case. 
</P>
<P>
 Block's comments and those from other sources familiar with the investigation 
have dramatically increased the pressure on Garcetti to take decisive action in 
the case. If Garcetti chooses not to prosecute, there also is the possibility 
that the U.S. attorney's office could accept the case because arson is a 
federal as well as a state crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti and Block have scheduled a meeting for today to discuss how to 
proceed in the case, sources said.

PROPOSED BAN SPURS FLURRY OF GUN BUYING; WEAPONS: HOUSE VOTE TO OUTLAW MOST 
SEMIAUTOMATICS AND MAGAZINES HOLDING MORE THAN 10 ROUNDS IS DRIVING UP PRICES 
AND SALES THROUGHOUT THE AREA. 
</P>

 Throughout Los Angeles, the rush is on as people flock to gun shops for what 
may be their last chance to purchase intimidating-looking weapons with 
high-tech names as well as high-capacity ammunition magazines for all 
semiautomatic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 After the House of Representatives passed a bill a week ago that would bar the 
future manufacture, sale and possession of most semiautomatic weapons and any 
magazine holding more than 10 rounds, aficionados ranging from the serious gun 
collector to the average Joe have been hitting gun shops from the Westside to 
the High Desert. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guns on the lists have doubled (in sales)," said Laura Brunts, manager of 
Santa Fe Gun Galleria in Palmdale, where articles on gun control are copied and 
left on the counter, free for the taking. "We are selling four times as many 
magazines as we did before the ban." 
</P>
<P>
 And prices are climbing. 
</P>
<P>
 At Santa Fe, AK-47 magazines with 30 rounds are going for $35, up from $19.95 
last week, and prices on all semiautomatic handguns were raised $50 Wednesday 
morning. There was but one MAK-90 military-style rifle left in the store 
Wednesday, although 10 more will be shipped soon. When they arrive, Brunts said 
the price will jump $200, to $750. 
</P>
<P>
 The version of the weapons ban approved by the House is similar to one passed 
by the U.S. Senate in November. A conference committee must work out any 
differences between the two before the ban is sent to President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 The ban would outlaw 19 types of semiautomatic weapons, but in California most 
guns on the list already were illegal under a 5-year-old state ban, except for 
the Intertech-9, MAK-90 and Colt Sporter -- the civilian version of the M-16 -- 
and their copies. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Lesmeister, director of the National Assn. of Federally Licensed Firearm 
Dealers -- which represents 30,000 gun store owners nationwide -- said sales on 
the West Coast have doubled, while Midwest gun shop owners are seeing their 
sales triple. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the guns on the list were already in short demand," Lesmeister said. 
"I think as the shortage gets worse, the demand gets great, as it gets closer 
to becoming law."  
</P>
<P>
 During lunch hour Wednesday, business was booming at Gun Heaven off Fairfax 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 David M. Bell, an investment manager for a firm in Downtown Los Angeles, 
stopped in to purchase a semiautomatic pistol, a Colt Sporter rifle and a 
semiautomatic shotgun -- all of them slated for banning under the federal law 
because of their large-magazine capacities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a hothead," said Bell, who shelled out about $7,000 for the guns. 
"I'm not a white supremacist. I don't think we need to hoard guns for the 
oncoming apocalypse. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if my life is going to be challenged, I want to be able to defend myself. 
The criminals are still going to have guns." 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the increasing prices, B & B Sales in North Hollywood, one of the 
area's largest gun outlets, also was bustling. 
</P>
<P>
 Gun merchants there, as elsewhere, defended their recent price hikes, saying 
they reflected a matter of supply and demand that had led to higher wholesale 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Kahn, owner of B & B Sales, said manufacturers have raised the price of 
guns that he ordered before the ban passed. 
</P>
<P>
 And rising price tags certainly did not stop Chris Encinas from purchasing his 
first gun at B & B on Wednesday. In fact, it put pressure on him to buy before 
prices skyrocketed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to rush it," said the 25-year-old Van Nuys man as he stood at the 
glass counter, where 20 semiautomatic handguns were displayed. "If we didn't 
have the ban I wouldn't have to, but it's better that I buy it today." 
</P>
<P>
 As the salesman placed the gun on the counter and Encinas ran his fingers over 
his $510 choice -- a Glock 40-caliber semiautomatic handgun with a 15-round 
magazine -- he said: "I can't wait to get it home." 
</P>
<P>
 The gun would remain legal under the ban, but the high-capacity magazine would 
not. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner's in Reseda is among the stores that has not yet raised its prices, 
according to store manager Terry Barnes. But he said he has been offered as 
much as three times the retail price of some models that he does not stock. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are willing to pay whatever," Barnes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many gun shop owners contacted blamed the media for the ban, and refused to 
talk to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The media fuels everything," said Lee Montoya, special project director for 
Turner's Outdoorsman, a chain of hunting and fishing stores in Southern 
California. "For people who were on the fence about buying a gun, this probably 
decided it for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Anger about the ban also was expressed by many customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sucks," said Jerry McCain, a Mojave resident who said that if he had the 
money he would buy a semiautomatic gun before they become illegal. "This whole 
notion of banning them to keep them away from outlaws, it ain't going to work." 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence of the gun-buying frenzy prompted by the ban has yet to reach the 
state level, said Mike Broderick of the State Department of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won't know anything for a number of days," said Broderick, whose office 
usually processes 60,000, 15-day waiting period applications daily. 
</P>
<P>
 But in many gun shops, empty display cases made it evident that the rush is 
on. Shop owners recalled that a similar increase in business occurred last year 
when Congress passed the Brady law, which required a 15-day waiting period for 
handgun buyers. A second burst of sales happened when Sen. Dianne Feinstein 
(D-Calif.) introduced the ban on assault-style weapons late last year, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 At American Arms International in Glendale -- which advertises it will beat or 
match any price -- salesman Nick Sepian said he sold 10 guns daily before the 
ban, and now sells 25 most days. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody knows exactly what is going to be banned," Sepian said. "But we are 
selling anything that has high capacity and looks intimidating." 
</P>
<P>
 Across town at Western Gun Shop on Western Avenue, store employees estimated 
that business has increased by half since the House voted on the measure last 
Thursday. Store manager David Joo said he had to hire two more workers to meet 
the demand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Up until now, I haven't had any time to have my lunch," Joo said. "It's been 
so busy."

COPTER SHOWED NO SIGN OF ENGINE TROUBLE; AVIATION: TWO VICTIMS IN THE FIERY 
ACCIDENT ON POMONA FREEWAY ARE TENTATIVELY IDENTIFIED AS JAPANESE NATIONALS. 
VISIBILITY WAS NOT A FACTOR, INVESTIGATORS SAY. 
</P>

 There were no signs of engine failure before a helicopter clipped a telegraph 
cable between the tops of two power line towers, crashed onto the Pomona 
Freeway and exploded in flames, killing both men on board and tying up traffic 
for hours, federal officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County coroner's office said the victims were tentatively 
identified as Japanese nationals, one 24, the other 33. Both victims were 
severely burned in the fire that followed the crash, and positive 
identification was not expected for several days. 
</P>
<P>
 The Robinson R-22 helicopter, which had been on a training flight from Chino 
to Pacoima, was flying back to Chino Airport about 9:42 p.m. Tuesday when the 
accident occurred, said Tom Wilcox, an investigator with the National 
Transportation Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilcox said a Los Angeles police officer and a Los Angeles County sheriff's 
deputy were both eastbound on the Pomona Freeway in the Hacienda Heights area 
when they noticed the aircraft following the freeway in roughly the same 
direction as they were driving. 
</P>
<P>
 The helicopter was flying at a slow speed and at an unusually low altitude, 
with its landing lights on, the two officers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They saw a flash," Wilcox said of the officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence shows that the helicopter struck and severed a seven-strand 
communications cable between two 180-foot Southern California Edison Co. towers 
that straddle the freeway, NTSB officials said. The broken cable dropped onto 
some power lines, which shorted out in the flash of light that could be seen 
for miles. 
</P>
<P>
 The crippled aircraft crashed onto the westbound lanes between Azusa Avenue 
and Hacienda Boulevard and burst into flames, witnesses said. Debris from the 
shattered aircraft struck several cars, causing minor injuries to four 
motorists and triggering a traffic jam that lasted for more than five hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Safety board sources said the overcast ceiling was several thousand feet above 
the ground and visibility was about five miles at the time of the accident, so 
it appears unlikely that weather had forced the pilot into the power lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Although specifying no specific minimum altitudes, Federal Aviation 
Administration regulations require a helicopter to fly at a sufficient height 
to permit making a safe landing in the event of engine failure, Wilcox said. 
</P>
<P>
 A preliminary study of the wreckage gives no indication that the helicopter's 
engine failed or that it suffered any other type of mechanical failure, sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although other models have experienced problems prompting NTSB requests for a 
safety review, Robinson's two-seat R-22, built at the company plant in 
Torrance, generally has an excellent safety record. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Robinson (R-22) helicopter has had a lot of accidents, but they were 
always attributed to pilot error," said Bob Muse, director of operations for 
U.S. Helicopters in Long Beach, the authorized dealer for R-22s in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is that it's the No. 1 helicopter in the world," Muse said. 
"There are more R-22s sold than all other helicopters combined, but their 
primary use is for flight training, so you end up with the least experienced 
people flying the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wires and helicopters have always been a problem," Muse said. "The pilot 
probably lost his train of thought and ended up flying lower than he should." 
</P>
<P>
 Muse said he sold the helicopter involved in the crash to Scott Tingley, 
president of Skyline Aviation, a firm that rents helicopters and other aircraft 
at Chino airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Tingley said the pilot of the chopper that crashed was "FAA licensed with 
plenty of experience." In about one more week, he would have had the training 
and flight experience necessary to apply for a commercial pilot's license. 
</P>
<P>
 "He filed a flight plan to Whiteman (Airport in Pacoima), then he was going to 
fly to Downtown L.A., and then head back to Chino," Tingley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The helicopter carrying the two men took off about 8 p.m. and headed northwest 
toward Pacoima, the NTSB said.  
</P>
<P>
 Wilcox said that while flying over the San Fernando Valley, the pilot talked 
with air traffic controllers at Burbank Airport. The pilot did not mention 
trouble, Wilcox said. 
</P>
<P>
 The safety board investigator said that when heading from Downtown to Chino, 
helicopters often fly along a traffic corridor that roughly follows the Pomona 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a Japanese pilot, and he might have been confused where he was," Muse 
said. "If you're flying near the freeway, sometimes you go down low to read the 
freeway signs." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilcox said the NTSB is not expected to complete its investigation and render 
a verdict on the cause of the accident for several months.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; 
EX-SERGEANT WHO TESTIFIED AGAINST LAPD GETS $150,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The sergeant who once trained Los Angeles police officers in the use of force 
was awarded $150,000 Wednesday to settle his allegation that he was demoted in 
retaliation for his testimony against fellow officers, including those involved 
in the beating of Rodney G. King. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council voted unanimously to make the payment to Fred 
Nichols, who is now retired, to resolve his lawsuit against the city and 
several top police administrators, including former Chief Daryl F. Gates. 
</P>
<P>
 Nichols got high marks in department evaluations when he headed the 
department's self-defense and use-of-force training section, his lawsuit said. 
But, according to his lawsuit, he fell into disfavor in 1991 when he told a 
grand jury that officers in the King case used excessive force. 
</P>
<P>
 Nichols charged that he also inspired the wrath of Gates and other LAPD top 
brass when he criticized them before the Christopher Commission and when he 
testified in a criminal trial that two Long Beach officers had used excessive 
force in subduing activist Don Jackson. The 17-year LAPD employee said he was 
further ostracized because he was one of the few black supervisors on the 
force. 
</P>
<P>
 City lawyers defending the case said Nichols was never demoted, never lost 
wages and that his removal as head of the training section was not retaliatory.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; SHANNEN 
DOHERTY SUED BY FORMER LANDLORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shannen Doherty's ex-landlord sued the "Beverly Hills 90210" cast member 
Wednesday, alleging that she did $136,300 worth of damage to an apartment and 
stiffed him for $14,000 in rent. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Nishimura, who filed eviction papers against the Memphis-born actress in 
late March, 1993, owns the unit she rented on North Doheny Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Doherty's publicist, Lisa Kasteler, said the actress was out of the country 
and had not been served with the Los Angeles Superior Court lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 In the lawsuit, Nishimura claims Doherty moved out after the eviction papers 
were served. But he alleges that he was unable to rent the unit until the lease 
expired in August because of the severity of the damage. He says that cost him 
an additional $44,000 in potential income.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: GLENDALE; SHOP CO-OWNER 
RECOGNIZES RARE COINS, AIDS IN ARREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The co-owner of a Glendale coin shop is responsible for the recovery of nearly 
$500,000 in rare silver and gold coins stolen more than a year ago from a Long 
Beach coin show, and the arrest of a suspect in the theft, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Van Bebber recognized the coins Monday when some of them were brought 
into his Coin and Stamp Galleries by a man attempting to sell them, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas J. Riccio, 31, of Bell, described by authorities as a baseball card 
dealer, was arrested Monday by Glendale police who responded to a call from the 
employee, Officer Robert Velasco of the Long Beach Police Department said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coin dealers are a close-knit group, they know each other and when there is a 
theft like that, they are aware of it," said Sgt. Jim Rodriguez, a detective in 
the burglary division. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the man's home, detectives found two safes containing most of the 1,100 
coins, which are valued at between $350,000 and $500,000, Velasco said. 
</P>
<P>
 Riccio was booked on suspicion of grand theft, receiving stolen property and 
on outstanding traffic warrants, Velasco said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; 3 
SENTENCED TO PRISON FOR TELEPHONE FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three men were sentenced to federal prison this week for their role in a 
Culver City-based telemarketing "boiler room" scheme that defrauded hundreds of 
victims throughout the country of more than $2.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The case represents the first local prosecution and sentencing from "Operation 
Disconnect," a coordinated FBI operation in 13 states in which more than 240 
people were arrested, according to U.S. Atty.Nora M. Manella. 
</P>
<P>
 Altaf Almani of Playa del Rey, the president of the company involved in the 
fraud, was sentenced to 57 months in prison and three years probation. Two 
other defendants were sentenced to 51 months and 27 months, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. Bart H. Williams said the defendants obtained money by 
leading victims to believe they had won expensive bonuses and gifts as part of 
the company's promotional campaign.

 The following Los Angeles Unified schools will begin accepting applications 
next Monday under a state law that allows open enrollment at any school with 
space available. Schools with no space are omitted; magnet and charter schools 
are not subject to open enrollment. Applications are available at all schools. 
Principals must sign the application but cannot refuse permission to transfer. 
Application deadline is June 13. Lotteries on June 14 will allot seats at 
schools with high demand. School: Open spaces Adams Middle: 200 Albion Street

MAN KILLS PARENTS, SELF DURING 911 CALL; TRAGEDY: NEIGHBORS SAY THE FORMER 
GEOLOGIST SNAPPED AFTER TWO YEARS OF UNEMPLOYMENT. HIS BROTHER, WHO WAS 
CRITICALLY INJURED, WAS ON THE EMERGENCY LINE WHEN GUNFIRE BEGAN.

 A despondent Whittier man who had been virtually jobless for two years gunned 
down his family and then killed himself in a blood bath that erupted midway 
through a 911 call his brother had made in an attempt to prevent the man's 
suicide, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas G. Morgan, 43, an unemployed geologist and occasional substitute 
teacher, died Tuesday night of a single gunshot wound after killing his elderly 
parents and wounding the younger brother who had tried to save his life, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan's father, Frank Morgan, 73, and mother, Loretta, 71, died of multiple 
shots from the man's .45-caliber handgun, police said. The brother, James 
Morgan, 40, who was shot in the stomach and wrist, was reported in critical 
condition at County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just snapped," said neighbor Joe Onesto, 34, as he strolled with his 
children near the tidy two-story house on Citrus Avenue where the killings 
occurred. Even the Morgan family dog, a black cockapoo, had been shot to death. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the trouble began shortly after 9 p.m. Tuesday when a dispatcher 
received an emergency call from James Morgan. According to a police tape of the 
call, the man calmly told the dispatcher that his older brother had been 
drinking and was pointing a loaded gun at his own head. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, there was the sound of James Morgan dropping the phone as five 
gunshots exploded in the background and someone screamed, "Oh, my god!" As the 
dispatcher listened, the gunfire crackled on, punctuated by the high-pitched 
wail of the dog. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers who later burst into the house found Thomas Morgan's body in the 
living room with his semiautomatic pistol nearby. Frank Morgan, a retired 
chemical engineer, had apparently managed to stumble out of the room before 
collapsing, authorities said. Loretta Morgan, a retired lab technician who sang 
in a local women's choir, was found in a nearby bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Only James Morgan managed to flee, police said. Bleeding profusely, he was 
airlifted to the hospital from a neighbor's home. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittier, a suburb east of Los Angeles, is known for its serene neighborhoods 
of historic and custom-built homes. Police said the Morgans' neighborhood, on 
the northwest side of town, is among the oldest and most affluent in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of those places where you say, 'Gee, what a quiet, nice 
neighborhood,' " Whittier police spokesman Chuck Drylie said. "I've been here 
19 years and I've never heard of anything like this happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said there was no clear motive for the shooting. But neighbors said 
they believed Thomas Morgan had been depressed over his chronic unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan earned bachelor's and master's degrees in geology from UC Riverside, 
and until two years ago he had been a geologist in Oklahoma, neighbors said. 
But when he lost that job, they said, he was unable to find full-time work and 
moved into his parents' home. 
</P>
<P>
 A neighbor who spoke on condition of anonymity said things had begun to look 
up last fall, when Morgan indicated he was planning to get a teaching 
credential. But, the neighbor said, Morgan never found more than substitute 
teaching jobs, and except for occasional stints in Montebello and Santa Fe 
Springs schools, he remained jobless. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being out of work as long as he was, I have the idea he must have gone off 
the deep end," the neighbor said. "He just had so much bad luck."

CLEANUP UNEARTHS CHUNKS OF DDT; ENVIRONMENT: WHITE CLUMPS BURIED TWO TO THREE 
FEET DEEP ARE FOUND TO CONSIST MOSTLY OF THE TOXIC PESTICIDE. THE EPA IS 
REASSESSING ITS OPERATION IN TORRANCE-AREA NEIGHBORHOOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A mysterious white substance unearthed in two back yards has proved to be 
largely DDT, prompting the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to consider 
expanding its cleanup of a South Bay neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Scattered clumps of a white, powdery material were spotted Friday in soil two 
to three feet below the surface as cleanup workers removed soil already known 
to contain the banned pesticide. EPA tests have found that the white material 
is 66% DDT and 10% decomposed DDT, mixed with soil and other organic matter, 
agency officials confirmed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA officials emphasized that because the DDT was buried, it does not pose 
a direct health hazard to people living near the two back yards along West 
204th Street east of Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 In light of the latest finding, the EPA is reassessing its cleanup plans for 
the two back yards and is launching an investigation into the source of the 
DDT, agency spokeswoman Paula Bruin said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We remain committed to cleaning it up, no matter what we find," Bruin said. 
</P>
<P>
 News that the white substance was mostly DDT spread quickly among residents, 
and some called it proof of their suspicion that the DDT contamination in their 
neighborhood is more serious than federal officials have indicated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm basically pretty disgusted," said activist Cynthia Babich, who maintains 
that the EPA should have done more extensive soil testing years ago in the 
neighborhood, which is near two toxic chemical sites, including a federal 
Superfund site that once housed a large DDT manufacturing plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Babich said she fears that highly concentrated DDT may be buried under 
neighborhood homes, and she repeated her call for the federal government to 
permanently relocate residents living closest to the cleanup site, an option 
that federal officials call highly unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 High levels of DDT were first detected during a series of surface-soil tests 
this winter and spring in the two yards, including the yard behind the home 
rented by Babich and her husband. The discovery concerned residents because 
high doses of the banned pesticide, a suspected carcinogen, can affect the 
nervous system and the liver. 
</P>
<P>
 Until this week, the highest DDT level found in the back yard soil was 4,509 
parts per million, or 45 times the level considered safe by the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to those tests, the agency began its cleanup project April 29, with 
initial plans to remove 8,000 cubic feet of soil from the two yards at a cost 
of about $350,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Babich and other neighbors expressed fears that the tainted soil could be 
blown into the air, the EPA agreed to relocate 25 families from the street in 
hotels at federal expense until the cleanup is complete. 
</P>
<P>
 When workers and residents spotted the white clumps, the EPA sent samples to a 
laboratory for testing. 
</P>
<P>
 More white clumps have been found this week in soil from both yards, but 
officials could not provide an estimate Wednesday of how much there was. 
Babich, who has been videotaping the excavation, estimates that she has seen 
enough clumps to fill two garbage cans. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA is planning to test soil in 100 to 300 yards in the neighborhood to 
make sure the DDT contamination is not widespread. 
</P>
<P>
 Babich recalled Wednesday that her husband, Frank, experienced nausea and 
vomiting after digging fence-post holes in their back yard three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents have complained of rashes, nausea, headaches and joint pain and 
have wondered if the cause is the DDT and other chemicals in the nearby toxic 
sites. Health officials have assured them, however, that there is no known way 
for residents to come into contact with those chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter deFur, a senior scientist for the Environmental Defense Fund in 
Washington, said the newly excavated DDT probably does not pose a direct health 
hazard to residents because it was two to three feet below the surface. He 
would be more concerned, he said, if such high concentrations were found in 
surface dust.

COUNCIL BLOCKS ONE CELLULAR SITE BUT OKS ANOTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council on Wednesday waded into the debate over the 
health effects of cellular phones, denying a proposed cellular transmission 
site in Hollywood but approving a similar unit near Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision came as activists in a number of communities, citing cancer 
fears, have delayed or blocked installations of the so-called cell sites, which 
have been placed on scores of office rooftops -- and in some cases schoolyards 
-- to relay cellular phone signals. In January, parents of pupils in a Laguna 
Beach elementary school forced a cellular company to remove a microwave dish 
that the school had allowed on its property in exchange for rent. Last year, an 
activist persuaded the West Hollywood City Council to quash three cellular 
permit applications. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest battles, two resident organizations, one in Hollywood and the 
other in Marina del Rey, fought AirTouch Communications Inc. over plans to 
place cell sites in those areas. 
</P>
<P>
 After city zoning officials approved the plans, Hollywood and Marina del Rey 
neighborhood groups appealed to the City Council. On Wednesday, the council 
voted 12 to 2 to block the Hollywood project, but gave the Marina plan a 
unanimous go-ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Council President John Ferraro marshaled council opposition to the Hollywood 
location after noting heavy opposition from a local homeowners group, said 
Renee Weitzer, Ferraro's planning deputy. "The residents had real concerns, 
healthwise, about the site, and we felt we should support them," Weitzer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cellular phone companies find such resistance frustrating, arguing that it 
complicates efforts to expand service. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a shame that politics is again disrupting business in the city of 
Los Angeles," AirTouch spokeswoman Melissa May said of the council's denial of 
the Hollywood cell site. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the scientific research is contradictory, according to the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency's regional office in San Francisco. Cellular 
phones and transmission units, such as radios, produce electromagnetic fields, 
but scientists have not yet reached a consensus on whether electromagnetic 
fields increase the risk of cancer.

A KINGDOM MISPLACED; HISTORICALLY, EGYPT HAS GOTTEN ALL THE GLORY -- BUT WHO 
KNEW ABOUT NUBIA? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, Rick VanderKnyff is a free-lance writer who contributes 
regularly to The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nubia has languished in Egypt's shadow for much of history, but in the last 
few years scholars have started to see the ancient Nile civilization in a new 
light. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ancient Nubia: Egypt's Rival in Africa," an exhibition that opened in 1992 at 
the University of Pennsylvania, has helped bring public attention to those 
changing views. National magazines from Newsweek to Smithsonian have weighed in 
on the subject, digging into the sometimes thorny reasons that Nubian culture 
was downplayed in the first place -- reasons that some say include implicit 
racism among past scholars. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit opens Friday at the Bowers Museum of Cultural Art in Santa Ana, 
and with it comes discussion of the sometimes-controversial issues that have 
followed the show since the beginning. While those issues are important ones, 
curator David O'Connor says, he hopes they won't cloud appreciation of the 
objects themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to being "wonderfully made," O'Connor said, the artifacts on 
display -- including a wide array of ceramics and also funerary objects, 
jewelry, tools and weapons -- demonstrate clearly the ways in which the culture 
of Nubia differed from that of its neighbor to the north. 
</P>
<P>
 In viewing the works, he said, "you realize that you're looking at a very 
different culture than Egypt." O'Connor is curator-in-charge of the Egyptian 
Section of the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and 
Anthropology, and a professor of Egyptology. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that the exhibit is making the public aware of Nubian civilization 
and culture in a way that wasn't possible before, unless you happened to live 
near one of the big, permanent collections," O'Connor said. "This is the most 
impressive way people can learn about (Nubia). It just makes a very tremendous 
impression that can't be equaled by even the most beautifully illustrated art 
book." 
</P>
<P>
 Nubia stretched for almost 900 miles along the Nile in what is now southern 
Egypt and northern Sudan. It was long seen by scholars as peripheral to ancient 
Egyptian civilization, dependent on it for cultural stimulation and inferior to 
it in political organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're talking about ancient Nubia, Egyptologists tended to take their 
view from ancient Egyptian literature, which tends to depict all other 
civilizations as dependent on Egypt," O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
 There was an unspoken assumption at work as well: "For quite a long time, 
scholars tended to think that Africa couldn't really produce substantial 
civilization or substantial culture." By this reasoning, Egypt was seen as more 
of a Mediterranean culture than an African one. 
</P>
<P>
 Scholars are now finding that Nubia had a much more sophisticated culture than 
was earlier presumed and that it deserves to be evaluated as a civilization on 
its own terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nubia has picked up as an area of interest," O'Connor said. "This interest in 
Nubia keys in with a growing interest in the ancient kingdoms of Africa, 
particularly among African Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 Revisionists believe that large kingdoms arose in Nubia much earlier than 
previously thought, well back into the Bronze Age. The exhibit includes a wide 
variety of artifacts from this period, including eggshell-thin painted bowls 
and jars from the early Bronze Age (3100 to 2200 BC), and other ceramics and 
funerary goods from Kerma, an important capital of Upper Nubia in the period 
from 2500 to 1500 BC. 
</P>
<P>
 Artifacts in the exhibit represent an Egyptian colonial period (1550 to 1100 
BC) and the Napatan and Meroitic periods of Nubian history (900 BC to AD 350, 
named for the two capital cities of the time). Influences moved both north and 
south during this period; in fact, the kings of the 25th Dynasty in Egypt (712 
to 657 BC) were Nubians. The Meroitic monarchy was replaced by smaller kingdoms 
from AD 320 to 550; after 600, a series of Christian kingdoms arose throughout 
Nubia before the region's conversion to Islam in the 16th Century. "Ancient 
Nubia: Egypt's Rival in Africa" includes more than 300 artifacts tracing a 
3,500-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the artifacts in the University of Pennsylvania's collections were 
gathered in "salvage" operations at sites that were later inundated by Lake 
Nassar after periodic raising of the Aswan Dam. Unlike in Egypt, which has been 
well-excavated, there remains room for significant discoveries in Nubia -- 
discoveries that may change the nature of the continuing debate over the level 
of Nubian civilization.

HIS AIM IS STILL TRUE; COSTELLO REGROUPED THE ATTRACTIONS NOT TO BE TRENDY BUT 
TO 'DO THE SONGS JUSTICE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In this season of back-by-popular-demand, Elvis Costello would finally seem to 
be moving in step with the drumbeat of the music marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Pink Floyd returns to lay another brick. Eagles flock to refeather their nest. 
Steve Winwood dusts off Traffic as a brand name because his own is no longer 
bankable. Meat Loaf serves up another helping of aural cholesterol. Ladies and 
gentlemen, the Rolling Stones. And Elvis Costello and the Attractions reconcile 
and try to pump it up again with their first record and tour together in eight 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 From this cynical point of view, the timing of the Attractions reunion would 
seem to be especially propitious -- or suspicious. Costello's 1993 release, 
"The Juliet Letters," found him collaborating with the Brodsky Quartet, a 
classical string ensemble. If part of his rock 'n' roll audience wasn't willing 
to follow him around that bend, the latest and most extreme in a career full of 
stylistic curves, what better way to reassure them than by reuniting the gang 
that brought us such fondly remembered rock-outs as "This Year's Model" and 
"Armed Forces"? 
</P>
<P>
 Far be it from Costello not to anticipate the cynic's viewpoint, having taken 
it himself in more than a few songs intended to lacerate, berate, mock and 
skewer. He knows how the regrouping of a band that parted on somewhat testy 
terms in 1986 might be perceived. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was resisting it, because I didn't want anybody to think it was one of 
these theoretical reunions, where there wasn't any (artistic) reason for it," 
the talkative Costello (age, 39; real name, Declan MacManus), said over the 
phone last week from Seattle, where he and the Attractions were about to play 
the second show on a tour that brings them to Irvine Meadows on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The "it" he resisted was the last step in reassembling Elvis Costello and the 
Attractions, a process he said took place in unpremeditated, piece-by-piece 
fashion last year as he worked on his latest album, "Brutal Youth." 
</P>
<P>
 Costello says the reunion unfolded like this: 
</P>
<P>
 He had barely finished work on "The Juliet Letters" when he decided late in 
1992 to record some new rock songs. He adjourned to Pathway Studios, the 
hole-in-the-wall operation in London where he recorded his 1977 debut album, 
"My Aim Is True." His plan was to play all the instruments himself, except for 
the drums, which he would leave to Attractions alumnus Pete Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I quickly found that to do the songs justice, I needed a proper band," 
Costello said. Around that time, he sat in as an observer at a rehearsal by Sam 
Moore, the soul singer of Sam & Dave fame. Costello had written a 
custom-tailored song for Moore, and among the players accompanying Moore was 
Steve Nieve, the former keyboards player in the Attractions. "They ended up not 
using the song, but Steve was playing great," he recalled. So he invited Nieve 
to come by and play on his own album-in-progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Lowe, Costello's old friend and former record producer, was recruited on 
bass. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'I can do some of these, but these other ones are not my speed,' " 
Costello said. It was producer Mitchell Froom's idea to enlist Bruce Thomas, 
the one missing Attraction, to play bass on the remaining songs. 
</P>
<P>
 That is when Costello paused and had a vision of cynics diagnosing him with 
reunionitis, that opportunistic infection common to aging rockers. 
</P>
<P>
 Thinking it over, Costello decided there was a legitimate reason for bringing 
in the last of his old comrades, and thereby re-forming the Attractions: "I 
thought, 'That (leaving Thomas out because reunions are suspect) is silly, 
because he is the man for the job." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the best things about popular music is that, for all the extraneous 
hoopla, image-making foggery and second-guessing about motives it always 
invites in its mass-marketed forms, the thing ultimately does speak for itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brutal Youth," released earlier this year, is a very good album, and that 
justifies any means short of illegality and cruel coercion that Costello may 
have used in creating it. The Attractions play great, both in driving passages 
that feature Pete Thomas' distinctive, dry snare-snaps and the stately ballads 
in which Nieve's chiming piano sets the mood (putting a plug in for Lowe, 
Costello laments that the Attractions-reunion angle has led people to overlook 
"that sneaky sound Nick creates" on such R&B-based songs as the "Hang On, 
Sloopy"-ish "Rocking Horse Road"). 
</P>
<P>
 Costello's new melodies are extremely hummable. That should be reward enough 
for those listeners who don't want to burrow diligently through the thorny 
thickets of metaphoric verbiage his lyrics sometimes grow into. Those up to the 
challenge of untangling meanings from the more dense songs will find that they 
yield a typically Costello-like range of amusement and disgust. Fans who like 
their rock straightforward and transparent can enjoy Costello at his simplest 
and most direct on the forlorn ballad, "Still Too Soon To Tell" and the 
crackling Stones/Faces/Replacements-style rocker, "Just About Glad." Those who 
like to watch an artful musical thief at play can chuckle as Costello nicks 
ideas and puts them to his own musically punning use. Check out "This is Hell," 
a wry vision of lives fallen into booze-fogged stasis. A harmony part in the 
chorus alludes stylistically to the Beatles' "It's getting better all the time" 
refrain from "Sgt. Pepper's" -- except that Costello twists the wording to "it 
never gets better or worse" in keeping with own sardonic agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 For Costello and the Attractions, who worked together from 1977 to 1986, a 
reunion meant having to get past some ruffled feelings. Bruce Thomas (no 
relation to Pete) had done much of the ruffling by writing "The Big Wheel," a 
1991 book about a rock band's travels that was a thinly fictionalized rendering 
of life with the Attractions. A reviewer for Publishers Weekly praised Thomas 
as "an honest storyteller of the first rank," but added that "He's not always 
likable, as when his disaffection makes him belittle others." 
</P>
<P>
 Costello says there was no need for emotional amends and peace offerings. As 
he tells it, the band just got matter-of-factly back to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really wasn't very dramatic," he said. "That's all a bit of daytime 
television for us. We don't need to go on one of those stupid, 'My grandmother 
is a Nazi' type of programs and talk about our problems. You just get on with 
what you want to do, and everybody is getting along great. Not everybody's 
obsessed with this culture of forgiveness and redemption as people are here. 
There's far too much bloodletting and wound-watching for my taste in American 
culture, and I won't have anything to do with it. I'm not trying to be stoic, 
but it's best just to get on with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Costello leaves the emotional bloodletting and wound-watching for the people 
in his songs, who do it compulsively and to the extreme. The Englishman, who 
lives in Ireland with his wife, former Pogues bassist Cait O'Riordan, was 
bemused to land in America last week, turn on the TV and find the scenario of 
one of his new songs, "Pony Street," being played out on one of those 
"Oprah"-type talk shows he despises (Costello says he sometimes lands on them 
when he's trying to catch the news and can't help being lured in). The song, 
which leads off "Brutal Youth," is a testy exchange between a baby-boomer mom 
and her daughter. Mother wishes the girl would follow in her own free-spirited 
footsteps; daughter finds mom and her generation a bunch of self-indulgent 
embarrassments. Costello referees the tiff, giving the two equal time. 
</P>
<P>
 Since he was sitting in Seattle, spiritual home of today's brutal rock youth, 
it seemed appropriate to ask this baby-boomer and member emeritus of the Angry 
Young Men of Rock Club what he makes of the grunge movement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw Pearl Jam last year opening for Neil Young at a big festival in 
Ireland," Costello said. "I really enjoyed the show and thought they threw 
themselves into it with complete conviction. Something real was going on. Then 
I bought the record, and if I'd bought the record first, I never would have 
listened to them. Something like 'In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida' was going on." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Nirvana and the late Kurt Cobain, he said, "I heard the records. I 
think they had some very good tunes. That's just a bad thing when somebody 
can't think of a reason to live." 
</P>
<P>
 Costello says it's appropriate to have generational divisions over music -- 
although he also expressed delight that a good number of fans in their teens 
and 20s turned out for his tour-opening show in Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody wants to feel like their parents" about music, he said. "And the last 
thing I want to do is feel I understand and am at one with every new trend. If 
it speaks to me, I'm delighted, but I don't expect it to. I'd be delighted if 
some 20-year-old has some revelation for me, but I'm not counting on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Costello credits his 19-year-old son, Mark, with helping him to one 
revelation. Costello had never been a big Jimi Hendrix fan, but his opinion 
changed a few years back when his son got into Hendrix's records. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very interesting to hear him discover the music. (He'll say,) 'Have you 
heard this guy Coleman Hawkins, this guy Cannonball Adderly?' He listens to a 
lot of jazz and a lot of funk stuff that I don't know. I collected rare 
hillbilly records; he's collecting rare '70s funk records, Bernard Purdie 
records that I didn't know existed." 
</P>
<P>
 Costello says he doesn't try to guide his son's taste, except that "I might 
buy him a record for his birthday and say, 'If you like that, there's a chance 
you'll really love this (other artist).' " 
</P>
<P>
 Costello says he owes much of his own broad palette of influences to his 
parents. He remembers his mother taking him as a boy to classical concerts and 
to a show by Tony Bennett, with whom Costello dueted last month during the 
veteran (and suddenly hip) pop-standards crooner's "MTV Unplugged" performance. 
Costello's father, Ross MacManus, is a professional musician -- a jazz 
trumpeter who later in his career became a dance-band singer. 
</P>
<P>
 "He brought a lot of different music into the house," Costello recalled. "He's 
66 and has scaled down a lot. He sings maybe a weekend a month, in what they 
call 'working men's clubs.' There aren't any working people in England anymore 
because the government put them all out of work. But they still have the 
clubs." 
</P>
<P>
 Costello hit with a rush in the late-'70s, with an opening streak of 
frequently manic and irate rock albums -- "My Aim Is True," "This Year's Model" 
and "Armed Forces" -- that were better-played, and therefore more accessible, 
than the era's punk rock. Along with some testy offstage behavior, his music 
got him pegged as one of rock's angry young men. But moving into the '80s, 
Costello chose to broaden his reach. "Get Happy" veered in an R&B direction, 
"Almost Blue" paid homage to country influences, and "Imperial Bedroom" 
explored pop-rock forms that were dense, baroque, and less easily accessible. 
Sales clearly were not his chief priority, and instead of the mega-stardom that 
seemed possible after "Armed Forces," he settled for a large cult following. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be interesting to see whether today's much-disgusted, seldom-amused 
grunge contingent can make the sort of stylistic and emotional leaps that 
Costello managed after his initial burst. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a little bit too much value placed on anger for anger's sake, as if 
that's a representation of real feeling, and anything pitched at that level 
makes it real," Costello said. "I think that's one of the fake things about 
rock 'n' roll, that simply shouting makes it right." 
</P>
<P>
 As for his stylistic explorations, he said, "If every musical style was a 
possibility to you as a child, that becomes a kind of folk music," a basis for 
natural experimentation and evolution. "Rock 'n' roll and saloon songs, jazz 
and country songs -- I don't see anything inhibiting" in attempting to sing 
them all. "The only thing is, can you sing the notes, and does it mean anything 
to you?" 
</P>
<P>
 "The Juliet Letters" brought Costello far from in-your-face ire. Not only was 
the format classical chamber music, but the framework for the songs was 
epistolary. Each song was conceived as a letter, and Costello says he and his 
Brodsky Quartet collaborators were conscious of observing some of the 
conventions and formalities of literary English. With some exceptions -- the 
scrawls of a ranting madman, the plaint of a frightened child, the comical 
spleen of an old woman toward money-grubbing relations -- the songs honor the 
reserve and detachment common to the written word, while still allowing vivid 
emotions to come through. 
</P>
<P>
 Costello, who learned to read and write music so he could work with the 
Brodsky Quartet, is moving forward with more classical projects. He said he has 
completed a strings-and-woodwind score for a children's recording in which 
Monty Python alumnus John Cleese narrates the story of Tom Thumb. He also has 
been commissioned to write a piece to be performed next year to mark the 300th 
anniversary of the death of English composer Henry Purcell. 
</P>
<P>
 But Costello views that as an aside to his main -- and prolific -- career as a 
songwriter. When the British pop starlet Wendy James asked Costello to write a 
song for her, he and wife O'Riordan responded by knocking out an entire album's 
worth -- a job Costello says was finished in a single weekend. The 10 songs, 
released by James last year as an album called "Now Ain't the Time for Your 
Tears," form a cohesive, barbed and insightful look at the pursuit of rock 
stardom. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know much about her except what I picked up from newspaper 
articles," Costello said. "I've only met her once, even now. She asked (for a 
song), and the idea developed very quickly. It was a piece of cake. It doesn't 
mean everything comes that easily. But so long as I want to pick up a guitar 
and do this kind of music when the mood takes me -- why not?"

NEW PICK OF THE WEEK: ALI FARKA TOURE WITH RY COODER "TALKING TIMBUKTU" / 
HANNIBAL  
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 World-music aficionado Ry Cooder just picked up a Grammy Award for his 
collaboration with Indian musician V.M. Bhatt, "A Meeting by the River." Expect 
to see this, Cooder's meeting across the ocean with West African guitarist 
Toure, deservedly nominated next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mali musician has long woven together traditional West African rhythms, 
North African vocal melisma and good old Mississippi Delta blues. But if this 
pairing with Cooder, whose music also is founded upon American roots styles, 
seems less conceptually surprising than "A Meeting by the River," that doesn't 
mean it's any less remarkable. Take "Soukora." It's a love song sung by Toure 
in Bambara -- one of 11 languages he speaks -- so all most English-speaking 
listeners will get of the story is the skeletal synopsis in the liner notes. 
The music, however, speaks more eloquently than words ever could. Toure opens 
with one of his signature edgy electric Afro-blues guitar riffs, then Cooder 
arrives with a delicate acoustic guitar line that floats above the tune with 
the airy sweetness of a Hawaiian lullaby. 
</P>
<P>
 Other musical guests include blues veteran Clarence (Gatemouth) Brown, who 
adds a haunting viola to "Ai Du," while jazz bassist John Patitucci and drummer 
Jim Keltner make up the rhythm section. Later, Toure features the njarka, a 
one-string lute, and his own Groupe Asco in "Banga," whose spare melody wends 
and surges like "the river spirit" it is meant to conjure. It's projects like 
this that give the Global Village a good name. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ali Farka Toure plays Tuesday at 1 p.m. in the Cal State Fullerton Pub, 800 
N. State College Blvd., Fullerton. Free. (714) 773-3501. RANDY LEWIS

 The Faces 
</P>
<P>
 "Long Player" (1971) 
</P>
<P>
 Warner Bros.  
</P>
<P>
 Like Mick Jagger and the Rolling Stones, they sometimes were referred to as 
Rod Stewart and the Faces by those without a rock 'n' roll clue. 
</P>
<P>
 But "Long Player" (along with the group's three other recently reissued studio 
albums) is rock-solid evidence that the Faces were very much a full-fledged 
band, not merely a bunch of back-up musicians for an increasingly popular 
singer. Indeed, there's a rowdy, devil-may-care quality to "Long Player" that 
is never quite as evident on Rod the Mod's more acclaimed solo discs from the 
same period (1971 also saw the release of Stewart's "Every Picture Tells a 
Story"). Before their six-year career came to a close in 1975, the Faces had 
forged a well-earned reputation for boozy-woozy behavior both on and off stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, one couldn't call "Long Player" slick and overproduced: Such 
spirited numbers as "Bad 'N' Ruin" feel like they were written and recorded 
during a late-night beer bash. The hotblooded, aptly titled "Had Me a Real Good 
Time" shifts gears midway through so the lads can wind things up with a rousing 
instrumental exchange that includes a blaring sax workout by Stones' stalwart 
Bobby Keys. Guitarist Ron Wood (now a longtime member of the Stones) and 
keyboard player Ian McLagan were also given ample space to get their ya-ya's 
out. But make no mistake: This nine-track album supplies plenty of quality 
songs to learn and sing, including a choice slice of acoustic blues by Ronnie 
Lane called "Richmond" and a spruced-up concert version of Paul McCartney's 
"Maybe I'm Amazed." And it's doubtful that Stewart ever delivered a more 
elegant ballad than "Sweet Lady Mary." 
</P>
<P>
 Unavailable for more than 10 years in the United States, "Long Player" finally 
is receiving a long overdue second life. JON MATSUMOTO

COMEDY; CULTURE CLASH WANTS TO RAISE OUR SPIRIT -- AND CONSCIOUSNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Orange County Edition.

<P>
 Culture Clash keeps hitting new levels of success, but so far the comedy trio 
hasn't become spoiled. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a popular weekly TV series (syndicated through Fox Television) and the 
recent signing of its first movie deal, the troupe is committed to keeping its 
political consciousness intact. That's especially true when it plays 
universities -- as it does Friday, with a show at the UCI Bren Events Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our primary focus is to entertain and to make people laugh, but running a 
very close second is our desire to politicize people, and that's really 
important at the college level," said group member Richard Montoya. 
</P>
<P>
 Montoya, with colleagues Ric Salinas and Herbert Siguenza, uses satirical 
sketch comedy and more-serious theatrical vignettes to explore the state of 
what they call Chicanismo in the United States, but they say their message -- 
nonviolence and activism -- plays to a broader audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a matter of being proactive rather than complacent," Montoya said. 
"Everyone should have a little bit of consciousness in them. We're trying to 
keep people on campus involved in this kind of stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides their evening performance, the trio will offer a free workshop at 1 
p.m. in the campus Cross-Cultural Center. One of the goals, Montoya said, is to 
give students the inside scoop on Hollywood, especially the lack of successful 
Latinos and how Culture Clash is bucking that trend. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's sketch-oriented TV show -- called, appropriately, "Culture Clash" 
-- is seen locally on Saturdays at 7 p.m. It started as a six-week experiment 
in July and is slowly adding cities across the country. Still, the show has yet 
to break into New York and Miami, two cities with huge Latino populations, and 
Montoya is starting to wonder why. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really doing well in each of its markets," he said. "We're kind of 
thinking it's time for it to make the leap to the (Fox) network. . . . We watch 
'In Living Color,' and we watch 'Saturday Night Live,' and this show stands 
show up there with those." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the group continues its theater projects, including a 
commissioned work to be called "Culture Clash Does Miami," about the Cuban 
experience in that city. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really one of the first pieces that takes us outside the Chicano 
experience," Montoya said. 
</P>
<P>
 Working on the TV show has actually changed the trio's live performances for 
the better, Montoya says. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stage work has kind of gotten edgier and more urgent," he said, referring 
to the tenor of its political and social commentary. "It's still funny, but the 
stage is becoming a forum for what we can't do on TV. . . . When we're on the 
stage, it's just a different animal all together." 
</P>
<P>
 The UCI show will feature skits and some more somber set pieces, set against 
the funeral last year of farm labor organizer Cesar Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
 "We look at militancy and Chicanismo and where has it gone, and what will be 
its place in the 1990s," Montoya said. 
</P>
<P>
 A central question raised is whether the Chavez legacy of "nonviolence, pride 
and unity" still has a place or whether Latinos should focus on matters 
economic and leave issues of identity unexplored. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just trying to lead the way as far as discussion," Montoya said. "Are 
we all going to become middle class and complacent, or do we find a place where 
our militancy works hand in hand with our daily lives?" 
</P>

DANCE; FROM SPOTLIGHT TO SIDELINES TO BEHIND THE SCENES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN, Zan Dubin covers the arts for The Times Orange County Edition.

<P>
 You can take the dancer out of the ballet, but you can't take the ballet out 
the dancer. 
</P>
<P>
 At least that's James Jones' experience. After abandoning a ballet career -- 
which included stints with respected Frankfurt and Zurich troupes -- to create 
a successful computer business four years ago, Jones returned last winter, as a 
choreographer, to his first love. 
</P>
<P>
 Ballet Pacifica will perform his neoclassic "Concerto in D," set to 
Stravinsky's Violin Concerto, Friday and Saturday at Irvine Barclay Theatre. 
It's the troupe's first performance of the work. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was all business and no ballet, "my life wasn't balanced," the Laguna 
Beach resident said. "I have a deep love for dance, and I don't want to just 
put it away because I think I don't have time for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, 40, founded ComputerBooks, a medical softwear outfit, in 1990 upon 
earning an MBA at UC Irvine, where he first studied ballet as an undergrad in 
the early '70s and taught ballet from 1980 to 1989. He switched to business, he 
said in a recent phone interview, because "my mind was just wanting something 
besides rehearsals," and he wanted training to help run South Coast Ballet. 
Jones served as artistic director of the South Coast troupe from 1982 to 1985; 
it disbanded a few years later. 
</P>
<P>
 But last year, he was asked to choreograph a waltz in the "Nutcracker" for 
Ballet Pacifica. Founder Lila Zali had been one of his early ballet teachers, 
and he happily accepted the request, later resurrecting his 1984 ballet 
"Liebeslieder Waltzes" for the troupe's concert this past March. 
</P>
<P>
 Still hungry for involvement, he volunteered to revive "Concerto in D," which 
he created in 1982 for his UCI students, who gave the work its premiere. He's 
added two new movements to the 18-minute piece, including a central pas de deux 
. 
</P>
<P>
 "It begins with female dominance over the male," he said, "then goes into male 
dominance over the female, then the couple comes to a compromise; they work out 
an equal balance, a give-and-take." 
</P>
<P>
 Balletomanes on their toes will know that Jones' ballet is danced to the same 
Stravinsky work George Balanchine selected for his vaunted 1972 "Violin 
Concerto." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Balanchine greatly influenced Jones, who worked with the master in the 
late '70s as a member of the Zurich Ballet, Jones said, "the only company, 
outside of (Balanchine's) New York City Ballet, that premiered his works." 
</P>
<P>
 But why risk comparisons to one of ballet's titans? Simply, Jones said, 
because he much admired the concerto and felt compelled to use it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not pretending to be Mr. B," he said, using the common nickname. "I'm 
just saying what I want to say to the music. Some of it has his style to it, 
but it's still me." 
</P>
<P>
 * What: James Jones' "Concerto in D" will be danced in Ballet Pacifica's 
season-end concert, also featuring "Our Town" by Philip Jerry, "Counterpoint" 
by Molly Lynch and "Duetto" by Israel (El) Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
 * When: Friday, May 13, at 8 p.m.; Saturday, May 14, at 2:30 and 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where: Irvine Barclay Theatre, 4242 Campus Drive, Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 * Whereabouts: Take the San Diego (405) Freeway to the Jamboree Road exit and 
head south. Turn left onto Campus Drive. The theater is on Campus near Bridge 
Road, across from the Marketplace mall. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wherewithal: $15 for adults; $12 for students and seniors, who may also 
purchase $6 rush tickets two hours before each performance. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where to call: (714) 854-4646.

WANNA DANCE?: KNOTT'S CLOUD 9: HIGH ON NOSTALGIA, FLOOR SPACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN, Zan Dubin is a member of The Times Orange County Edition staff. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 OK, so it's not as hip as those underground clubs that migrate from week to 
week and draw the waifish and chic, but if you prefer grace over grunge, 
there's good reason to try Knott's Berry Farm's monthly swing and ballroom 
dance this Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 An expansive dance floor (4,800 square feet) that's less crowded than most 
recommends the event, held at the park's Cloud 9 Ballroom, an airy, spacious 
hall with a nostalgic feel. A glittery mirrored ball twirls slowly above as 
dancers sweep, swirl or Lindy hop below. Two large-screen TVs show priceless 
footage of such veteran hoofers as grand master Fred Astaire or the tapping 
Nicholas Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 Locally popular deejay Patricia Straight, spinning everything from Frank 
Sinatra to Shelby Lynne, plays swing (West and East Coast), ballroom (waltz, 
fox trot) and Latin (cha-cha, tango, rumba) dance music. Straight also gives 
hustle and disco two-step fans their turn and throws in a few country hits for 
Texas-style two-steppers. 
</P>
<P>
 A friendly clientele (partners aren't necessary), plus rules against smoking 
and alcohol are other assets of Cloud 9, which attracts kids to seniors; the 
average age hovers around 35. Attire ranges from comfy slacks and cowboy boots 
for both sexes to floor-length dresses for the women, although nothing's too 
elegant. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't expect anything too posh in decor. This is, after all, a cow town 
theme park, not the Copacabana. The linoleum dance floor's black-and-white 
check pattern livens things up, and theatrical lighting creates a romantic 
mood, but beyond that, unremarkable describes the surroundings, and the walls 
could use a fresh coat of paint. 
</P>
<P>
 More bothersome is the cost of refreshments ($2 for bottled water) and the $12 
admission price. Ticket holders may roam around Knott's for an hour before the 
7 p.m.-to-11 dance begins, and, during the summer, until midnight. But most go 
to this dance to dance, period. Free parking included in admission is some 
consolation. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the down side -- particularly for those loathe to sit out a single 
song -- is the evening's entertainment. At 8, 9 and 10 p.m., the floor is 
cleared as dance teams or couples perform routines from 10 to 20 minutes long. 
Some of the area's top competitors and teachers show up, but so do some 
embarrassingly bad acts. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, despite these deficits and the hike from the vast parking lot, 
Straight's Cloud 9 affair is a good time. It offers one of the too few weekend 
opportunities to don taffeta and patent leather and whirl around the room in an 
atmosphere evocative of a far more innocent age. 
</P>
<P>
 Assorted tips: There's no coat check at Cloud 9, but belongings can be 
deposited on a number of tables and chairs. Packing a pair of flat shoes for 
the trek from the parking lot is advisable. 
</P>
<P>
 To find the light green Cloud 9 building, head toward its neighbor, the park's 
sky-high parachute ride. Topped by a large "K," for Knott's, this sky jump is 
easily spotted from afar.

KID STUFF: THE STUNT MAN; IN 'COUCH POTATO SCIENCE,' CIRCUS-STYLE ANTICS ARE 
PART OF RICK LEWIS' LESSONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CORINNE FLOCKEN, Corinne Flocken is a free-lance writer who regularly covers 
Kid Stuff for the Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rick Lewis can balance full glasses of water on his chin, do back-flips off 
furniture and juggle plungers or toasters without breaking a sweat. 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, you think, what a precocious child. Kids, take Ricky and go play out back. 
Way out back. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so fast. Even though his stunts may sound like those of a rascally 
8-year-old, Lewis is no kid. At 32, the Vancouver resident has spent more than 
20 years performing acrobatics, juggling, mime and other circus-style skills 
for audiences across the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Lewis has a new act, one that many would consider more challenging than 
any in his repertoire. He's a teacher, sort of. 
</P>
<P>
 In his 40-minute workshop, "Couch Potato Science," Lewis uses acrobatics, 
juggling and physical comedy to make potentially complicated lessons in 
physical science and nutrition accessible and entertaining to kids. On Saturday 
and Sunday, the Launch Pad science center in Costa Mesa's Crystal Court will 
host Lewis for three performances daily. 
</P>
<P>
 A professional entertainer since age 8 (he made a nickel profit with his first 
neighborhood show), Lewis spent two years studying drama at Webster 
Conservatory for Theatre Arts in St. Louis before dropping out to work as a 
clown. He landed a job in a road company of the circus-themed Broadway musical 
"Barnum," in which he expanded and refined his skills as an understudy for the 
show's male roles. He has appeared on TV in "Sesame Street" and "America's 
Funniest People," and later this year, moviegoers can catch him barrel-rolling 
down a football field on a bass drum, doubling for actor Jim Varney in "Ernest 
Goes to School." 
</P>
<P>
 Very impressive, you say, but not quite the resume of a science teacher. Not 
to worry, says Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 The Connecticut-born entertainer, the son of a scientist, enlisted the help of 
physics professors at the University of British Columbia to form the basic 
curriculum of his workshops. And his mom, a nutrition specialist, helped him 
put together bits like "Saran Rap," in which he juggles various food items 
while rapping a tribute to healthy eating ("When you've got the munchies and 
you've got to get your fill / Snack on fruits and vegetables and you won't need 
that vitamin pill.") 
</P>
<P>
 Isaac Newton's three laws of motion also come into play in "Couch Potato 
Science," and Lewis demonstrates each of them individually and in combination. 
For example, to illustrate how every object has a center of mass, he teeters on 
top of a "rolly-bola," a board balanced on a rolling cylinder placed on top of 
a coffee table. Still mounted on the rolly-bola, he takes the lesson a step 
further, exploring the different levels of energy required to lift objects of 
varying weights by juggling a barbecue fork, plunger and an ax. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kind of disguise the educational value with an entertaining package that 
keeps people interested," Lewis explained in a phone interview from his home. 
"Kids may not remember the exact principles (presented in the show), but the 
visual experience will help even little ones learn something about the laws of 
nature that operate in our world." 
</P>
<P>
 Audience volunteers are an important part of his shows. A small "Couch Potato" 
viewer may find him or herself strapped to a board and balanced on a vertical 
support or attempting to move a bowling ball off a table using only their 
breath. Adults may help demonstrate rotational inertia by balancing a 
broomstick and pencil on the palm of their hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "Couch Potato Science" is actually a combination of two other workshops, 
"Furnysics" (subtitle: "The Physics of Furniture") and "The Grapest Show on 
Earth." Another workshop, "The Wonderful Circus of Science," showcases an even 
flashier array of stunts, including riding a 12-foot unicycle. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis began developing his science shows after seeing, and being dissatisfied 
with, other educational entertainment programs offered for families. 
</P>
<P>
 "In most of the other shows I heard of, the education level was maybe an 
eight, but the entertainment level was only a two or three," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way I've worked it, the educational content is such that an adult could 
walk away having learned a fair bit. Kids don't walk up after the shows and 
say, 'Wow, you're a great educator,' but they do have a great time." 
</P>

SURFING: BUD TOUR LURES THE BEST TO HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK FIGNETTI and DAVID REYES, Rockin' Fig is Rick Fignetti, a Huntington 
Beach surfer/shop owner. Times staff writer David Reyes has reported on U.S. 
surf teams competing in Bali and Brazil. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Bud Tour has pulled into Huntington Beach with a top field of surf 
competitors, including reigning world champion Derek Ho of Hawaii, former world 
champ Kelly Slater and the Fab Four. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockin' Fig -- who announces Bud Tour events, including this one -- was beyond 
stoked. 
</P>
<P>
 Can you dig it? World-class talent coming here to Huntington Beach!  
</P>
<P>
 Fig said this contest, provided there's a good swell, is the perfect 
opportunity for Orange County aficionados to see some high-caliber surfing. It 
rained last year so let's hope nature helps out with some sun and nice, tasty 
waves. 
</P>
<P>
 The contest began Wednesday and runs through Sunday on the northern side of 
the Santa Ana River jetties. Spectators should enter Huntington State Beach at 
Brookhurst Street. 
</P>
<P>
 I hear we've got the Fab Four -- Chris Brown (Santa Barbara) who's currently 
leading the tour's ratings, current Bud Tour champ Rob Machado, (Cardiff), 
Shane Beschen (San Clemente) and Taylor Knox (Carlsbad). And, there's Slater 
and Ho.  
</P>
<P>
 The Fig was munching pizza when we talked, and I couldn't calm him down. 
Lately, he's been bummed because there's been no surf. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only that, but it's been freezing -- what a bad combo. If it hasn't been 
gloomy and ugly in the mornings, it's been freezing cold in the water, and 
lousy two-foot slop. It's bunk.  
</P>
<P>
 Fig, who had a chance to talk with Slater after he won the Bud Tour's Santa 
Cruz contest in February, said Slater is very serious about grabbing a triple 
-- in surf parlance, that means getting a No. 1 ranking in all three major surf 
categories, the world tour, Bud Tour and the world-qualifying series. 
</P>
<P>
 I told ya. He wants to win all three. The guy's back! He's serious!  
</P>
<P>
 Yo, Fig, that pizza must've had a topping of adrenaline-soaked mushrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Slater fans remember he took the 1992 world title only to fall off the mantel 
in 1993 because of injuries and a busy shooting schedule on the television 
series "Baywatch." But the handsome, 22-year-old Floridian has quit the show 
and is back in the hunt. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Going for a Walk: Ballots have gone out for candidates to the Huntington Beach 
Surfing Walk of Fame. Similar to Hollywood's star-studded sidewalk, it is the 
world's first walkway to recognize surfing's pioneers and champions who helped 
shape the sport. The walk of fame will be launched May 28 with installment of 
the walkway's logo on a 2-foot by 2-foot granite stone during an 11 a.m. 
ceremony at Main Street and PCH in front of Jack's Surfboards. So far, only the 
legendary Duke Kahanamoku is a lock to be honored in the first batch of six to 
be selected from the nominees, to be determined by surfing insiders. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Award: Chris Strother, a senior at Carlsbad High School and one of 
California's top-ranked amateur surfers, was named the Old Spice Athlete of the 
Month for May by Sports Illustrated. Strother, 18, is the National Scholastic 
Surfing Assn.'s Open men's division champion. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Ball: Invitations to the Surf Industry Manufacturers' Assn.'s (SIMA) fifth 
annual Waterman's Ball on June 4 were mailed last week. SIMA has raised its 
fund-raising goal from last year's $75,000 to $100,000, which is donated to 
three Southern California environmental groups, said SIMA spokesman Mike 
Kingsbury. Tickets are $100 per person. Fig and I went last year, and it's fun. 
There's a band, an auction of surfing dream gifts such as trips to Tavarua, 
surfboards, sessions with the pros and plenty to eat. Donations help the 
American Oceans Campaign, Orange County Marine Institute and Surfrider 
Foundation. For information, call SIMA at (714) 760-0784.

 Video: San Juan Capistrano councilman and surfer Jeff Vasquez is teaming with 
Laguna Beach filmmaker Greg MacGillivray to redistribute MacGillivray's "Five 
Summer Stories" on video. MacGillivray's summer stories, a 1972 documentary, 
became a classic of the genre. Who did the soundtrack? It was the Laguna 
Beach-based band Honk, which still gets together for an occasional reunion 
show. The video is expected this fall. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Contest: Kelly Slater won last weekend's individual surfing championship in 3- 
to 4-foot waves, at the 16th Katin Team Challenge in one of the toughest groups 
of finals' competitors assembled this year on the West Coast. Slater was also a 
member of Team Focus, part of a dream team that won the tag-team title at the 
same contest. Slater's teammates were Rob Machado of Cardiff, Shane Dorian and 
Conan Hayes, both of Hawaii. Behind Slater in the individual finishers were 
Shane Beschen of San Clemente, Machado, and Taylor Knox, of Carlsbad.

DO IT!: BIKE ENTHUSIASTS TO HIT THE TRAILS AT O'NEILL PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Last year, the Orange County Trails Coalition decided to hold a Trails 
Awareness Fun Ride for mountain bikers in Caspers Regional Park, only to fall 
victim to a rare June rainstorm. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, organizers said, they had a healthy turnout, generating enough 
donations to buy the county some water-shunting bars (later installed by 
volunteers) to help control trail erosion and also five mountain bikes for 
rangers to use on patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition is back with plans for a second event, this one on Saturday at 
O'Neill Regional Park. The day will include group trail rides for all ability 
levels, a children's obstacle course that will also teach trail-riding basics 
(BMX bikes OK), live entertainment and a raffle for $5,000 in prizes, including 
bicycles. In addition, participants are invited to camp at the park Friday 
night at no additional charge. 
</P>
<P>
 But the function has a purpose beyond simply providing a good time. Organizers 
hope to recruit some new trail volunteers through the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many ways volunteers can get involved in an easy fashion," said 
Patrick Henry of the trails coalition. "They don't have to spend all their free 
days sweating in the sun." 
</P>
<P>
 Although much of the focus Saturday is on bikes, equestrians and hikers are 
welcome as well and will have walks and rides scheduled through the day. 
</P>
<P>
 As an added bonus, two new trails will be previewed. 
</P>
<P>
 One is a multiuse path about three miles long, mostly dirt, connecting O'Neill 
to the El Toro Bike Path paralleling El Toro Road. It's the first step in a 
long-range plan to connect many of the county's parks by off-road paths, and it 
will remain open after Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The other new path is the long-awaited Arroyo Trabuco trail, about seven miles 
of dirt path along a sycamore-lined canyon. The trail will open permanently in 
a few months after Caltrans completes bridge construction nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Trails Coalition is organizing the event with the county 
Department of Harbors, Beaches and Parks, with bicycle component maker Shimano 
the main corporate sponsor. Mechanics from Shimano and from Giant bicycles will 
be on hand to provide free bike checks. In addition, numerous companies and 
organizations with an interest in trail issues will take part. 
</P>
<P>
 Public agencies, under increasing financial pressure, are having more and more 
difficulty maintaining park facilities, and there has even been talk of closing 
some parks. Orange County Trails Coalition is among many county groups that 
organize volunteer labor to maintain and repair trails. Some groups, such as 
SHARE at Crystal Cove State Park, even help patrol trails and thus reduce the 
friction between mountain bikers and other trail users. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, the bike routes will be open from 8:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. From noon 
to 5 p.m., trail-support groups and others will be on hand to offer information 
on their activities and sell food for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 * What: Trails Awareness Fun Ride. 
</P>
<P>
 * When: Saturday, May 14, 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where: O'Neill Regional Park. 
</P>
<P>
 * Whereabouts: From the San Diego (405) Freeway, exit at El Toro Road and go 
west into the foothills. Turn right on Live Oak Canyon Road at Cooks Corner, 
and follow the road several miles to the park entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wherewithal: $25 ($10 for children 12 and under). 
</P>
<P>
 * Where to call: (714) 890-3925.

KIDS ON FILM: DANA CARVEY'S 'CLEAN SLATE' CHALKS UP MOST LAUGHS TO THE DOG; IN 
"CLEAN SLATE," COMEDIAN DANA CARVEY PLAYS A GUMSHOE FROM VENICE WHO, ABOUT TO 
TESTIFY AGAINST A GANGLAND KILLER, MUST SOLVE THE MYSTERY OF HIS GIRLFRIEND'S 
MURDER AND ESCAPE HIS ENEMIES, AS HE SUFFERS FROM A RARE AMNESIA THAT MAKES HIM 
LOSE HIS MEMORY WHENEVER HE FALLS ASLEEP. (RATED PG-13)  
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite the talents of Dana Carvey, what made most kids laugh the hardest in 
this comedy was his sidekick -- a dog with a depth-perception problem. 
</P>
<P>
 While his master can't remember his life from day to day, Baby can't make it 
through his doggy door. He can smell his food but can't find the dish. Loyal 
and brave, he snarls and leaps at his master's enemies but misses and lands in 
the closet. 
</P>
<P>
 For younger kids, the dog made the movie. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was real good," said Sasha Chiampi, 8. All she remembered from 
the film afterward was "this dog who can't find where his dog door is, so he 
ran into the door." 
</P>
<P>
 Here are the results from a small, unscientific survey, asking kids, "Who was 
funnier, Carvey or the dog? " 
</P>
<P>
 Sasha: "The dog." 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Schrank, 12: "The dog." 
</P>
<P>
 Bianca Rivas, 6: "The dog." 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie Rivas, 12: "The dog. . . . Well, both." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was OK," said Leslie who found that "some parts were boring; some parts 
were good." 
</P>
<P>
 The slowest part, she said, was "the whole beginning" when Carvey as private 
investigator M.L. Pogue has to bring himself up to date each morning by playing 
a tape recording explaining his amnesia and what happened to him the day 
before. "I got it after three minutes," Leslie said. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie's whole family came because they all like Carvey from his sketches on 
TV's "Saturday Night Live." But Leslie said she thought he was funnier in a 
previous role, as Wayne's sidekick, Garth, in the movie "Wayne's World" and its 
sequel, "Wayne's World 2." 
</P>
<P>
 "Clean Slate," Jon said, "wasn't as funny as other movies I've seen, like 'Ace 
Ventura.' " Jon said he preferred Jim Carrey, another sketch comedian who just 
made his feature film debut in that movie. "He's funnier and has a split 
personality," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If Carvey's humor is more subdued than it was in "Wayne's World," he plays a 
similarly sweet nerd who is pursued by gorgeous women. He still conveys with 
only his jerky eye movements the confusion of a brain that's trying hard but 
just doesn't get it. 
</P>
<P>
 Personally, I laughed as much at Carvey as at the dog, altogether about six 
times, a moderate score on my own laugh-o-meter. Especially funny were Carvey's 
attempts to cover up his memory loss at a surprise birthday party, and a scene 
where, in the midst of being chased by his enemies, he lands on a darkened 
stage and is mistaken for a lecturer in anthropology. 
</P>
<P>
 There is isolated profanity, and the sex scenes are mostly silly. Carvey's 
kisses with Valeria Golino (of "Hot Shots") are probably the most chaste in 
recent movie history. 
</P>
<P>
 In one running gag, a colleague asks Pogue to find out who is sleeping with 
his fiancee. Pogue becomes increasingly nervous as all signs -- including 
handcuffs on the bedpost -- begin pointing to him as the prime suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, there's more adult humor than kid humor in this plot. Kids who liked 
"Groundhog Day," a story about a reporter who must repeat the same day until he 
gets it right, will probably be able to sit through this one. But for little 
ones especially, there's not much except the dog.

PARKER'S PLACE: FAMILIAR FACES; FOREIGNERS TRAVELING ON COSTA RICAN ROADS BUMP 
INTO KNOWING SMILES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After a day of driving through a nation notorious for its bad roads, your 
muscles ache, your joints revolt and your nerves feel like they've been stroked 
by a wire brush. If you are the driver, you clutch the wheel at 10 and two, 
gritting your way up the next rock-studded grade. If you're a passenger, you 
slip into that dreamy state where you imagine a dinner, drinks and clean 
sheets, but every minute or so your chin bounces off your chest and your eyes 
open again to the dire exigencies of the road. 
</P>
<P>
 And so it was while our two-car caravan strained toward the Arenal Observatory 
Lodge somewhere in the mountains of Costa Rica. Until, that is, our rear party 
of four -- packed into a Hyundai four-door -- stalled in the middle of a 
washed-out section of the dirt road, water cascading over the tires, headlights 
illuminating their stasis, starter grinding away with vanishing energy and no 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Always willing to imagine the worst, I stood on the far shore and watched, 
wondering what would happen if the starter just died and the Hyundai wouldn't 
move. We had a chain in the vehicle that had already made it across the water 
-- a four-door truck with a small open bed in the back and a power train 
apparently comprised of two small squirrels. The idea that this truck and a 
chain could actually pull out the sedan was bad comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 I tallied up the provisions, should we be stuck there for the night. We had 
four half-empty bottles of water, a plastic bag of blackening bananas, and I 
owned a three-pack of breath mints courtesy of Continental Airlines. Pretty 
thin cuisine, considering our last meal was at least 100 miles and 1,000 hours 
ago. Could we eat the upholstery and still get back our damage deposit, I 
wondered? 
</P>
<P>
 As duly noted by songwriters and poets, the darkest hour is just before the 
dawn. Which is to say that just as the Hyundai appeared to shiver its last, the 
plucky little engine caught and roared (the verb is excessive) to life, sending 
a plume of victorious white smoke into the dank Costa Rican night. 
</P>
<P>
 We on shore cheered. Those in the Hyundai waited until the sedan had crossed 
the water and dragged itself onto dry land before doing likewise. We were on 
our way again! 
</P>
<P>
 A few minutes later a heavenly sign appeared on the road ahead of us. A truck 
came down toward us from the dark infinity of jungle above, trundling past with 
a friendly nod from the driver. And not just any truck, but an Imperial Brewery 
truck, having just deposited -- we could only assume -- a cargo of cold 
cervezas to the Arenal Observatory Lodge. We were clearly the chosen people. 
</P>
<P>
 A few arduous kilometers later, we rolled into the parking area of the lodge. 
We got out, stared toward the dark mass of Arenal Volcano in the distance, 
stretched our tired bodies. We could smell the food in the restaurant. I was 
already imagining the next day's hike, which would lead us partway up the 
grumbling cone of Arenal.  
</P>
<P>
 We felt the pressure of the day begin to release, the anticipation of the 
night calling. Then we went to claim our reserved rooms at the open-air front 
"desk" and discovered that we were at the wrong lodge. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want the Arenal Lodge," the clerk explained. "This is the Arenal 
Observatory Lodge." 
</P>
<P>
 He gave us the same conciliatory smile that the car lease agent had used on 
us, and I wondered if this was the national expression. But he gave us 
directions, pointing out through the darkness to the way we had come. Yes, we 
would have to cross the washed-out road again, yes we would have to backtrack 
across the brain-scrambling rocks and ruts. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's kidding," someone mumbled. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, he's not. Forward, ho!" 
</P>
<P>
 The sedan didn't stall in the water this time because Tom went through it at 
about 50 k.p.h. Our little squirrel-powered truck scrambled to keep up. We 
bounced back through the darkness at an accelerated pace, each driver seeking 
that mythical speed where tires are said to "just hit the tops of the rocks," 
resulting in a smoother, faster ride. We achieved the faster part, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 As luck would have it, the road to the right lodge was even worse than the one 
to the wrong lodge. Stretches of it were so vertical that snippets of concrete 
had been thrown in -- either so the tires could find purchase in the mud, or 
perhaps as a simple affirmation that this was truly a road -- and for this 
concrete we were grateful. We ascended from darkness into blackness. We passed 
a four-wheel drive Land Cruiser stuck in a roadside ditch. Finally, just this 
side of eternity, a sign welcomed us: WELCOME TO THE ARENAL LODGE -- YOU MADE 
IT! 
</P>
<P>
 We spent two days there, hiking the volcano and climbing down to a waterfall, 
both rather boring activities compared to Third World motoring. During this 
peaceful hiatus, we geared up for our next outing on the Costa Rican roads. 
</P>
<P>
 Early on our day of departure we ate a grandiose breakfast and headed out. Our 
goal was the Monteverde Cloud Forest, a national park high in the mountains 
that was, as the crow flies, not that far away. But crows don't take the road. 
We did, though it made the road to the Arenal Lodge look like the Autobahn. 
</P>
<P>
 We careened around corners featuring sheer drops of 500 feet; we slid around 
lumber trucks and herds of Brahma cattle; we zoomed through the terraced fields 
of coffee from which the workers paused to give us -- you guessed it -- that 
minor smile so pregnant with wonder and condolence. Upon entering the village 
of Monteverde we noted that in the billboards left standing from the last 
election, the winning presidential candidate smiled down on us with this exact 
look on his face. Everybody knew us! 
</P>
<P>
 We arrived at the cloud forest after driving some 8 1/2 hours. Out of 
curiosity, perhaps masochism, I hauled out the map to see how far we'd gone and 
was somewhat disheartened to learn it was less than 90 miles. Our cloud forest 
guide pointed out the Arenal Volcano in the distance and told us that using a 
perfectly good footpath running between the volcano and the forest, she had 
easily made the walk in a little more than nine hours. All eight of us gave her 
the look that we were getting pretty good at -- the undertaker's smile, the 
knowing little smirk, the billboard grin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know," she said. "The roads here aren't great." 
</P>
<P>
 A week later, back in the capital of San Jose, we stopped to run our rental 
cars through the wash. Deltas of mud ran forth. We then wiped the seepage from 
the Hyundai oil pan, which looked like a fresh Jiffy Pop dome might look if you 
dropped baseballs on it. 
</P>
<P>
 While we waited for the rental company representative to come pick up the 
vehicles, a couple of us loitered outside the hotel, practicing "the 
expression" in the windows. We were fluent in it by now, almost as good as the 
locals. So by the time he got there we all gave it to him, laying it on pretty 
thick. He studied our knowing, tragic, bemused smiles. He gave us back one of 
his own. He didn't look at the oil pan, generously overlooked the new dents and 
signed us off. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see you enjoyed driving in Costa Rica," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It couldn't have been better!"

3-HOUR TOUR: CALIFORNIA CULTURE TO THE MAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN EPSTEIN, Benjamin Epstein is a free-lance writer who regularly 
contributes to The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When people elsewhere in the country think of Southern California, they 
probably imagine something like Main Street, Huntington Beach, where culture 
runs from surf history to Native American art, where counterculture can mean 
body piercing or micro-brewed ales on tap. 
</P>
<P>
 3 to 4: No place captures the spirit of Surf City U.S.A. like the 
International Surfing Museum, the only museum, its ads say, "where it's OK to 
call the curator 'dude.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The current show, "Boards of Distinction," includes half a dozen post-World 
War II Bob Simmons boards; a collapsible three-piece surfboard-in-a-suitcase 
from 1965; the "funeral board," a black coffin-like board found awash at 
Hermosa Beach in 1951, its owner never found; and a board deemed distinctive 
"because it's never been rode." 
</P>
<P>
 Artifacts aren't limited to surfboards. There's a bust of Duke Kahanamoku, the 
father of modern surfing, and the first electric guitar owned by Dick Dale, 
"King of the Surf Guitar." In glass cases are a surfer hood ornament from 
Kahanamoku's Lincoln convertible, Jams swim shorts and the Huntington Beach 
Pier's 1914 cornerstone. 
</P>
<P>
 There's also a tribute to Hawaiian George Freeth, who introduced the sport to 
the Mainland in 1907. Freeth was awarded the Medal of Valor for "a daring 
single-handed storm surf rescue of . . . the entire crew of a sinking Japanese 
fishing vessel." The museum sells surf books, surf POGs and posters. 
</P>
<P>
 4 to 4:30: Native Waves offers art of the Native American nations. On the 
walls are paintings representing the different nations and, more intriguing, 
dream catchers. "The spider webbing holds the bad dreams and only allows the 
good ones to go through," said owner Lowell Tvlako, a Creek-Seminole. "Attached 
to the dream catchers might be horsehair for endurance, animal claws for 
protection, human hair to keep enemies away." 
</P>
<P>
 Sticks are big at Native Waves, and Tvlako commented on each. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stickball sets: "In the old days there could be 500 people playing this 
game, all after this one little ball. Several people would get killed. It was a 
dangerous game. It's still a dangerous game." 
</P>
<P>
 * Ghost dance sticks, one with a coyote skull: "These keep away the ghosts of 
your enemies. The spirit of the coyote protects us all. Hold it, walk with it, 
dance with it." 
</P>
<P>
 * Talking sticks: "Democratic society did not start with Thomas Jefferson and 
Benjamin Franklin. They based their ideas on Native Americans. In council 
houses, whoever held the stick talked. The skull is raccoon." 
</P>
<P>
 Implements of war include breastplates, chokers and clubs made from buffalo 
jaws. 
</P>
<P>
 "Janet Jackson wears these now," Tvlako said of the chokers. "Before, a suit 
of armor kept a guy from getting his throat slit; it stopped spears and arrows. 
When the white man came with bullets, of course, it didn't help that much." 
</P>
<P>
 4:30 to 5: Check out the severely trendy clothes at Sunline Electric Chair. 
Skulls and crossbones are apparently in these days, even on tennis shoes, and 
the fashion rule of thumb seems to be the more the merrier. 
</P>
<P>
 One belt sported seven large skulls, the buckle two dozen itty-bitty skulls. 
More to the point, another buckle spelled out "stoopid." In all fairness, 
perhaps, the store also carries Mary and Jesus buckles. "It sort of balances 
out," saleswoman Shirley Memon noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the figurines is a man in an electric chair. Swimwear is extremely 
provocative, but a sign shows that the store is nothing if not discreet: "For 
Special Orders on Bondage-Wear, Please Inquire at Front Counter." 
</P>
<P>
 Only "mainstream" body piercings are contracted through the shop, according to 
Steve Hoelscher: "You know, navels, noses, nipples," he said, with Stony the 
iguana perched on his shoulder and jewelry coming out of his nostrils and 
through his tongue. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly all the salespeople have tattoos or body piercing or both; Memon seemed 
the exception. "I used to have a tongue piercing," she said, "but I took it 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 5 to 6: At this point, you might want to settle into any of a half-dozen 
micro-brewed ales at the Huntington Beach Beer Co. In fact, you might want to 
try them all: It's only $1 per five-ounce taste (or $3 per pint). 
</P>
<P>
 They include delicately hopped Huntington Beach Blonde; more hoppy Pier Pale 
Ale; Main St. Wheat, nice with a lemon slice; malty Brickshot Red; Black Gold 
Porter, even more malty, like chocolate or coffee; and specialty beers such as 
Crowley's Cream Ale and seasonal berry beers. 
</P>
<P>
 A variety of burgers, pastas and brick oven pizzas ($5 to $10) are available. 
Armadillo eggs, fried jalapenos with Cheddar cheese, are worth a try, and the 
wood-fired garlic bread is downright addictive. When deciding which ales to 
order with food, brewmeister Alex Puchner recommends guidelines similar to 
those for wine: "Light with fish and chicken, red with beef, porter with 
dessert."

 BABY BOOMLET: Ventura County's population grew only slightly last year (B1), 
with the biggest gain of new residents in Oxnard. . . . The city added the 
largest number of new dwellings and led the county in births, with 3,857 babies 
born last year. Oxnard now accounts for 21% of the county's population, and 
nearly one-third of its births, preliminary figures show. Doy Williams, the 
county's supervising deputy registrar, keeps track of such numbers: "It appears 
that Oxnard does have a lot of births." 
</P>
<P>
 STAR POWER: Auditor-Controller Thomas O. Mahon is the first political 
candidate this year to plug into the high-wattage power of Ojai's movie stars. 
. . . Mahon hopes that the guest appearance of Malcolm McDowell will attract 
donors to his $100-a-head garden party Sunday afternoon in Ojai. Mahon said he 
doesn't know the star of "A Clockwork Orange" and other movies. His appearance 
was arranged by a supporter, county Risk Manager Robi G. Klein. "Malcolm is a 
friend of mine," Klein said. "His son and daughter go to the same school that 
my son goes to."

 COLD SHOULDER: The state Department of Transportation admits that it goofed. 
First, it installed a metal-beam guardrail along the Ventura Freeway near the 
Rincon to prevent wayward cars from plunging into the surf. But the railing 
pushed the bike path closer to traffic. And one cyclist subsequently died in a 
collision with a car (Ventura County Life, Page 8). . . . So Caltrans replaced 
the rail with a concrete barrier and spray-painted 'No Parking' upside down. 
Now surfers can no longer see the waves and motorists are confused. As one 
cyclist put it: "If anything, it's more dangerous than it's ever been." 
</P>
<P>
 ON THE BENCH: Mike Scyphers remains suspended as Simi Valley High baseball 
coach despite a legal effort by parents of his ballplayers (C10). . . . A judge 
rejected their request to reinstate the coach, suggesting that Scyphers come to 
court instead. Meanwhile, detectives continue to probe alleged improprieties. 
Said Sgt. Mike King: "We don't have a date of completion yet."

MAN GETS $1.8 MILLION IN DOG CASE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A jury has awarded $1.8 million to a man who was injured when a small dog 
darted in front of his bicycle. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Smith, who thought the dog was attacking him, lost control of the bicycle 
and crashed, his lawyer said.Doctors testified that Smith, now 60, needed a 
total knee and joint replacement. 
</P>
<P>
 The dog was not harmed in the 1990 accident and has since died. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury agreed with Smith that the dog's owners, Pat and Charles Steele, 
violated Cameron County and homeowners' association leash laws in Port Isabel, 
a resort area across the bay from South Padre Island. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors on Monday awarded Smith $1 million for pain and mental anguish, 
$660,000 for loss of physical ability, $73,000 for medical bills and $50,000 in 
punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's wife, Ann, was awarded $50,000 for loss of household help, 
companionship and sexual affection, according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Steele would not comment, referring questions to her lawyer, Bob Spann. He 
was not in his office Wednesday.

FARMERS GET DISCOUNT ON STATE WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY F. POLS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Agricultural users of the Calleguas Municipal Water District are getting a 
nearly 30% discount on the cost of state-supplied water, restoring prices for 
farmers to nearly pre-drought levels. 
</P>
<P>
 The Metropolitan Water District, which supplies Calleguas with water, decided 
to cut rates after continued complaints from its agricultural users that prices 
were too high. MWD ordered Calleguas and its other member agencies to pass on 
the discount of $137 per acre-foot to farming customers. One acre-foot is 
enough water to serve the needs of two urban families for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We recognize that it is important to take care of those people who have made 
significant investments in Southern California," MWD spokesman Jay Malinowski 
said. "The impact on our total budget is not significant, since only 8 or 9% of 
our users are in the agricultural community." 
</P>
<P>
 Malinowski said the MWD is not worried about meeting water demands this year. 
But with reservoirs at about 60% of the desired level for this time of year, he 
said 1995 could be a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the 1950s, farmers had received state water at discounted prices. But in 
1992, the drought forced state water officials to end the discounts. Also, 
supplies to agricultural users were cut as much as 50% at the height of the 
drought. 
</P>
<P>
 Calleguas agricultural customers have been paying $471 per acre-foot for 
treated water. Under the reduction, they will pay $334. About 10% of Calleguas' 
total sales are to growers. Don Reeder of Pro-Ag, a farm management company, 
said the discount was a welcome relief to the citrus and avocado growers in the 
east county who are Calleguas' biggest agricultural customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It definitely makes us happy because we come out with cheaper water," Reeder 
said. "But it comes at a price, because when there is a drought, we will have 
our supplies cut immediately by 30%." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the rate reduction, farmers can expect to have their deliveries cut 
by 30% in a drought before any mandatory conservation methods are imposed on 
residences or businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 That part of the agreement doesn't surprise Rex Laird, executive director of 
the Ventura County Farm Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not real thrilled about it, but we're used to it," Laird said. 
</P>
<P>
 Farm customers in Ventura County already pay a relatively higher price for 
water than some other Southern California customers because all Calleguas water 
is treated to adhere to state water quality. 
</P>
<P>
 Reeder said avocado and citrus growers usually spend about two-thirds of their 
annual budget on water. Raising one acre of avocados at pre-reduction prices 
cost about $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The discounts "keep us in business," Reeder said. "But if we go back into 
drought, we might just have to stump the trees." 
</P>
<P>
 While some Calleguas agricultural customers blend pumped ground water with 
state water, most are completely reliant on the imported water. Ground water 
supplies in the eastern part of the county are scarce. 
</P>
<P>
 The discount will last only three years -- long enough, MWD officials hope, 
for farmers to start looking for new methods to water their crops. 
</P>
<P>
 "We needed some period of time for them to find other sources of water," said 
Patrick Miller, president of the Calleguas board and chairman of the MWD 
agriculture committee. 
</P>
<P>
 For the east county's growers, that new source will probably be reclaimed 
water, Miller said. Reclaimed water is treated sewage waste water. While it 
could not be used on a crop such as lettuce, it is acceptable for citrus and 
avocados.

AGREEMENT CONSIDERED TO LINK WATER SYSTEMS; PIPELINE: PLAN WOULD ALLOW OXNARD, 
VENTURA AND DISTRICTS TO SHARE IN DROUGHTS, EMERGENCIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Seeking a way to share water in droughts and other emergencies, three water 
agencies and the cities of Oxnard and Ventura are considering an historic 
agreement that could eventually link their water systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement among the cities, Casitas and Calleguas municipal water 
districts and the United Water Conservation District would lay a pipeline to 
connect existing water distribution systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials hope the Federal Emergency Management Agency would pick up most of 
the cost to link the systems with a pipeline across the Santa Clara River. 
Estimates to link the systems range from $1 million all the way up to $30 
million, depending on the extent of the program and the source of the estimate. 
The agencies have applied for a FEMA grant, but have yet to hear about the 
project's chances for funding, said John Johnson, Casitas general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 But even without federal funding, Johnson said the agencies might be able to 
share the cost among themselves and thus better prepare the county for 
emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Jan. 17 earthquake, water pipelines were ruptured in Simi Valley, 
leaving some residents without water for days. And during the drought, Santa 
Barbara County spent millions to import only a few hundred acre-feet of water. 
</P>
<P>
 "If somehow we can have a united, or at least a cooperative county, all of the 
citizens would be better off under emergencies," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Mayor Tom Buford said the proposed agreement among the agencies is the 
result of a long-standing desire for an emergency water plan. But, he said, the 
earthquake was the impetus to kick-start the plan and apply for federal 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ideally, we would have everybody hooked up to everybody else so that in times 
of need, we could share," Buford said. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Kendall, Calleguas general manager, described the proposal as merely a 
starting point to connect the Calleguas distribution system with the city of 
Ventura and the Casitas district. 
</P>
<P>
 Calleguas, a water wholesaler that covers two-thirds of the county, imports 
water from Northern California and elsewhere and distributes it to Moorpark, 
Simi Valley, Thousand Oaks, Camarillo and Oxnard. To link that system to 
Ventura and Casitas, crews would have to build a pipeline across the Santa 
Clara River. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, which is outlined in a memorandum, has "provisions that could 
bring all the parties to the table and give us a chance to discuss engineering 
possibilities," Kendall said. "This memorandum establishes that we are agreeing 
to try to agree. But it's really just the cornerstone." 
</P>
<P>
 Calleguas' five-member board of directors is expected to review the proposed 
agreement at its Wednesday meeting. Other agencies are expected to follow, 
although no schedules have been set. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal states that all five agencies acknowledge they want to formulate 
a plan to link the systems, but that they are not committing to any specific 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the cities and agencies agree on a plan, it would be the first time 
they have joined forces to build an emergency water system. 
</P>
<P>
 The leaders who worked on the proposal concede, however, that a pipeline 
across the Santa Clara River could establish a permanent line to bring imported 
water to Ventura, which now relies on Casitas Reservoir, Ventura River and 
ground water. 
</P>
<P>
 "Its purpose would be for emergency, but if we have the plumbing system set 
up, we might be able to use it for other purposes," Buford said. 
</P>
<P>
 Making the transition from emergency to permanent, however, could be too 
costly and cumbersome to consider, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in an emergency, Calleguas would need approval from its supplier, the 
Metropolitan Water District, to provide water to areas outside its boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Should Ventura want to join the Calleguas and MWD systems and become a 
permanent water customer, such annexation could cost "millions and millions," 
said MWD spokesman Jay Malinowski. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't even estimate how much," he said. "Annexation would take a very 
long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Malinowski said MWD is cautious about considering new customers, particularly 
ones as large as Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a real reluctance on the part of our board to annex even the 
smallest parcels right now, 10 to 15 acres being what we consider small," 
Malinowski said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura City Councilman Steve Bennett, who won his seat opposing a proposed 
pipeline to import state water from Castaic Lake, said he would object to such 
a move. 
</P>
<P>
 He pointed out that Ventura voters, in a 1992 ballot measure, rejected a plan 
to build the Castaic pipeline in favor of building a plant to desalinate sea 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the pipeline (to connect the systems for emergency use) is not going to 
cost much money because of FEMA, then that's great," he said. "But if it turns 
out to be a considerable sum of money, then the voters have said, 'Let's spend 
it on desal.' "

SANTA PAULA IS TICKETED FOR A THEATER; ENTERTAINMENT: THE SEVEN-SCREEN COMPLEX

 Sixteen-year-old Elisa Perez of Santa Paula never has anywhere to go on Friday 
nights. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Paula High School junior doesn't own a car and often can't get to 
teen-age nightspots in Oxnard or Ventura. She complains there is little to do 
for young people in her hometown. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, we're really stuck," Elisa said. "We don't even have a bowling 
alley." 
</P>
<P>
 But things might change by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles developers are planning to open a $3-million theater complex along 
West Main Street by Thanksgiving -- the beginning of the six-week holiday 
movie-going season that is second only to summer in gross receipts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be more fun having a movie theater in Santa Paula," Elisa said 
Wednesday, one day after the Planning Commission unanimously approved the 
sprawling multiplex. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won't be able to complain that there's nothing to do anymore," she said. 
"We can spend more time with our friends and it will be somewhere for 
teen-agers to hang out." 
</P>
<P>
 The 16,000-square-foot movie house is planned for the site of the old Santa 
Paula Bowl, which closed last year for lack of business and was demolished last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 The new center calls for seven movie screens in an L-shaped complex, with 
patio dining and retail shops planned nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're real excited about the whole project," said Brett Havlik, general 
manager of Wallace Theater Corp., the Honolulu-based company that will operate 
the multiplex. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great location because the town needs a theater," he said. "We have 
very high expectations." 
</P>
<P>
 If all goes as planned, the Santa Paula complex will be the second multiplex 
theater to open in Ventura County this year. Construction began last month on a 
12-screen theater complex in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, Santa Paula conducted a survey asking residents what types of 
services they most wanted for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a number of activities listed and (a theater) was at the top of 
the list," Planning Commissioner Shirley D. Hara said. "It's a great form of 
entertainment and it brings increased revenue into Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will also bring jobs, and any type of jobs we can bring into this 
community are needed," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Havlik said the movie house represents between 20 and 30 new jobs for Santa 
Paula residents. All but a handful would be part-time positions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The president of the Santa Paula Chamber of Commerce welcomed the theaters as 
another entertainment alternative for the city's young people. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have two teen-age daughters and there's not a lot for them to do, so this 
will really help," said Peggy Jensen, who owns Casa de Flores flower shop. 
</P>
<P>
 The multiplex theater also will help keep entertainment dollars local, Jensen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I take my family to the movies, we'll spend $50 or more," she said. 
"This will keep the money in Santa Paula." 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Pearlman, a partner in the Los Angeles firm planning the development, 
said the cinemas will be accompanied by an ice-cream parlor, a sandwich shop 
and other retail stores. 
</P>
<P>
 A Thrifty drugstore and a Vons supermarket already have opened in the nearby 
Santa Paula Shopping Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've expanded the entire center, and we have aggressively gone out and met 
with the theater operators," Pearlman said. "Now, when 'Superman 14' opens in 
Beverly Hills, it'll be shown in Santa Paula at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen-year-old Evy Hernandez, a Santa Paula High School graduate who works 
at McDonald's, said many of the young people in town get into trouble because 
there is so little to keep them occupied. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of graffiti-writing because the teen-agers need something more 
to do," she said. "So having a theater will be good. 
</P>
<P>
 "I usually just rent movies, but I'll probably go once or twice a week."

CITY MANAGER EXEMPT FROM CAP ON ACCRUED BENEFITS; VENTURA: JOHN BAKER IS 
ENTITLED TO NEARLY $50,000. OTHERS FORFEIT UNUSED VACATION TIME OVER A LIMIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Ventura City Manager John Baker, who will leave for the private sector in July 
with nearly $50,000 in unused vacation time and sick leave, is the only city 
employee permitted to cash in an unlimited amount of vacation hours, city 
personnel officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Most other Ventura city employees must forfeit unused vacation time after they 
reach a limit of 240 hours, and even police and fire officials cannot accrue 
more than about 550 hours, said Christine Schlag, a senior personnel analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker, who takes about 10 of his 20 allotted vacation days each year, has 
amassed 825 unused vacation hours since he came to work in Ventura nearly 13 
years ago. He has also collected 540 hours of unused sick leave, but according 
to city policy he can receive reimbursement for only 25% of that time. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprised to learn earlier this week of Baker's sizable stockpile, some City 
Council members said Wednesday that they intend to negotiate a more spartan 
contract with the city's next manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the very first thing I asked the mayor to do when John told us he was 
leaving, that we meet and discuss a new pay package," Councilman Jim Monahan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schlag said the provision allowing Baker to store up an unlimited amount of 
vacation time was approved by the council in 1990 -- the same time the city 
established a separate interest-bearing account into which Baker has deposited 
$295 per month. 
</P>
<P>
 That fund -- payable upon his departure from the city -- now holds about 
$14,000, which Baker has asked the city to apply toward his future health care 
premium payments.  
</P>
<P>
 Monahan sat on the council that approved the resolution but said he is "almost 
positive" that he opposed it. "I guess I was the only one that recognized we 
were entering a very tough time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Gary Tuttle said he also wants to offer the new city manager a less 
generous contract, at least initially. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we should start off where we left off" with Baker, he said. "It 
was part of his reward for doing a good job. My goal would be to negotiate down 
and start back up again." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the League of California Cities, a statewide city lobbying and 
informational organization, said it is not uncommon for city employees to have 
no cap on accrued vacation time.

 Personnel officers at the cities of Camarillo, Santa Monica and Santa Clarita 
said, however, that their city managers are bound by the same vacation caps 
that apply to everyone else at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees at the cities of Santa Monica and Santa Clarita cannot collect on 
any of their unused sick leave, while Camarillo employees cash in sick leave on 
a sliding scale, depending on how long they've been with the city, according to 
personnel officials at the three cities.

POPULATION GROWS AT SLUGGISH 1.3% RATE; STATISTICS: THE 1993 FIGURES SHOW 
SMALLEST GAINS SINCE RECORD-KEEPING STARTED. OXNARD AND PORT HUENEME LED THE 
COUNTY IN INCREASES.

<P>
 Despite recent signs of economic recovery, Ventura County's population grew at 
its slowest rate in decades in 1993 and was particularly stagnant in Simi 
Valley, Ojai and Santa Paula, according to new state figures. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's population grew to 708,168 by Jan. 1, up just 1.3% over the 
previous 12 months, a rate of increase half that of the 1980s' boom years. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the growth was in just two cities -- Oxnard and Port Hueneme, which 
accounted for nearly 44% of all new residents, the state Department of Finance 
has informed local officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's full 1993 report, including new population estimates for 
California and all of its cities, will not be officially released until next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County figures show the lowest overall growth rate since annual 
record-keeping began in 1960. In previous years, county growth has come because 
foreign immigration has outpaced residents moving away and because of thousands 
of more births than deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 The new figures, county Senior Planner Steve Wood said, reflect "a combination 
of lack of jobs and fewer people moving into the county. And there is the 
increased possibility that some of the people are moving out (for jobs)." 
</P>
<P>
 The figures also show huge differences in growth from city to city. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiny Ojai gained just 72 new residents last year, while the population of 
Oxnard, the county's largest city, surged by 2,432 new residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Paula had the lowest growth rate, just 0.6%, adding only 150 residents 
to a population of 26,706. Port Hueneme grew fastest, its population jumping 
6.9% to 21,868 after years of stability. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Richard Velthoen said he suspects that Port Hueneme grew because 
of a large housing project at the Naval Construction Battalion Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Seabee base added 200 to 300 family units," he said. "That accounts for 
most of it." 
</P>
<P>
 The state report, in fact, shows an increase of 250 housing units in Port 
Hueneme. Nearby Oxnard had the most new dwellings, 587, and the sharpest 
increase in household size -- an indicator of crowding. 
</P>
<P>
 The affluent eastern county, with its pricey houses, had fewer new dwellings 
-- just 115 in Moorpark, 177 in Simi Valley and 303 in Thousand Oaks, the state 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, the economy has stopped the development of new homes," Simi Valley 
Mayor Greg Stratton said. "It's just a reflection of the general downturn in 
the economy." 
</P>
<P>
 Even as local planners ponder a rare period of slow growth, however, 
indications are that growth in 1994 will increase. 
</P>
<P>
 The state reported 12,500 more jobs countywide in March than in same month in 
1993. New housing permits were also up 85%, to 411 for the first quarter of 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 A separate Department of Finance report released in February also suggests 
that Ventura County's slow-growth trend has bottomed out. 
</P>
<P>
 The county grew only 1.1% -- about 7,700 residents -- for the fiscal year that 
ended June 30. But the new figures for calendar year 1993 show a slight uptick 
for the last six months of 1993 and an annual growth of 1.3%. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's growth was so small for fiscal 1993, state analysts said, 
because, for the first time, more residents moved out of Ventura County than 
moved in from other states and foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
 For several years, more residents have moved away than have moved here from 
the other 49 states. But until last year, enough foreign immigrants had settled 
in the county to more than offset the loss to other states. 
</P>
<P>
 The overall population increase occurred only because the county had 8,347 
more births than deaths in 1992-93, analysts reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Finance bases its twice-a-year population estimates on 
changes in such data as births, deaths, school enrollment, registered voters, 
driver's licenses, address changes, registered autos, housing units and income 
tax returns. 1994 Population Estimates 04,16,12,12,10 Jan. 1 '93 Jan. 1 '94 %

ELECTIONS / VENTURA COUNTY SUPERVISOR; SCHAEFER FOCUSES CAMPAIGN ON ATTACKING 
CRIME, IMPROVING SAFETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fighting crime by expanding Ventura County's anti-drug and gang prevention 
programs and protecting law enforcement from budget cuts is the central theme 
of Madge L. Schaefer's campaign for her old job on the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first 10 years that we lived here nobody locked their doors," said 
Schaefer, a 25-year resident of Thousand Oaks. "I never was concerned about my 
safety. And rightly so." 
</P>
<P>
 But those days are gone, said Schaefer, one of five candidates competing for 
the 2nd Supervisorial District seat being vacated by Maria VanderKolk. The 
district includes Thousand Oaks, Oak Park and Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 As examples of increasing incidents of violent crime, Schaefer pointed to the 
fatal stabbing of a 14-year-old Simi Valley student earlier this year and a 
shooting in Thousand Oaks that left two Westlake High School students injured. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are moving inward," she said. "The fences have gone up and 
everything's locked and double-locked. What we have now is the thugs walking 
the streets, and we're all home inside. We need to reverse that and take back 
the streets." 
</P>
<P>
 If elected, Schaefer, 52, promised to bring together government leaders and 
representatives of various community organizations to establish youth outreach 
programs to help curb gang activity. 
</P>
<P>
 As a former member of the Board of Supervisors, Schaefer said she helped 
organize a gang conference to crack down on crime in Ventura and Oxnard by 
redirecting resources in those areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to do more of this," said Schaefer, who has been endorsed by the 
Ventura County Deputy Sheriff's Assn. "We need to find better ways to prevent 
some of the problems." 
</P>
<P>
 David Williams, president of the union, said Schaefer demonstrated her 
commitment to law enforcement as a past member of the Thousand Oaks City 
Council. He said she pushed for the city to buy bulletproof vests for officers, 
who at the time were required to purchase their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having gotten to know her over the years, Madge is someone we feel very 
comfortable with," Williams said. "She knows how government works and how to 
cut through the red tape." 
</P>
<P>
 Schaefer's government experience was also cited as the reason for her 
endorsement by the Service Employees International Union Local 998, which 
represents more than 2,400 county employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "She understands the budget process and she's always been a good advocate for 
county employees," said Barry Hammitt, executive director of the union. 
</P>
<P>
 Schaefer agreed that it is her past experience as a supervisor that sets her 
apart from her opponents, something that she can draw on to help resolve county 
issues ranging from waste management to expansion of public health services. 
</P>
<P>
 "In order to be effective, you've got to know how government works," she said. 
"You've got to be able to step in from Day 1 and know what's going on, to 
understand what the county's responsibilities are and what the problems are." 
</P>
<P>
 On the issue of waste disposal, Schaefer said she strongly backs development 
of a new west county landfill. With Bailard Landfill in Oxnard scheduled to 
shut down in 1997, Schaefer said she does not want the Simi Valley Landfill to 
become the county's only dump. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's always been east and west county (landfills) and that should 
continue," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of investors from San Diego wants to develop a landfill at Weldon 
Canyon near Ojai -- which residents there have successfully opposed -- and is 
collecting signatures to put the issue on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Schaefer said she supports the initiative process, but is not convinced that 
Weldon Canyon is the appropriate or only site for a new dump. "I'm not willing 
to say I support Weldon Canyon," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In other issues, the candidate said she backs a proposal to add a new 
$30-million outpatient wing to Ventura County Medical Center in Ventura. The 
plan has sparked an opposing campaign by neighboring Community Memorial 
Hospital, which considers the county hospital an emerging competitor for 
private patients. 
</P>
<P>
 But Schaefer, who is credited by county officials with instituting reforms 
that have boosted the county hospital's financial standing, said it is the 
private hospital that is trying to lure Medi-Cal patients away from the county 
to ease its financial troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we close the county hospital, then a contract would have to be negotiated 
to provide care (for the poor) with private hospitals," she said. "The problem 
is when the economy changes and things ease up, the private hospitals are going 
to want to dump those patients or raise charges to get the market rate. And who 
pays for that? The taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
 Schaefer said she believes that establishing a commercial airport at Point 
Mugu would help attract new businesses while providing the county's 
agricultural industry with another way to ship its products. The Navy has 
offered to share its runway with the county to help cut operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "But ultimately the success or failure of the airport will be determined" by 
whether major airlines believe that there is enough passenger demand to support 
it, said Schaefer, whose husband, Bruce, is a captain for USAir. 
</P>
<P>
 In the area of public safety, Schaefer said she believes that in the future, 
some portion of money generated from Proposition 172 -- a sales tax initiative 
approved by state voters in November -- should go to the County Fire 
Department. Money from Proposition 172 is now split among the county's law 
enforcement agencies and criminal justice system. 
</P>
<P>
 But Schaefer said that before the Fire Department receives a portion of the 
money, it must improve its efficiency. She noted that a recent audit of the 
department showed that it was top-heavy with managers, and spends too much on 
overtime and sick leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message that I heard from the Board of Supervisors was that 'You need to 
get your house in order before we look at additional funding,' " Schaefer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidate says that if elected, she would solicit suggestions from county 
employees on how to improve operating efficiency in all departments, just as 
she did as a supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every business, in order to stay viable, has to constantly look at how it 
operates and how it can better serve the public," Schaefer said. "I don't think 
government is exempt from that." 
</P>
<P>
 Although she touts her experience on the Board of Supervisors as a reason to 
vote for her, her opponents and critics say this is exactly why voters should 
not support her. Schaefer's opponents include Thousand Oaks City Councilman 
Frank Schillo, taxpayer advocate H. Jere Robings, attorney Trudi Loh and 
rancher Carter Ward. 
</P>
<P>
 Robings criticized Schaefer for voting in 1989 to approve a number of large 
financial perks for county officials. Among the benefits were seven weeks of 
extra vacation pay, a $6,000-a-year car allowance plus mileage, a longevity 
bonus and education benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 The compensation package also included a cash payment to elected officials who 
leave office that was equivalent to what their appointed peers collect for 
unused vacation time. As a result, Schaefer received a check for $16,383.78 
after her defeat in 1990, according to county records. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the perk has been discontinued, several county officials are still 
eligible to receive cash payments for time accrued before the benefit was 
eliminated. Among those eligible to receive payments when they leave office are 
Supervisors Vicky Howard and Maria VanderKolk. 
</P>
<P>
 Schaefer defends her support for the compensation package, saying it was 
designed to bring the pay of elected officials in line with that of county 
managers. She noted that Robings, who at the time served as director of the 
Ventura County Taxpayers Assn., was present when the board approved the 
benefits package in 1989 and did not raise the issue then. 
</P>
<P>
 Robings said it was not disclosed exactly what the benefits package included 
or how much it would cost. The county refused to release figures detailing how 
much officials were paid in extra benefits until The Times, citing public 
disclosure laws, threatened a lawsuit in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Schaefer shrugs off Robings' criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was all done in public," she said of the board's approval of the pay 
package, which has since been completely restructured. "It was all upfront. 
There are so many serious problems going on and that's all one candidate can 
talk about." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Schaefer's fiery personality and support from development interests were 
cited as reasons for her narrow 1990 defeat to VanderKolk, then a 25-year-old 
political newcomer who ran on a slow-growth theme. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters describe Schaefer as a smart, hard-working politician with a firm 
grasp of financial issues. Her critics, on the other hand, say she is arrogant, 
manipulative and quick-tempered, qualities they attribute in part to her 
undoing. 
</P>
<P>
 But Schaefer, who lost a 1992 bid for the state Assembly, said that if she 
occasionally ruffles feathers, it is because she is not afraid to "tell it like 
it is." 
</P>
<P>
 "I am never going to be quiet in the face of something I believe is wrong," 
she said. "I will try and do it with a velvet glove and, if that doesn't work, 
I'll take off the gloves and use brass knuckles. That has always been my 
approach. If you're looking for somebody who is going to be a Caspar 
Milquetoast, I am not your candidate." 
</P>
<P>
 Another criticism leveled at the former supervisor was that she had taken her 
constituents for granted, spending the week before the 1990 election in New 
York City, representing the county in meetings with Wall Street companies that 
rate county bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Schaefer now says she went to New York because former Supervisor Jim Dougherty 
was ill at the time, something he did not want publicized, and could not make 
the trip. Both supervisors were on the county's finance committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to reschedule, but we couldn't," Schaefer said of the trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, even some of Schaefer's supporters said she had waged her campaign as a 
sure thing. She did no door-to-door canvassing and left half of her $40,000 
treasury untouched. 
</P>
<P>
 Schaefer acknowledges that she made some mistakes in the campaign and perhaps 
should have run more aggressively. 
</P>
<P>
 "The perception was that I didn't care," she said. "Whether I thought I was 
taking the election serious enough didn't matter. The perception was the 
reality." 
</P>
<P>
 But Schaefer has worked hard to change that perception. Since January, the 
former supervisor has dragged her ironing board to shopping centers all over 
Thousand Oaks talking to and registering voters. In the process, she collected 
more than 2,000 signatures to help get her name placed on the June 7 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's important for me to put myself out in the public arena," she 
said one cold day in February outside a Ralphs supermarket. "It lets people see 
I'm out here and I'm interested." Profile of Madge L. Schaefer

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; FURTHER STUDY URGED FOR ANTI-DRUG PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Citing growing demands on Camarillo's budget, including a requested $550,000 
hike in the cost of police services, City Council members Wednesday asked for 
further study of a request that the city pay for an anti-drug program. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members referred the issue to a budget study session scheduled for 
June 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Pleasant Valley School District and Ventura County sheriff's 
officials proposed that the city pay as much as $140,000 to bring the 
nationally known Drug Abuse Resistance and Education program to the school 
district. District officials have said they support the program but have no 
money to pay for it, and therefore turned to the city for help. 
</P>
<P>
 During an hourlong study session Wednesday, school district and sheriff's 
officials said the initial $140,000 cost for the DARE program could be trimmed 
to $70,000 through a combination of grants and contributions from community 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 But even with the reduction, the council would not immediately commit to 
funding the DARE program, agreeing instead to consider the request during its 
annual budget study meeting next month. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, it will have to be a definite maybe," said Councilman Stan Daily. 
"There's only so much in the pot and our first responsibility has to be to the 
health, welfare and safety of our citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 But Sue Eastman, a Pleasant Valley spokeswoman and teacher, said the program 
is worthy of the council's support. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are dealing with human beings here," Eastman said. "It's very difficult to 
measure the effectiveness of programs like this. But we do know that we have 
seen some very positive results already at Camarillo Heights (School). We 
believe the city will be taking a cost-effective, proactive stance by 
supporting DARE." 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo Heights School, located just outside the city in unincorporated 
county territory, is the only elementary school in the district with a DARE 
program. The Sheriff's Department pays for the bulk of that school's program.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; D.A. ENDS PROBE INTO '92 FATAL ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura man who was released from jail with an apology after police said he 
did not cause a drunk-driving death most likely was at fault, an 
accident-reconstruction expert told prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 But prosecutors, who made the opinion public Wednesday, announced they were 
closing their investigation into the November, 1992, accident, which claimed 
the life of a 16-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Kevin J. McGee said it does not seem possible to 
prove to a jury that 21-year-old Antonio D. Morales was behind the wheel of a 
pickup truck being pursued on the Santa Paula Freeway by California Highway 
Patrol officers when it plowed into a van carrying Victoria Gonzales of 
Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 A murder charge was dismissed against Morales in March, 1993, after CHP 
investigators concluded that he was a passenger in the truck and that the 
driver was Andres Seals, 21, of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Each man said the other was driving. 
</P>
<P>
 But accident-reconstruction expert Carley Ward, who has a doctorate in 
engineering and specializes in biomechanics and dynamics, was hired by 
prosecutors and determined that Morales drove the truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the CHP had come to a different conclusion, prosecutors felt a jury 
would refuse to convict Morales, McGee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Morales' lawyer, Deputy Public Defender Richard E. Holley, said, "It was clear 
to both the CHP and our experts that Tony Morales was not the driver." 
</P>
<P>
 McGee called the incident a tragedy for the victim's family. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are disappointed, as are we," he said. The family could not be reached 
for comment. DWAYNE BRAY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; POLICE SEEK MAN IN FATAL SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Police are looking for a 46-year-old Ventura man in connection with a fatal 
shooting at a Ventura mobile home park. 
</P>
<P>
 Raul Cervantes Viveros, who witnesses said shot and killed his neighbor Juan 
Vargas on Sunday, has fled the area, Sgt. Bob Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's still at large, and we're doing our best to locate him," Anderson said. 
</P>

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; AT 100, FORMER PRINCIPAL TAKES LIFE IN 
STRIDE

<P>
 Starting to feel the aches and pains of old age creeping up on him, longtime 
Ventura resident Lee Ogden now swims daily at the Pierpont Inn pool instead of 
in the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Exercise is not what it was when Ogden was a mere octogenarian. 
</P>
<P>
 The former school principal, who moved to Ventura in about 1931, turns a 
century old today. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, it's not much different from being 99," said the former principal of 
Ventura Junior High School, now known as Cabrillo Middle School. "But you know, 
I'm at that stage where it's all a day-to-day proposition with me now." 
</P>
<P>
 Ogden grew up in Norfolk, Neb., the son of a building contractor and a 
homemaker. The town had about 6,000 people at the time, he said. "For Nebraska, 
that's a big city."  
</P>
<P>
 After enlisting in the Marines to avoid the World War I draft, Ogden spent a 
year tending the peace in the Dominican Republic after civil unrest there. When 
the war ended, Ogden got his degree from a small Nebraska college, married his 
college sweetheart and took a job as a school superintendent in Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
 Ogden and his wife, Naomi, moved to Glendale in the late 1920s to follow his 
parents, who had fled west to avoid the cold. "I saw my first orange groves," 
he said, flashing a big smile at the memory. "I had always wondered about them. 
In Nebraska, we only had some apple trees." 
</P>
<P>
 Ogden soon moved to Ventura for a job, and, except for a short stint in Corona 
in the mid-1930s, he has lived there ever since. The couple had three sons and 
eight grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Ogden worked in the Ventura schools for 31 consecutive years, first as 
principal at Ventura Junior High and then, when he was forced to leave in 1951 
because of ill health, as an English teacher at the combined high school-junior 
college. He retired in 1959, then substituted at the high school for 10 more 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, he was such a wonderful principal," said Ventura resident Nancy Gallardo, 
who attended the junior high in the mid-1940s. "He was always somebody that 
would talk to you. He seemed to always know everybody by name." 
</P>
<P>
 John Wolfe, who worked as an administrator at the then-separate elementary 
school district, said Ogden was a popular school official. 
</P>
<P>
 "People thought a lot of him, and they have a lot of praise for him," he said. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Ogden has outlived his wife, who died of Alzheimer's disease 12 years 
ago, his six brothers and sisters and most of his contemporaries. Nowadays, 
when he goes to church, he doesn't recognize most of the congregation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he plans to spend the rest of his days in Ventura -- preferably in his 
hillside home, with a panoramic view of the city and the ocean shore. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my town now," he said. "It's a part of me." CONSTANCE SOMMER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; GROUP URGES COUNCIL TO BURY UTILITY LINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of Oxnard Shores residents bombarded the City Council this week with 
pleas to bury the utility lines in their neighborhood first. 
</P>
<P>
 With little comment Tuesday, the council approved a proposed revision of the 
priority list of utility lines designated for burial. 
</P>
<P>
 The council action also designated June 7 as a public hearing for Oxnard 
Shores property owners to comment on the proposal, which would require each 
owner to pay up to $900 to hook into the underground lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans call for the city to spend about $2.5 million to bury thousands of feet 
of utility lines stretching from Amalfi Way to 5th Street, including much of 
Harbor Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Money to pay for the project -- about $3 million -- has been generated by a 
series of assessments, including city fees and charges by Southern California 
Edison, which will bury the lines. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Oxnard Shores residents told the council that they should lead the 
list because they have paid into the assessment fund for years and are willing 
to pay their own hookup costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oxnard Shores is a victim of aging," said Bodine Elias, chairwoman of the 
Oxnard Shores Neighborhood Council. "It was subdivided before any of the 
(existing) restrictions were in place." 
</P>
<P>
 Other neighborhoods targeted for placing lines underground include the Channel 
Islands Boulevard area, portions of Oxnard Boulevard and parts of Saviers Road.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI VALLEY; $26,000 RAISED FOR RADAR TOWER FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ojai Valley residents who are demanding that the National Weather Service move 
its Sulphur Mountain radar tower raised about $26,000 this week during a 
$50-a-person dinner and art auction. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 200 people crowded the tiny Wheeler Hot Springs restaurant Tuesday 
night for the event, which was hosted by local celebrities Scott Bakula, Mary 
Steenburgen and Rickie Lee Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty-one art pieces, including lithographs by Ojai potter Beatrice Wood and 
paintings by John Nava and Ed Moses, netted several thousand dollars, which 
will be earmarked for future events, including a trip to Washington and a march 
to be staged in downtown Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason people come to these things is because California used to be full 
of Ojais -- beautiful, pristine places," said Steenburgen, who has lived in 
Ojai for 10 years. "We love where we live, and it's ridiculous that we have to 
work to keep it nice." 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai resident David Hedman said he was delighted with the turnout. 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably half of the funds we've raised over the last 60 days have been 
(earmarked to inform) other communities that they are about to be raped by the 
National Weather Service," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the weather tracking system are angry that the federal government 
erected the 98-foot-tall tower without notifying them and fear that the low 
levels of radiation it emits could pose health risks. 
</P>
<P>
 But a federal judge ruled earlier this year that the government did not act 
capriciously when it installed the tower in November, and said sufficient tests 
were conducted to determine the radar's safety. 
</P>
<P>
 After losing the two court battles, the residents have launched a series of 
events aimed at raising money for their fight and garnering support outside 
their small community. TRACY WILSON

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; JUDGE UPHOLDS ARREST OF WITNESS IN TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge has ruled that a Ventura County deputy district attorney violated no 
law by arranging to have a witness arrested on misdemeanor traffic warrants in 
April as she waited in a courthouse hallway to testify in her husband's drug 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 But Superior Court Judge Charles W. Campbell Jr. on Tuesday said Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Terence Kilbride's actions were inappropriate. Campbell also suggested 
that Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury instruct his deputy prosecutors not to 
interfere with witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 6, Kilbride directed a Sheriff's Department law clerk to check 
whether there were outstanding arrest warrants for Kara Crecelius of Ojai, who 
had come to the Hall of Justice to testify in the drug-possession trial of her 
husband, John Crecelius. 
</P>
<P>
 The check turned up two warrants against the woman for failure to pay traffic 
tickets. Kilbride called the Sheriff's Department twice, saying the woman was 
at the courthouse waiting to testify. On the second call, he noted that "no one 
has picked her up," a clerk has testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, the woman was arrested. Campbell eventually ordered her 
released to testify, but Deputy Public Defender Todd R. Howeth argued that she 
had been intimidated by Kilbride. He also accused Kilbride of prosecutorial 
misconduct and asked that John Crecelius, whom a jury found guilty of two drug 
counts, receive a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell denied the motion for a new trial and sentenced John Crecelius to 
five years in prison Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kilbride said he felt exonerated and added that he was only doing what he 
thought was proper under the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Kilbride's boss, Deputy Dist. Atty. Ron Janes, said, "There was an honest 
effort by Mr. Kilbride to do something that the law requires." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior prosecutors could not be reached to determine if they plan to follow 
the judge's advice on instructing other deputy prosecutors not to interfere 
with witnesses. DWAYNE BRAY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: GROUPS HONORED FOR CHARITABLE WORK

 The volunteers at Caregivers in Ventura ran 5,135 errands, drove 9,400 miles 
and spent 978 hours visiting the elderly last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The workers at Livingston Memorial Visiting Nurse Assn. delivered nurses, 
physical therapists and medical technology to 500 homebound residents who could 
not afford their services. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the two Ventura County groups were recognized for their work 
during the 1994 Community Partnership Awards sponsored by the Los Angeles Times 
Ventura County and San Fernando Valley editions. 
</P>
<P>
 Altogether, 10 organizations received $5,000 grants to continue their 
charitable activities in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 "The demands placed on local nonprofit organizations, especially over the last 
few months, have been overwhelming," said Jeffrey S. Klein, president of the 
newspaper editions. "The Community Partnership Awards are an opportunity for 
The Times to honor these organizations for their tireless efforts to improve 
the quality of life in our community." 
</P>
<P>
 Caregivers matches each of its nearly 200 volunteers with an elderly person 
who may need help living alone. The point of the program is to give the older 
person someone to rely upon so he or she can delay going to a nursing home or 
other institution, said Patricia B. Meredith, the group's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 The Livingston nursing group provides a range of home health services at 
discounted prices or no cost to the county's indigent patients confined to 
their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The other 1994 winners are the Assistance League of Antelope Valley, Assn. to 
Aid Victims of Domestic Violence in Newhall, San Fernando Valley Friends of 
Homeless Women and Children, Rhapsody in Green in Studio City, Human Services 
Network in North Hollywood, the Zonta Club of the Santa Clarita Valley Area, 
Special Equestrian Riding Therapy in Agoura Hills, and Santa Clarita Valley 
Youth Orchestra Foundation in Valencia. PHYLLIS W. JORDAN

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; WOMAN CHARGED WITH MOLESTING BOY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 35-year-old Thousand Oaks woman has been charged with 31 counts of child 
molestation for having sex almost once a month with a teen-age boy for 2 1/2 
years, prosecutors said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 With tears in her eyes, Gloria G. Goldman appeared for arraignment Wednesday 
in Ventura County Municipal Court.However, the arraignment was put off until 
May 20 and Goldman remains free in lieu of $10,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman is charged with molesting the Thousand Oaks boy at least once a month 
from August, 1991, to February, 1993, with the exception of one month in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged incidents began when the boy, now 17, was 15, the complaint says. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman, a former teacher, faces 11 counts of a lewd act upon a child, 18 
counts of oral copulation and two counts of unlawful sexual intercourse. Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Bob Calvert declined to discuss the facts in the case, or whether 
authorities suspect any other boys are involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Sheriff's Deputy Bob LeMay said the victim revealed the alleged 
affair after recently converting to Christianity. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy initially told a church peer counselor, who reported it to 
investigators. The boy talked with authorities about three weeks ago, LeMay 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's emotionally troubled by the whole incident," LeMay said. The teen-ager 
has temporarily moved from the area, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The public defender's office was appointed to represent the woman. She left 
the courthouse without talking to reporters. DWAYNE BRAY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: JUDGE DENIES PIROLI'S BID FOR SEIZED MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Father David Dean Piroli, the Simi Valley priest once accused of stealing more 
than $50,000 from his former parishes, is not entitled to share in any of the 
$43,420 seized from his church room and office, a judge has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Superior Court Judge Allan Steele said the money, much of it 
stuffed into collection envelopes, should go to the Catholic Archdiocese of Los 
Angeles.The cash was seized after Piroli was charged with one count of grand 
theft and one count of embezzlement in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the money found in the room and office, Piroli claimed about $10,000 
belonged to him. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge, who made his decision in a written ruling Tuesday, did give the 
suspended priest back the nearly $23,000 that remains in nine bank accounts in 
Piroli's name. He had given him $10,000 from the bank accounts earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Steele's ruling on the return of the money all but ends the criminal case 
against the 38-year-old Piroli, which began nearly two years ago and resulted 
in a six-week trial and several dozen other court hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Piroli was acquitted last month of an embezzlement charge by a Superior Court 
jury, which deadlocked 9 to 3 in favor of acquittal on a grand-theft charge. 
</P>
<P>
 During his trial, the defense maintained that a senior pastor framed Piroli by 
planting much of the money found in his room at St. Peter Claver in Simi Valley 
and in his church-owned car. The embezzlement charge stemmed from accusations 
against Piroli at Sacred Heart Church in Saticoy. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge did not formally dismiss the embezzlement charge. He has said he 
plans to do that after prosecutors and the defense decide on who gets some 
documents and other non-monetary property seized from Piroli. DWAYNE BRAY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: OXNARD; MOBILE HOME RENT INITIATIVE OPPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than a dozen mobile home park residents persuaded the Oxnard City Council 
to adopt a resolution opposing an initiative that would override local 
rent-control laws on mobile homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of people who feel this initiative is being misrepresented," 
Mayor Manuel M. Lopez said Tuesday."Even though it is being touted as 
assistance for mobile home residents, it would not do that." 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative, being circulated by park owners around the state as the 
"Mobilehome Fairness and Rental Assistance Act," would limit rent subsidies to 
10% of the residents and do away with local mobile home rent-control laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Alice-Jean Davis, president of the regional chapter of the Golden State 
Mobilehome Owners League, told the council Tuesday that signature-gatherers at 
a local shopping center last weekend were lying to potential signers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were indeed saying that (the petition) was for 10% off rents," Davis 
said in seeking council support for the resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, whose region covers San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Ventura 
counties, said several other cities have adopted similar resolutions, including 
Thousand Oaks and Arroyo Grande. 
</P>
<P>
 Petition supporters said they have about 100,000 of the signatures needed to 
qualify the measure for the fall ballot.  
</P>
<P>
 They have until late June to submit about 385,000 valid signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 There are more than 10,000 mobile homes in Ventura County. JEFF McDONALD

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; GUIDELINES SOUGHT ON SALES OF CITY 
PROPERTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Concerned about the potential for corruption, Thousand Oaks Councilwoman Jaime 
Zukowski has pushed the council to formalize its process of selling city-owned 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 The council asked the city attorney Tuesday to draw up guidelines for property 
transactions after Zukowski insisted that the current process can be abused. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm concerned that there is no safeguard in place to look out for the city, 
the property buyer and the public trust," Zukowski said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said her concern stemmed from the city's sale of a 7,200-square-foot 
parcel on East Hillcrest Drive. That sale was made privately to two local 
businessmen, despite the fact that other parties expressed interest in the 
property, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we should make it clear exactly what we need to do when selling 
property and make certain that the council is kept appraised of which 
properties are considered surplus," Zukowski said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other council members said they saw no evidence that the process could lead to 
favoritism for some buyers. But they agreed to ask the city attorney to draw up 
guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 "If formalizing the process will give everyone a greater sense of security, 
then I don't see why we shouldn't do it," Councilwoman Judy Lazar said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zukowski had also pushed the council to consider changing the city's policy 
toward appraisals. She said more than one appraisal of city-owned parcels would 
help the city avoid bad deals. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Alex Fiore said the city's track record of making profitable 
land deals proved that multiple appraisals would not be needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Added City Atty. Mark Sellers: "That would be a waste of city money. I just 
don't think it's necessary." MATTHEW MOSK

 Detectives also arrested Debra Foxen, 30, of Camarillo on suspicion of 
methamphetamine possession after she showed up during their search of the 
Loesches' home, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 A two-month investigation and tips from neighbors eventually led detectives to 
the house where Paul and Peter Loesche lived in the 3300 block of Calle 
Quebracho in Thousand Oaks, Pentis' report said. 
</P>
<P>
 After watching the house, detectives searched the brothers' house and cars 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 They found two ounces of methamphetamine worth $5,000, $21,000 cash, five 
assault rifles with numerous 30-round magazines, a shotgun, five semiautomatic 
handguns and about 3,000 rounds of ammunition, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives also found scales, materials for cutting and packaging drugs and 
lists of suspected drug buyers, along with radio scanners used to detect police 
surveillance, Pentis' report said.  
</P>
<P>
 Peter Loesche was booked at Ventura County Jail, where he was being held 
Wednesday evening in lieu of $5,000 bail. Foxen was released on her own 
recognizance. Paul Loesche was later released on $10,000 bail, police said.

FIRE GUTS HOUSE; WOMAN, CHILD NOT HOME

 Ventura firefighters subdued a two-alarm house fire Wednesday night after 
twice searching the burning structure for a 15-month-old infant. 
</P>
<P>
 The blaze, reported at 7:16 p.m., gutted the house in the 600 block of 
Sheridan Way but caused no injuries or damage to nearby homes, Ventura Fire 
Department Battalion Chief Bill Rigg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors on the street near Ventura Avenue first noticed the flames and tried 
to put the fire out by breaking windows and opening doors, Rigg said. However, 
their efforts caused the fire to spread more quickly so that the one-story 
house was fully involved when firefighters arrived, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 With four engines on the scene, firefighters had the flames contained within 
10 minutes, Rigg said. Warned that a child might be home, firefighters 
conducted two searches but found no one. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, tenant Dana Taylor and her baby returned from the grocery store to a 
home charred by fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Rigg said the Fire Department was investigating the cause of the fire and the 
extent of the damage. PHYLLIS W. JORDAN

SCHOOL PANEL OFFERS NEW GOALS FOR CONEJO DISTRICT; EDUCATION: THOUSAND OAKS 
PARENTS, OFFICIALS STRESS THE USE OF COMPUTERS, SMALLER CLASSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Emphasizing school safety, better use of computers and a reduction in class 
size, a panel of Thousand Oaks parents and school officials has drawn up a 
broad blueprint for the future of education in the Conejo Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel's recommendations will be discussed today as members of the Conejo 
Valley school board meet to define new five-year goals for the district. Those 
goals, replacing ones set in 1989, will be used to guide curricula and budget 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel's list of 10 suggestions, whittled down from months of community 
meetings, calls for giving more autonomy to administrators at individual 
schools, encouraging parent involvement, improving school facilities and 
recruiting high-quality staff. Other goals call for bringing more computers 
into the classroom and for preparing students for jobs in the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Two school board members on Wednesday said they are concerned that some of the 
suggested goals are too vague and that others might be impossible to achieve. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should not just be expressions or slogans of flag-waving, pep-rallying 
points," said board member Bill Henry. "Every single one of those should be 
quantifiable." 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, Henry said he is troubled by the goal of reducing class size. 
Because class size is so closely tied to state funding, he said there is little 
the district can do to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly in the foreseeable future, class size, if anything, will get worse, 
not better," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Mildred Lynch said she believes the panel's suggestions focus too 
much on technology and special programs and not enough on traditional academics 
and solid classroom teaching. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not here to train workers for corporations. We're here to educate 
people," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing academic in here. There's nothing about teaching what some of 
us think kids ought to know," Lynch added. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Dolores Didio, who served on the committee working on the 
five-year plan, said the list of suggested goals was distilled from hundreds of 
comments made by parents, students, teachers, business leaders and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Developing a master plan for the use of technology, school safety and 
shrinking class size were repeatedly named as top priorities, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 School performance and quality teaching may not have been mentioned as goals, 
she said, because the district is already recognized for having high scores on 
standardized tests and quality programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what people are looking for is expanding beyond that," Didio said. 
</P>
<P>
 Didio said the goals are intentionally broad and the committee never set out 
to develop detailed policy suggestions or set specific benchmarks. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to holding public forums to seek community input, the district 
also solicited written comments from a number of groups. Among the letters 
received was a list of 16 suggestions from the American Assn. of University 
Women. Goals suggested by the group included "freedom from violence," 
"bias-free education," and intervention programs for at-risk students. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's previous five-year plan contained seven broad goals, including 
reducing permissiveness, offering support to teachers and boosting student 
performance. There was no mention of technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's workshop on the plan will begin at 3 p.m. in the board room at the 
Conejo Valley district offices, 1400 E. Janss Road in Thousand Oaks.

THOUSAND OAKS ANNOUNCES CURFEW CRACKDOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As juvenile crime and gang skirmishes increase in Thousand Oaks, sheriff's 
officials said Wednesday they plan to crack down on teen-age curfew violators 
to restore late-night calm. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County sheriff's deputies in Thousand Oaks decided to start handing 
out more curfew citations after Oxnard police stepped up their own curfew 
enforcement, sheriff's officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, it's going to get the kids off the street," said Sgt. Michael de 
Los Santos, the sheriff's youth officer in Thousand Oaks. "And if we're dealing 
with gang members or people that are on probation, it's going to be one other 
violation of their probation we can use." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's officials have been making plans for the crackdown for several 
weeks, he said, but the announcement came just as City Council members and 
Thousand Oaks residents began pressing for more curfew enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members Frank Schillo and Alex Fiore on Tuesday asked Sheriff's 
Cmdr. Kathy Kemp -- the city's chief of police -- to report to the council on 
how her deputies are enforcing the city curfew ordinance that targets teen-age 
loiterers. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents at the city's first Crime Symposium on Saturday also recommended 
that police cite more teen-agers for violating curfew. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we strengthen it or urge that it be used regularly, that can help get the 
bad guys off the street," Schillo said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks curfew ordinance prohibits anyone younger than age 18 from 
being on the streets between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. unless accompanied by an adult. 
It is a status offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Juvenile probation authorities usually write warning letters to parents of 
first-time offenders. Second- and third-time offenders often are ordered to do 
community service work or pay a fine by making a $25 donation to the charity of 
their choice, said Julie Hedrick, a senior deputy probation officer with the 
county Corrections Services Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Juvenile Court, authorities can stack a curfew violation atop other 
crimes in asking for stiffer punishment in cases of probation violations, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Thousand Oaks deputies often merely warn young nighthawks about the law 
and order them off the street without issuing citations, Kemp said. In 1993, 
deputies issued 149 curfew citations to Thousand Oaks youths, and so far this 
year have issued 34, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they've got a legitimate purpose to be out, we prefer to give them the 
benefit of the doubt," Kemp said. "A lot of times, we may . . . do it 
informally and say, 'All right, we want everybody to go home,' and then if we 
see them still wandering around later we'll cite them." 
</P>
<P>
 In coming nights, however, deputies might run curfew sweeps, warning every 
teen-ager spotted on the streets after 10 p.m. and ticketing stragglers, she 
said. Sheriff's officials have not yet decided when the crackdown will go into 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the problem is in the upcoming season -- summer," Kemp said. 
Teen-agers often just hang out at restaurants and other late-night businesses, 
keeping some legitimate customers away, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 De Los Santos said youths under age 18 cause more than half the nighttime 
street disturbance complaints that deputies answer from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. on 
weekend nights in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Any such disturbance "could take two units out of service for 15 to 20 
minutes," and slows response time for emergency calls, De Los Santos said. 
</P>
<P>
 When deputies cite youths for violating the curfew, they sometimes must drive 
the offender back to the East Valley Sheriff's Station and call their parents, 
which takes even more time, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't do a lot of that because we realize how time-consuming it is," Del 
Los Santos said. "That's why they end up getting warned a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Alex Fiore said tightening curfew enforcement "may have some 
merit."

* MAURICE (MAURY) KING; WESTERN-WEAR RETAILER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID E. BRADY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maurice (Maury) King, a San Fernando Valley retailer since 1946 whose 
Western-wear store supplied clothing for numerous Hollywood productions, has 
died. He was 76. 
</P>
<P>
 A longtime Van Nuys resident, King died Tuesday at a Burbank hospital after 
suffering from leukemia, said his son, Randy King. 
</P>
<P>
 With his wife, Arlene, King opened King's Riding and Sport Shop on Friar 
Street in Van Nuys in 1946. Two years later, the Kings modified their inventory 
to target the growing number of horse owners in the Valley, re-christening the 
store King's Western Wear. In 1950, the couple built a home in Van Nuys a few 
blocks from the store. 
</P>
<P>
 According to his son, a regular fixture at the shop in the early years was a 
dog that King had smuggled out of Germany during World War II. Named Duchie, 
the boxer entertained customers for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 King's Western Wear moved to its present Van Nuys Boulevard location in 1962. 
Since then, it has become one of the largest stores of its kind in Southern 
California, drawing customers from around the globe, according to Randy King. 
He added that the store's apparel has appeared in such movies as "Unforgiven," 
"Silverado" and "Urban Cowboy." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Chicago, King moved to Los Angeles with his family about 1920. He 
attended Los Angeles City College and worked briefly in the retail industry 
before being drafted in 1942. As a member of the Army Air Corps, he fought in 
the European theater, attaining the rank of captain. 
</P>
<P>
 According to his wife, King was active in San Fernando Valley community 
affairs for many years and gave generously to several charities benefiting 
Israel. The Kings celebrated their 51st wedding anniversary this year. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his wife and son, King is survived by a daughter, Nancy King of 
San Rafael, and two grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 A funeral will be held at 11 a.m. Friday at Groman-Eden Mortuary, 11500 
Sepulveda Blvd., Mission Hills. In lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be 
made to the charity of the donor's choice.

TWO HITS? DODGERS NEED ONE; BASEBALL: MONDESI'S HOME RUN BREAKS UP REYNOLDS' 
PERFECT GAME AND IS ENOUGH FOR ASTACIO, 1-0. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 He must have hit 2,000 curveballs during the spring, staying late with Manager 
Tom Lasorda after every exhibition game, hitting curveballs until his arm got 
so sore that at one point he had to take a day off. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most important curveball Raul Mondesi has hit this season came 
Wednesday night, a solo shot in the sixth inning against Shane Reynolds, a 
fill-in starter for Houston who was throwing a perfect game. It was the only 
run the Dodgers would get in their 1-0 victory over the Astros, giving them 
their first three-game sweep this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are running out in the field before the (sixth inning) and Mondesi says to 
me, 'Bugsy, I'm going to hit a bomb next time up,' " Brett Butler said. "So we 
are in the dugout before he goes up and it's kind of dead, and I say, 'Mondesi 
doesn't lie, he said he was going to hit a bomb.' Then he goes and hits it. I 
said, 'Thanks for telling the truth.' " 
</P>
<P>
 It was a cold, damp night at Dodger Stadium, not conducive to balls flying out 
of the park. To add to that, Reynolds was throwing his split-fingered fastball 
so well that he had Lasorda checking the baseballs. 
</P>
<P>
 But the winning pitcher was Pedro Astacio (2-3), who pitched an outstanding 
game for the second consecutive start. Spotted a 1-0 lead when Mondesi hit the 
first pitch Reynolds threw in the sixth inning, Astacio cruised to a 
complete-game four-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Inside I was confident when I came to the plate," Mondesi said. "I was 
waiting for a breaking ball and he made a mistake and pitched it over the 
middle." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers got only one other hit. The Astros hit only five balls out of the 
infield, and the most threatening one should have been a double in the third 
inning by Andujar Cedeno. Mondesi made a running catch in right before running 
into the padded wall for the second consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the best fielder I have ever played with," Butler said. "He's being 
compared to (Roberto) Clemente and Ellis Valentine and players like that. He's 
like a wild stallion -- he's oozing with ability." 
</P>
<P>
 The victory gave the Dodgers a 17-17 record, the first time they have been at 
.500 since the fourth game of the season. All three victories over the Astros 
were one-run games. 
</P>
<P>
 Astacio, who is more animated on the mound than in the clubhouse, retired 15 
of the first 16 batters. He escaped three scoring threats by the Astros, the 
last one coming in the eighth inning, after Sid Bream hit for Reynolds and 
doubled to left. With two out, James Mouton struck out swinging, and Astacio 
whirled around on the mound in glee. But the ball got away from Mike Piazza, 
who threw to first for the out. Astacio pumped his fist and leaped off the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 "Astacio pitched outstanding and so did the other young man, but 
unfortunately, he lost," Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the game, Astro Manager Terry Collins said he hoped to get five innings 
out of Reynolds, and what a five innings he got. Reynolds retired the first 15 
batters. He had eight strikeouts, five in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 "He threw a good ballgame, just one pitch beat him," Delino DeShields said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds was filling in for Pete Harnisch, who was back in Houston. An MRI 
exam revealed he has a partially torn tendon in his right shoulder, but he is 
expected to make his next start on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mondesi's last 11 starts, he is batting .325 with four doubles, three 
homers and eight runs scored. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those curveball sessions, all of them paid off," Lasorda said.

ANGELS CAN'T RECALL MORE PLEASANT DAY; BASEBALL: THEY MOVE INTO FIRST PLACE 
AFTER WINNING TWICE AGAINST RANGERS, 8-6 AND 13-1.

 The Angels have endured three decades of failures in their franchise history, 
so when there are nights like Wednesday, who can blame them for feeling 
invincible? 
</P>
<P>
 They were sure they discovered utopia at The Ballpark, and after 8-6 and 13-1 
victories over the Texas Rangers, there wasn't a soul who could convince them 
otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know too much about the history of this club, but I've got to believe 
there hasn't been a day like this one," Angel left fielder Dwight Smith said. 
The Angels got the 8-6 victory in 10 innings in the continuation of a game 
suspended after eight innings Tuesday night, then easily won the regularly 
scheduled game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know the owner (Gene Autry) is getting older, and he wants to see a winner, 
and the least we can do is give him a championship and stir up a little 
excitement at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "You keep seeing ESPN and everyone else writing us off, but hang around, baby, 
and you're going to see something special from this club." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels are 15-20, which somehow is good enough for first place in the 
American League West, they believe that this was a day that will be treasured 
in Angel folklore: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Angels won the suspended game when Smith hit a pinch-hit run-scoring 
single to trigger a three-run rally in the 10th, and then won the second game 
when they played home-run derby against rookie Rick Helling. 
</P>
<P>
 -- They recaptured the distinction of having the worst record for a 
first-place club in history. "It's realignment, baby, you got to love it," 
Smith said. "They can say what they want, but if we finish five games under 
.500 and are still in first place, we're still going to the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 -- They left town believing they had been reincarnated as the Bronx Bombers, 
producing 32 hits and 21 runs in the two games, including nine extra-base hits 
in the second game. 
</P>
<P>
 They actually have had more difficulty this season hitting 55-year-old coach 
Bobby Knoop in batting practice than they did against Helling. He struck around 
long enough to face 13 batters, yielding four home runs, two triples, one 
double and three singles in one-plus inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a pretty good kicking," Angel Manager Buck Rodgers said. "I think if 
they had thrown the rosin bag up there, we probably would have hit a line 
drive." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mark Langston returned 29 days after undergoing elbow surgery to win the 
nightcap, yielding five hits and one run in five innings. It seemed only 
appropriate, the players said, that they were in first place when he went on 
the disabled list and returned to first on his first day back. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, they provided him a nice welcoming gift with a 6-0 lead before he 
took the mound, and a 9-0 lead before he began the second inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't know how much time he was going to need to get loose," Smith said, 
"so we made sure of it. He's the $6-million man, isn't he?" 
</P>
<P>
 -- Right fielder Tim Salmon, who never before had a four-hit game, had two in 
the same day. He went eight for 10 in the two games, raising his batting 
average from .272 to .311. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had spurts like that before," Salmon said, "but never for such an 
extended period." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Shortstop Gary DiSarcina, who had a career batting average of .190 with no 
homers and two runs batted in at the Rangers' former home, Arlington Stadium, 
batted .333 with one homer, two doubles and three RBIs during the series. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest thing I worried about was that my homer would get rained out," 
DiSarcina said. "You should have seen me. I sat in here during the delay 
(Tuesday), held my hands together and said, 'Come on, if you're really up 
there, you'll help me out on this one.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't speak for everyone else, but I love this place." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Designated hitter Chili Davis hit a triple and two homers -- including a 
homer from each side of the plate -- in the second game to go along with four 
RBIs. He is batting .357 with eight homers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Reliever Mike Butcher, who had a security guard ejected from the premises 
for taunting the Angel relievers during the series, pitched 1 1/3 innings 
Tuesday and started the suspended game by pitching two more innings for the 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "It felt like I got a win and a save in the same game," Butcher said. "Is that 
possible?" 
</P>
<P>
 -- Reliever John Dopson pitched four shutout innings in the second game for 
the first save in his 13-year professional career. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you hang around long enough," Dopson said, "you see a little bit of 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
 -- First baseman Jim Edmonds, after being brushed back with a pitch in the 
first inning, hit the next pitch into the right-field seats for the first homer 
of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, I'm sure we've all had better days in our life," said Davis, "but 
right now, I really can't think of any."

KNICKS SAVE BEST FOR LAST QUARTER; NBA PLAYOFFS: STARKS' THREE-POINTERS KEY AS 
NEW YORK TAKES 2-0 LEAD OVER CHICAGO, 96-91. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The fourth quarter belongs to the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
 This is fortunate for them, because their first three quarters are invariably 
up for grabs. The Chicago Bulls took it to them once more Wednesday night, but 
the Knicks got them again in the final quarter and won, 96-91, to take a 2-0 
lead in the Eastern semifinal series. 
</P>
<P>
 In Game 1, the Bulls led by 15 points in the third quarter but were upended 
the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 In Game 2, the Bulls led by eight in the third quarter, but the Knicks hit 
them with a 27-19 fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulls are averaging 52 points in the first half, 37 in the second. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, put it this way," Bull forward Horace Grant said, "when you play a 
Charles Oakley for 10-12 minutes, then you come in with a Charles Smith for 5-8 
minutes, then you come in with an Anthony Mason, I think that would wear 
anybody down. I don't think Hulk Hogan wouldn't be worn down." 
</P>
<P>
 Mason, the best player Pat Riley ever put on indefinite suspension, came off 
the bench to score 15 points with 14 rebounds and six assists in 34 minutes. A 
6-foot-7, 250-pound "small" forward, he was often matched against the taller, 
thinner Toni Kukoc, who needed a crash weightlifting course, or a bat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess our bench is going to have to match their bench," Grant said. "That's 
very difficult. No single player is going to stop Mason in the post. Toni is a 
little too weak to stop him in the post." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it wasn't supposed to be this hard. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Bulls almost stole Game 1, Riley put it down to the 48-hour 
turnaround from the Knicks' first-round victory over New Jersey, hinting in 
addition his team had taken the Bulls lightly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Game 1 scare and two days of hard drilling on Chicago's spread-out 
triangle offense were expected to cure that. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't. The Bulls spread them out again and Knick muscle was useless. By 
halftime, Grant, Scottie Pippen and B.J. Armstrong were in double figures. John 
Starks missed four of his five shots, was assessed a technical foul after 
picking up his third personal and went to the bench fuming. 
</P>
<P>
 The third quarter followed the Game 1 script too. The Knicks regrouped at 
halftime, came back out . . . and fell further behind. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulls went back up by eight. They were still ahead, 61-56, when Pippen 
drew his fourth foul with 4:50 left in the third quarter and had to come out. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks cut it to 72-69 after three quarters, then held the Bulls scoreless 
for the first 5:40 of the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulls still led, 72-71, 2:39 into the period, the Knicks having neglected 
to score a field goal themselves. Then Starks, back in, cooled down and left 
alone on the right wing, hit a three-pointer to put New York ahead for the 
first time since the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The next time down, Starks, on the left wing and covered this time, hit 
another three-pointer and the Bulls were all but officially finished.  
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Starks scored eight of his 13 points during an 11-0 run that made it 
80-69. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Riley: "John threw a couple of daggers right at their heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Bull Coach Phil Jackson: "Starks' three-pointers were the difference in 
the ballgame. It was a wind-out-of-the-sails period of time when he came in and 
cast those two and they went down and the game changed dramatically."  
</P>
<P>
 Said Starks: "That's always been my forte since I came here. I can be one for 
five or one for 11 and I always think my next shot is going down." 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Ewing scored 10 of his 26 points in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just haven't been able to handle the pressure down the stretch of the 
game," said Pippen, who scored 22 points but missed 10 of 15 shots. "They're 
definitely a much deeper team than we are. Any time we play three quarters with 
a team, we should be able to get it done." 
</P>
<P>
 The series moves to Chicago for Games 3 and 4, as it did last spring. The 
Bulls went home and won four in a row a year ago. This time, however, the man 
who used to own the fourth quarter is playing baseball and the Knicks have a 
lean and hungry look.

STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS; DEVILS GET THEIR DUE AND RANGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now that they have gotten the Boston Bruins out of the way, the New Jersey 
Devils can focus on the team they have battled all season for NHL supremacy -- 
the New York Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 John MacLean had two goals and two assists Wednesday night in a 5-3 victory 
over the Bruins as the Devils advanced to the Eastern Conference finals. The 
Devils won the final four games of the best-of-seven series against Boston 
after losing the first two at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "The road to the Stanley Cup is through New York," New Jersey forward Bernie 
Nicholls said. "We are now in a situation where we want to be. We have an 
opportunity to play against the Rangers, the best team in the NHL in the 
regular season." 
</P>
<P>
 Devil goalie Chris Terreri stopped 38 shots to win his third straight game at 
Boston Garden, where the Bruins lost five of seven during the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Devils open the conference finals Sunday at New York. The Rangers have won 
eight of nine playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Western Conference final could be decided tonight as San Jose plays at 
Toronto with a 3-2 lead. The winner gets the Vancouver Canucks, a winner over 
Dallas in five games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Devil-Ranger series matches the NHL's two best teams during the regular 
season. Only the Rangers had more than the Devils' 106 points, and that was 
largely because New York won all six of its games against New Jersey during the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just really want to savor this one," MacLean said. "We know who we play 
next. We'll talk about that later on. We just want to savor the win." 
</P>
<P>
 MacLean's second goal was the game-winner. He scored with 4:37 gone in the 
third period to give New Jersey a 4-3 lead and stop a Boston rally that had 
wiped out a three-goal deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholls stole the puck from Boston defenseman Al Iafrate at the Bruins' blue 
line and passed to Claude Lemieux, whose shot ricocheted off the post and right 
to MacLean on the other side of the ice for New Jersey's fourth goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the biggest mistake I've ever made," Iafrate said. "This game was our 
best game of the series, but we still didn't win." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins rallied from a 3-0 deficit with a goal late in the second period 
and two more in the first 2:08 of the third. The three goals, in a span of 
3:37, broke a scoreless span of 122:19 for Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Niedermayer, Lemieux and Tom Chorske also scored for the Devils, with 
Chorske's goal coming in the final minute. Mariusz Czerkawski, Glen Wesley and 
Bryan Smolinski scored for Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey, which won, 2-0, in Game 5 for the only home victory of the series, 
excelled throughout at shutting down Boston's forwards and held Adam Oates 
without a goal in the six games.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By ALLAN MALAMUD

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Advisory to Dodger fans: As crazy as it might seem, don't leave the ballpark 
early this year. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 So many games are being decided in the late innings that the team's relievers 
have more decisions than the starters. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Dodger starters had 116 decisions and relievers 46 last year. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 The favorite baseball chant in L.A. has gone from a derisive "Dar-ryl" to an 
enthusiastic "Ra-ul." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers haven't pulled a triple play since moving from Brooklyn in 1958, 
but their Bakersfield farm club in the California League was the victim of an 
unassisted triple play by shortstop Neifi Perez of the Central Valley Rockies 
on Monday. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 With men on first and second, Perez caught a line drive, stepped on second to 
double off that runner and then ran a few steps to tag out the runner who had 
strayed too far from first. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The teams with the three best records in the American League reside in the 
East Division. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 What helps make that possible is a league schedule that is nearly balanced. In 
football and basketball, the percentage of intra-division games is far greater. 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta Brave reliever Mike Stanton raised his lifetime batting average to 
.600 -- six for 10 -- with his two hits, including the game-winning bunt, 
against Philadelphia on Tuesday. Stanton didn't bat once last year when he made 
63 relief appearances. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The economy-conscious Montreal Expos will probably trade free agent-to-be 
right fielder Larry Walker before the end of the season. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 At the major league owners' meeting early next month, look for announcements 
that two franchises, including one in Tampa-St. Petersburg, will be added for 
the 1996 season and that University of Kansas Chancellor Gene Budig will 
succeed Bobby Brown as American League president. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The good thing about early-season rainouts is that they create midseason 
doubleheaders. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Jo Lasorda will be the host of a summer fashion show and luncheon June 1 at 
the Anaheim Hilton Towers, proceeds going to the Tommy Lasorda Jr. Memorial 
Foundation. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Greg McMurtry, the former New England Patriot and Michigan wide receiver 
signed by the Rams as a free agent, was selected by the Boston Red Sox in the 
first round of the 1986 amateur draft as a pitcher. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I didn't get a chance to watch the controversial Julio Cesar Chavez-Frankie 
Randall fight last Saturday, but a lot of my questions will be answered Sunday 
at 10 p.m. when the replay is shown on Showtime. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Depending on whom you believe, Michael Moorer's first defense of his World 
Boxing Assn. and International Boxing Federation heavyweight titles will be 
against George Foreman or Joe Hipp. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Promoter Bob Arum, who wants to match Moorer and Foreman in September, is 
planning an attractive Riddick Bowe-Larry Donald bout July 15 at Lake Tahoe or 
July 16 at Hollywood Park. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Gabriel Ruelas, who will fight Paris Alexander on May 20 at the Olympic, could 
challenge any of the super-featherweight champions but wants to face the best 
of them, James Leija. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It would be a mandatory defense against the No. 1 contender for Leija, who was 
impressive winning the title from Azumah Nelson. . . .  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Danielle Scott of Long Beach State, who was named national volleyball player 
of the year and led the Big West Conference in rebounding, will participate in 
the long jump, high jump and triple jump and run anchor for the 49ers' 
400-meter relay team in the conference meet this week at New Mexico State. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 The absence of a $1-million bonus to the horse who does best under a point 
system in the Triple Crown races has made some decisions to skip the Preakness 
easier. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 However, Go For Gin still has a chance to win a $5-million bonus for sweeping 
the Kentucky Derby, Preakness and Belmont Stakes. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Charlie Whittingham on Strodes Creek, who is skipping the Preakness after a 
second-place finish in the Derby: "Before the year is over, he'll be the best 
horse racing -- without a doubt." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy Croll, the trainer of badly beaten Derby favorite Holy Bull, couldn't 
leave Churchill Downs soon enough last Saturday. A parking attendant locked the 
keys in Croll's car. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Nick Vachon, the 21-year-old son of King executive Rogie Vachon, was the No. 1 
draft pick of the L.A. Blades of Roller Hockey International. He played center 
for the Tampa Bay Lightning's Knoxville, Tenn., farm club this season. . . .

 Pavel Bure is the most exciting player in hockey. . . .

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; WALLACH DRAWS HIGH PRAISE FROM CLAIRE 
</P>

<P>
 Third baseman Tim Wallach has the highest ranking a player can have, according 
to Executive Vice President Fred Claire. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a gamer," Claire said."The other day in Montreal his thumb was all cut 
up when he took a ball off of it, and he wouldn't even go in and have it looked 
at. He didn't even want anybody to know about it.  
</P>
<P>
 "As far as examples go, you can't find anybody better than Wallach and Brett 
Butler. The way they prepare for a game, take care of themselves, they are both 
gamers." 
</P>
<P>
 Butler, 36, has been on base with a hit or walk in all but one game this 
season and needs four hits to reach 2,000. Wallach, 36, is the only Dodger to 
start every game this season. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Former Dodger shortstop Bill Russell is the bench coach, but he works with 
infield coach Joe Amalfitano and pays particular attention to Jose Offerman. 
</P>
<P>
 Offerman, in his third season as the Dodger shortstop, is fielding better than 
in the past. After 34 games last season he had nine errors. This season, he has 
four. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think maturity is the main reason he is fielding better," Russell said. 
"The last couple of years have been tough for him. " MARYANN HUDSON

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; PEREZ MIGHT NOT NEED WRIST SURGERY

 Angel first baseman Eduardo Perez probably will not require surgery on his 
left wrist, according to Dr. Lewis Yocum, who Wednesday injected cortisone into 
the wrist in an attempt to curb the inflammation. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez still believes he will have to be placed on the 15-day disabled list, 
retroactive to May 5, but the Angels will wait until Friday before deciding. If 
they think Perez will be ready to play next week, the Angels are expected to 
call up utilityman Mark Dalesandro. If it will be longer than a week, first 
baseman J.T. Snow will join the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know everybody's yelling and screaming for J.T. Snow," Angel Manager Buck 
Rodgers said, "but we've got a guy hitting .370, and I'm not in a real hurry 
moving Jim Edmonds out of there for anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Yocum, who previously administered a CAT scan and magnetic resonance imaging 
test on Perez's hand, has already given two cortisone shots to Perez in the 
last 10 days. Perez has missed seven consecutive games, and will be unable to 
swing a bat until at least Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has worn triangular cartilage in there," Yocum said, "but we don't see a 
sign of significant damage. Who knows, maybe he could play the rest of his life 
with it. (Former Oakland third baseman) Carney Lansford did it for years. It 
just depends how he well he can adjust." 
</P>
<P>
 If surgery becomes necessary to repair the cartilage damage, Yocum said Perez 
would be sidelined six to eight weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll see how (Perez) reacts to the shot," Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi 
said. "But if it's still hurting, we'll probably have to get another player. 
The likely guy right now is J.T., but we'll see." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Although reliever Bill Sampen said Tuesday night that he did not want to 
accept his assignment to Vancouver, Bavasi said Wednesday that Sampen has no 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampen still has an option left in his $240,000 contract, and according to the 
Basic Agreement, he does not have the right to decline the assignment without 
being suspended. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew it was a strong possibility that he'd accept free agency if he had 
that right, but he doesn't," Bavasi said. "We're glad because he has a good arm 
and we want to keep him." 
</P>
<P>
 "That stinks when decisions are made like that," Sampen said. "I really felt 
this would be a good opportunity. It's frustrating as much as anything. It just 
gets old. The last two years I've been looking for the luxury to fail, and I 
just haven't had that luxury."

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE MAJORS; BROWNING WON'T NEED SURGERY ON ARM

 Cincinnati Red pitcher Tom Browning won't need surgery on his broken left arm. 
</P>
<P>
 Browning's arm broke as he threw a pitch Monday night in a 3-2 victory in San 
Diego.He was examined in Cincinnati by Dr. Scott Jolson, who decided the break 
would heal without surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 The Reds say it's possible Browning could pitch again late in the season if 
the arm heals quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 The injury leaves Browning with an uncertain future, even if he completely 
recovers. Browning, 34, is in the final year of a four-year, $11.9-million 
contract that contains an option year for 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The left-hander would have automatically gotten another year at $3.5 million 
if he pitched in 200 innings this season or the Reds traded him. Instead, the 
Reds can buy out the option year for $583,333.

he will try to strengthen the shoulder through exercises before opting for 
surgery, which would sideline him six to nine months. BOB NIGHTENGALE

INDIANAPOLIS 500 / DAILY REPORT; UNSER PASSES MICHIGAN TEST, GETS UP TO 226.478

 The first four days of practice for the May 29 Indianapolis 500 have been the 
safest in the track's history. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventy cars have been driven 6,930 laps -- 17,325 miles -- at speeds up to 
230 m.p.h. with only one minor accident. That occurred when Mike Groff's car 
slid in a patch of oil and hit the wall last Monday. The car, a Lola-Honda, 
suffered minor damage and Groff escaped with a bruised foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Windy conditions kept speeds down Wednesday as Al Unser Jr. recorded the 
fastest lap, 226.478 m.p.h., in one of Roger Penske's Mercedes-Benz-powered 
cars. That was well below the 230.403 posted Tuesday by Raul Boesel, in a 
Lola-Ford Cosworth. 
</P>
<P>
 Unser credited the quick lap to running 520 miles in a test Sunday at Michigan 
International Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been really, really important for us to run up there," Unser said. "It 
has helped us coming here. I've heard what people are saying (about 
sandbagging), but the Marlboro Penske is not locked in for the pole. We need to 
get the car around the corners to go quick. You can have all the horsepower in 
the world, but you've still got to get around the corners." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Brayton, in a Lola-Menard, was fastest Sunday, followed by Michael 
Andretti's Reynard-Ford Cosworth on Monday, Boesel on Tuesday and Unser on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Pole qualifying is Saturday.

 When Bobby Rahal practiced in his Honda-powered Lola, it was the first time a 
Japanese manufacturer had participated in the Indy 500, but it was not the 
first Japanese involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiro Matsushita was the first to drive in the 500 in 1991. The late Takio 
(Chickie) Hirashima, a California-born Japanese, was a riding mechanic for 
George Robson's winning car in 1946 and also was in charge of Autolite's Indy 
spark-plug program in the '70s.

 Johnny Parsons, an 11-time 500 starter and a former Los Angeles policeman, has

The engine is a 209-cubic-inch model similar to Penske's Ilmor Mercedes power 
plants.

MOTOR RACING / SHAV GLICK: PARKER HOPES TO MAKE HISTORY AT POMONA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scott Parker, four-time American Motorcyclist Assn. Grand National dirt-track 
champion from Swartz Creek, Mich., wants to be the first rider to win five 
flat-track championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker broke out of a yearlong slump two weeks ago to win the Sacramento Mile, 
and he hopes the momentum will carry over to Saturday night's national 
half-mile at the Pomona Fairplex. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm excited about getting back to Pomona," he said. "I've won a bunch there 
before, and winning at Sacramento helps my motivation in getting ready this 
week." 
</P>
<P>
 Parker moved from seventh place to pass 1992 champion Chris Carr with two laps 
to go and won by about 18 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those last two laps at Sacramento, I held on as hard as I could," Parker 
said. "I think I proved to my fans and myself that I'm back." 
</P>
<P>
 Parker won four national titles from 1988 to 1991, riding a Harley-Davidson. 
He won the spring race at Pomona in 1991 and in 1992 won the spring and fall 
races. Only Carroll Resweber, who won four AMA titles from 1958 to 1961, has 
won as many as Parker. 
</P>
<P>
 After two races this season, Carr leads with 36 points, followed by Terry 
Poovey with 25 and Parker with 20. Carr won the season opener at Daytona Beach, 
Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been racing professionally since 1979, but I think I've still got some 
more wins left," Parker, 32, said. "The motor's running real good, so I think 
I'm good for two or three more years. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I'm at a beautiful track, I love it and wouldn't think of quitting. 
Then, when I'm at a lousy track, I wonder what I'm doing there." 
</P>
<P>
 The AMA is instituting a new qualifying procedure at Pomona. Instead of 
individual time trials, six four-lap heats will determine the fields for four 
10-lap semifinal heats. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be interesting at Pomona, where you can ride high or ride low, but on 
one-groove tracks it will be a problem. You could get a bad start in your heat 
and in only four laps you might not get to the front. Pomona is a good track to 
work with, though, so it should work out fine." 
</P>
<P>
 The last time Parker was at Pomona last October, he crashed during practice 
and sat out the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Ricky Graham, who won a record 12 races, including the October race at Pomona, 
in winning the championship last year, is not expected to ride at Pomona 
because he is recuperating from injuries suffered while trail riding before the 
Sacramento race. 
</P>
<P>

LOS ALAMITOS; SALES MAY BOOST ARABIAN RACING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODY BERGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Race-ready Arabian horses will be on the auction block Sunday at Los Alamitos, 
and everyone concerned is hoping the sale leads to more races and stronger 
fields -- immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos offers the most Arabian races and the richest purses, but still 
trainers note small fields, especially at the beginning of each meeting. Equest 
International, the only exclusively Arabian sales company, came up with this 
sale to combat the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a minimum of eight races a week and we're having trouble filling 
them," trainer Bryan Braithwaite said. "This sale should mean a lot. It will 
spread 30 horses around, and they could each run three times a month." 
</P>
<P>
 All 30 are ready to run and many already have. At the most recent Arabian 
sale, prices averaged $16,000 and topped at $47,250. A founder of the sales 
company, Randall Gault, expects this sale to do better.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's an emerging business," he said. "It parallels what happened in the 
thoroughbred market 20 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Gault added that he expects quarter horse and thoroughbred owners to be among 
the bidders, as well as representatives of many royal families from the United 
Arab Emirates. 
</P>
<P>
 The Maktoum brothers of Dubai, who are also active thoroughbred owners, the 
Zayed brothers of Abu Dhabi and the Al Thani family of Qatar are major buyers 
in the emerging Arabian market. Although their presence has been a boon to 
sellers and breeders, their involvement also caused instability in the 
fledgling domestic racing scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Only available on the fair circuit in this country until recently, Arabian 
racing usually meant a competition of unsuccessful show horses. The breed got a 
boost in 1990 when legislation changed and Ed Allred, owner of Los Alamitos, 
started Arabian racing in Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
 The breed is also gaining popularity in Delaware, Colorado, Michigan and 
Texas. The number of horses registered to race increased 50% in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are just now starting to get serious," Braithwaite said. "There's 
enough money now for people to breed for the races. They're not just taking 
show horses that weren't quite good enough. For the first time we're breeding 
race runners to race runners." 
</P>
<P>
 And the results are clear. Braithwaite trained the 1987 champion, who ran six 
furlongs in 1:20. Now the track record is 1:17 2/5 and horses routinely run 
1:18. 
</P>
<P>
 But as American racing started to grow, sheiks from the United Arab Emirates 
decided to build a racing circuit in their countries and shopped for horses in 
the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
 "They bought all the horses two years ago," Braithwaite said. "People had 
$10,000 claimers that they got $35,000 for." 
</P>
<P>
 The royal families also have been active in the thoroughbred market, but 
because the Arabian market is so much smaller, the results were more dramatic. 
In 1993, five of the top 10 California runners were owned by sheiks Falah 
Zayed, Tahnoon Bin Zayed or Mansoor Zayed. Another is owned by Qarn Racing of 
Qatar. When the California racing season ended in December, many horses were 
shipped overseas. Because of the 60-day quarantine, few return to race. 
</P>
<P>
 And the opportunity for American owners to sell for export continues. Three 
weeks ago, one of the largest Arabian breeders, Jim Wagner's Colonial Ridge in 
Indiana, sold 78 horses to one of the Maktoums.  
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos trainers have about 250 horses on the grounds now but still 
cannot fill more than a couple of races a night with six-horse fields. And few 
of the horses are familiar to fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Braithwaite has 24 in his barn and 23 are maidens. Barbara Jagoda, one of the 
top five trainers from 1993, has 10 horses, and six are maidens. They estimate 
that 80% of the horses on the grounds are new since last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the sheiks' involvement keeps jolting the growing racing circuit, the 
long-term effects are expected to be positive. The influx of money has 
encouraged more breeding of Arabian racehorses and improved the breed. And 
Gault, of Equest International, sees the royal connection as a continuing boost 
to the breeding business. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have good racing programs over there and breeding programs are getting 
started," he said. "They're going to send their mares to American stallions, so 
it's coming around, starting to help on both ends." 
</P>
<P>
 Sales barns will be open Friday and Saturday and a training preview is 
scheduled for Saturday at 11 a.m. The auction begins at noon on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Jagoda's Magna Terra Smoky will probably be the favorite in the Equest 
International California Open on Friday. With each race, the one-eyed gelding 
proves tougher than his rivals, and the seven-furlong race, worth about 
$12,500, gives him another opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 A three-time Arabian Racing Assn. of California horse of the year, Magna Terra 
Smoky is also favored to win the 1993 Arabian title, which will be announced at 
the ARAC annual awards dinner Saturday night.  
</P>
<P>
 Bits And Pieces, owned by Falah Zayed and trained by Don Collins, is a threat 
in the Equest International California Distaff to be run at seven furlongs 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 In her last start May 1, Bits And Pieces romped to a 19 1/2-length victory in 
only a 4 1/2-furlong race. Her time of 57 seconds was only two-fifths of a 
second off the track record. 
</P>
<P>
 Bits and Pieces will have to race three-time national champion Fryga -- she 
was top 3-year-old in 1990, top 4-year-old in 1991 and top older mare last year 
-- and PS Crystal Sage, who won the California Girls Handicap at Los Alamitos 
in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Make Mine Bud, trained by Blane Schvaneveldt, scored his second quarter horse 
stakes victory of the year last Saturday, leading wire to wire in the $40,000 
Spencer Childers California Handicap. Owned by Bobby Cox and Herb Graham, Make 
Mine Bud ran his record to eight victories in 12 starts and his earnings to 
$74,834. Four Forty Blast, installed as the morning line favorite at 7-5, was 
scratched because of a high fever. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Diddy Wa Diddy defeated Stellar Trux by 2 1/2 lengths in winning the War 
Chic Handicap on Friday. The winning time for the 870-yard race was 45.17 
seconds. . . . The handle at Los Alamitos topped $2.5 million for the 29 races 
offered Saturday. The track supplemented its 12 live races with nine simulcasts 
from Hollywood Park, two from Golden Gate Fields and five from Churchill Downs 
on Kentucky Derby day. A crowd of 9,100 attended the afternoon simulcasts and 
6,537 were on hand for the live races.

THOROUGHBRED RACING; LESS MAY BE MORE IN THE LONG RUN FOR LOCAL TRACKS

 Santa Anita officials are studying the possibility of conducting races four 
days a week instead of five or reducing the number of daily live races from 
nine to eight in an attempt to alleviate horse shortages that led to small 
fields during the most recent meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to look at it from top to bottom and from everybody's perspective 
(including the California Horse Racing Board and horsemen)," said Mark 
Stephens, Santa Anita's director of marketing. "Conceptually, several of us all 
think that fewer, more quality programs would do more good for the sport. The 
goal of this is bigger fields. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have to work from everybody's perspective. If we didn't have the 
cooperation of all three major entities, it wouldn't happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Track President Cliff Goodrich said Santa Anita isn't alone among local tracks 
in its thinking. "(This concept) is in the air," he said. "We're exploring this 
idea because we're trying to do everything we can to improve the quality of the 
product. 
</P>
<P>
 "The quality of the product is our foremost concern. A reduction of dates is 
one of the ways the quality can be improved and there are many other ways as 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 Less racing would result in larger fields, which would lead to increased 
handles. Races with six horses or fewer are unattractive to bettors and, 
because of a shrinking horse supply and a staggering number of racing dates 
(281 on the local thoroughbred circuit this year), they have become more 
common. The problem was evident at the end of Santa Anita's 90-day 
winter-spring meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans being considered include five-day weeks with eight-race cards and 
four-day weeks with nine races on two weekdays and 10 races on the weekends. 
The first proposal would decrease the number of weekly races from 45 to 40; the 
latter to 38. 
</P>
<P>
 With a four-day week, Santa Anita would probably run Wednesday, Friday, 
Saturday and Sunday, Thursday-Sunday or Friday-Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Off the top of my head, the most attractive would be Wednesday, Friday, 
Saturday and Sunday," Stephens said. "It would set Wednesday aside, you could 
have a stakes race that day and (the dark day on Thursday) would also help 
Friday." 
</P>
<P>
 R.D. Hubbard, Hollywood Park's chief operating officer, has campaigned for 
fewer dates in the past and last year the track concluded its fall meeting on 
Dec. 20, rather than Christmas Eve as before. 
</P>
<P>
 Del Mar, which begins its seven-week season on July 27, has also discussed 
cutting back to eight races a day. There are no changes planned for the 
upcoming meeting, said Dan Smith, the track's director of media and marketing,  
</P>
<P>
 Del Mar, which will apply for its 1994 license at the CHRB meeting later this 
month, will follow its normal Wednesday-Monday schedule with nine live races a 
day.

 Trainer David Bernstein and owner Phil Hersh will not run The Wicked North in 
the $150,000 Mervyn LeRoy Handicap on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's top handicap horse will wait for the $300,000 Californian on June 
5 before coming back in the $750,000 Hollywood Gold Cup on July 2. 
</P>
<P>
 "We only nominated him (to the LeRoy) because he was doing so well," Bernstein 
said. "But after looking at the situation, we've decided to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "First of all, it would have been his third race in seven weeks, and he also 
has a minor skin infection that he picked up back East. It isn't a serious 
thing, and he hasn't missed any training because of it. We're treating him with 
antibiotics and he's fine. He'll work again Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Gold Cup is our major objective. The overall program just adds up to 
running in the Californian and then the Gold Cup." 
</P>
<P>
 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Patchy Groundfog, who was the last horse Bill Shoemaker rode on Feb. 3, 1990, 
will run for the first time since June 24, 1991 in today's fifth race, a 
$32,000 claimer at 5 1/2 furlongs. The 11-year-old son of Instrument Landing, 
who has earned more than $700,000 in a 67-race career, will be ridden by Corey 
Black. . . . Jockey Corey Nakatani, who broke an ankle in a spill at Santa 
Anita on April 2, will return to riding on May 18, according to agent Bob 
Meldahl. . . . The match race between Lazor and Soviet Problem at Golden Gate 
Fields will be shown between the sixth and seventh races today at Hollywood 
Park. . . . Valiant Nature, who nearly fell on the first turn of the Kentucky 
Derby, then finished 13th, is expected back at Hollywood Park today. . . . Soul 
Of The Matter, who finished a troubled fifth in the Derby, returned Tuesday and 
he could race again in the Affirmed Handicap on July 2 and the Swaps on July 
23.

 NO STRINGS: When Elvis Costello toured last year playing his own brand of 
chamber music with a classical ensemble, the Brodsky Quartet, he couldn't fit 
Orange County into his plans. . . . The witty, hard-edged English rocker will 
be at Irvine Meadows on Saturday (OC Live!), but hold the violins -- this time, 
Costello has reunited with his original, hard-charging backup trio, the 
Attractions. It's their first tour together since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 COLOR THEM GONE: Orange County Fair officials were proud they had snared pop 
music's Color Me Badd as their opening night act for this year's fair run, July 
8-24. Alas, they just found out that the group's members have decided to focus 
their energies on the recording studio: They've canceled all their public 
appearances the rest of the year. . . . "We're crushed," says fair spokeswoman 
Jill Lloyd. "But we hope to have a new opening act before the end of the week." 
</P>
<P>
 CHECKING IN: Who guitarist Pete Townshend, creator of the rock opera "Tommy" 
(F1), was at the musical Wednesday at Orange County Performing Arts Center's 
Segerstrom Hall. A spokesman says Townshend isn't regularly in the audience but 
likes to drop by as a quality-control measure. . . . The hall, by the way, is 
getting raves from the show's director, Des McAnuff. "I really like the feel of 
that house," he says. "For 'Tommy' especially, you need a big sound, and in a 
big space like Segerstrom you can get it."  
</P>
<P>
 PURE COUNTRY: The Buena Park Cultural Arts Foundation wanted someone really 
big to headline a fund-raiser for its long-planned Community Arts Center. It 
didn't take long to decide on Merle Haggard. Tickets for tonight's event at 
Knott's Berry Farm range from $20 to $100. . . . KIK-FM deejay Brian Cowan will 
introduce Haggard and admits that "this is very exciting for me." He says of 
Haggard: "He's the only true living legend in country music. He has the 
defining sound that is country music."

 QUAKE LOANS: A $30-million federal program aimed at combatting the urban 
blight caused by apartment owners abandoning their earthquake-damaged buildings 
will be announced today. (B4) . . . The program will provide the landlords who 
can't otherwise qualify for funding with low-interest loans for rebuilding. The 
first allocations will go to neighborhoods in Granada Hills, Northridge, Van 
Nuys and Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 WAR OF THE WORDS: The makers of Scrabble got heat from national civil rights 
groups for words in their official dictionary deemed offensive. "They 
perpetuated negative stereotypes," said Mary Krasn, director of the Valley's 
Anti-Defamation League chapter. . . . Well, the words are coming out, and now 
some players object. "We're only playing letter combinations," said Deborah 
Sapot, a member of a Granada Hills Scrabble club.

 HOLDING SERVE: Pierce College changed tennis coaches this year, but it hasn't 
changed traditions. Winning is still what it serves best. Pierce (21-1), ranked 
second in the state, will face Los Altos Foothill today for the state 
championship. . . . New coach Aris Hovsepian, above, has replaced the legendary 
Paul Xanthos (C10). 
</P>
<P>
 NEAR DISASTER: Jason Gore almost needed CPR right there on the golf course. 
No, this was not a sudden stroke -- it was more like a sudden choke. He was 
slowly throwing away a safe three-shot lead on the final hole of a big college 
golf tournament last week. . . . But Gore, an Arizona sophomore who went to 
Hart High in Newhall, somehow saved himself and won a playoff (C12). 
</P>
<P>
 SECURITY: General Motors will put $10 billion in cash and stock into its 
pension fund, which certainly pleases the White House (A1). . . . The 
announcement also makes GM retirees a little more secure, including some who 
worked at the former Van Nuys plant. "I know they have the money to keep paying 
me," said Ray Knudson, trustee of United Auto Workers Local 645. Michael Arkush

LEWIS PULLER JR.; PULITZER-WINNING WRITER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lewis B. Puller Jr., a disabled Vietnam War veteran who wrote a Pulitzer 
Prize-winning autobiography, committed suicide Wednesday. He was 48. 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Massie, a spokeswoman for George Mason University, where Puller was in 
his second year as a writer-in-residence, said that Puller killed himself. A 
family friend who spoke on condition of anonymity said Puller shot himself, but 
Fairfax County police would only say that they were investigating a death at 
Puller's residence. 
</P>
<P>
 Puller was the son of the most highly decorated Marine in U.S. history, Gen. 
Lewis (Chesty) Puller. 
</P>
<P>
 His book, "Fortunate Son: The Healing of a Vietnam Vet," is about his life 
with his father, his Vietnam experiences and his struggle with depression and 
alcoholism after the war. The book won the Pulitzer Prize in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Puller served as a combat platoon leader in Vietnam until he stepped on an 
enemy land mine in 1968. The explosion tore away his legs and parts of both 
hands. He was awarded the Silver Star, two Purple Hearts, the Navy Commendation 
Medal and the Vietnam Cross of Gallantry. 
</P>
<P>
 He returned to Vietnam in August for the first time since the war, and said he 
was overwhelmed when he met disabled Vietnamese veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here I am, sitting on an NVA (North Vietnam Army) soldier's bed with him," he 
said. "You know, our stumps are all tangled up. It was incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 Don M. Boileau, chairman of George Mason's communications department, said he 
received a handwritten note from Puller on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very precise note regarding students' grading," Boileau said. "In 
retrospect, he was wrapping things up. It was very thoughtful. He obviously put 
a lot into it." 
</P>
<P>
 Puller's wife, Linda T. (Toddy) Puller, was notified of her husband's death in 
Richmond. A state legislator, she was attending a special session of the 
General Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 "To the list of names of victims of the Vietnam War, add the name of Lewis 
Puller," she said in a statement Wednesday night. "He suffered terrible wounds 
that never really healed." 
</P>
<P>
 Puller was a 1963 graduate of Christchurch School in Saluda, Va. After 
Vietnam, he attended law school at the College of William and Mary. He worked 
as a lawyer at the Defense Department before taking a leave of absence to teach 
at George Mason. 
</P>
<P>
 Puller ran unsuccessfully for Congress in eastern Virginia's 1st District in 
1978. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1992 graduation speech at Christchurch School, Puller told the students 
he was proof that life offered second, third and even fourth chances. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time I graduated from college, I had flunked out of one school and was 
on academic and disciplinary probation at another," Puller said. "I was also 
well on my way to being an out-of-control alcoholic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not proud of any of this, and I readily acknowledge that most of my 
problems, most of my misfortunes, were of my own making."

AROUND THE VALLEY / JOCELYN Y. STEWART: CANOGA PARK SCHOOL HAS GOLDEN WAYS TO 
RECOGNIZE STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A nd the winner s are . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Jonathan Ajar who wins free doughnuts. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Alexis Betton-Schinck who wins a free stuffed dog. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Thi Thu Hoang who wins an 'early-to-lunch' pass. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so it's not exactly the Academy Awards or the Grammies, but to students at 
John A. Sutter Middle School in Canoga Park this may be the next best thing. 
</P>
<P>
 They get their names read over the PA system for the whole school to hear; 
they get pats on the back from friends and teachers, and they get a prize. 
</P>
<P>
 When you're in middle school, it really doesn't get much better than this. 
</P>
<P>
 Each Thursday morning in Gold Rush, what was known in the old days as 
"homeroom," Sutter students sit at their desks, listening intently as school 
officials call off the week's list of winners. 
</P>
<P>
 The accomplishments that have brought them this fame and (albeit small) 
fortune? 
</P>
<P>
 Making it to school on time every day, turning in homework, picking up trash 
on the school grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 In the eyes of Jim Avallone, Sutter's assistant principal, this behavior 
merits recognition, a pat on the back, "a plain ol' 'atta boy.' " Or "atta 
girl." 
</P>
<P>
 "We need more 'atta boys' in the schools," Avallone said. "Students need 
positive reinforcement." 
</P>
<P>
 Avallone, a man brimming with ideas, enthusiasm and optimism, has a ready 
"atta boy" fixed on his lips. If first impressions are correct, Avallone still 
believes in his ability to make a positive difference in the lives of kids and 
still gets excited about discovering new ways to do just that. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sutter Gold Club is one of his ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan is simple: teachers and counselors take note of students exhibiting 
good behavior, and the students receive coupons that allow them a chance to win 
prizes at a drawing each week. Those students whose names are selected walk 
away with the prizes. 
</P>
<P>
 In a district strapped for cash, the most difficult part is finding ways to 
reward the students, so Avallone and others at the school have turned to 
private businesses for help. 
</P>
<P>
 "My philosophy is, it doesn't hurt to ask, all they can do is say no," he 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 He knocks on doors, he calls, he writes letters. Multimillion dollar 
corporations and mom-and-pop businesses -- they're all the same, the way 
Avallone sees it. Everyone can give a little something. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd be surprised, there are companies that want to help. . . . I really 
feel the community is looking for a way to connect with the schools but 
sometimes they either don't take the initiative or they don't know how to make 
the connection." 
</P>
<P>
 Avallone really doesn't ask for much. A free meal from a restaurant, a free 
haircut from a barbershop, a free tape from a record store. The cost to most 
merchants is negligible, and from participating they sometimes learn something 
about students.  
</P>
<P>
 When Sutter students visit businesses to redeem the certificates, merchants 
quickly see that not all teen-agers and pre-teen-agers are taggers lying in 
wait to graffiti their businesses and property. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can see we've got some good students," Avallone said. 
</P>
<P>
 And to the students, the inexpensive gifts can make a world of a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it's hard for us to understand," Avallone said. "These little 
things mean so much to a student." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Avallone is realistic about the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to say it reaches every single child and gets them to do 
everything we want them to do," he said. "For some it works, for some it 
doesn't. The sixth-graders tend to respond more." 
</P>
<P>
 For those who do respond, the gifts speak a message that can benefit students 
of all ages: Someone is watching when they achieve -- as well as when they fail 
-- and there is a consequence for both. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the Gold Club -- the PA announcements, certificates and gifts -- 
Sutter faculty members have given students the kind of recognition that boosts 
young egos and fosters pride, said Marie Claire Henneman, coordinator for the 
English as a Second Language program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need it, you need it, we all need it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brook Franklin, a polite sixth-grader with pretty brown eyes and a warm smile, 
is a Gold Club winner. Standing in the office after picking up her prize, she 
helped explain why more students are getting to class on time and behaving 
better since the Gold Club started.  
</P>
<P>
 "If they get something for it, it makes them want to come to school more," she 
said, holding the Dodger yearbook/program she won for being on time to class 
three weeks straight. "It makes me feel I should come to school every day on 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 And the recognition helps too. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very exciting getting your name called -- even if it is wrong," said a 
smiling Shadi Halavi, after correcting Avallone's pronunciation of her name. 
</P>
<P>
 Students like Brook; Paul Vincente, who announced that he felt "pretty good" 
after winning a sports video, and Isis Nix, another winner, will probably 
remember the prizes and their moments of acclaim -- however brief. In some 
small way, it may help shape the way they act in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Avallone and his colleagues at Sutter know that, and perhaps that is why they 
work so hard searching for ways to keep students motivated, to help them 
maintain a positive attitude toward school and learning. 
</P>
<P>
 And that is why Avallone and the others are always on the lookout for new ways 
to reward the students -- even in the middle of an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a good one," Avallone declares in a voice bright with excitement. 
"The Los Angeles Times provides the buses and the kids go on a trip to see The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
 "They see printing presses and things they've never seen before! They have 
lunch there in your cafeteria! That'd be great! How about it?"

DIGEST: CLU'S HARPER TO PULL BRIEF DOUBLE DUTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Football Coach Joe Harper will be interim athletic director at Cal Lutheran 
effective June 1, the school announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran will hire a permanent replacement in the fall after conducting a 
national search over the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper, 57, succeeds Bob Doering, who in March announced his resignation as 
athletic director and chairman of the university's physical education 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper has been Cal Lutheran's football coach the past four years, posting a 
15-24 record, including a 5-4 mark last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Before coming to Cal Lutheran, Harper worked five years in private business. 
He was football coach at Northern Arizona from 1982-84 after spending the 
previous 14 years at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. Harper had a 96-43-3 record at 
Cal Poly from 1968-81, and he was the school's athletic director from 1968-73. 
</P>
<P>
 Doering, the Cal Lutheran athletic director for 14 years, is taking a 
sabbatical next fall. He is expected to return to the school in the spring as a 
part-time instructor. 
</P>
<P>
 Nena Amundson, a long-time Cal Lutheran instructor, was selected to replace 
Doering as chairman of the physical education department. Basketball 
</P>

 Joey Ramirez, Ventura College point guard who committed to play at Pepperdine 
next season but backed off when Coach Tom Asbury resigned to coach at Kansas 
State, has signed with the Waves after all, Ventura Coach Philip Mathews said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez, a 5-foot-10 sophomore from Santa Paula High, decided to attend 
Pepperdine after talking to Tony Fuller, the school's newly appointed coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Ramirez) likes Fuller," Mathews said. "It'll be good for him. Tony needs a 
point guard and he really wanted Joey." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez, the Western State Conference North Division co-player of the year 
with teammate Brandon Jessie, averaged 15.9 points 5.7 assists during the 
1993-94 regular season. Baseball

designated hitter Chris Fick. 
</P>
<P>
 Arroyo, a senior from Buena High, has a record of 8-1 with a save. He was 5-1 
with a 2.49 ERA in SCIAC games. Weiss, a junior transfer from Cal State Los 
Angeles, is 9-1 and was 6-0 with a 2.70 ERA in conference games. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, Sebbo, Becker and Fick batted better than .400 in SCIAC games. Fick 
had nine home runs and 35 runs batted in; Sebbo had three homers and 34 RBIs; 
Becker added six home runs and 19 RBIs; and Wilson had 19 stolen bases and 
scored 34 runs.

Coaches' Assn. NCAA Division III poll after losing, 11-9, to Pomona Pitzer in 
the final of the SCIAC tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran (29-6-1) will learn Sunday whether it has been invited to play in 
the best-of-five NCAA Division III West Regional, beginning May 20. The 
Kingsmen are ranked second in the West region behind UC San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 The Master's College catcher Jeff Tomlinson was selected to the All-NAIA

COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: 2 MATADORS MISS OUT ON HOME GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chad Thornhill and John Najar have more in common than their disabled right 
arms. 
</P>
<P>
 Najar, out for the season with a broken bone in his forearm, and Thornhill, 
sidelined indefinitely with a broken bone in his elbow, both won't play in this 
weekend's sink-or-swim Western Athletic Conference series at Fresno State. 
</P>
<P>
 Both know the territory, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Najar attended Fresno State for two years before transferring to Northridge in 
1992-93. Thornhill, who played high school and junior college ball in Fresno, 
played several all-star and summer-league games on Fresno State's Beiden Field. 
</P>
<P>
 For Thornhill, so much for playing before family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shoot, I wouldn't have minded if they'd booed me," Thornhill said. "Just to 
hear them (at all)." 
</P>
<P>
 For Najar, so much for getting even. He pitched 3 2/3 innings in two years 
wearing a Bulldog uniform. What's more, Najar is 0-2 against Fresno State since 
he became a Matador. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guess I'll just have to beat them next year," Najar said. 
</P>
<P>
 Najar and Thornhill are juniors. Outfielder Kevin Howard, who also played his 
high school and junior college ball in Fresno, is expected to start. 
</P>
<P>
 Entering the final weekend of the regular season, Northridge is tied with 
Fresno State in WAC West Division play at 12-9, one game behind San Diego 
State. Northridge needs to win the divisional title to keep alive any hopes of 
a fourth NCAA playoff berth in as many seasons at the Division I level. CAL 
STATE NORTHRIDGE 
</P>
<P>
 A Painful Walk 
</P>
<P>
 Najar wasn't exactly impressed when he heard the news of Cincinnati Reds' 
pitcher Tom Browning's injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Browning broke his arm while throwing a pitch over the weekend. Najar broke 
his right arm, now encased in a cast, a month ago while throwing a pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the big leagues for you," Najar cracked. "They carry Browning off on a 
stretcher. I had to walk off on my own."

 Quotebook -- From former Cal State Northridge infielder Andy Hodgins, a 
product of Simi Valley High: "They retired my number at Simi. Of course, it was 
also worn by (Chicago White Sox reliever Scott) Radinsky." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Brian Vasey sounded a tad envious. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge utility whiz, drafted into duty as a pitcher because of 
injuries to several teammates, was the losing pitcher in last week's 13-1 
defeat to Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton used four pitchers -- including a freshman to start the game -- and 
each looked strong enough to go the distance. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not like us (having to use position players)," Vasey said. "I'm sure 
they had a few more guys they could have used, too." 
</P>
<P>
 In three games against Fullerton, the Matadors scored six runs. JUNIOR 
COLLEGES

 Playing Through 
</P>
<P>
 College of the Canyons golf Coach Gary Peterson will be delighted when 
Caltrans finishes repairs to the earthquake-damaged stretch of the Golden State 
Freeway near Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
 With easier access to the campus, Peterson figures he can attract more players 
for next season. This year began with a good nucleus, but the ranks diminished 
because of difficulties some players faced in getting to the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I lost three players directly and it was really tough for another (to 
get to the school)," Peterson said. "Hopefully, the reopening of the freeway 
(scheduled for next week) will make it more enticing for the players to come 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 This season, Canyons slipped to third in the Western State Conference with a 
12-8 record after winning the state title in 1993, and did not qualify for the 
Southern California regional. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The freeway) might have had an impact but I don't want to use it as an 
excuse," Peterson said. "But simply to lose the numbers (of players) didn't 
help our program." 
</P>
<P>
 Two freshmen, Julio Cano from Kennedy High and Glen Musser from Alemany High, 
started with the team on Feb. 1 but dropped out when the commuting began to 
wear them down. Cano and his family have since moved to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 "At times they would car-pool, but sometimes they would spend 1 1/2 hours on 
the road, sometimes just one way," Peterson said. "Glen stuck it out a little 
longer, but it became really difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 Another freshman, Paul Muniz from Granada Hills High, was able to complete the 
season and averaged 80.4 strokes. CAL LUTHERAN 
</P>
<P>
 Playoff Snub 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Keisha Davis says she is frustrated, and who can blame her? 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran's softball team did not receive an invitation to the NCAA 
Division III softball playoffs despite a 29-8 record, 23-1 in the Southern 
California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just didn't know what (the NCAA selection committee) wants us to do," Davis 
said. "The girls were heartbroken." 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran had more victories than 12 of the 24 playoff teams and fewer 
losses than 13 of them. 
</P>
<P>
 The playoff teams all come from locales north and east of Iowa. The two 
regionals that included "western" teams had four teams from Iowa, two from 
Minnesota and another from Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis was told by one NCAA official that Cal Lutheran was the victim of a soft 
schedule. Although the Regals were ranked 18th in the final Division III poll, 
the team's "power rating" was weak. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Davis blamed herself. But then she considered the obvious -- under 
the circumstances, Cal Lutheran's schedule could not have been tougher. 
</P>
<P>
 The school's budget doesn't allow the team to travel to the Midwest, 
small-college softball's hotbed. Nor can the school afford to pay for opponents 
to come play at Cal Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting penalized because of our (financial) limitations," Davis said. 
"What can we do but say, 'We had a wonderful season' and try to figure out what 
we can do next year to get in?" 
</P>
<P>
 For its part, the SCIAC is going through the annual formality of filing 
paperwork so that its champion might receive an automatic invitation to the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Another possibility, according to Davis, is that several Southland schools 
will band together to hold a spring tournament and will invite several of the 
nation's top small-college teams to take part. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran should be even stronger next season. Outfielders Laree Reynolds 
and Deborah Clements are the only two Regal regulars who are seniors. Around 
the Campuses . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * Five Cal Lutheran regulars batted better than .400 during the Southern 
California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference softball season. Reynolds led 
the contingent, batting at a .493 clip. She was followed by Heidi Stevens at 
.479, Tracy Little at .476, Shani Smyth at .470 and Aimee Snider at .439. In 24 
conference games, the Regals batted .387 while their opponents were limited to 
a .211 average.

KEEPING TABS / STEVE ELLING: BLOWING LEAD ENABLED GORE TO WIN PAC-10 TITLE IN

 Sure, now he can laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 When former Hart High golfer Jason Gore was wobbling down the 18th fairway in 
the final round of the Pacific 10 Conference men's championship last week, he 
wasn't exactly enjoying the ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore, a sophomore at Arizona, held a three-stroke lead in the individual 
tournament before the 18th hole in the fourth and final round at Tucson 
National Resort and Conference Center. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't exactly slam the door. In fact, he almost experienced severe 
esophageal constriction, swallowed his Adam's apple and forgot how to breathe. 
</P>
<P>
 "They rolled me around on the ground and did CPR," Gore cracked. "I was trying 
to get the throw-up off my shirt." 
</P>
<P>
 Gore triple-bogeyed the hole to force a three-way sudden-death playoff at 
one-under-par 287. 
</P>
<P>
 He managed to shake off the near-disaster, however, and won the title with 
consecutive pars on two playoff holes. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore, who turns 20 on May 17, came close to experiencing sudden death on the 
72nd hole. Perhaps his lively sense of humor saved him. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore, who won the Pac-10 individual championship as a freshman, was unsure of 
the extent of his lead as he teed off on No. 18, but by the time he reached the 
green, he had a pretty good idea that he had all but thrown the title into the 
deep blue yonder. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's water to the left and water to the right," he said of the hole, a 
difficult par-4. "It's basically nothing but water and fairway." 
</P>
<P>
 Care to guess where the ball wound up? Gore was three-under for the round when 
he teed off, yet he gave it all back at the 18th. Gore almost gave back his 
title as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing in the final threesome of the day, Gore hit his tee shot into the 
water, a four-iron into a bunker and still wasn't on the green after five 
shots. Finally, after chipping to within five feet, he holed a left-to-right 
slider for a triple-bogey. 
</P>
<P>
 A knee-knocker? You bet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Especially when it's for a seven," he joked. 
</P>
<P>
 For Gore, the playoff was nothing new. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1993 Pac-10 championships, Gore edged All-American Todd Demsey of 
Arizona State on the second playoff hole. On the second hole of last year's 
playoff, Gore missed the green with his approach shot, but somehow salvaged par 
to close out the playoff when Demsey made a bogey. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got it up and down from where Jesus left his sandals," Gore cracked. 
</P>
<P>
 Amen. Gore is the first player to win consecutive Pac-10 championships since 
Mike Peck of Stanford in 1977-78. Scott Simpson of USC, who plays on the PGA 
Tour, won back-to-back titles in 1975-76. Next spring, Gore will attempt to 
become the first player to win three in a row since Sherman Finger of USC in 
1964-66. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore, a big hitter, fired rounds of 74-74-68-72 at difficult Tucson National, 
which is rated 74.9 from the championship tees. 
</P>
<P>
 The team will have a few more cracks at No. 18 next week: Gore and his Arizona 
teammates will play in the NCAA Division I West Regional May 19-21 at Tucson 
National. 
</P>
<P>
 Checking the fax: In baseball, Pepperdine's Erik Martinez (North 
Hollywood/Pierce) ranks second on the team in batting (.313) and stolen bases 
(21). Teammate Jason Cohen (El Camino Real/Pierce) is batting .295. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman Jeff Tagliaferri (Kennedy) has a .315 average and ranks second on the 
team in doubles (15) at Long Beach State. . . . David Jacobs (Calabasas) has 
been a bright spot for Cornell (11-23) with a .395 on-base percentage, 
second-best on the team. His .278 batting average ranks fourth. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 At Michigan State, sophomore catcher Mike Andry (Chaminade) has had to fight 
for playing time. He has 13 at-bats and a .231 average in 10 games for the 
Spartans (21-23), who have used 30 players. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Westmont junior outfielder Dan Gray (Glendale/Canyons) carries a .319 average 
and leads the team in home runs (six), runs batted in (43) and slugging 
percentage (.513). He was an honorable-mention choice on the All-NAIA District 
3 team announced this week. Teammate Chris Ferebee (Montclair Prep) is batting 
.294 in limited play as a freshman, and junior infielder Greg Thompson 
(Alemany/UC Santa Barbara) is batting .293 with 30 RBIs and a team-high 15 
doubles. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 In softball, freshman catcher Nicole Ochoa (Thousand Oaks) leads Long Beach 
State in RBIs (23) and ranks second in home runs (four). . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Fresno State, which leads Cal State Northridge by one game heading into a 
crucial Western Athletic Conference doubleheader Friday at 1:30 p.m. at 
Northridge, will feature senior Kim Maher (Buena) at shortstop and sophomore 
Jenifer Henry (Buena) in center field. Henry has a .245 average and 22 RBIs. 
Maher is making another strong bid for All-American status. She leads the 
Bulldogs in batting (.442), hits (76), runs (48), doubles (15), triples (five), 
walks (19) and slugging percentage (.745). . . .  
</P>
<P>
 In track and field, Marcus Reed (Canoga Park) of UCLA ran personal bests of 
10.35 seconds in the 100 meters and 20.66 in the 200 to win those events in 
Saturday's quadrangular track and field meet against USC, Brigham Young and 
Washington. The marks moved Reed to ninth on the all-time Bruin performer list 
in the 100 and to 10th in the 200.

LIFE & TIMES / WENDY MILLER: A FRONT SEAT VIEW OF THE WALL CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY MILLER, Wendy Miller is editor of Ventura County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 People often wonder where editors and reporters get ideas for stories. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes it's as easy as looking out the window. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the view through my windshield that inspired this week's Centerpiece 
story on The Great Divide, the concrete barrier that runs along a two-mile 
stretch of the Ventura Freeway. The wall separates the highway from a strip of 
beach called the Rincon (Spanish for corner). 
</P>
<P>
 This part of road is where U. S. 101 and Highway 1 are one, and drivers 
commuting between Central Coast cities invariably find themselves here. 
</P>
<P>
 I, being one such driver, have traveled that stretch nearly 1,000 times, a 
spectator to the ebb and flow of the sea, the greening and browning of the 
hillside, the dodging and weaving of speeders and the best laid plans of 
Caltrans. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last several months, one of those plans seemed to be made manifest in 
bits and pieces. First a barrier went up, then it came down. Signs went up, 
then they came down. A new barrier arose. This one stayed. 
</P>
<P>
 It all seemed a little strange, and often when things seem strange, 
journalists get interested. I did. And so did staff writer Jeff Meyers, but not 
at first. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't see a cement wall becoming a cover story," Meyers said. "But anytime 
an editor wants to pay me to take a spin up the coast, I turn into an 
eager-beaver reporter."

MANHATTAN BEACH TEACHERS REJECT CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON GARCIA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Manhattan Beach teachers overwhelmingly rejected a new contract Tuesday, 
refusing to accept a deal that would have left nearly one-third of them without 
a raise for a third year. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract, which teachers rejected by a 166-26 margin, would have held high 
school teachers' salaries to 1991-92 pay levels for the 1993-94 school year.  
</P>
<P>
 Elementary teachers would have received an average raise of 11%. 
</P>
<P>
 All teachers would have received a 3% raise for the 1994-95 school year. 
Teachers in the Manhattan Beach district earn $25,000 to $51,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 They have been working without a contract for eight months. An impasse in 
contract talks was declared last March and a state mediator was brought in. The 
mediator offered the compromise contract in April, and negotiators agreed to 
take the proposal back to the school board and the teachers for consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board approved the proposed contract unanimously. But for the 
teachers union, the biggest obstacle was the lack of a raise for high school 
teachers.  
</P>
<P>
 A disparity in salaries arose when Manhattan Beach City School District and 
Mira Costa High School merged last year to form the Manhattan Beach Unified 
School District. Mira Costa High School salaries were higher than those of 
elementary teachers.  
</P>
<P>
 Manhattan Beach Unified officials say a $1.5-million cut in state funding and 
a projected deficit meant that some teachers would have to go without a raise.  
</P>
<P>
 "We were looking for more upward movement in the salaries," said Bob Sumpter, 
president of the Manhattan Beach Teachers Assn. "We're talking about three 
years at the same pay level for the high school teachers." 
</P>
<P>
 The union executive committee, which was not part of the bargaining team, 
voted 12 to 0 to recommend that members turn down the offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Sumpter said teachers are still willing to negotiate with the school district. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials were angry about the vote. "We're obviously very 
disappointed that it was voted down," said Catherine Hagen, legal counsel for 
the district. "My understanding is that the mediator still has jurisdiction and 
that he is looking at a date to resume the negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
 Hagen said administration bargainers felt deceived by union negotiators.  
</P>
<P>
 "We will need to evaluate whether we're willing to bargain with the teachers' 
bargaining team or demand one that really represents the union," Hagen said.  
</P>
<P>
 Union officials, however, say they didn't endorse the district's offer but 
were obligated to bring it before the union. 
</P>
<P>
 Mediation is expected to resume this month or early next month.

KEEPING A SHARP EYE ON THE BALD EAGLE; WILDLIFE: AN ENVIRONMENTALIST WORKS HARD 
TO RE-ESTABLISH THE NEARLY EXTINCT SPECIES ON CATALINA ISLAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN WOODWARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dave Garcelon dangles precariously over the huge bald-eagle nest on the 
southeastern cliffs of Catalina Island. 
</P>
<P>
 He hangs from a harness connected by a long rope to a helicopter hovering 120 
feet overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the second time Garcelon has visited the nest in a month. In early April, 
he removed an egg and replaced it with a synthetic one. As he approaches the 
nest this time, Garcelon again disturbs the nesting bird, and it takes off, 
soaring through the sky. 
</P>
<P>
 In less than a minute, Garcelon has replaced the fake egg. The eagle and its 
mate return to find a two-week-old eagle chick.  
</P>
<P>
 "The adults immediately came back and started to brood it, and then later we 
saw them feeding it," said Garcelon, 40, president of the Institute for 
Wildlife Studies in Arcata in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The eagle chick was hatched in a San Francisco Zoo incubator from an egg laid 
by captive birds. It was the 42nd bald eagle released on Catalina Island under 
a reintroduction program Garcelon started in 1980.  
</P>
<P>
 When the chick is old enough to fly in 11 or 12 weeks, it has roughly a 50-50 
chance of survival, Garcelon said. But that's better odds than if the eagles 
had tried to hatch their own egg on the island. 
</P>
<P>
 Human intervention is still the only way to ensure the survival of the 
endangered species, said Garcelon, who has worked for 14 years to re-establish 
bald eagles on Catalina.  
</P>
<P>
 At least six breeding pairs of bald eagles were nesting on the island in the 
1940s. They were among the 25 to 40 pairs on the eight Channel Islands before 
the population was wiped out by hunting and pesticide poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
 DDT left over from extensive use in Southern California agriculture continues 
to permeate the environment and show up in the fatty tissue of birds and other 
wildlife. The pesticide was outlawed in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 DDT affects the calcium deposits in the eggs of eagles and other shorebirds, 
Garcelon said. The eagles lay eggs with shells so thin they easily break or 
lose water, causing the embryo to dehydrate.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're able to save at least some of them until hopefully the environment 
cleans up well enough that they can do that themselves," he said. "One of these 
days that stuff (DDT) will degrade and be out of the environment." 
</P>
<P>
 Now Catalina is home to two breeding pairs and an additional nine mature 
birds, all reintroduced. Garcelon said an unequal sex ratio prevents more 
breeding on the island. 
</P>
<P>
 When eggs are laid, Garcelon quickly replaces them with replicas. 
</P>
<P>
 The fragile eggs are transported in a specially designed padded case to San 
Francisco for incubation. Sometimes a chick goes back to the parents that laid 
its egg, but only three of 14 eggs laid on Catalina since 1987 have been 
successfully incubated. The egg removed from its Catalina nest in early April, 
for example, did not hatch. 
</P>
<P>
 After the chick is left in the nest, the adult birds quickly take on the role 
of parents. Only one foster chick has died in a Catalina nest, Garcelon said.  
</P>
<P>
 As the birds mature, they often leave the island for three or four months. 
Wing tags and radio transmitters help Garcelon monitor their travels.  
</P>
<P>
 One bird released in 1991 was spotted on the California/Oregon border earlier 
this year, he said. But eventually it may return.  
</P>
<P>
 "We expect them to come back to at least the general area of Catalina Island 
because they have what's known as a 'natal site tenacity' and like to breed in 
the same area they came from." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcelon's aim in forming the nonprofit wildlife institute in 1979 was to 
re-establish bald-eagle populations, but he said he was not aware of how 
prevalent DDT was in Southern California waters when he began the Catalina 
project. Garcelon hoped the birds would be producing their own healthy chicks 
by now. Only one pair has laid and hatched an egg unaffected by DDT.  
</P>
<P>
 Garcelon's organization and the Catalina Conservancy have spent more than 
$700,000 in private funds trying to bring the species back. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past three years, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has contributed an 
additional $255,000 to the program. 
</P>
<P>
 It takes $150,000 a year to maintain the program, but it's money well spent, 
Garcelon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcelon added that the only other bald-eagle program in California is on the 
Big Sur coast. 
</P>
<P>
 He has reintroduced the eagles in several other locations, including Lake 
Tahoe, British Columbia, Arizona and New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcelon also works on the east coast of Russia with a reintroduction program 
he developed for the steller sea eagle -- one of the biggest eagle species in 
the world and a relative of the American eagle.

CITIES GIRD FOR A FLOOD OF RETIREMENTS FUELED BY SPIKING OF PENSIONS; CIVIL 
SERVICE: CHANGE IN STATE LAW IS PROMPTING WORKERS TO LEAVE BEFORE NEW 
GUIDELINES TAKE EFFECT JUNE 30. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Douglas Gates will be a busy man come June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 As personnel director for the City of Hawthorne, Gates will have at least 28 
vacancies to fill or eliminate by then. About 8% of the city's work force will 
have retired in the last several months of the fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's about three times what we normally see in one year," Gates said. "It's 
going to make things very interesting around here." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawthorne, as it turns out, is not the only South Bay city bidding farewell to 
an unusually high number of employees, officials said. In Redondo Beach, 24 
plan to retire. In Torrance, up to 92 safety workers eligible for special 
retirement benefits could leave this year. 
</P>
<P>
 A change in state pension law has prompted what one Hawthorne councilwoman 
calls a stampede of retirements. Workers, many of them police officers and 
firefighters, are leaving cities in a last-chance rush to inflate their 
pensions before new guidelines take effect. 
</P>
<P>
 The departures could muddy the financial and personnel picture in six local 
cities for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems stem from the elimination of pension spiking, an often-criticized 
practice written into the contracts of some public employees. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Spiking agreements typically let workers convert unused sick leave and 
vacation time into cash during their final year of employment. The extra pay is 
then counted as a salary increase and used to calculate a higher pension. 
</P>
<P>
 That's how Richard McCarroll, a Hawthorne police officer for 28 years, boosted 
his pension in 1991. McCarroll said his base salary, around $49,000 a year, 
entitled him to a monthly pension of $2,300. Thanks to spiking, he receives 
$2,750 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a contract thing, a little icing on the cake," said McCarroll, 53, who 
now lives in Sedona, Ariz. "It's basically beer and dinner money, or maybe a 
little more than that." 
</P>
<P>
 But for the state Public Employees' Retirement System, the cost of pension 
spiking was huge. Although no one knows the amount with certainty, officials 
speculated that the practice could have cost taxpayers billions of dollars if 
left unchecked. 
</P>
<P>
 Local governments contracting with PERS to fund retirements weren't 
contributing funds for the extra benefits. Neither were the workers. The 
retirement system absorbed the cost.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the retirement system said it would no longer pay for the spiked 
portion of pensions. It gave government agencies a grace period to remove 
pension spiking from contracts by the end of June, 1994. And, during the grace 
period, it began charging cities for the extra cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of pension spiking during the grace period, 94 agencies statewide owe 
$29.8 million to the system as of May 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those 94 agencies, Torrance owes the most -- $4.23 million -- records show. 
Redondo Beach ($1.05 million), Hawthorne ($824,548), Gardena ($258,953), El 
Segundo ($151,538) and Hermosa Beach ($15,935) are the other South Bay cities 
indebted to the system. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The actual cost to cities, however, is expected to be greater than the figures 
indicate. That's because current balances reflect only the cost of employees 
who retired by May 1. The majority plan to do so in June. As more employees 
leave the cities, the balances will rise. 
</P>
<P>
 Redondo Beach, for example, said it expects to owe $2.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In Torrance, the number is harder to calculate. Officials don't know when or 
how many of the 92 safety workers eligible to retire with spiked pensions will 
do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Most cities force employees to retire after they convert leave time into cash. 
But in Torrance, police and fire employees have the option to retire months or 
years from now, with pensions spiked by cash received by June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said it is unlikely that all 92 will retire this year. And the 
longer employees wait, the less the city will owe in spiking costs. Promotions 
and other raises should eventually boost most of the salaries beyond their 
spiked levels, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The upshot for Torrance is that its liability could grow by as much as $14.5 
million in the coming years -- or by very little.  
</P>
<P>
 The bills for most cities will start coming due next year, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Payments to the retirement system will stretch over 10 to 30 years to ease the 
burden on local agencies. Reserves already paid into the system also will 
soften the blow in some cities. 
</P>
<P>
 But state and local officials said sizable amounts will come from city 
coffers. 
</P>
<P>
 Redondo Beach said it expects to pay $160,000 a year more to the retirement 
system through the year 2011. Hawthorne officials estimated the city will cough 
up $400,000 next year alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time you take a $400,000 hit," Hawthorne Finance Director Tim Brown said, 
"I have to find $400,000 in services to cut." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the expected rise in labor costs, some local officials said the 
departures will help to balance budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 The retirements offer an opportunity "to eliminate positions without laying 
people off," said Hawthorne's Gates. "It really gives us much more flexibility 
at a time when we need it." 
</P>
<P>
 But Gates also worried that too many veteran employees are leaving at one 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city is losing a lot of years of experience those people bring to the 
job," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And, officials in the South Bay said, the retirements are particularly 
troublesome because most are in police and fire departments. The departures 
come at a time when many cities are trying to beef up their forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider Torrance, where 27 safety personnel and five other workers have 
retired with spiked pensions since late 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "A year ago, we put around a million dollars in the budget to hire nine police 
officers," Mayor Dee Hardison said. "But they're retiring faster than we can 
hire them at this point." As a result, Torrance and other cities are likely to 
fill some of the open jobs. That would wipe out at least part of the potential 
savings from the retirements. 
</P>
<P>
 While officials grapple with the effects on city finances and staffing, some 
council members privately say the retirements raise ethical questions. Indeed, 
pension spiking has drawn criticism throughout California. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1992 audit of pension practices in eight Southland cities prompted State 
Controller Gray Davis to label pension spiking an abuse of the public trust. 
</P>
<P>
 "Public service is a privilege," Davis said at the time. "It's not a license 
to pig out." 
</P>
<P>
 But retirees have long maintained that they deserve a comfortable retirement 
after years of hard work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think most of those retiring with these benefits are doing it because they 
earned" the benefits, said Robert Klein, who worked a dozen years as a teacher 
in Hawthorne and 13 years as the director of parks and recreation. 
</P>
<P>
 Klein, 70, said he had originally planned to retire in 1995 but left in March 
to boost his pension. 
</P>
<P>
 Retirement system officials said the latest round of pension boosting is 
substantially different from some high-profile cases, in which top officials 
got bigger paychecks in retirement than at work.  
</P>
<P>
 In one instance, former Manhattan Beach City Manager David J. Thompson 
received a yearly pension that was $50,000 more than his annual base salary of 
$89,000. The City Council later slashed Thompson's pension, but he sued and 
received a $199,500 settlement last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The average benefit for a retired employee is about 35% to 45% of the worker's 
salary. The latest round of spiking boosts that amount by 7% to 9%, a 
retirement system spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some South Bay cities, however, have avoided the extra expense entirely 
because they do not have contracts that promote pension spiking. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've avoided that stuff like the plague," said Gary Irwin, assistant city 
manager in Lomita.  
</P>
<P>
 Other South Bay cities currently without pension-spiking agreements are 
Avalon, Carson, Inglewood, Lawndale, Manhattan Beach, Palos Verdes Estates, 
Rancho Palos Verdes, Rolling Hills and Rolling Hills Estates.

POLITICAL NOTEBOOK: OILY TO BED AND OILY TO RISE . . . MAKE A DEMOCRATIC 
PRIMARY.

 GRILLING OIL: Campaigns offer fertile ground for kissing babies, shaking hands 
and bashing big oil interests. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, three Democratic candidates in the 28th Senate District, 
which includes South Bay's coastal communities, have held press conferences and 
issued statements promoting their stand against oil projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, at a Hermosa Beach event to announce the endorsement of the Sierra 
Club and the California League of Conservation Voters, Torrance Councilman 
George Nakano voiced his opposition not only to offshore drilling but also to a 
proposal to drill on land for oil in Hermosa Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "The effects (of oil drilling) are irreversible. That's the real problem," 
said Nakano as he gave a $20 check to the Hermosa Beach Stop Oil Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 "What does that have to do with the state?" asked Tim Mock, campaign manager 
for incumbent Ralph C. Dills (D-El Segundo), of Nakano's opposition to the 
Hermosa drilling. "It seems like he's running for City Council rather than 
state Senate." 
</P>
<P>
 Dills has been supported by the oil industry, including $2,500 in campaign 
contributions from Jan. 1 to March 17. But Mock points out that the senator 
recently received praise for getting a bill through the Government 
Organizational Committee last month that bans new oil leases in state 
tidelands. 
</P>
<P>
 Another candidate in the Democratic primary, public interest attorney Mike 
Sidley, plans to take a tour of Santa Monica Bay today, in part to discuss 
offshore drilling. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 MONEY FOR DILLS: Dills leads his opponents in spending so far this year, 
according to the latest financial disclosure statements. 
</P>
<P>
 Dills spent $102,000 from Jan. 1 to March 17, well ahead of Nakano with 
$24,157. Sidley spent $1,417, and Manhattan Beach real estate broker Jo Ann 
Rodda filed a short form that indicates she does not plan to spend more than 
$1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nakano nearly matched Dills in cash on hand as of March, with $132,317 in 
his campaign coffers compared with Dills' $140,053. Sidley had $16,283. 
</P>
<P>
 Nakano's campaign has criticized Dills for having no individual contributors 
listed in his latest report. His biggest contributions were $5,000 from the 
Bicycle Club Casino in Bell Gardens and another $5,000 from Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at Nakano's (contribution list), it looks like all Asian 
surnames," Mock said. "If you are going to talk diversity, we have many 
different interests" supporting Dills' campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 He said teachers associations and manufacturers unions also gave money to 
Dills. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone gives to a union or a political action committee, those are 
individual contributions," Mock said.  
</P>
<P>

<P>
 STILL SLUGGING: The campaign teams of Rancho Palos Verdes Councilwoman Susan 
Brooks and former Palos Verdes Estates Councilman Ron Florance met two weeks 
ago to iron out their differences. But on stage there's as much bitterness as 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
 The two 36th Congressional District candidates appeared Sunday at the League 
of Women Voters forum in Torrance, with Brooks once again charging that 
Florance will be so caught up in litigation over a past real estate deal that 
he will be unable to effectively campaign against incumbent Jane Harman 
(D-Marina del Rey). 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't need a Republican-style Whitewater in California," Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Florance, who threatened to sue Brooks two weeks ago for distributing a letter 
accusing him of having a "tainted business background," called Brooks' remarks 
"trash statements by a desperate candidate." 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks also chided Florance for giving his campaign a $150,000 personal loan 
-- at 10% interest. 
</P>
<P>
 He did give his campaign a loan, with the 10% interest, said John Carlson, a 
Florance consultant. But the interest -- which was placed on the loan on the 
advice of his lawyers -- was waived several weeks ago, he said. 
</P>

 HAYDEN ON THE HILL: State Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) will take his 
gubernatorial campaign to the Palos Verdes Peninsula on Sunday. The lawmaker 
and 1960s political activist will appear at a Democratic Club forum at 2 p.m. 
at the Shops at Palos Verdes. His opponents, State Treasurer Kathleen Brown and 
State Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi, may send representatives. Also 
scheduled to appear are Nakano and Sidley. Mock plans to represent Dills.

SIGHTS; EXHIBIT OF LATINO WORKS HAS A MYSTICAL QUALITY; PAINTINGS AT CARNEGIE

 At present, the Carnegie Art Museum in Oxnard is genuinely abuzz with 
paintings that are not, by any definition, wallflowers. Vivid color schemes, 
large scale and bold imagery -- pushing at the limits of realism -- make for 
art that strains to leap off the wall and escape the boundaries of two 
dimensions. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's the point. 
</P>
<P>
 A unicorn is flanked by El Salvadoran soldiers in Frank Romero's huge 
triptych, "Espirito del Pueblo," based on the 15th-Century "Lady of the 
Unicorn." In Elizabeth Perez's "Heard in Hand," a nude woman holds a heart in 
her hand, an unequivocal symbol of love lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Literally stretching into three dimensions, Margaret Garcias "In the City of 
the Angels" is a wooden wardrobe painted with scenes of violence and peril 
contrasted with natural imagery, with angel wings hung inside. 
</P>
<P>
 But what distinguishes "The Mystical in Art: Chicano/Latino Painting," one of 
the finest shows yet hung at the Carnegie, is not its extroverted initial 
impression. As the show's title suggests, at issue is the expression of inner 
life, via religious, psychological, mythological, or art-referential windows. 
</P>
<P>
 Curator Frank Romero sought to illustrate the theme of mysticism as 
represented in the work of 13 Chicano and Latino painters, mostly from Southern 
California. Romero, a well-known artist based in East L. A., was last seen in a 
one-man show at the Carnegie Art Museum in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero's work includes the "Going to the Olympics" mural on the Hollywood 
Freeway near Downtown Los Angeles. He is working on a mural for the Metro Red 
Line Station in L. A. The paintings in his previous show had a generally 
boisterous presence, but the works at the Carnegie use the Mixografia 
print-making technique to create delicate images of primitive icons. 
</P>
<P>
 Paradoxes often arise in considering these artists, who tend to work in 
various media and deal with complex issues. Slippery cross-referencing between 
image, meaning and historical contexts is common. 
</P>
<P>
 Culturally, the art here often taps into the Latin American literary legacy of 
magic realism, using techniques of prickly realism, all shuffled, to expand 
beyond the surface reality. There is also an obvious link to the contemporary 
art world, with the revitalized narrative emphasis of postmodernist painting. 
</P>
<P>
 Eloy Torrez, for instance, draws on Baroque and Renaissance painting 
mannerisms and traditions for his pieces, but also tosses in a contemporary 
spin. The triptych "Damnation of the Spirit" depicts a group of nudes, none too 
coy, basking in the mysterious light of dusk on a beach. "Spirits of 
Silverlake" shows a back-yard Bacchanalian revelry replete with accordionist 
and winged spirits. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Romero, Yreina Cervantes is known for her mural work. But for this show, 
she is represented by small watercolor pieces such as her "Homage to Frida 
Kahlo." The celebrated Mexican artist Kahlo -- who could not bear children -- 
is seen nude and pregnant with twins, and holding a mirror image of Cervantes' 
own face. Hence, Kahlo is commemorated as a matriarchal presence. 
</P>
<P>
 Patssi Valdez, whose paintings here are among the show's most compelling, is 
also a photographer and member of the Chicano Art Movement and ASCO (Spanish 
for nausea). 
</P>
<P>
 In her feverish interior scenes, Valdez illustrates dream-like discomforts of 
home -- all skewed angles and supercharged color. "La Noche de la Sandia" finds 
a room clutched by irrational, diagonal lines and sharp corners, as if seen 
through a heightened awareness and implying either fear or altered 
consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 Venezuela-born Luchita Hurtado's paintings are some of the gentlest of the 
lot. She paints swatches of blue sky, viewable from any angle, as if seen 
through cave openings. Only floating feathers provide middle ground 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Romero's work ranges from a depiction of a Taos Pueblo religious 
ceremony, conspicuous on the museum's back wall, to intimate pieces upstairs. 
Her sly still life, "Ripe Fruit," finds Our Lady of Guadalupe nestled among 
fruit on a table -- the merging of religious vision and everyday life. 
</P>
<P>
 Ann Chamberlain's enigmatic and relatively tiny pieces, in the upstairs 
gallery, tend to be dwarfed by the larger works in the show, but her art 
commands close attention. Chamberlain mixes and dislodges archetypes, but in a 
charmingly naive style that is as whimsical as it is didactic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Portland Man," both funky and extravagant-looking in oil and gold leaf on 
wood, portrays a huge mythical figure towering over Portland -- Portlandia 
meets Godzilla meets Paul Bunyan. Her images, sometimes inspired by film, evoke 
intentionally ambiguous story lines and the sort of dryly irrational world of 
surrealist Giorgio De Chirico. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, such is the lay of the artistic land, full of inexplicable -- or at 
least interpretively open-ended -- events and scenes. Mystical, in this case, 
has many different meanings, and somewhere in that matrix of potential meanings 
lies the pulsing heart of the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Suffice to say, a visit to this exhibition is bound to be anything but a 
passive art-watching experience. 
</P>
<P>
 On a local note, Romero is judging a "Ventura County Chicano/Latino Painting 
Competition" in connection with the exhibit, with an award presentation on 
Friday at 7 p.m. For information, call 385-8157. Details

NIGHT LIFE: ACOUSTIC SOUNDS RETURN TO GRACE VENTURA HARBOR; MELLOW TROUBADOUR 
ALAN THORNHILL'S FREE WEEKEND SETS ADD ANOTHER GOOD REASON TO GO TO 
LORENZONI'S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Ventura Harbor has a long industrial tradition. Before it was full of fine, 
expensive boats and tourist-oriented shops, it was a dump, and the adjacent 
Ventura Keys was an airport. The sewage treatment plant and a petroleum tank 
farm are remaining relics of the industrial past. It's often windy and cool 
down there in the harbor -- sort of where the smell meets the swell if the wind 
is just so. 
</P>
<P>
 There hasn't been nighttime music in the harbor since Hussing's went away a 
few years ago, but like a breath of fresh air for music fans, Lorenzoni's 
Espresso Bar & Cafe is offering affordable acoustic music on weekends. One of 
the featured performers is laid-back troubadour Alan Thornhill, down from the 
Ojai Valley, performing from 7 to 10 p.m. Saturdays. It's a free show, and 
there's free parking as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorenzoni's has a lot to offer for those out for a night of PG-rated fun, 
featuring about 110% fewer hassles than your usual club. First of all, there's 
no gnarly bouncers, no beer, no drunks, no cops and thus no trouble. No dopey 
dancers are likely to slam into you and knock you flying, either. Also, 
Lorenzoni's has great food -- the Southwestern melt is worth the journey alone. 
They have all sorts of teas, coffees and flavored cappuccinos, and some serious 
belt-loosening pastries. 
</P>
<P>
 The place has a bunch of doors and, thus, a breeze, and usually, a lot of 
strolling tourists. Also, a few cute little sparrows cruise by looking for 
handouts. And Thornhill, who has been playing locally since the late '60s, 
appreciates the ambience. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually this place is packed," Thornhill said. "The place is real open, and 
usually we get a lot of walk-in traffic. I like these kinds of gigs -- I've had 
enough of those smoky bars." 
</P>
<P>
 Thornhill travels light. He sets up against the wall, opens one of the doors 
and gets a cross breeze working, perches on a bar stool and entertains with his 
cool, clear voice. It's as laid-back as a Sunday morning in Ojai. Thornhill 
even gets to take his young daughter, Naomi, to these gigs. He good-naturedly 
informs the crowd of a $5 charge per table for anyone who doesn't sing along to 
his daughter's favorite song, "Puff the Magic Dragon." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been playing music all my life -- my parents were very supportive," he 
said. "I used to listen to everything on the radio; I'm a self-taught 
guitarist. I formed my first band in junior high school and we used to play 
school dances. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in a few groups over the years, the last one was Little Brother, 
which broke up about four years ago. That's the way it is with bands -- they 
come, they go. It was a five-piece band that played old R & B songs. I love 
that kind of stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 These days when he plays, Thornhill generally does the kicked-back tour. In 
addition to Lorenzoni's, he can be seen strumming and crooning at such places 
as Wheeler Hot Springs in Ojai, or SOhO and Cold Springs Tavern in Santa 
Barbara. Since he graduated from Hueneme High School in 1968, he's played at a 
lot of the venues that no longer exist, such as Charlie's and the Sand Dollar 
in Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 "From time to time, I've played all over the county; I've toured and I played 
Back East as recently as February. The local scene is always changing. There's 
a lot of good musicians, but very few places to play. Right now, I'd say the 
Ventura-Santa Barbara scene is pretty bleak." 
</P>
<P>
 Thornhill released a pair of tapes last year -- one a Christmas album and the 
other, "The Time, the Tide & the Tears," which contains 10 acoustic originals. 
He's had some considerable success selling his songs, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know a lot of songs. I could play a whole night of originals or a whole 
week of covers," he said. "I'm always writing new songs, and sending them off 
to other artists and publishers. Chris Hillman of the Desert Rose Band recorded 
one of my songs, and I've had songs done by Kenny Loggins. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the music part of all this, but it's hard to make a living at it. I'm 
a carpenter, so sometimes, it's hard to find the time. I just do what I do."

<P>
 The City Council has given preliminary approval to an ordinance designed to 
prevent nepotism at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members voted 5 to 0 last week to prohibit the city from hiring 
relatives of the city manager, department heads and elected or appointed 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance also would bar relatives from working in the same department 
under certain circumstances. Current employees would not be affected as long as 
they remain in their present positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike a previous draft, the proposed law would not prevent the appointment of 
relatives to committees. 
</P>
<P>
 A final vote is scheduled May 19. SCOTT SANDELL

COMMUNITY NEWS: HAWTHORNE; POOL HALL OWNER SUES TO GET LIQUOR PERMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The owner of a billiards parlor has sued Hawthorne and the City Council in a 
bid to get a liquor permit. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Jamgotchian, owner of South Bay Billiards, filed suit in Los Angeles 
Superior Court Tuesday asking a judge to force the city to issue him a permit, 
which would let him apply for a state liquor license.He is also seeking 
$100,000 in legal fees and estimated lost revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamgotchian's action comes nearly two months after the City Council denied him 
a liquor permit for his El Segundo Boulevard business. Council members said the 
pool hall is unsuitable for alcohol sales because it is near Hawthorne High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been fighting to get this permit for five years," Jamgotchian said. "All 
my competitors in the billiards business can serve alcohol, but I can't." 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilwoman Martha Bails said other pool halls "may serve liquor, but 
they're not next door to a school." SCOTT SANDELL

COMMUNITY NEWS: INGLEWOOD; COUNCIL TO REVIEW PLAN ON DRILLING NEAR FAULT

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council will hear citizen comments May 24 on a proposal to permit 
exploratory oil drilling on a one-acre plot that falls within a special 
cemetery zone. 
</P>
<P>
 The council had approved the drilling at 7715 S. Victoria Ave. in December, 
1992, but the decision was overturned by a U.S. Superior Court ruling that the 
city had not considered potential earthquake problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The active Newport-Inglewood Fault runs through the area. Drilling near faults 
has produced a sinking of the earth, which produces cracks in buildings and may 
cause an earthquake, according to the Coalition Against the Pipeline.  
</P>
<P>
 A new city report, which says that oil drilling would not cause problems with 
the fault, will be reviewed by the council. Residents can get a copy of the 
report from the Inglewood City Planning Office at 1 Manchester Blvd. SAMANTHA

COMMUNITY NEWS: TORRANCE; BEST BUY CO. TO OPEN STORE AT OLD GEMCO SITE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Best Buy Co. Inc. will make its Southern California debut this fall when the 
consumer electronics chain opens a store in the former Gemco building at 
Hawthorne Boulevard and Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 The building has been vacant since Gemco went out of business more than five 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Torrance store will be the first of six to eight stores that the retailer 
says it will open in California by the end of the year. Best Buy currently has 
152 stores in 18 states. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the Torrance Planning Commission unanimously approved plans to 
renovate the 10 1/2-acre site. Merchandising Development USA Inc. owns the 
property, which it will lease to Best Buy. Another retail store would sublet 
part of the site, but Best Buy executives said they have not yet signed a 
subleasing agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Best Buy sells electronics, computers and home appliances. Store employees are 
not paid on commission, and shoppers can help themselves to the merchandise 
stacked on the sales floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Best Buy will begin hiring 100 to 250 full- and part-time workers in 
September, company officials said. MARY GUTHRIE

<P>
 When it comes to the Willows Wetlands, local environmentalists refuse to 
remain as quiet as the wind whispering through the 200-year-old trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans of the Willows, a five-acre habitat of willow trees and migratory birds 
near Artesia Boulevard and Vermont Avenue in Gardena, are campaigning to save 
an adjacent parcel of land from development. 
</P>
<P>
 Shirley Turner and other environmentalists see the eight-acre parcel just 
south of the wetlands as a buffer zone and an ideal spot for an information 
center. "You see soaring hawks, ducks and other migratory birds in the 
Willows," said Turner, a Torrance resident. "If you build right next to it, 
you'll strangle this pristine willow area." 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Gardena, which recently purchased the property from Caltrans, 
agrees part of the parcel could be used as a buffer between the wetlands and 
the busy streets and shopping centers nearby. The city plans to zone the land 
fronting Artesia for commercial development, but it will require environmental 
impact reports for commercial development on the rest of the Caltrans lot, said 
City Manager Kenneth Landau. 
</P>
<P>
 City leaders are devising a plan for the area. The city was granted $1 million 
from a county park bond issue to enhance the wetlands and open the area to 
visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 But Turner and others are circulating petitions asking that the entire 
Caltrans lot be annexed to the wetlands. Turner said she has collected about 
250 signatures. "We're trying our best to not let these willows be strangled."

COMMUNITY NEWS: RANCHO PALOS VERDES; CITY OPPOSES PROPOSED MTA BUS SERVICE CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rancho Palos Verdes officials oppose a proposal by the Los Angeles 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority to cut bus services on the Palos Verdes 
Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 The authority is considering service reductions on Routes 225, 226, and 444 to 
cut expenses.City administrative analyst Veronica Dolleschel said 11 of the 
authority's proposed 22 cutbacks in the 1994-95 budget could affect bus users 
on the peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 Options include canceling operation of all three lines on Saturdays, canceling 
all Sunday and holiday service on the 444, and reducing the 225 and 226 service 
to one bus every two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to the authority, Mayor Steven Kuykendall says the city has 
serious concerns about the proposed cuts. He suggests raising fares to maintain 
service.

CENTERPIECE: CAUGHT OFF GUARD; WHILE AIDING DRIVERS, THE BARRIER HAS MADE 
CYCLISTS' ONLY COASTAL ROUTE FROM SANTA BARBARA TO VENTURA A HIGH-RISK OUTING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF MEYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Great Barrier Beef began innocently enough for the California Department 
of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, 1992, Caltrans erected a simple metal-beam guardrail along the 
ocean between Bates Road and La Conchita, a two-mile stretch of the Ventura 
Freeway also known as 101, Pacific Coast Highway and the Rincon. 
</P>
<P>
 While improving safety for drivers -- the guardrail prevented southbound 
vehicles from careening over a seawall -- the Caltrans project had the opposite 
effect on bicyclists, making their only coastal route from Santa Barbara to 
Ventura a high-risk undertaking. 
</P>
<P>
 The multiuse shoulder includes a section of the Bicentennial Bike Trail, which 
runs from Canada to Mexico. Before the guardrail, the ride was never completely 
safe for cyclists, but at least they had room to maneuver in an emergency. When 
installation of the $138,220 barrier narrowed the shoulder from 18 to 14 feet, 
cyclists were forced to make life-and-death choices if suddenly confronted by a 
parked car with the driver's door opened wide. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans admitted it made a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't realize we'd cause a problem for cyclists," traffic engineer Larry 
Louden said. "Frankly, we goofed." 
</P>
<P>
 Moving quickly to appease cyclists, Caltrans only managed to compound one goof 
with another, enraging another segment of the population. This particular bend 
in the Ventura Freeway was not just a rest stop for truckers but a free parking 
spot for summertime beach-goers. 
</P>
<P>
 When Caltrans decided to ban parking to protect cyclists, "it caused an 
uproar," said Kris Kuzmich, administrative assistant to state Assemblyman Jack 
O'Connell (D-Carpinteria). 
</P>
<P>
 The uproar drowned out pleas from cyclists. Caltrans rescinded the no-parking 
ban in about two weeks, which meant that cyclists were literally between a rock 
and a big rig. An arm's length from vehicles cruising at 70 m.p.h., they had to 
ride on maximum alert in a constant state of terror. Fresh skid marks across 
the bike lane -- ominous reminders that traffic sometimes took unexpected 
detours -- also added to the anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very scary and unpleasant," said Bill Becher of the Conejo Valley 
Cyclists club. 
</P>
<P>
 By the spring of 1992, O'Connell and state Sen. Gary Hart (D-Santa Barbara) 
had persuaded Caltrans to schedule two informal public meetings to resolve the 
dangerous situation. At the second meeting, in September, 1992, Caltrans agreed 
to move the guardrail toward the ocean about four feet, creating a door zone 
between the bike path and the parking section. Everybody was satisfied, 
including Pat Larson, president of the Ventura-Oxnard Cycling Club, and 
representatives of the Surfrider Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We supported Caltrans moving the guardrail as far back as possible," said 
Larry Manson, a local Surfrider member. 
</P>
<P>
 But the move did not come soon enough for a 65-year-old female cyclist, who 
was killed last June when a car drifted into the bike lane and ran into her. 
</P>
<P>
 After the removal of the old guardrail and the construction of a new barrier 
in February -- at a cost to the taxpayers of $274,596 -- Caltrans thought the 
Great Barrier Beef was finally over. But it was only getting warmed up. 
</P>
<P>
 Manson and others were stunned to see the new installation. Caltrans had 
widened the shoulder, but instead of using the same two-foot-high metal rail 
with a peekaboo ocean view, Caltrans had laid down a 32-inch-high, solid 
concrete wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Surfrider cried foul, contending that Caltrans switched plans without telling 
the public and should have applied for permits from the California Coastal 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time you build a significant structure along the coast -- and I consider 
a two-mile concrete structure significant -- you have to go through the 
permitting process," said Manson, a history teacher at Ventura College. 
</P>
<P>
 Manson recently took Surfrider's objections to the Ventura office of the 
Coastal Commission, which agreed to investigate the possibility that Caltrans 
is in violation of the 1976 California Coastal Act. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one disputes that cars do get launched off (the shoulder) and we agree 
about the need for a barrier," Manson said, "but this is all about process. The 
whole issue of going through public review is reasonable. It's good to have 
public input." 
</P>
<P>
 Surfrider argues there is a big difference between a slender metal guardrail 
and a ponderous concrete barrier, but Caltrans officials counter that the 
barriers are exempt from the Coastal Act, falling under the "repair and safety" 
exclusion. The original guardrail didn't need permits for the same reason. 
</P>
<P>
 "We replaced a safety barrier with a safety barrier," said Ron Kosinski, a 
district chief of environmental planning for Caltrans. "If I had to go to 
hearings for every guardrail, (concrete wall) or stoplight, that's all I'd do." 
</P>
<P>
 But Chris Price, a Coastal Commission analyst and an avid cyclist, believes 
Surfrider might have a valid point. "There's some ambiguity in the exclusion 
clause," Price said. "I don't know if it was the intent of the exclusion clause 
to exempt a cement wall." 
</P>
<P>
 Others also object to the wall: It partly blocks the view for cyclists, 
motorists and La Conchita residents and possibly deters beach-goers and surfers 
from using the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's as much a mental barrier as a physical one," surfer Stan Fujii said. 
</P>
<P>
 Why did Caltrans install the concrete barrier? 
</P>
<P>
 It had no choice. After the September, 1992, meeting, Caltrans field engineers 
discovered their inability to move the guardrail closer to the ocean. Rail 
posts have to be sunk three feet into the ground, but the thin lip of the 
shoulder was on top of huge seawall boulders called riprap, which can't be 
drilled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Putting the guardrail in just wasn't practical," Robert Joe, a Caltrans 
engineer, said. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how the Great Barrier Beef plays out, cyclists must deal with a bike 
path still considered the most dangerous in the county (see chart). Although 
Larson said the shoulder, with the inclusion of the door zone, "is very 
comfortable again," other cyclists don't share his enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anything, it's more dangerous than it's ever been," said Tom Ramirez, a 
Santa Barbara rider who was cycling to Ventura. "You're still riding right next 
to traffic, and the way Caltrans marked the shoulder is very confusing to 
drivers. The last thing a cyclist needs out there is a confused driver." 
</P>
<P>
 If Caltrans really wanted to keep them safe from traffic, some cyclists said, 
it would have installed a barrier between the bike lane and the freeway. 
Caltrans' own Planning and Design Criteria for Bikeways states: "Bike paths 
closer than five feet from the edge of a highway shall include a physical 
divider." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the criteria "is desirable, it isn't a requirement," said Bill 
Weldele, district chief of a Caltrans' traffic design branch. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, putting a barrier on the edge of the freeway would prevent cars from 
parking along the shoulder, causing another controversy for Caltrans. 
</P>
<P>
 What about placing the bike lane on the ocean side of the barrier, separating 
cyclists from drivers? That option was discussed, Larson said, but eliminated 
out of fear that trash would be thrown on the path by people parked along the 
barrier, creating a hazard for cyclists. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd have dead cats, discarded hibachis, old tires," Larson said. "It would 
be unusable in a month." 
</P>
<P>
 The ideal solution would be to relocate the bike path across the freeway along 
the Southern Pacific rail right of way. But that option was neither discussed 
nor considered. According to experts, acquiring right of way and laying a path 
would be prohibitively expensive. Furthermore, because the path would run in a 
gully about 18 inches below the level of the freeway, cyclists would have to 
give up their ocean views, a prospect some might not appreciate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if they'd be happy riding in a hole seeing nothing but truck 
tires go by," Caltrans' Robert Joe said. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connell's assistant considers the current configuration the best. "I don't 
think there will ever be a solution to please everybody," Kris Kuzmich said. 
"That's impossible." A Few Routes to Traverse With Caution 
</P>
<P>
 Ten popular county bike routes rated as dangerous by expert cyclists: 
</P>
<P>
 LA CONCHITA 
</P>
<P>
 * Ventura Freeway (Bates Road to La Conchita) -- Cyclists must deal with 
high-speed heavy traffic and vehicles parked on the shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 VENTURA 
</P>
<P>
 * Harbor Boulevard (Seaward Avenue to Ventura Harbor) -- Heavy traffic, cars 
parked on shoulder and several cross streets make this an anxiety-producing 
ride. 
</P>
<P>
 * Harbor Boulevard (McGrath State Beach to Edison power plant) -- Bike lane 
and traffic lane converge on narrow bridge, bringing cyclists inches from 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 * Foothill Road -- Hilly and winding with no shoulder, the route is not for 
the novice. 
</P>
<P>
 MOORPARK 
</P>
<P>
 * Los Angeles Avenue (just east of Balcom Canyon Road) -- Railroad tracks 
above the road level cross bike route at an angle and can catch a bicycle's 
front wheels, throwing cyclists into oncoming traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 CASITAS PASS 
</P>
<P>
 * California 150 -- Large potholes on the downhill grade are booby traps for 
cyclists. 
</P>
<P>
 SIMI VALLEY 
</P>
<P>
 * Arroyo Simi Bicycle Path -- Although most of the route is protected, 
cyclists have to exercise caution crossing several major streets. 
</P>
<P>
 * Madera Road (Los Angeles Avenue south to just past Royal Avenue) -- A 
designated lane suddenly disappears in a stretch with heavy traffic, giving 
cyclists little space to maneuver. 
</P>
<P>
 CAMARILLO 
</P>
<P>
 * Central Avenue (between the Ventura Freeway and Santa Clara Road) -- The 
heavily trafficked street has no shoulder, providing cyclists with no safety 
margin. 
</P>
<P>
 HIDDEN VALLEY 
</P>
<P>
 * West end of Potrero Road -- A blind curve offers cyclists no clue as to what 
lies beyond the bend.

COMMUNITY NEWS: ROLLING HILLS ESTATES; SHOW TO FEATURE 180 CLASSIC AUTOMOBILES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 San Pedro automobile buff Paul Gommi says he can pinpoint the moment that Ford 
Motor Co. turned automobiles into art. 
</P>
<P>
 It was September, 1932, when Ford -- then considered the most influential car 
manufacturer in the world -- built its first prototype using the concepts of 
styling and streamlining. 
</P>
<P>
 The prototype, which Gommi owns, became the model for mass-produced 1933 
Fords. Finally, the public had access to transportation that not only performed 
but looked good, Gommi said. 
</P>
<P>
 The car is one of about 180 classic automobiles that will be displayed Sunday 
at the second annual Palos Verdes Concours d'Elegance. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all machines up to that point, form followed function," he said. "The 
revolution here was the styling -- that it became aesthetically pleasing." 
</P>
<P>
 His Ford prototype, which has never been driven, is said to be the rarest Ford 
ever built. It took Gommi three years to track down its original parts after he 
stumbled across the Model 40 chassis in about 1985. The only replacement part 
of the car is the fan belt, which is needed to start the engine for judging. 
</P>
<P>
 The Concours d'Elegance will also include a rare 1936 Cord Sportsman 
Cabriolet. The modern class will feature the latest models of the Vector Avtech 
SE and the Lamborgini Countach. Both sell for about $200,000. Jaguar also will 
display its new sports car, the XJ220, which is so fast that it's not 
street-legal or available for sale in the United States, Palos Verdes Concours 
chairman Eric Allan said. "However, it sells in Europe for around $750,000." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the automobiles, the event will include exhibits by local artists and 
food booths. It will be at Palos Verdes Peninsula High School at Silver Spur 
Road and Hawthorne Boulevard in Rolling Hills Estates from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
Tickets are $10 for adults and $6 for children 5 to 12. Information: (310) 
541-2479.

PEOPLE: EX-CIA OFFICIAL, WIFE ENGAGE IN OVERT OPERATION: EDITING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By SUSAN PATERNO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 Two or three decades into a career and midway through the second half of life, 
some people go through a change. They buy the latest, lowest, loudest sports 
car; they find a new husband or wife younger and better built than the first; 
they get the implant or the lift or the tuck. Not James H. Taylor, the former 
executive director of the CIA under William Casey and Bill Webster. When he and 
his wife, Nancy, tired of their old life as government bureaucrats, they simply 
junked it and got a new one. 
</P>
<P>
 Since January, the Taylors, both in their 50s, have been the editors and 
producers of the newsletter "Bicycle Travel and Review," a Manhattan 
Beach-based "guide to riding in all the right places."  
</P>
<P>
 "When the Cold War ended," Taylor said, "I, like thousands of others, needed 
to find something useful for my life." And besides, writing and editing a 
publication is not completely unlike what the Taylors had been doing, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We'd both done a lot of writing." He paused. "Of course, it was 
official-sounding memos mostly." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, what the Taylors write is much more accessible. 
</P>
<P>
 After scouting locales, they research the history of the region they plan to 
write about and then hit the bike trail themselves. They profile spots 
particularly well suited to bicycle travel, providing readers with pertinent 
details: when to go; where to stay and eat; which routes to follow and how 
difficult they are; sights along the way and any admission costs or hours of 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Each issue is devoted to one trip. So far, the Taylors have reviewed road 
biking in the Gold Country near Yosemite; Moab, Utah; and Santa Ynez, north of 
Santa Barbara. The next issue takes readers to Europe for a ride along the 
Danube River from Munich to Budapest.  
</P>
<P>
 Their typical subscribers are "people very much like us," Taylor said. 
"They're mostly in their 40s, 50s or 60s, they want to be active, they take 
recreation seriously, they want to eat well and enjoy good accommodations." 
</P>
<P>
 The newsletter is "not charitable and not profitable yet," Taylor joked. But 
it already has 760 subscribers who pay $44 a year for six issues.  
</P>
<P>
 "They come from all walks of life," he said. "We have doctors, lawyers, 
accountants, people who run health spas and inns. A lot were joggers when age 
and infirmity caught up with them. Bicycling is much easier on you, and it's 
very good aerobic exercise." 
</P>
<P>
 The Taylors have been biking enthusiasts for more than two decades, riding 
with professionally run tours and creating their own rides for themselves and 
friends. "We were arranging trips and doing research and thought we might make 
it a business. That's what got us on our way," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 About the same time, the Cold War was ending, putting the military and the spy 
industries slowly out of business. After 20 years with the CIA, Taylor retired 
in 1989. Nancy, who worked in the Washington city planner's office, left her 
job and the couple moved to the South Bay, where Taylor took a job at TRW.  
</P>
<P>
 "The downsizing created a sometimes very depressing environment," Taylor said. 
"We said to ourselves: 'We can do something different. We don't have to spend 
life like this. Life's too short.' We weren't having fun." In late 1992, Taylor 
resigned from TRW and the couple started their cycling guide.  
</P>
<P>
 The Taylors hope to break even by mid-1995.

DECIPHERING THE SPECIAL LANGUAGE OF CALTRANS

 For motorists, highway confusion begins at the county line. Crossing over 
Bates Road, they drive into Ventura County around a downhill curve, the ocean 
raging beneath the rock seawall. For the next two miles, drivers glimpse 
strange arrangements of large block letters painted alongside the 
coastline-hugging concrete barrier. You read as best you can at 65 m.p.h.

 Gnikrap on. Official-looking type between parallel white lines, the lettering 
is apparently meant as some kind of advisory. You search your dashboard for a 
switch to turn on your gnikrap and can't find one. Then your car flashes past 
another row of letters. Reading from bottom to top this time, you're able to 
interpret gnikrap as "no parking" spelled backward. 
</P>
<P>
 But numerous cars park next to the barrier. Could it be that parking is 
forbidden inside the parallel white lines and allowed on the rest of the 
shoulder? What is the meaning of the five-foot-wide lane between the no-parking 
zone and the freeway? Can anybody decipher this without an instruction manual? 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen upside-down words like that before," Hank Alviani of La 
Conchita said. "That's a very peculiar way of putting 'no parking' in there." 
</P>
<P>
 Designed to keep parked vehicles from endangering cyclists, the signs also 
seem to deter motorists who incorrectly assume the entire shoulder is 
off-limits. The signs were installed by Caltrans at the suggestion of Pat 
Larson, president of the Ventura-Oxnard Cycling Club, and representatives of 
the Surfrider Foundation. But Larson won't take the blame for the confusion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them to make it linear, but they spelled it backward and it looks 
stupid," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans can't understand why anybody would be confused. "I think the markings 
are correct," said Bill Weldele, district chief of a Caltrans' traffic design 
branch. "They adhere to the vehicle code for pavement markings. Anybody who 
reads from the top down is reading backward." JEFF MEYERS

THEATER REVIEW; 'NUNSENSE' IN OXNARD IS TRULY A TALENT SHOW; PRODUCTION OF THE 
MUSICAL COMEDY ABOUT A CONVENT'S FUND-RAISING EVENT OVERCOMES A WEAK SCRIPT 
WITH CREATIVITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If you are looking for evidence that an imaginative and talented production 
can overcome the shortcomings of a script, you need go no further than Heritage 
Square in Oxnard and view the current production of "Nunsense." It's very funny 
almost despite Dan Goggin's original script, which is ridden with bad puns and 
overly obvious irreverent japes. 
</P>
<P>
 The show, an off-Broadway perennial (now in its zillionth continuous year) and 
community theater standard, opened last week under the auspices of the newly 
formed Ventura County Actors' Theatre; the group is an offshoot of the old 
Cabrillo Music Theatre. (Another production will open in Simi Valley on May 20; 
a group in Ojai will open "Nunsense II" on June 17, having presented the 
original show last fall). 
</P>
<P>
 For those not aware, "Nunsense" is supposed to be a talent show given by a 
group of nuns to benefit themselves; they need the money to defrost several 
dead members of their order who are currently at rest in the convent's freezer. 
And if you think that's funny. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Director Sean Moran, who was at the helm of several of the Cabrillo group's 
musicals, gives this "Nunsense" an air of improvisation that helps it 
considerably: much of the dialogue seems truly spontaneous even when it isn't, 
something that requires better than average actors, which Moran has assembled 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 They're also good singers, much better than the show requires. Among the more 
notable voices are Lorraine MacDonald as Sister Mary Robert Anne, and the 
fellow who calls himself "Spanky," who plays Sister Mary Amnesia, the nun who 
has forgotten her true identity since being hit on the head with a crucifix 
(these are the jokes, folks). 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, he's one of two men who play nuns here; the other is director Moran 
himself, stepping in halfway through rehearsals to replace the woman originally 
cast as the Mother Superior.

REDONDO STUDENT SUSPENDED FOR FIRING GUN AT SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Redondo Union High School student accidentally fired a semiautomatic pistol 
during an art class last week, police said. No one was injured when the bullet 
pierced the classroom floor. 
</P>
<P>
 The weapon apparently went off when the female student tried to shift the gun 
inside her jacket pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 The student told police that she had been the victim of several crimes in the 
last year and that another student had recently cut in front of her in line. 
The unidentified student and two others who allegedly tried to hide the gun 
have been suspended pending an expulsion hearing, and charges against them are 
expected to be filed this week, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 School administrators did not hear about the May 3 incident until the 
following day. A teacher who was in a small, adjoining classroom when the gun 
was fired apparently lectured the students on the dangers of firecrackers, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not commonplace at this school," said Principal Bob Paulson. JAMES 
BENNING

COUNTRY ROUNDUP: LEGENDARY PERFORMERS RETURN FOR OLD WEST FEST; THE GENUINE 
ARTICLE -- BUCK PAGE AND HIS ORIGINAL RIDERS OF THE PURPLE SAGE -- WILL PERFORM 
SUNDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN LOEWENTHAL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As a kid growing up without television in Guam, I learned to appreciate life's 
simple entertainments. By day we'd outrun the daily tropical rain showers while 
playing tag in Davy Crockett 'coon skin caps. And at night the thunder of 
coconuts rolling down the corrugated metal roof of our quonset hut served as a 
lullaby. 
</P>
<P>
 But the best times to be had were at the parties in my mama's floral chintz 
living room. If I was lucky, the grown-ups would stand me on their shoes and 
waltz to tunes of Eddie Arnold or Tennessee Ford. And I could steal olives and 
maraschino cherries from the beverage table while some tall guy strummed a fast 
two-step on his immense guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those simple pleasures (sans the coconuts) will be offered up this 
weekend at the Ventura Harbor Village. Festival of the Old West will kick off 
an outdoor summer concert series of music ranging from rhythm and blues to 
rock. It's all free and country music will be featured one weekend a month. 
</P>
<P>
 From 2 to 5 p.m. Saturday, Sibling Rivalry, a brother-sister duo featuring 
Leti Morgan and Pino Sanchez, will entertain. Thunder Country radio deejay, Bob 
Allen, will meet and greet from noon to 3 p.m. Rick Henderson will teach and 
the Country Lovers dance demo team will perform line dances from 2 to 3 p.m. 
And there will be pony rides and rodeo clowns for the kids. 
</P>
<P>
 But the highlight of this weekend is Sunday's double bill of old and new 
country: The Rhythm Rangers and the legendary country-Western band, Buck Page 
with his Original Riders of the Purple Sage. 
</P>
<P>
 The latter group, named after a novel by Zane Grey, helped to make cowboy 
music popular in the 1940s and '50s with hits including "Tumbling Tumble Weed," 
"Ghost Riders in the Sky" and "Don't Fence Me In." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the only one alive out of the first lineup of the original Riders -- the 
ones who went on the road," said Page, now 71. "Today the group is only Joe 
(Boemecke), Mike (Ley) and I." 
</P>
<P>
 The original lineup consisted of Bob Parker on guitar, Ken Cooper on 
accordion, Hal McCoy on string bass and Page on guitar, banjo and fiddle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the cowboy bands until we came along were fiddles, guitars and 
banjos. But it sounded kind of empty behind the vocals," he said. "So there was 
a good accordion player in town and I got him into the group. It really filled 
up the sound." 
</P>
<P>
 That was in 1936. Page was 14 years old when the Riders got their start on the 
NBC radio station in Pittsburgh. A stint playing music and performing novelty 
sharpshooting tricks with the circus came next. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we went with the circus, they just didn't want us to sing. And all we 
could really do was sing and play," Page recalled. "But one of our guys was a 
sharpshooter. So Bob Parker shot live bullets, Necco wafers and cigarettes out 
of our mouths." 
</P>
<P>
 Happily, the music -- and the musicians -- survived that tour to produce a 
string of hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Page has never stopped playing music, but earlier in his career did manage to 
get in some acting as well, appearing in more than 200 motion pictures, 
including "The Glenn Miller Story" and "A Star is Born," with Judy Garland. 
</P>
<P>
 And true to his country-Western music roots, he did ranch for most of his 
life. He and his wife have lived in Oxnard since 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 And he's had an impact on subsequent musical generations. In the late 1970s, 
Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead bought a pedal steel guitar to play country 
music as a side band. Garcia acknowledged his admiration for the Original 
Riders of the Purple Sage by calling his group the New Riders of the Purple 
Sage. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, Page's band inspired the formation of Riders in the Sky, a 
modern trio that has gained national popularity as a nostalgia group. Duded up 
like Roy Rogers, they perform the tight vocal harmonies associated with Page or 
Sons of the Pioneers. 
</P>
<P>
 But we have the original, genuine article. And he's back in the saddle -- and 
studio -- recording and touring. 
</P>
<P>
 The Original Riders of the Purple Sage have just recorded 21 of their 
well-known hits and some original tunes to be available by Sunday. Three of 
Page's songs are out in a collection of campfire songs by Centerstream 
publishing. And his group will appear with the New Riders of the Purple Sage 
and Waylon Jennings June 23-26 at the Mountain Country Art and Music Festival 
in Missoula, Mont. 
</P>
<P>
 "The country music as we know it is long gone," said Page. "All we have now is 
rock 'n' roll music and singers wearing cowboy hats. Country music today is 
'She done me wrong and she's sitting down at the local bar right now with six 
guys. And I'm walkin' the floor over her.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "But Western music is singing to the cattle, around the campfire, herding, 
riding your horse along the trail and being lonesome for your family." 
</P>
<P>
 Page told me he was "happier than heck" about the nostalgia or renewed 
interest in country-Western music. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always said for 40 years that this would come around full circle and it 
has." Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: Buck Page and the Original Riders of the Purple Sage; the Rhythm 
Rangers

DISCLOSURE: PROBLEMS OF CLOSED-DOOR SESSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sen. Quentin L. Kopp (I-San Francisco) is to be congratulated for sponsoring 
legislation that enables public scrutiny of the local legislative process 
(March 29). I wish he had included the requirement to record the minutes of 
closed sessions of city council meetings and retain those minutes for a prudent 
period of time, before making them public. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of Rolling Hills Estates have long suffered the effects of 
good-old-boy back-scratching cronyism in our local government. Back-room deals, 
questionable closed session council meetings and secret committee negotiations 
resulted in what I feel is an inappropriate expenditure of $1.4 million of 
county funds earmarked for Rolling Hills Estates. 
</P>
<P>
 A complicated agreement, which in my opinion, included questionable appraisals 
of donated land, and likely negative attendant tax consequences to the donor, 
resulted in our city transferring 20 of the available 28 acres to the Palos 
Verdes Land Conservancy. The Conservancy, an independent entity that can buy, 
sell or trade land, is not an agency of our state or local government. 
Therefore, I believe that public funds facilitated giving significant public 
assets to a private entity which has its own agenda, and not a single public 
hearing was held.  
</P>
<P>
 The arrogance of our City Council members who presided over the disposition of 
$1.4 million and 28 acres of land without public hearings, in secret closed 
sessions, prove the wisdom of Kopp's legislation.

CRIME: TRYING TO IMPROVE PENAL SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the Harbor Area Town Hall meeting on April 20 at the Doubletree Hotel in 
San Pedro, representatives of the district attorney's office, of Sheriff 
Sherman Block's office and two judges from the San Pedro Court cited lack of 
funding, resulting in excessive workload, as one of the major causes of an 
increase in crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The representative of the Sheriff's Department specifically said that this 
nation has not shown a strong enough commitment to fighting crime with 
corresponding commitment of adequate funds. 
</P>
<P>
 We Californians are part of this nation. If my memory serves me correctly, 
most of the ballot measures providing funding for additional prisons or 
additional police passed (even when all other spending measures were voted 
down). So we, the voters, did allocate money to the fight against crime; but 
when the budget cuts were made, they were made (by our elected officials) 
across the board, including police, the district attorney and the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 At the meeting, a gentleman asked, "How about making the criminals work to 
help support themselves?" and he was given the trite answer that the labor 
unions do not want the prison system to compete with workers in the production 
of goods. 
</P>
<P>
 Why cannot the prison inmates be put to work to grow their own food, make 
their clothes and whatever else they need? Why cannot the criminals convicted 
of nonviolent crimes be put in prison farms, prison factories, and be put to 
work? Why cannot the youthful offenders be put in boot camps and taught 
discipline, work habits and self-control, along with basic skills and a trade 
or a profession? 
</P>
<P>
 It is now time to take a new (or an older) approach to the fight against 
crime. The creation of boot camps has already been tried in other states and 
discussed here in California: Why are we not implementing it? 
</P>
<P>
 If legislation is required to allow convicted felons to be placed in different 
types of correctional facilities, what are we waiting for? Time is running out, 
and the officials in Sacramento and Washington must wake up to this fact.

SAFETY: CRIME AND THE BILL OF RIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am concerned about the Neighborhood Safety Act of 1994 (AB3789), recently 
introduced into the California Assembly, in which drivers and their vehicles 
entering "emergency areas," so designated by a two-thirds vote of local 
government councils, could be randomly inspected at checkpoints for possession 
of illegal firearms. 
</P>
<P>
 Have we all taken leave of our senses? I am shocked that Assemblywoman Betty 
Karnette (D-Long Beach) is a co-sponsor of this bill! When was the last time 
you read the Constitution, Betty? Do you plan to destroy part of our true 
American way of life: our Bill of Rights? In return for what . . . safety from 
crime? 
</P>
<P>
 Do we honestly think that drivers with illegal firearms would risk driving 
through a checkpoint? So, who do you suppose will be harassed? The law-abiding 
resident who will be giving up his right "to be secure in their persons, 
houses, papers and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Karnette is quoted in an article as saying: "The dangers of people driving 
around with guns far outweighs the danger of undergoing searches. Besides, my 
experience with law enforcement in my district is that most are sensible 
people. I trust them." Boy, tell that to Rodney King! 
</P>
<P>
 Law-abiding citizens should be aware of what is happening. Our Constitution, 
one of the greatest documents in the world, is slowly being eroded. And in the 
name of safety and crime prevention. 
</P>
<P>
 When prohibition (of alcohol) was repealed, crime decreased. 
</P>
<P>
 Decriminalize drugs. Regulate the potencies (via the Food and Drug 
Administration). Tax the receipts. Take away the black market profit motive for 
drug dealers. Use the receipts for drug rehabilitation. Then, free up the 
police for real criminals: murderers, rapists, arsonists. 
</P>
<P>
 This will have the effect of eliminating the "urgency" to destroy our Bill of 
Rights.

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: LOWER PRICES, SAME GREAT FOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL KRIKORIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The last decade has seen many a celebrated restaurant open a sidekick 
establishment with much lower prices. In Paris, Joel Robuchon, considered by 
many to be the greatest chef in France, recently opened Le Relais du Parc, 
where rates are only a third or a quarter of those at the restaurant that bears 
his name. In Los Angeles, Patina owner Joachim Splichal has opened the 
popularly priced Pinot Bistro in the San Fernando Valley and plans a casual 
cafe downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 Six months ago, Jose Dahan opened Village Cafe in the Hollywood Riviera. He 
now divides his time between his original Palos Verdes Estates restaurant, 
J'Adore, which features a $39 prix-fixe menu, and the new place -- a pretty, 
22-seat cafe located next to a Trader Joe's -- where meals can be had for as 
little as $5.  
</P>
<P>
 Be sure to consider the prominently displayed chalkboard that lists the daily 
specials. A special that's become so popular that it's almost always listed is 
the salad Nicoise ($5.95), featuring tuna, hard-boiled eggs, string beans, 
tomatoes, cucumbers, bell peppers, and anchovies drizzled with olive oil and 
balsamic vinegar. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a pizza of the day ($2.50 for a large slice), with toppings such as 
grilled chicken breast, fresh oregano, garlic, roasted eggplant and feta 
cheese, or sausage, Gorgonzola and eggplant. The soup of the day might be white 
bean with smoked bacon ($2.50). 
</P>
<P>
 Three large medallions of swordfish ($7.25) are sauteed with sun-dried 
tomatoes, garlic, fresh tomatoes and a white wine sauce made from a light fish 
stock enhanced with fresh basil, one of the many herbs Dahan grows in his 
garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandwiches include a vegetarian sandwich ($4.95), served on seven-grain bread 
moistened with olive oil and loaded with grilled eggplant, zucchini, tomato, 
bean sprouts and avocado. 
</P>
<P>
 The Village Cafe is at 1759 South Elena Ave., Redondo Beach. (310) 316-5400. 
Open Monday through Saturday 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.

REEL LIFE / FILM & VIDEO FILE; SPECIAL EFFECTS DIRECTOR LOOKS BEYOND MOVIES; 
HOYT YEATMAN'S COMPANY HAS WON TWO ACADEMY AWARDS. NOW IT'S EXPANDING INTO 
PROJECTS THAT COMBINE FILM AND THEME PARK RIDES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PANCHO DOLL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ever wonder what sort of job Calvin of "Calvin and Hobbes" would grow up to 
have? 
</P>
<P>
 Spend half an hour with Hoyt Yeatman, co-owner of Dream Quest Images in Simi 
Valley, and you will quickly learn the type of adult the comic strip builder of 
mutant alien snowmen might turn out to be. 
</P>
<P>
 At 39, Yeatman is the driving force behind the special effects that garnered 
his company two Academy Awards, one in 1990 for computer-manipulated models 
that animated underwater action scenes in "The Abyss," and another in 1991 for 
"Total Recall." 
</P>
<P>
 He produced his first film at age 8. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was about a forced landing on planet Eggtron. I did the landscape with 
eggs and pipe cleaners." 
</P>
<P>
 Hmm, sounds like Calvin's Spaceman Spiff. 
</P>
<P>
 To hear Yeatman talk of his job as special effects director, to listen to the 
exuberance and speed with which he reels off special-effects arcana, is a 
little like watching film whizzing off a high-speed projector into a pile on 
the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We work in 35 millimeter, Vista Vision, 70 millimeter, 5, 8 and 15 perf. IMAX 
as well as high-definition video. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 He goes on. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been going through huge changes. In the last year we've switched from 
matte painting to doing backgrounds with computers and digitizing pens. In a 
period of eight months we went from glass to work stations." 
</P>
<P>
 He takes a breath: 
</P>
<P>
 "Lots of the landscapes we still do with modeling. The 'Batman' set was a 
110-foot-by-66-foot model of Gotham. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even as the folks at Dream Quest refine the use of digital technology in 
combination with models, the Hollywood blockbuster formula has been changing. 
There's a sense that audiences are getting tired of meaningless movies that 
rely solely on effects, preferring relationship and character-driven movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, Yeatman said Dream Quest has been expanding its work in 
"motion-based films" for theme parks. 
</P>
<P>
 When Warner Bros. finished filming "Batman," they turned the set over to 
Yeatman to make "The Batman Adventure," a roller coaster chase after The 
Penguin at the Warner Bros. Movie World theme park. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing we like about the special venue projects is we get our whole hands 
on the project, like we had with 'Total Recall' and 'The Abyss.' But that's 
happening less and less often with features. Studios are parting out their 
effects work. More and more it's just like making pizza." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Hollywood is intent on making movies about real people (not a foregone 
conclusion), Dream Quest is angling for its new niche. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can see a time when multiplexes will have a simulator bay next to their 
regular theaters, where people could take a ride while waiting in line for a 
movie. The creative potential is very exciting."

ON THE ROAD: A TURN FOR VERSE AT CAFE VOLTAIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD REED, Leonard Reed is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The white-haired gentleman read a simple poem about his travels in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 The middle-aged fellow noted before reading that his poem was actually written 
for his daughter's 21st birthday. This was useful to know, as his "Poem as 
Be-bop for Kristin" contained no obvious reference to the occasion and the 
contour of his verse was as jagged as the syntax of be-bop jazz itself, with 
internal riffs not by Charlie Parker but by T.S. Eliot and Rimbaud -- "the 
French Rimbaud," he'd also note. 
</P>
<P>
 The young hepcat wearing shades testified about his beleaguered mother in a 
poem that introduced his sister as "my-father-whom-I'd-never-met's-daughter." 
</P>
<P>
 The intense, black-haired, black-cloaked woman hurled vivid images -- "a gray 
dove, soft and silent as ash" -- in short lines depicting solace, isolation, 
regret. 
</P>
<P>
 A very young woman wearing a bright yellow and lime hat studded with mesh 
flowers recited stanzas built for the refrain "I'm convinced it's love." The 
things that convinced her it was love were: "We both own a copy of 'Harold & 
Maude' " and "He lets me pop the zits on his back."

 One woman rose to read but never quite got to it. Instead she "happened" in a 
great whooshing, speeding, omni-directional riff. It indicted Christianity for 
trading on icons of idealized visions of women while saving the power deities 
for men (even if they are hunky, "touchable" ones like St. Sebastian). She 
would ultimately get the hook for taking too much time, but not before 
discussing her unrelenting heterosexuality (a gift), Nixon (a jerk), Whitney 
Houston (a concept), and "declawed radio" in the form of NPR (a godsend). 
</P>
<P>
 Less effusive was the young man who invoked darkness in lines that fell as 
bluntly as his images. His poem titled "Heather" led off with "It hit the 
floor/the slap of heavy guts" and ended with "the guts stink." Brightening 
things up a bit, he then read a one-line poem he credited to an unnamed writer: 
"The man went off into the night to do just that." 
</P>
<P>
 With that, he paused and looked at the rapt audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "Isn't that cool?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 It is poetry night at Cafe Voltaire, in The Livery, downtown. This goes on 
every Thursday: word pilgrims arriving to testify, naming their feelings with 
spoken English, standing up one at a time to face 40 or so others to expose the 
innermost. 
</P>
<P>
 Poetry does this to people. It always has. 
</P>
<P>
 It's older than written words. It's from the ancient oral world in which 
people, warmed and illuminated by fires, spoke in rhythms and rhymes in such a 
way as to elevate a feeling, spotlight a discovery, intone a belief. Poetry has 
taken us far: through joy, grief, birth, death, evolution, devolution, love, 
hate. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's poems operate at many levels, from the banal and the affronting to the 
inspired and transcendant. At their roughest, they talk randomly of mere 
events. At their best, they contain a string of only those words that magically 
telegraph, with explosive power, real insight. Mark Twain troubled his whole 
life with finding just the right words, because he felt "the difference between 
the right word and the wrong word is the difference between lightning and a 
lightning bug." Ka-BOOM.  
</P>
<P>
 Hence the silence at these open-mike sessions. People want to hear what people 
must say in the words they've committed to paper. Phil Taggard, the poet who 
emcees and sometimes reads at these public readings, is plain about the sense 
of destiny stand-up poets have. "I do it because I have to," he says. "I have 
to do it. I have to put myself out there. It's a need." 
</P>
<P>
 If writing and reading poetry is a survival need as basic as food, no one 
could have made it clearer on this recent Thursday than Robert R. Reinhart, by 
day a Mercedes-Benz mechanic in Westlake but by all other hours a miner picking 
away to find that spot where the emotions and intelligence collide: in a 
word-jewel, or poem. 
</P>
<P>
 Reinhart's work is marked by economy and precision in the use of English and 
derives power from that. But Reinhart also has an eye for the telling metaphor, 
most fittingly of all on the subject of the elusive poem itself: 
</P>
<P>
 It is crying for you  
</P>
<P>
 like a kitten born under the house,  
</P>
<P>
 but you cannot find it,  
</P>
<P>
 so you listen  
</P>
<P>
 and you listen  
</P>
<P>
 and you beat the keys  
</P>
<P>
 a little harder  
</P>
<P>
 praying that you can free the words. " 
</P>
<P>
 On a Thursday night in Ventura, amid all the other word pilgrims, he did just 
that.

EARTHWATCH: ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES BECOME VITAL FOR HOME BUYERS, SELLERS; 
INSPECTORS SPECIALIZE IN CHECKING PROPERTIES TO DETERMINE IF THERE ARE PROBLEMS 
TO BE SOLVED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Wouldn't it be great if when life offered up one of those difficult situations 
it also provided a warning sign like those on freeways that say Blockage Ahead 
Use Alternate Route? Buying or selling a house is just the sort of situation 
where it would be nice to know about trouble ahead of time, so one could exit 
or get around it. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a new kind of trouble ahead in the '90s for home buyers and sellers. 
Environmental trouble. And a new professional, the environmental inspector, has 
emerged to deal with it. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm talking about people who can spot environmental problems lurking around a 
property you might want to buy or sell: soil or ground water pollution; 
formaldehyde or asbestos in the insulation; chemical fumes from the carpeting 
or heating and cooling equipment; or emissions from nearby power lines. Any of 
these can sink chances for financing the transaction. These days, to coin a 
phrase, banks duck muck. 
</P>
<P>
 Now there is the Environmental Assessment Assn., a nationwide professional 
standard-setting organization headquartered in Phoenix. The association, which 
has swelled from a few hundred members to 5,000 in three years, consists mostly 
of real estate brokers, real estate attorneys and real estate appraisers, as 
well as chemical and civil engineers. In order to get licensing, all members 
must have taken and passed professional training courses conducted nationwide 
by the association. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, commercial property buyers and lenders are the big users of the 
members' services. But more and more residential transactions are being 
screened for environmental problems, due to chemical spills near residential 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, no one wants to hear about more hassles and detours ahead when buying a 
house, especially financial detours. But, according tJ. Warren, a spokesman for 
the Environmental Assessment Assn., "the testing for these problems can be 
quite inexpensive." Ignoring the issue, he warned, is like "playing Russian 
roulette with a risk that could be extraordinarily expensive." 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Feltman is a veteran real estate appraiser and environmental inspector 
with The Appraisal Center in Ventura. Some of his comments put me in mind of 
the freeway warning sign. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state of California is really protecting the (real estate) consumer now," 
Feltman said. "Before 1988 it was buyer beware. Since the 1988 Disclosure Laws, 
selling is much more complicated." 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Feltman refused to list a large estate unless the owner disclosed 
there was once a private gas pump and tank on the property. Were any pollution 
to be discovered later, he said, the earlier failure to disclose would make 
owners, old and new, the lender and even the realtor, liable for the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, which is an extreme example, listing the property with the 
buried tank threatened to slow the sale. So the owner decided to remove the 
whole rig and clean up the place. 
</P>
<P>
 One kind of inspection done by the Environmental Assessment Assn. is a 
relatively inexpensive "Phase I." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Miklos, an inspector with TM Appraisals in Thousand Oaks, said this is 
where there is "reason to believe that an environmental problem may exist. (The 
appraiser) performs a visual inspection and sometimes a review of available 
documents regarding the property." The appraiser looks for the icky stuff 
mentioned above; as well as radon, which is not much of a threat in our county; 
lead paint, present in older homes; and PCB's -- chemicals sometimes emitted by 
power-line transformers located too near a house. 
</P>
<P>
 The initial inspection should be enough to determine whether or not further 
and more complicated inspections are necessary, including engineering studies, 
Miklos said. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: Real estate owners, sellers or lenders who wish to consult with an 
environmental inspector who is a local member in good standing of the 
Environmental Assessment Assn., call (602) 483-8100. Information on training 
courses for those interested in this new career is also available.

FASHION; THE WHITE HOUSE OF STYLE; EXHIBIT EXAMINES FIRST LADIES' IMPACTS ON 
HISTORY, WHICH FOR BETTER OR WORSE OFTEN CAME VIA THEIR CHOICE OF CLOTHES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Madame President exhibit at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library is more 
than just a fashion show -- at least that's what we were told upon arriving at 
the display last week. It is instead a tribute to the First Ladies of America 
and their roles in history. 
</P>
<P>
 We did notice that the collection includes The Time Magazine cover naming 
Betty Ford Woman of the Year, Hillary Rodham Clinton's law degree, and about 
190 pieces of clothing and jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, one of the major roles of First Ladies from the start has been to set 
fashion standards for the rest of us to copy, or alternately, to poke fun at. 
So, we personally were delighted with the fashionable tone of the artifacts, 
and the contrasts they showed, such as Frances Cleveland's ermine-lined velvet 
wrap and Mamie Eisenhower's pink bed jacket. 
</P>
<P>
 These two ladies were big hits with American women and had a lot of influence 
on how they dressed -- one avant garde, the other sort of heartland mawkish. 
</P>
<P>
 It is recorded that Mrs. Cleveland's low necklines caused the National Women's 
Temperance Convention to send word to the White House that her clothing was 
"immodest and fraught with dangerous and immoral influences," to which the 
White House is said to have made no reply. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Mamie Eisenhower, a staunch anti-feminist who "never knew 
what a woman would want to be liberated from," influenced a lot of fans to 
dress and to decorate their homes in sweetheart pink. But here's a surprise: 
Mrs. Eisenhower was named the 11th best-dressed woman of 1952 by the New York 
Dress Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 After Mamie left the White House, Jacqueline Kennedy steered fashion with her 
famous pillbox hats and straight-cut suits, which are not represented in the 
exhibit. On display instead is her Oleg Cassini ivory-colored inaugural gown, 
which looks simple, considering that its owner reportedly spent more on clothes 
during her husband's term than he earned as President. 
</P>
<P>
 Near this gown is a black taffeta dress of Eleanor Roosevelt's, who we would 
safely guess never laid eyes on a designer in her life. Like many activists, 
she ignored fashion and was known to wear dresses that cost $10, which we would 
love to have seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Another thrifty First Lady was Martha Washington, who actually recycled her 
dresses, according to notes at the exhibit, dismantling worn garments and 
rewinding the thread to use again. When she died, most of her remaining clothes 
were cut into pieces for souvenirs. The display includes only a pair of her 
detachable linen sleeves. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the outfits collected, some better than others seem to represent the tastes 
of their owners. Barbara Bush's image is just right with a no-nonsense blue 
suit plus her claim to fashion fame, a faux pearl choker. Nancy Reagan, who 
probably set the record for wardrobe size among all the White House residents, 
is symbolized by an ice green pleated dress, which she wore to Prince Andrew 
and Fergie's wedding. 
</P>
<P>
 From Mrs. Truman's effects comes an unexciting navy ensemble, which seems 
right since she was known for no style influence. However, her husband is 
credited with popularizing the Hawaiian shirt -- a stubborn trend, which 
apparently can never be totally eradicated. 
</P>
<P>
 The collection shows a fascinating march of history from Abigail Adams' 
whalebone corset and Angelica Van Buren's parasol to Grace Coolidge's 
flapper-like silver gown and Mrs. Nixon's Red Cross uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 But, when you come to the end of the gallery, you realize there's been an 
oversight on the part of the committee that pulled this thing together. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlikely as it may seem, nowhere is there represented the current First Lady's 
unique contribution to style: the headband. 
</P>
<P>
 We are willing to bet a lot more women in this country have bought headbands 
than have entered law school since Hillary showed up on the scene. In case you 
are unaware of it, she is widely credited with a surge in headband sales that 
still has not plunged. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, a few elitist critics have since discouraged her from wearing the 
accessory -- along with other so-called frumpy fashions. But to us, its appeal 
remains. 
</P>
<P>
 Think about it. Which would you prefer to see, one of Elvis' recording 
contracts, or his American Eagle Jumpsuit? It's that tangible quality we want 
here; the immediacy, the pathos of a personal artifact. 
</P>
<P>
 More than just a fashion show -- oh, yes. It's that intimate touch we long 
for, the chance to savor an icon's frumpy headband. That's what this country's 
all about. Yeah.

JAUNTS; SOARING WITH EAGLES IN HOMEBUILT PLANES; AFTER MONTHS OR YEARS OF 
TOILING OVER THEIR CREATIONS, PILOTS GET THE CHANCE TO LAUNCH THEIR AIRCRAFT AT 
THIS WEEKEND'S ANNUAL FLY-IN AT CAMARILLO AIRPORT.

 What does it take to build your own airplane? 
</P>
<P>
 For Dave Timms, it took 8 1/2 years of meticulous labor in his Simi Valley 
garage. For Bob Fowler, also of Simi Valley, it took 7 1/2 years, working side 
by side with his wife, to blast some 4,000 rivets into his metal two-seater. 
</P>
<P>
 Timms and Fowler are members of the Camarillo Experimental Aircraft Assn., an 
unusual bunch of pilots who not only like to fly but also build their own 
planes or restore classics. 
</P>
<P>
 The group is hosting its 14th annual Fly-In this weekend, along with an air 
show at Camarillo Airport. Last year, about 10,000 people showed up at the 
three-day event to gawk at 100 or so home-built or restored planes, some of 
them pretty wild looking. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Timms' airplane. The propeller is in the back, the wings flip up on the 
ends, and there is a smaller wing in the front. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very odd-shaped airplane," said Timms, who is a semi-retired aerospace 
engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 The sleek yellow two-seater is not only fast, but Timms set a 30,407-foot 
world record for altitude in the experimental aircraft. He now uses it mainly 
for trips to visit relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Some pilots buy kits to build their planes and others, like Timms, buy the 
plans and assemble the materials themselves, which is much more time-consuming. 
He knew nothing about building one until he began, and then it took him much 
longer than he expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the first -- and hopefully the last -- plane I build," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fowler, who owns a computer products company, is at work building his 
second plane, which resembles an antique with fabric covering the body. His 
first one, a conventional-looking plane, can be pushed to a top speed of 300 
m.p.h., he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The term experimental aircraft does not necessarily imply a wacky-looking 
flying machine. It means an aircraft built from either plans or a kit, rather 
than one that comes off an assembly line, and it carries special certification 
by the Federal Aviation Administration. The 135,000 members of the national 
Experimental Aircraft Assn. might build gyrocopters, helicopters, airplanes or 
the newest types, ultra-lights. 
</P>
<P>
 Members say it is not only cheaper to build one than buy one ready-made, but 
the home-builts usually perform better. Nor does it take an aeronautical genius 
to put one together, according to Richard Trickel, whose Tri-R Technologies in 
Oxnard sells a kit he designed called KIS (Keep It Simple). 
</P>
<P>
 In the last two years, Trickel has sold 73 kits to people of all professions, 
even to a would-be pilot. 
</P>
<P>
 His kit costs $16,000 and takes "about a year of pretty dedicated part-time 
work, 800 to 1,000 hours," he said. Once built, though, its builder can sell 
the two-seat airplane for about $60,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Trickel's home-built kit planes will be among those displayed during 
the show, which opens Friday.. Some old-time planes will also be there for 
viewing, like the restored PT22 World War II trainer and the other restored 
warplanes. Pilots from around Southern California and the western states will 
fly in to show off their planes, compete, talk shop, learn new technology and 
browse through aviation gizmos at a pilots' flea market. 
</P>
<P>
 During the air show, which starts at noon on Saturday and Sunday, members of 
the Los Angeles chapter of the International Aerobatic Club will take to the 
skies -- many flying home-built planes -- for some dizzying maneuvers. 
</P>
<P>
 Two speakers are on the agenda: Bill Smithey, a retired U.S. Navy captain, 
will talk about blimps on Friday at 5 p.m., and at 5 p.m. Saturday NASA 
astronaut Carl J. Meade will recall his space shuttle flights. 
</P>
<P>
 Kids won't be bored. They can take special tours and get a glimpse of how 
airplanes are put together. Also, Barney the dinosaur will fly in for an 
appearance. Details 
</P>
<P>

FOR THE KIDS; IT'S A ZOO OUT THERE FOR YOUTHS HEADING TO CAMP; SUMMER PROGRAMS 
GIVE CHILDREN WHO LOVE ANIMALS -- FROM LIZARDS TO GOATS -- A CHANCE FOR SOME

 You've heard of tennis camp, computer camp, even weight-loss camp for kids. 
Now, for those kids who are nuts about animals, we have zoo camp, farm camp, 
horsemanship camp and even nature camp. 
</P>
<P>
 During their summer break, young children might learn everything from how to 
milk a goat to the finer points of grooming a horse. Summer vacation is about a 
month away, so it's not too soon to sign up. 
</P>
<P>
 For young animal lovers, here are a few day camps in and around Ventura 
County: 
</P>
<P>
 * Moorpark College's exotic animal training program offers a Junior Safari Day 
Camp it calls "You Belong in Our Zoo." It's for kids in grades one through 
seven who want a glimpse of how students at the college train exotic animals 
such as lions, tigers, wolves, coyotes, monkeys, snakes, sea lions and even a 
pot-bellied pig. 
</P>
<P>
 The kids help feed the animals, clean the pens and assist the students with 
the almost daily shows they put on to practice their animal-training skills. 
The camp's hands-on experience is limited to smaller animals such as lizards, 
tortoises, harmless snakes and birds. 
</P>
<P>
 Camp runs from 8:30 to 11:30 a.m., Monday through Friday, and costs $110 per 
weekly session. They run from June 20 through July, and each is limited to 15 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 * Zoo Camp at the Santa Barbara Zoo is a combination of learning about zoo 
animals, games, songs, arts and crafts and science experiments. Children will 
not have direct contact with the zoo's general animal collection, but keepers 
bring out snakes, iguanas, tarantulas and birds of prey for personal 
encounters. Older campers can help out in the zoo's domestic animal enclosure 
by feeding the sheep, goats, prairie dogs, guinea pigs and chicks. They also 
have cleanup duty. 
</P>
<P>
 The weeklong sessions are designed around themes such as animal habitats or 
conservation. Fridays include special activities such as a trip to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Zoo Camp, which runs from June 27 through Aug. 26, is for children 3 years old 
to grade six. They are divided into small groups by age. Camp runs from 9 a.m. 
to 2 p.m., Monday through Friday, and the week costs $90. 
</P>
<P>
 * Painted Pony Camp in Santa Paula is for children, ages 5 to 10, who want a 
taste of farm life -- real farm life, that is, because this is a working farm 
and the home of Pam and Steve Colvard. Their secluded spread includes goats, 
sheep, pigs, chickens, ducks, rabbits, turkeys, horses and ponies. 
</P>
<P>
 The kids learn about a different farm animal each day, and the day's 
activities are designed around that animal. On goat day, for instance, they 
learn how to milk a goat, how to make goat's milk ice cream and why a goat has 
split hoofs. 
</P>
<P>
 They spend time every day just hanging around the barnyard with the animals, 
which are gentle because they've all been raised by the Colvards. They also 
work in a garden, make butter, hear stories, sing songs, hike to a creek and 
catch polliwogs, and swim in the Colvards' pool. 
</P>
<P>
 The weeklong camp sessions, which begin June 20, run from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., 
Monday through Friday. The cost is $100 a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Several horseback riding schools in Ventura County now offer summer camps for 
kids. They get an intensive daily dose of riding, along with a lot of horse 
know-how including saddling, grooming and caring for the horse, and even horse 
anatomy. The camps are for beginners as well as advanced riders. Here are a 
few: 
</P>
<P>
 * At Peppercorn Riding School in Saticoy's Wheeler Canyon, weeklong summer 
sessions beginning June 20 run Monday through Friday, from 8 a.m. to noon. They 
are open to children 7 to 15 years old and the cost is $180 per week or $40 per 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 * Elvenstar Farm and Riding School in Moorpark is a little more intensive, 
with sessions running two weeks, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Friday. 
The cost per session is $400. Kids 7 years and up ride about three hours per 
day. Summer camp begins June 20. 
</P>
<P>
 * Las Palmas Riding Club in Moorpark also offers two-week sessions beginning 
June 20. Children 6 to 14 years old go from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., Monday through 
Friday. In addition to riding and learning about horsemanship, the kids swim 
and go on field trips. The cost is $300 per session. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura's Community Services Department is offering a summer nature program 
for kids. All sessions are a week long and they run at different times during 
the summer, beginning June 27. 
</P>
<P>
 * One, called "Live Animals and Their Habitats," takes children 7 to 12 on 
hikes through Arroyo Verde Park, looking for animal tracks. They get a close-up 
look at opossums, tortoises, tarantulas, scorpions, snakes and hawks. The 
weeklong session runs Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. The cost 
is $75. 
</P>
<P>
 * Another one, also for kids from 7-12, has them exploring the shore at Emma 
Wood State Beach, looking for tide pools and marine life. It's one week long, 9 
a.m. to 3:30 p.m., and on Friday, the last day, the kids spend a full day on a 
boat trip to Anacapa Island. This one runs $120. 
</P>
<P>
 * For younger kids, 3 to 6 years old, a weeklong program called "Seaside 
Critters" exposes them to marine life at Marina Park. It's a shorter session, 
from 9 to 11:30 a.m., and it costs $55. Details

MUSIC; REPUTATION ON THE ROAD MAKES PHISH A BIG CATCH; TOURING THE COUNTRY IN 
RELATIVE OBSCURITY UNTIL RECENTLY, THE VERMONT QUARTET IS NOW TASTING FAME. 
</P>

 No one hears much about Vermont outside of Vermont. The locals probably like 
it that way. Ethan Allen and the Green Mountain Boys gained fame during the 
Revolutionary War; then Stannard's Vermont Brigade helped turn back Pickett's 
Charge on the fateful third day of Gettysburg in 1863. Over 100 years later, 
there's great ice cream from Ben & Jerry's; and now, finally an exportable 
soundtrack, those road dog rocking non-spellers in Phish. 
</P>
<P>
 If most bands in Hollywood can't get a record deal, what chance would a band 
like Phish have? 
</P>
<P>
 But Phish did things their own way. They didn't make a demo, send it off and 
hope Mr. Big from Megamondozilla Records would listen, then love it and sign 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Phooey, figured Phish. They took their act on the road, touring as 
relentlessly as any blues band, releasing their own stuff, and attracting an 
ever-growing horde of appreciative fans. A fan club network, the Phish Net, 
claims more than 50,000 members. 
</P>
<P>
 When they were signed to Elektra, Phish already had two albums (since 
reissued). Their fifth album is new for '94 -- the mind-bending "Hoist." 
There's some jazz, a bunch of rock, and endless jams, which gives a small 
preview of the live show, where the songs are so different, it seems like Phish 
is about five bands. They're one of those so-called "jam bands," beloved by 
Deadheads and dancers everywhere along with the Spin Doctors, Blues Traveler, 
the Samples, Big Head Todd & the Monsters and Widespread Panic. 
</P>
<P>
 Once four guys driving around in a van, Phish now has a small convoy at their 
disposal, and frontman Trey Anastasio and his pals stay in hotels under 
aliases. Famous musicians now guest on their records. The current Phishing 
trip, which will serve up a slew of surreal tunes, will stop by the Arlington 
Theatre in Santa Barbara Tuesday night. Anastasio, a.k.a. Sty Bateman, 
discussed what's what from a New Orleans hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
 How is 'Hoist" different than the other albums? 
</P>
<P>
 We went and recorded completely new material that no one had ever heard 
before. Usually we write on the road, and by the time it would come out, 
there'd be all these bootleg tapes going around. We have five albums and they 
all sort of flow together into one big thing. Making "Hoist" was a lot more fun 
and relaxed than the other ones. It's doing very well, but traditionally, 
albums have not been our selling point. Our focus is still on the live thing, 
and we've always had a great live following. 
</P>
<P>
 People tape your live shows? 
</P>
<P>
 Sure. We don't care. That's what put us where we are -- bootlegs passed 
around. Every show is different every night, and the albums are different, too, 
so we figure people will buy the albums, too. 
</P>
<P>
 And now you've got famous people on your album like the Tower of Power horn 
section, Bela Fleck and Alison Krauss; what's up with that? 
</P>
<P>
 Our producer had some connections, so the Tower of Power people played. Alison 
Krauss was playing one night, and we went to the show and went up to her 
afterwords and asked her if she would sing on our album. She'd had never even 
heard of us before, but she said OK. 
</P>
<P>
 Most bands try demos and showcasing to get signed, but not Phish. You took 
your show on the road, and it worked. 
</P>
<P>
 We basically toured the whole country before we signed. We put all of our 
energies into the live thing. The great thing about that was that we never felt 
like we were relying on the record company to do anything. The problem with 
young bands is that with tour support and all that, you get in too deep and you 
have to pay it all back. I think people want the quick fix; it's faster to get 
the big check now. But we've been doing this for 10 years -- we started in a 
Plymouth Voyager. It just takes a long time. You have to really love traveling 
around and playing. We picked up our crowd one fan at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of years ago, you guys were cruising around in a van sleeping in 
campgrounds; now it's a convoy and an alias in a hotel? 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, well, we're up to two trucks and two buses now. We lease all that stuff 
because the maintenance will kill you otherwise. I gotta have an alias now or 
otherwise people will be calling me at the crack of dawn -- four in the 
afternoon. On the road, you have to learn to go without sleep for about seven 
months. I'm not complaining; our fans are sort of mellow, and I really enjoy 
going to meet them. I don't need a flak jacket or anything, and I'm glad about 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 Phish usually plays alone, why? 
</P>
<P>
 We really want to play after all the traveling and hanging out in a hotel 
room. We usually play around three hours, maybe two 75-minute sets, plus an 
encore. We try and start pretty much on time, and if anything, we play too 
long. 
</P>
<P>
 What's happening in Vermont? 
</P>
<P>
 Us, Ben & Jerry's, and a lot of bovine growth hormones. Vermont is too cold 
for most people, but I like the cold. 
</P>
<P>
 What's in the future for Phish? 
</P>
<P>
 Tour. Life has been good lately except for the incident in Buffalo where I 
fell through the floor. I tore some ligaments, but everything's working again. 
We just want to keep getting better. Details

THEATER REVIEW; 'EVITA' RETURNS BETTER THAN EVER; CIVIC LIGHT OPERA'S LATEST 
PRODUCTION OF THE POPULAR MUSICAL IS THE BEST OF THE THREE IT HAS STAGED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP BRANDES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Santa Barbara Civic Light Opera's reprise production of "Evita" is a 
glossy, energetic affair that admirably captures the cautionary grandeur in 
this final musical collaboration between lyricist Tim Rice and composer Andrew 
Lloyd Webber. 
</P>
<P>
 No surprise here -- the production reunites several veterans of past "Evitas," 
including director Mark Lipschutz (who stage-managed three national tours), 
Valerie Perri (who's been playing the title role since she was 22), and, as the 
opposing figure of Che, Tim Bowman (who played the role in the 1979 Los Angeles 
production). 
</P>
<P>
 Lipschutz' direction faithfully re-creates the original Hal Prince staging 
that was so integral to the original London and New York productions -- the 
backdrop of projected photos, the round of musical chairs between the generals 
that signifies Juan Peron's ascent to power, the metal scaffolding from which 
Evita receives the adulation of the masses. 
</P>
<P>
 As Eva, Perri wears the role like skin, and somehow makes us feel compassion 
for this one-time cabaret singer who, as the wife of Juan Peron, became a 
selfish, hard-hearted despot exploiting the dreams and plundering the wealth of 
the Argentine people. 
</P>
<P>
 We wait in vain for Eva to say something intelligent or insightful, but the 
secret of her success remains pure charisma coupled with a bottomless appetite 
for power. 
</P>
<P>
 Her icy character is established early on, when we see her handing out 
autographed photos to her discarded lovers, assembly-line style ("Good Night 
and Thank You"). Even her first meeting with Peron (a very believable David 
Wasson) is steeped in the mutual admiration between two sharks as they sing 
"I'd Be Surprisingly Good for You." 
</P>
<P>
 In the dynamic chemistry between Perri and Wasson, Eva emerges as the catalyst 
for the couple's increasing consolidation of power. But in the end, we pity her 
as she struggles with the cancer that would end her life at age 33 and agonizes 
over the irony of having triumphed over her enemies only to be "defeated by my 
own weak body." 
</P>
<P>
 The willingness of a democratic society to abdicate its freedoms and embrace 
Eva's excesses is the ominous legacy of her career. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Bowman's Che (a character invented by Hal Prince to give a unified voice 
to Eva's opponents) is torn by his love-hate relationship to all that Eva 
represents. 
</P>
<P>
 Her behavior may have been outrageous and reprehensible, but there's a 
compelling vitality to Eva (brilliantly established in an early dance number 
contrasting her fiery ensemble with a group of stiff, hollow British 
aristocrats). 
</P>
<P>
 With lyrics that speak to unsettling realities rather than the traditional 
escapism of music theater, Tim Rice crafted a powerful commentary on the role 
of glamour in politics, and inspired Andrew Lloyd Webber to compose his most 
accomplished score. Unlike the interchangeable tunes in subsequent Webber 
shows, the songs in "Evita" are as tightly woven with plot and character as the 
staging. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the perennial favorite, "Don't Cry for Me, Argentina," the SBCLO 
production boasts a particularly rousing version of "A New Argentina" to close 
the first act. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the third and best "Evita" we've seen from the Santa Barbara Civic 
Light Opera. In 1987, the show marked a turning point in the company's 
transition from community theater to professional status, and a limited run in 
1990 broke box office records at the Oxnard Civic Auditorium -- though with 
Lipschutz and Perri returning from the Oxnard production, the improvements here 
are more in the way of refinements than major differences. 
</P>
<P>
 God knows the last thing we want in a musical is something to think about -- 
but if we must, this tight, stylish, and striking production continues to be 
the SBCLO's most substantial ticket. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: "Evita" 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Through May 22, Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8, Sundays at 7 p.m.; 
matinees at 2 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Granada Theatre, 1216 State St. in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 * COST: $18-$29.50.

 If you've been by Nora's Bistro in Ojai this week, you may have noticed a 
life-size sign -- a waitress, Nora, holding a chalkboard featuring the day's 
specials -- located on the Montgomery Street side of the establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 So what? Well, the fact that she is still out there is significant. The city, 
cracking down on its enforcement of a 13-year-old sign ordinance, had 
determined that the sign (and another like it on the Ojai Avenue side of the 
restaurant) conflicted with the guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 But last week owner Amy Schneider and city officials worked a compromise. It 
allows the Montgomery Street sign to remain outside, with the other sign kept 
inside, but facing out. No doubt the move pleased customers -- at least the 
eight pages worth -- who signed a petition in support of the signs.

 Nora's is at 423 E. Ojai Ave.

 Folks at Mullarkey's in Oxnard plan to get into the spirit of the California 
Strawberry Festival today, when they begin serving the California Strawberry 
Tart Caribbean. Chef Timothy Banning will prepare this dish that beat out more 
than 400 entries to win the Strawberry Festival's Berry-Off Recipe Competition. 
The dessert is made of cream cheese, coconut, lime, and uh-huh, strawberries. 
</P>
<P>
 Mullarkey's is in the Radisson Suite Hotel at 2101 W. Vineyard Ave. The 
festival is May 21-22.

 It's not every restaurant that celebrates its first anniversary with bagpipes. 
But that's what Ron Horn, owner of Simi Valley's Buchanan Arms Restaurant & 
Pub, plans to do June 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Buchanan Arms, which has a 17-year-old sibling in Burbank owned by Horn and 
his parents, specializes in British fare. There's roast beef with Yorkshire 
pudding, shepherd's pie and fish and chips (the most popular dish, said Horn). 
The place also serves up steaks and burgers for those who prefer good old 
all-American food. 
</P>
<P>
 Horn has weekly Friday night sing-alongs and occasional special guests. This 
Saturday, Des Regan's Irish Band will make an appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 How did a guy whose speech sounds completely Californian came to own a 
Scottish/British pub? "I was born in Glasgow. We came here in 1963, when I was 
2 years old," said Horn. "I know I've lost my accent; I went to school in the 
Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 Buchanan Arms is at 5835 E. Los Angeles Ave.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; DEPENDABLE CLASSICS, WITH DEVOTION; MOST OF THIS ITALIAN 
FARE HITS ABOVE THE MARK. SOUPS SATISFY, THE SCAMPI IS ELEGANT AND THE GNOCCHI 
ARE SOFT AND LIGHT. 
</P>

<P>
 Every reviewer, crotchety from so much bad eating, carries his own acid tests: 
the simple dishes that chronically fail. 
</P>
<P>
 Why can no one, it seems, make good gnocchi? Why is the now-fashionable, 
ubiquitous Caesar salad generally so awful and rarely made with the simplicity 
and boldness it requires? Why is pasta so often overcooked, reduced to a 
flavorless mush that can't hold sauce properly? 
</P>
<P>
 But every reviewer gets surprised now and then -- a happy fact, no doubt, that 
makes up for everything. The surprises in this case come from Basilico, a 
relatively new restaurant tucked into a shopping center corner at Wood Ranch in 
Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Basilico is far from perfect. Some of the menu basics are decidedly 
lackluster. The service might, on a busy night, be harried and aloof. And it's 
pricey. 
</P>
<P>
 But Basilico also is one of only two or three restaurants in this region that 
handles a good number of the Italian classics with dependability, style and a 
devotion to prime ingredients -- in a word, with perfection. That is no small 
feat. 
</P>
<P>
 Eliano Gamboni is that rare chef whose culinary authority gets fully and 
unself-consciously communicated on the plate, be it a strikingly authentic 
veal-based pasta Bolognese, a breathtakingly deep Roman stracciatella soup, a 
stellar plate of asparagus done as it would be, in browned butter, in Milan. 
</P>
<P>
 Do start with one of the soups, each a dignified nod to the highest Italian 
cooking tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 Minestrone alla Genovese ($4.50) is a dense vegetable array in light 
olive-oil-streaked chicken broth: simple, fragrant, richly satisfying, ladled 
from its own single-order saucepan. The stracciatella ($4.50) is remarkably 
bracing and memorable for it: fresh spinach leaves coated in grana Padano 
cheese and egg in a heady caramel-colored beef broth. 
</P>
<P>
 Worthy appetizers include fried calamari ($8), air-light in the batter and 
ocean-sweet in the fish; and the simple caprese ($8), or fresh sweet mozzarella 
with thick tomato slices and fresh basil leaves. Peperoni arrosto ($8), in 
which roasted bell peppers, onions and tomatoes are topped with anchovies, gave 
glimmers of its lusty Mediterranean self but suffered from refrigerated 
ingredients clotted with clumps of gelled olive oil. 
</P>
<P>
 A special treat among starters, however, is scampi sulla Paglia ($10). Giant 
shrimp are lightly battered and flash-sauteed in lemon, garlic and butter and 
placed on a nest of straw-fried potatoes. The result is both rustic and 
elegant, subtle and bold. 
</P>
<P>
 To this reviewer's astonishment, however, the Caesar salad bombed. Indeed, it 
was ordered twice -- once at lunch and once at dinner -- just to be sure. How a 
kitchen of this sophistication can dress Romaine in supermarket-like goop 
mystifies. 
</P>
<P>
 A house salad of baby lettuces with goat cheese, however, is the way to go on 
the greens front; it is dressed lightly in lemon and olive oil ($5.50). Then 
again, a delightful salad alternative is the asparagus Milanese ($7.50), 
vividly green and still firm and dusted in imported Parmesan. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Caesar failed the acid test, the gnocchi -- something far more 
difficult to do well -- did not. In a simple dish of gnocchi al pomodoro 
($9.50), the gnocchi, potato dumplings, were soft and light as pillows and 
dressed minimally in a near-severe tomato/olive oil/garlic compote. Gnocchi of 
this quality recalibrate the standard for security food, rendering many other 
pastas, and, heaven knows, macaroni and cheese, pedestrian and pointless. 
</P>
<P>
 Penne alla Gorgonzola ($9) suffered, surprisingly. Again, in a dish far 
simpler than the gnocchi, the tube noodles were overcooked and the cheese sauce 
without Gorgonzola's characteristic pungency. But fettucine alla Bolognese 
($12) was the real thing: firm noodles dressed in velvety, amber, fatless, 
fresh ground veal sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Basilico sells a lot of pizza of the individual 12-inch variety. Surprises 
were in store here, as well. The uptown pizza -- or Portofino ($10), in which a 
thin crust arrived smeared in pesto, garlic, Nicoise olives and goat cheese -- 
was decadently delicious, original and satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
 But the acid test pizza -- the classic Margherita ($8.50), or plain cheese and 
tomato -- was an unforgivable bore: marred by a flavorless sauce and awash in 
less-than-fresh mozzarella. 
</P>
<P>
 Entree specials of grilled swordfish ($16.50) and chicken Valdostana ($15.50) 
were handled with perfection. The sparklingly fresh fish was grill-seared on 
the outside, locking in tenderness and juice. The breast-meat chicken, 
pan-seared before topping with first-quality imported prosciutto and fresh 
mozzarella and a woodsy mushroom reduction sauce, was aggressively flavorsome 
and rewarding. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is worth noting that these dishes were taken in slightly downsized 
portions at lunch at prices that, plainly, were shockingly high and more in 
line with dinner pricing. 
</P>
<P>
 For dessert do not miss the Cassata Palermitana ($5), an extravagantly 
flavorsome slice of Sicilian vanilla ice cream with candied orange peels and 
almonds. Tiramisu ($5) wins runner-up status with Basilico's own "moussed"

 Basilico's wine list is small but wide-ranging. Pricing is neither a bargain 
nor a gouge, but some selections are better values than others. Orvietto 
Classico by Vaselli ($18) is a soft, floral white that suits much of Basilico's 
cuisine, as does the sturdy red Dolcetto d'Alba Azelia '91 ($20). 
</P>
<P>
 More robust palates, however, might choose to pay full markup for the resonant 
Chianti Classico Badia a Coltibuono '91 ($28). 
</P>
<P>
 House wines by the glass are perfectly good -- a light Pinot Grigio and 
Bardolino -- but, at $4.50, small in the pour. Details

PERSONAL BEST: A CLOSE-UP LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO MATTER; DIGGING UP A TROVE OF 
MEMORIES

 In 1966, when Ted E. Gutman was a 56-year-old businessman, he took his first 
class in archeology through UCLA Extension. That was the start of a love affair 
with artifacts and pickaxes that has consumed him for nearly 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, after actively volunteering in support of UCLA's archeology department, 
participating in more than 100 digs, giving talks on archeology to Los Angeles 
Unified School District students, and raising money to support graduate 
students' research, Gutman, 84, is leaving Sherman Oaks for the Bay Area to be 
closer to his daughter, Carol. 
</P>
<P>
 Called an inspiration to young and old alike for his enthusiasm and 
dedication, Gutman was out on digs up to the age of 82, when he quit at his 
wife's insistence. The excavations have taken him as far as Mexico, Guatemala, 
Belize and Costa Rica. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's extremely active, and he doesn't seem to grow old," said James N. Hill, 
chairman of the university's anthropology department. "He looks the same as he 
did 25 years ago." It was Hill who, as an assistant professor, taught the class 
that got Gutman hooked on archeology. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Thursday, professors, graduate students and friends toasted Gutman for 
his contributions to the department at a farewell reception at UCLA's Fowler 
Museum of Cultural History. Among those who regretfully said goodby were Hill 
and museum Director Christopher B. Donnan. 
</P>
<P>
 Gutman played host to some visitors last week and, wearing a broad-brimmed 
straw hat and showing off a Costa Rican machete, he looked ready to hack a path 
to the nearest excavation site. As he talked about his life, he had little 
problem remembering dates and facts. 
</P>
<P>
 The German immigrant's passion for the past began as a high school student in 
Germany, where he began to study ancient Greek and Roman history.  
</P>
<P>
 After receiving a law degree from the University of Jena, Gutman was working 
in a district attorney's office when he received a job termination notice from 
the Justice Ministry. The year was 1933, and Hitler was just beginning to roll 
out his oppressive policies against Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was getting difficult to do anything as a Jew," Gutman recalled. 
"Gradually it was getting worse. For the first time in your life, you no longer 
were a full citizen." 
</P>
<P>
 He fled Germany that year and lived in Barcelona, New York and New Orleans 
before coming to Los Angeles in 1938 to work as a salesman for a manufacturer 
of smoking pipes. The following year, Gutman married, and with his wife, Ruth, 
reared two daughters, Carol and Margie, settling in Sherman Oaks in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
 During World War II, Gutman became an officer in the U.S. Army. In a twist of 
fate, Gutman, a Jew who had been persecuted by the Nazis, was put in charge of 
a unit that interrogated German prisoners of war. 
</P>
<P>
 After the war, he returned to the pipe business, eventually becoming a partner 
in a wholesale company that supplied pipes, imported cigarettes and smoking 
accessories. 
</P>
<P>
 Gutman retired in 1973. By that time, he was on his way to becoming one of the 
most active volunteers working to support UCLA's archeology department. In 
1967, he joined the UCLA Friends of Archaeology, which raises money for 
graduate student fellowships, and for which he has served as president and 
awards committee chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 The retiree became the second person to earn a certificate in archeology from 
UCLA Extension in 1979. A year earlier, he began giving talks to schoolchildren 
through the Fowler Museum's Target Program on such topics as human evolution 
and pre-Columbian cultures of Mexico and Central America.  
</P>
<P>
 Gutman developed a talk on the cultures of "Middle America" because he thought 
it would be interesting to the many Latino students in the school district, and 
would boost their cultural pride, said Charlene Singleton, a docent in the 
Target Program. 
</P>
<P>
 Singleton, a North Hollywood retiree, credits Gutman for getting her 
interested in archeology and for motivating her to complete the certificate 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been an inspiration," said Bill Hermann, a Studio City retiree and 
amateur archeologist. "He has shown me how one can use one's retirement to keep 
active, both physically and mentally, by going on digs."

TITAN PLAN FOCUSES ON ASSIMILATION; ACADEMICS: MAKING BLACK ATHLETES FEEL AT 
HOME IN COLLEGE COMMUNITY IS KEY TO SUCCESS IN THE CLASSROOM, DIRECTORS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Cal State Fullerton's most recent NCAA graduation-rates report confirmed John 
Reid's belief that many African American male athletes are not performing well 
academically -- of the 34 who enrolled and received financial aid in 1985-86, 
only five (15%) graduated within six years. 
</P>
<P>
 But Reid, a 51-year-old Fullerton graduate student who played football and ran 
track at Norfolk (Va.) State University, didn't need any official statistics to 
grasp the severity of the problem. He got a first-hand look at it in the fall 
of 1992 when he was asked by a Titan assistant basketball coach to tutor a few 
black players. 
</P>
<P>
 "One kid was borderline illiterate, but he was classified as a senior because 
his basketball eligibility had taken him to that level," said Reid, who 
declined to name the player. "I worked with the kid, but when he ran out of 
eligibility, he dropped out of school." 
</P>
<P>
 From his experiences as a black athlete and through discussions with others, 
Reid formed several opinions as to why many don't succeed in college. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them: Too many consider sports, not academics, their only vehicle to 
success. Too many neglect school, believing a lucrative professional career 
awaits after college. Too many colleges exploit them, generating enormous sums 
of money off sporting events without doing enough to ensure student-athletes' 
academic success. 
</P>
<P>
 But rather than harping on the problem, Reid spent months devising what he 
hopes is part of a solution. The result is the Black Ombudsman Program (BOP), a 
comprehensive academic, cultural, family and community outreach plan designed 
to improve the overall quality of college life for black athletes at Fullerton 
and increase their chances for success both during and after school. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot program, funded by Fullerton's Educational Equity office, began Feb. 
1 and includes 10 Titan basketball players. It does not focus primarily on 
academics. Rather, it strives to foster black athletes' assimilation into their 
campus and community during a time when many feel isolated. Better grades, 
program supporters believe, will be a byproduct. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to create an environment where kids are excited about going to 
school, or if not excited, at least not hating it," said Christine McCarthy, 
Fullerton's director of athletic academic services. "I don't want them going to 
school just to maintain their eligibility. Then, they're losing the best part 
of the university experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Spring semester grades aren't issued until the end of May, but both Reid, who 
coordinates the program, and Al Whitten, a former Titan football player who is 
the BOP assistant coordinator, said several players have shown progress through 
mid-term reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton junior point guard James French, a BOP participant who began the 
semester with a 2.3 grade-point average, said he's on course for a 2.8 or 3.0 
this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "By improving yourself, your grades are going to improve," French said. "Part 
of the program is self-love -- you learn who you are, where you came from. You 
develop confidence in yourself, and like in sports, the more confident you are, 
the better you'll play." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton basketball Coach Brad Holland said it's too early to determine the 
effects of the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we have high hopes for it," he said. "There are some good ideas, and 
we're hoping by the end of next spring the program will be in full bloom, and 
we'll bear its fruits." 
</P>
<P>
 Reid, plucking ideas from various research studies and articles about black 
student-athletes, modeled the program in a five-point star system -- the 
student in center, surrounded by five BOP components -- family, Afrocentricity, 
peer outreach, faculty and BOP administration/counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 BOP administrators and counselors coordinate the program, recruit students for 
it, provide motivation and support, track students' academic progress, and 
provide academic counseling or referrals to specific departments for such 
services. A look at the other four BOP components: 
</P>
<P>
 * Family: The BOP strives to strengthen the link between participants, their 
families and the university by sending families periodic newsletters updating 
them about their sons' school activities, maintaining phone contact with them 
and facilitating contact between participants and various faculty members, 
counselors and administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 BOP participants are also serving as Big Brothers to 10 young black boys, all 
but one from single-parent households, from Walter Knott Elementary School in 
Buena Park. The program aims to provide youngsters with positive black male 
role models and teach participants about self-responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "One player, Darren Little, even spent a weekend with the boy's family, so 
he's taken it beyond what we hoped," Whitten said. "He's trying to make a 
difference in a boy's life, but at the same time it gives him something. 
Darren's family is in Georgia, so the boy's family has become part of Darren's 
extended family." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Reid, who is working toward a master's degree in counseling: "It forces 
guys to right their ships, because now these little boys are looking up to 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 * Afrocentricity: Every Friday, BOP coordinators hold two-hour sessions, in 
which they hope to build self-esteem, dignity and pride in participants through 
cultural awareness. The group, which also meets informally several times a 
week, also focuses on specific issues -- one recent subject, for instance, was 
how black males cope with anger. 
</P>
<P>
 * Peer outreach: BOP counselors want the players to adopt a code for black 
male behavioral conduct, which calls for them to, among other things, stop 
name-calling one another, cursing one another, being discourteous toward one 
another, stealing from one another, fighting one another, killing one another 
and using and selling drugs to one another. 
</P>
<P>
 "These things are contrary to the goals most of us in society are trying to 
accomplish," said Whitten, who hopes BOP can expand to include males and 
females, athletes and non-athletes. "We're trying to reverse the behavior we've 
seen for so many years." 
</P>
<P>
 * Faculty: Select Fullerton faculty members are working with players to 
identify academic deficiencies and correct them. BOP coordinators are 
encouraging players to develop relationships with their professors, visit them 
during office hours, sit in the front row of the classroom and, most important, 
go to class. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of athletes cut class," said Whitten, a senior kinesiology major with a 
3.2 GPA. "I've been in classes with a few athletes who you'd see at the 
beginning of the semester and then the end. What happened in between? 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't go to class because they think it's not important. They think 
they're going to the pros. But the chances of making the pros are slim and 
none, so let's deal with reality." 
</P>
<P>
 Reality for many black college athletes is being at a large, predominantly 
white university far away from home, with few black coaches or faculty members 
to serve as positive role models. 
</P>
<P>
 It's spending so much time in sports that there's not enough energy to devote 
to other school activities. It's being intimidated by the vast academic 
bureaucracy, not knowing where to turn for help. 
</P>
<P>
 It's isolation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without this program, you'd go on feeling isolated," French said. "A lot of 
times you'll feel uncomfortable trying to get into different study groups, 
different things on campus, because you're like an outsider. 
</P>
<P>
 "But this is like an extended family. I feel comfortable getting help, and I 
feel I have more resources available to me to do well. I don't feel so alone, 
like I'm doing everything myself. A lot of guys try, but you can't make it in 
college by yourself." Graduating From Cal State Fullerton

JIM MURRAY: HE'S BEST YOU NEVER HEARD OF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The subject for today is "So you think you know baseball?" Only, it's not one 
of those magazine quizzes. ("If three men hit third base at the same time, one 
returning to the bag, one arriving from second and one from first, who, if 
anybody, is out?") 
</P>
<P>
 No, this is on the practical level. I would like to ask the quizee to identify 
the player who is certifiably one of the four or five best in the game, 
certainly one of the best hitters, and he probably couldn't cash a small 
personal check out of state. 
</P>
<P>
 I'll give you a hint: His last name begins with a B. No, not Barry Bonds! You 
think Bonds would have trouble cashing a check anywhere? 
</P>
<P>
 Are you ready? OK, his name is Jeff Bagwell. There'll be a short pause now 
while you all say "Who?" and begin scratching at your ears to be sure you heard 
right. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jeff Bagwell is one of the best players in the game today?" you sneer. "Get 
oudda here!" 
</P>
<P>
 You heard me. Jeff Bloody Bagwell. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, I know you've never heard of him. He plays for Houston. Nobody ever heard 
of anybody who ever played for Houston except for Nolan Ryan. It's kind of 
baseball's foreign legion. They play the game indoors and for years their 
outfield was just smaller than Rhode Island. There were eight no-hit games 
pitched in their ballpark in its 30-year history and more than 30 one-hitters. 
There were 34 inside-the-park home runs hit there. Babe Ruth might have been a 
contact hitter there. 
</P>
<P>
 They've moved the fences in (by moving home plate out) but the Astrodome is 
still a long way from a band box. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, when a guy makes the big leagues after only parts of two years in the 
minors (where he easily batted more than .300) he comes up to the big show with 
flags flying, horns blaring, and can't-miss written all over his dossier. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Bagwell looks so little like the part, pitchers think there should be a 
law against it. He should carry a warning from the surgeon general or somebody. 
Might be injurious to your health. 
</P>
<P>
 First of all, he's average-sized for baseball, only six feet, 195 pounds. You 
look at his statistics and you picture a 6-foot-5 giant with a blue-black 
beard, a chaw of tobacco in his cheek and a perpetual snarl. Jeff Bagwell looks 
as if he's going to sell you a vacuum cleaner. He's almost baby-faced. You 
imagine Billy the Kid looked like this. Until he drew. 
</P>
<P>
 Willie Mays batted .274 his first full season in the major leagues. Henry 
Aaron hit .280, Mickey Mantle, .267 -- and Barry Bonds, .223, if it comes to 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Bagwell hit .294 his first year. In his "sophomore jinx" year, he hit 
.273. But he drove in 96 runs and hit 18 home runs. Last year, he hit .320, 
sixth in the league. 
</P>
<P>
 But do the pitchers fear him? Pitch around him? Well, they walked Bonds 126 
times last year and 43 of them were intentional. They walked Bagwell six times 
intentionally, only 62 overall. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, maybe he has this piercing Ted Williams eyesight that can calibrate the 
spin even as it leaves the pitcher's hand? 
</P>
<P>
 He wears contact lenses. 
</P>
<P>
 He is like the choirboy who turns out to be a serial killer. He makes pitchers 
overconfident. They bear down on the Tony Gwynns, the Barry Bondses, Ryne 
Sandbergs and David Justices. They treat Bagwell as if he came to drag the 
infield or rake the batter's box. 
</P>
<P>
 You get ballplayers from California, Texas, Florida or one or all of the 
Caribbean islands. You don't get them from Connecticut. You don't get them from 
places where the season is six weeks long and you have to make do with a 
batting cage the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 That was a mistake the Boston Red Sox made. As a New England boy, Bagwell 
would have been made to order for the "Sawks." They drafted him out of college 
(University of Hartford), where he had batted .413. His favorite ballplayer was 
Carl Yastrzemski, and they probably should have given him his shot at that 
left-field wall in Fenway on that alone. But sentiment ranks low in the grand 
old game, and the Red Sox schlepped him away to Houston for a 38-year-old 
right-handed relief pitcher in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 If he played in New York, he might not be a candy bar by now, but he could 
cash a check and get asked for his autograph. He would probably have his own 
tabloid headline name "Bags Tags Dodgers With Homer in 11th." 
</P>
<P>
 In Houston, he doesn't get to swagger. He's batting .331 (78 points higher 
than Bonds). He leads the league in runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 He was rookie of the year in 1991, thus joining a pretty distinguished cast of 
characters (Willie Mays, Johnny Bench, Pete Rose and Jackie Robinson, to name a 
few). 
</P>
<P>
 He bats cleanup for the Houston Astros, but he might as well play in a mask. 
He's as anonymous as a Swiss bank. He is modest. "I'm not a No. 4 hitter," he 
complains. "I'm probably a No. 3 hitter. Bonds is a No. 4 hitter. Joe Carter." 
</P>
<P>
 The other night, with a 1-0 lead, Dodger pitcher Tom Candiotti forgot who was 
batting and started Bagwell with a fastball you throw to a No. 8 hitter. A 
moment later, it was in the left-field pavilion. A fan in a food line was 
startled. "Who was that?" he wondered. "Houston first baseman," he was told. 
"What's his name -- Birdwell?" the fan wanted to know. "Bagwell," he was told. 
"Bagwell? Is he new?" "No," he was told. "That's his eighth homer this year 
already. That's his 61st home run in four years." The fan grumbled. "Who does 
he think he is, Barry Bonds?" 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the season, Bonds might wish he was Jeff Bagwell.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Free-agent linebacker Joe Kelly agreed to a one-year $500,000 contract with 
the Rams on Wednesday, his agent, Steve Feldman, said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly, cut by the Raiders three weeks ago despite being the starting middle 
linebacker, chose the Rams' offer over one from the Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
 "The decision came down to Joe's relationship with (Ram linebacker coach) Dick 
Selcer," Feldman said. "Dick was the linebackers coach at Cincinnati when Joe 
was drafted there." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly, second on the Raiders in tackles last season with 103, probably will be 
a backup to Shane Conlan at middle linebacker and Roman Phifer and Henry 
Rolling at outside linebacker. MIKE REILLEY

 The most interesting matchup with the New York Knicks and the Chicago Bulls 
used to be Michael Jordan against the whole Knick team. Now it is Pat Riley 
against Phil Jackson. Sometimes you wish you could put them both out there in 
their elegant clothes and let Jackson throw elbows at Riley, the way he used to 
throw elbows at everybody. Then Riley could put his head down and try to run 
over Jackson, which is the way he played when he got off the bench. They would 
both feel a lot better. Riley and Jackson do not like each other at all, 
whatever lies they tell this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley thinks Jackson tries to steal big games by complaining to referees. 
Jackson has always thought there was a lot to complain about, because Riley has 
a dirty team. We always go from there. Even when they try to say nice things 
about each other, you are afraid they will choke on them. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, Jackson called Riley "one of the classiest people in the league." 
Then there was Riley after his own practice, saying Jackson is a "great" coach. 
After that, Riley talked about Jackson's discipline and said it is all right 
there for you when you break down the tapes, something Riley would rather do 
than eat. 
</P>
<P>
 And when he was done with all that, the Knick coach smiled, because he still 
does that once or twice a month during the playoffs, and said, "My feeling 
about that has nothing to do with the fact that he whines now and then." 
</P>
<P>
 Riley was asked why and said, "It's all for the edge." 
</P>
<P>
 The two coaches in this series are bright, fascinating men. If they quit 
tomorrow, they both go to the Hall of Fame. But both want more. Both still have 
something to prove, and not just to each other. Riley lost Magic Johnson a 
while ago. This is Jackson's first season without Jordan. Jackson tries to win 
another championship without the best player in the world on his side. Riley 
has been trying to do the same since he arrived in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley also tries to become the second coach in NBA history to win 
championships with two teams. Alex Hannum did it with the St. Louis Hawks in 
the 1957-58 season and the storied Philadelphia 76er team of 1966-67. There is 
as much on the line here for the coaches as the players, whether these things 
are discussed or not. Riley has four championships already, Jackson three. 
There has never been a one-on-one game for coaches quite like this. Because 
what they have is not enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just two different teams with Pat," Knick assistant Dick Harter 
said. "It's two completely different styles of play. That's the important 
thing. Most guys when they move from one place to another take everything with 
them. Not Pat." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Bulls win a fourth consecutive title without Jordan, it will go down as 
one of the great basketball accomplishments of all time and can only make 
Jackson bigger. A title in New York does the same for Riley. For years in Los 
Angeles, he heard that anyone could coach Magic and Worthy and Abdul-Jabbar to 
NBA titles. Now he has won 166 regular-season games in three seasons with the 
Knicks and made it to the conference finals last season. The only thing left, 
as a way of showing everybody, is winning it all in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson and the Bulls are once again in Riley's way. They are always in the 
way this time of year. Someone asked Riley on Tuesday if the Knicks have the 
same respect for the Bulls they once had. "We have not earned the right to not 
have respect for anybody," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again we find out there is so much to this series, even without Jordan. 
You start with the two cities. New York doesn't worry too much about Chicago, 
but there are always hard feelings coming the other way, along with the usual 
Second City insecurities. You have Ewing and Bill Cartwright, who played 
together once, and Charles Oakley, who came to the Knicks in the Cartwright 
trade. And there is Scottie Pippen, who would also like to win a title without 
having to pass the ball to Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley vs. Jackson just makes it all better. Both say this is all about the 
players in the end. Neither really wants to believe that. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley was asked if he thinks a coach can successfully lobby the referees at 
this time of year. Jackson clearly thinks so. He usually starts crying about 
the referees before the series and doesn't stop until his team gets ahead. Last 
year, Riley waited until the series was 2-2 before he said Ewing didn't get 
enough respect from the referees, or enough free throws. Then Ewing and the 
Knicks got what seemed like a hundred free throws in Game 5; they just couldn't 
make them. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Referees) are too smart for that," Riley said. Then he was talking about 
Sunday's game, and pointing out that the game was being officiated the same way 
when the Bulls were ahead 15 points as when they fell apart. "We outrebounded 
them, 16-8, in the fourth quarter," Riley said. "Eight of those rebounds were 
offensive. . . . When you do that, good things are going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Riley has not looked for an edge yet with the referees, because he has a 2-0 
edge in the series after Wednesday's 96-91 Knick victory. That will come later, 
maybe when the series moves to Chicago Stadium Friday night. Jackson, of 
course, started to lobby as soon as Game 1 was over. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all coach-ese," Riley said. "All about the edge." 
</P>
<P>
 Ewing has so much on the line here, because he has never won in the pros. 
Pippen has a lot on the line. But so do the coaches. They look for the edge, 
and try to win again, Phil Jackson without Jordan this time, Pat Riley without 
Magic. Both have made history. It just feels too much like someone else's 
history. Now they fight to make some of their own.

NO MORE 'RAH RAH RAH' FOR THOMAS; PRO BASKETBALL: PISTON GUARD RETIRES AT 33, 
SAYING HE NO LONGER HAS THE ENERGY TO PLAY AT HIS ACCUSTOMED LEVEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Isiah Thomas, one of the best point guards in basketball history, made it 
official Wednesday: It's time to let go of the game that has had such a 
powerful hold on his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, 33, who led the Detroit Pistons to two NBA championships during 13 
seasons in the league, announced his retirement at a news conference packed 
with old teammates, friends and family. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement was a formality. Thomas had made it clear he was finished 
when he tore his Achilles' tendon April 19. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a special day," said Thomas, fingering a large NBA championship ring 
on his left hand. "The hardest thing for an athlete to do is to know when to 
quit. When do you let go of the thing that has shaped your entire life? 
</P>
<P>
 "This basketball, it's so powerful. It's your whole life." 
</P>
<P>
 It had been thought that Thomas would hold off on his retirement until after 
July 1 to help the team's salary cap. But he and Bill Davidson, the Pistons' 
managing partner, said that was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 The team would be limited to half of Thomas' $2.52-million salary in either 
case, they said, because he is retiring. Only if Thomas were leaving to play 
for another team could the Pistons use his entire salary slot to sign other 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Achilles' injury wasn't the problem," Thomas said. "I'll be walking next 
week. The thing that makes me good is the energy and intensity I can bring to 
the game every night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have that type of energy anymore. I don't have that rah, rah rah 
anymore. There's just no more energy left in my body." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas led the Pistons to NBA championships in 1989 and 1990 and scored more 
than 18,000 points. 
</P>
<P>
 NBA Commissioner David Stern called Thomas one of basketball's finest players. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas also was hailed by two recent retirees -- Magic Johnson and Larry Bird. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a fierce competitor, leaving everything he had on the court," Johnson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Bird: "To me, Isiah was one of the players who raised the level of 
competition in the NBA up another notch." 
</P>
<P>
 It was thought the Pistons would offer Thomas a management position when he 
retired, but those plans are on hold. Isiah Thomas' Career Highlights

IRVINE'S O'BRIEN CONQUERS NERVES, NATION'S BEST; SWIMMING: SOPHOMORE GAINED 
CONFIDENCE BY WINNING 50 FREESTYLE AT U.S. JUNIOR NATIONALS. NOW, SHE TURNS HER 
ATTENTION TO THE SOUTHERN SECTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With a long "umm" and a shrug of her shoulders, Wendy O'Brien says she figures 
things started to click in March when she was in Grand Forks, N.D. 
</P>
<P>
 It was there, at the Junior Nationals swim meet, that the 15-year-old Irvine 
High School sophomore won the 50-yard freestyle in 23.64 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 "That (meet) was really important. It boosted my confidence and showed me that 
I could beat these other girls," O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those girls were some of the nation's fastest teen-age swimmers. Her time put 
her in a class generally occupied by top college swimmers who compete in the 
Senior Nationals. 
</P>
<P>
 And O'Brien is now swimming better than ever. She was named swimmer of the 
meet last month at the Foothill Swim Games, where she set a meet record in the 
50 free and came within a 10th of a second of breaking the 100 free record. She 
won both her events last week at Sea View League championships, setting a meet 
record in the 50 free. With the Southern Section Division II championships 
coming up Saturday, she feels confident. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really looking forward to this meet," said O'Brien, who counts Lana 
Stacey of Arcadia and Judy Thomas of Walnut as her chief rivals in the 50 and 
100 freestyles. "I'm kind of nervous, and I want to do good. Especially since I 
didn't have a good meet last year." 
</P>
<P>
 As a freshman, O'Brien made it to the section final in each event, but was not 
pleased when she finished fifth in the 100 and sixth in the 50. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was really upset after (the section finals) last year," Irvine Coach 
Scott Hinman said. "But she was a different girl then than she is now. Last 
year, she was easily intimidated. Just looking at the times posted would get 
her nervous." 
</P>
<P>
 Hinman said O'Brien now has a trait common to most great athletes -- 
confidence. "She's not cocky," Hinman said. "She just knows that instead of her 
chasing these girls, they're going to have to chase her." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien has the county's fastest freestyle times in the 50 (23.93) and the 100 
(51.98). And since her Junior National victory, she has drawn attention from 
UCLA and North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to her mental maturity, Hinman said O'Brien is physically 
stronger, particularly in her upper body. She attributes that to workouts at 
the Irvine Novaquatics club, which include about 30 minutes of daily dry-land 
drills with weighted balls, and high intensity sprint-style swimming drills 
that are stressed instead of long sets of yardage. 
</P>
<P>
 Novaquatics Coach David Salo said O'Brien can be one of the nation's best. And 
he said the Junior Nationals were a key in her outlook. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her workout ethic has changed, and she is now starting to understand the 
training aspect of swimming. She is beginning to learn how to train," said 
Salo, who has been coaching O'Brien for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Salo remembers it, there have also been some stormy times between the 
two. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a slacker. And there were times when I had to kick her out, and she 
would start crying," Salo said. "But now, she is beginning to understand." Salo 
said O'Brien is fortunate to be surrounded by other girls who have good workout 
habits, including El Toro's Katie Lowes. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowes, also a sophomore, and O'Brien have been developing a rivalry lately. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I made some corrections in workouts," Salo said, "I wanted to team Wendy 
with some of the girls who have a good workout ethic. I think Katie helps 
Wendy, and I think Wendy helps Katie. It's going to be interesting next year 
when El Toro joins the Sea View League." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien just smiles at that prospect. "I guess it will be fun," she said. "It 
will be tough for us with them in the league. But that's good." 
</P>
<P>
 A late bloomer, O'Brien started swimming with the Newport Beach YMCA at age 9. 
When she started to win some local meets, she told her father that she wanted 
to make the move to club swimming. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when we joined the Novas," said Phil O'Brien, Wendy's father. "From 
the beginning, I never had some grand plans for Wendy. My attitude has always 
been to do it for the love of it. It's got to be fun." 
</P>
<P>
 But there were times, when all the training and aging up to 11-12-year-old 
group put a damper on the fun, and Wendy talked of quitting. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very frustrating," O'Brien said. "When you age up, you have to swim 
against all these girls who are faster than you. You have to start all over 
trying to get to the top." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Phil: "When she talked of quitting, I've always told her to finish the 
season out. And if she still wanted to quit, then she can quit. And with Coach 
Salo, when she moved into his senior group, it was kind of rough for her. She 
wanted to leave, and we had meetings with him. But we seemed to get through it 
all, and now, she can't wait to get to a workout." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to her dad, O'Brien said her mother, Betty Lou, has been very 
supportive. Not overbearing, but "always there." 
</P>
<P>
 "My mom and dad have been great," she said. "And even though my dad gets me 
nervous sometimes, I'm glad they are there." 
</P>
<P>
 All section swimming finals will be at Belmont Plaza pool in Long Beach. 
Division I will be at 7 p.m. Friday. Division III will be at noon Saturday, 
followed by Division II at 7 p.m. Southern Section Swimming Preview 
</P>
<P>
 BOYS 
</P>
<P>
 DIVISION I -- Expect Mission Viejo, Woodbridge, El Toro and Marina to battle 
for the title. Woodbridge's Derya Buyukuncu could set a section or national 
record; the Turkish Olympian will swim the 50 freestyle and 100 backstroke and 
already has the national high school record in the back. Mission Viejo's Bart 
Sikora is expected to dominate the 500 freestyle. In the 200 free, Dawson 
Hughes of Woodbridge and Villa Park's Matt Cornue should be top finishers. Also 
look for senior Jason Lezak of Irvine in the 50 and 100 freestyles; his fast 
starts could be a factor. Sophomores to watch include Irvine's Steve Ronson 
(county's fastest time of the year in the 100 breaststroke) and Mission Viejo's 
Karl Hyross (200 individual medley, 500 freestyle). Santa Margarita's Phillipe 
Demers, probably the only freshman who will make it to a final, may be the one 
to beat in the 100 butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
 DIVISION II -- Defending champion La Crescenta Crescenta Valley is expected to 
be a strong contender, but Sunny Hills and Los Alamitos could offer some 
surprises. Ones to watch in individual competition: Los Alamitos' Tim Haney, 
Eric Ploessel and Carlo Franzia and Seann Schiele of Sunny Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 DIVISION III -- Laguna Hills was last year's champion and has a good chance of 
repeating behind Mark Kwok. But watch for Trabuco Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 GIRLS 
</P>
<P>
 DIVISION I -- The team competition should boil down to defending champion El 
Toro and South Coast League champion Mission Viejo. Junior Teresa Mauck of San 
Clemente and Mission Viejo's Cheryl Murphy likely will be top finishers in the 
200 individual medley, and Murphy, who swam a blistering 56.52 in the 100 
backstroke at the league finals, should dominate that event. Katie Lowes of El 
Toro will be the one to beat in the 100 and 200 freestyles. Nancy Jo of El 
Dorado, Cathy Carone of Capistrano Valley and Lisa Hess of Canyon should 
provide a close race in the 100 butterfly. Amber Wines of Santa Ana Valley and 
Katie Simmons of El Toro should perform well in the 100 breaststroke, and 
Alison Mijares, who has the second-fastest time in the county in 500 freestyle, 
figures to be one of Marina's top finishers. 
</P>
<P>
 DIVISION II -- Defending champion Walnut will probably be the one to beat. But 
expect Irvine, third last year, to challenge. Individuals to watch: Irvine's 
Wendy O'Brien (top-seeded in the 50 and 100 freestyle); Newport Harbor's Rachel 
Arrow, freshman Melissa Pomeroy and Melissa Schutz; Dana Nakaya and Jamiee 
Lindstrom of Woodbridge; Mater Dei's Melanie Chiang; Tustin's Mai Khan Nguyen, 
and Giana Johnson of Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 DIVISION III -- Powerhouse San Luis Obispo is expected to dominate; Kennedy 
will probably be the only county team that fares well. In individual events, 
Kennedy's Wendy Martin could win the 500 freestyle (fastest time in the county 
this year, 5:00.05) and also do well in the 200 free.

KATELLA SOFTBALL COACH FIRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Katella High has fired softball Coach Rhonda Weyer, who pushed an athlete from 
Esperanza during a game last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Weyer, a walk-on, had coached the Knights eight seasons.Athletic Director 
Linda Whitney will coach the team, which is winless in the Empire League this 
season, in its final game today. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very distressed, embarrassed and regret the incident," Katella 
Principal Jerry Glenn said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn said a videotape of the incident showed that Weyer did not knock down 
umpire Mike Callahan, as Callahan alleged in his report to the Southern Section 
office. "Everyone was standing on their feet except our player, who was laying 
on the plate," Glenn said. "Again, we regret this incident. It's not the kind 
of sportsmanship we expect from all of our athletes and coaches." 
</P>
<P>
 Weyer was ejected from Thursday's Esperanza-Katella game after a play at home. 
Esperanza catcher Julia Cappelli dived to tag Mendy Van Son, who was sliding 
home. Weyer rushed to Van Son's aid, pushing aside Callahan and then Cappelli. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't want to comment," Weyer said. "There was no intent of harming 
anyone. I was just going to my player's aid." 
</P>
<P>
 Callahan said Monday by telephone from Philadelphia that he did not eject 
Weyer for the contact with him: "It was a flash. I got pushed. I bumped into 
people. As far as I'm concerned, I fell down. If the videotape shows that I 
didn't fall down, then I didn't. But I was pushed hard from the rear and made 
contact with the players in front of me. I certainly didn't eject her for what 
she did to me."

SOFTBALL TITLES, PLAYOFF FIELD STILL NOT SETTLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 There's plenty at stake in today's softball games. If not league 
championships, certainly playoff berths. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the event of ties, coin flips will determine who gets preferential 
treatment from the Southern Section's playoff selection committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference between being No. 1 from a league and No. 2 could be the 
difference between being seeded or facing a tough team early in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Each league's top three teams get automatic berths. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's what is at stake in the last two days of the regular season: 
</P>
<P>
 DIVISION I 
</P>
<P>
 CENTURY -- Clinched: Foothill (20-6, 8-1), Villa Park (16-9, 7-2). Undecided: 
If El Modena (10-12, 5-4) beats Foothill, the Vanguards are third. If they 
lose, and Canyon (12-9, 4-5) beats Villa Park, Canyon is third through 
tiebreakers. Orange (12-9, 3-6) could get an at-large berth with a victory and 
Canyon loss. 
</P>
<P>
 EMPIRE -- Clinched: Los Alamitos (20-4, 9-0), El Dorado (17-7, 7-2), Cypress 
(15-5, 6-3). Undecided: If Cypress beats El Dorado, coin flip determines No. 2 
entry. 
</P>
<P>
 GARDEN GROVE -- Clinched: Kennedy (19-5-1, 11-1-1), Pacifica (17-5-1, 11-1-1). 
Undecided: At worst, La Quinta (15-8, 8-5) has tiebreaker advantages over 
Garden Grove (16-11, 8-5) and Rancho Alamitos (12-8, 7-6) for an at-large 
berth. Rancho holds the tiebreaker advantage over Garden Grove. Rancho plays 
Santiago (8-14, 2-11) and Garden Grove plays Bolsa Grande (7-14, 4-9). 
</P>
<P>
 SOUTH COAST -- Clinched: El Toro (20-8, 8-1), Mater Dei (18-5, 7-2). 
Undecided: Capistrano Valley (14-8, 5-4) plays Mater Dei. San Clemente (9-13-1, 
4-5) can get in if it beats Dana Hills, Capistrano Valley loses, and San 
Clemente wins Friday's playoff. 
</P>
<P>
 SUNSET -- Clinched: Marina (20-2, 12-1), Fountain Valley (14-8-1, 10-3). 
Undecided: If Ocean View (16-6, 9-4) and Huntington Beach (15-8, 9-4) are tied, 
they'll play Saturday. Huntington Beach plays Marina, Ocean View plays 
Westminster (7-13, 5-7). 
</P>
<P>
 DIVISION II 
</P>
<P>
 FREEWAY -- Clinched: Fullerton (13-13, 7-2), Sunny Hills (13-10, 6-3). 
Undecided: Possible four-way tie for third if Sonora (13-13, 4-5) loses to La 
Habra (7-13, 3-6) and Troy (8-13, 4-5) loses to Buena Park (7-13, 3-6). In the 
event of a three-way tie, a coin flip determines who gets a bye in a two-game 
playoff; a three-game playoff will determine third in the event of a four-way 
tie. 
</P>
<P>
 ORANGE -- Clinched: Savanna (11-9, 7-2), Western (14-10, 6-3), Magnolia (12-8, 
6-3). Undecided: Savanna would win title outright by beating Western today. In 
a three-way tie at 7-3, Magnolia would be top-seeded for playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 DIVISION III 
</P>
<P>
 PACIFIC COAST -- Clinched: Laguna Hills (13-9-1, 8-1), Trabuco Hills (11-10, 
7-2). Undecided: Costa Mesa (11-9, 6-3) is third if it beats Trabuco Hills. 
Century (5-4, 7-13) is third if it beats Laguna Hills and Costa Mesa loses. A 
coin flip will break a first-place tie. 
</P>
<P>
 SEA VIEW -- Clinched: Irvine (16-9, 10-3), Woodbridge (19-8, 10-3). Undecided: 
Third-place Tustin (11-6, 9-4) plays fourth-place Santa Margarita (17-10, 8-5) 
today. If they are tied, they'll play Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 DIVISION V 
</P>
<P>
 OLYMPIC -- Clinched: Cerritos Valley Christian (16-3-1, 9-0), Whittier 
Christian (8-8, 7-3). Undecided: Calvary Chapel (10-15, 7-4) can clinch by 
beating Cerritos Valley Christian or if fourth-place Brethren Christian (13-6, 
6-5) loses to Capistrano Valley Christian. If tied, the two will have a playoff 
to decide third place.

<P>
 Surprising even himself, El Toro's Tyce Routson won the Division I boys' 
diving championship Wednesday at Heritage Park, setting a Southern Section 
record with a score of 604.95. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think I would do that well overall," Routson said."I started off 
slow, but then I picked it up." 
</P>
<P>
 Routson, who will attend Miami on scholarship in the fall, got into his rhythm 
in the fifth round, when he executed an inward 2 1/2 somersault pike that drew 
marks of 7.5 to 8.5. On his next six dives, he averaged scores of 7.6, 
including a forward 1 1/2 somersault pike that drew two 9.0s. 
</P>
<P>
 Other top finishers form Orange County included Adrian Samples of Capistrano 
Valley (452.85), Mark Bosemiller of Edison (425.15), K.C. Tudor of Capistrano 
Valley (367.60) and Shawn Thomas of Edison (345.85). 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano Valley's Summer Brown won the girls' title with score of 498.50. 
Starting off strong on her first two dives, she scored 8.0 to 8.5 on an inward 
pike and back pike. 
</P>
<P>
 The top five girls' finishers, all from Orange County, were Brown, Amy Sloan 
of El Toro (471.50), Kanegha Jasperson of El Toro (465.10), Shannon Pace of 
Capistrano Valley (450.60) and Arika Earley of Mission Viejo (444.70).

ORANGE COAST'S SHAMMAS HEATS UP AFTER CHILLING OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Things are getting exciting for Nicole Shammas, sophomore center fielder for 
Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
 Shammas played four years of varsity softball at University High and was a 
starter at Orange Coast last season. 
</P>
<P>
 But only in the last couple of months has Shammas finally started to play up 
to her expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 After hitting .192 as a freshman, she got off to a a slow start this season, 
but things quickly fell into place because she learned to control her emotions. 
</P>
<P>
 Shammas, who bats second, hit .377 in 21 Orange Empire Conference games and 
was selected as the conference's most valuable player. She batted .301 overall 
and led OCC with 28 runs scored. 
</P>
<P>
 She also was an All-Southern California selection. 
</P>
<P>
 "In high school, I felt like I was a solid player but I was too nervous," 
Shammas said. "I would beat myself up and be mad about a game for the whole 
season. Even when I did well in a game, it wasn't good enough." 
</P>
<P>
 The reason for her improvement is pretty simple. 
</P>
<P>
 "Confidence and maturity," she said. "I'll say it over and over again. They 
are the big reasons for me doing better. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, I want to go out there and play all the time. I want to hit, and I want 
the ball to be hit to me. Before, if it was late in the game I didn't want the 
ball to come to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Shammas wasn't sure if she was going to be good enough to play college 
softball but tried out for the team just to see what would happen. 
</P>
<P>
 After she made it last season, her confidence slowly increased with each game. 
Her batting average might have been low, but Shammas rallied in the final month 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Her best performance came in the State tournament. She helped Orange Coast to 
a third-place finish and was selected to the all-tournament team. She batted 
.313 and made several outstanding catches in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her defense as much as her bat got her on that team," OCC Coach Nick Trani 
said. "She's a very intense player and works really hard. She always wants to 
get better and takes the game very seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 Shammas took last summer off to rest and work toward her eventual goal of 
becoming a teacher and coach. She was a coach for an age-group softball team. 
She also coached the freshman-sophomore girls' basketball team at University 
High in the fall and winter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've known since I was in high school that I wanted to be a teacher," she 
said. "Then I took a counseling course last semester and I was sure. I love 
sports and working with people." 
</P>
<P>
 Playoff Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Coast (29-13), the Orange Empire Conference champion, plays host to 
College of the Canyons (22-15) in the regional playoffs at noon Friday. Mt. San 
Antonio (29-11) plays Grossmont (20-11) at 2 p.m., also at OCC. The winners 
play at 4 p.m. The tournament ends Saturday, with games at 10 a.m., noon and 
the championship game at 2 p.m. The schedule is the same at each of the four 
regional sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress, which finished a game behind Orange Coast, also plays host to a 
four-team regional. The Chargers (40-15) play Pasadena (17-20) at noon and El 
Camino (20-17) plays Antelope Valley (37-9) at 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago (26-17), the third-place team from the Orange Empire 
Conference, also made the playoffs. The Dons play Moorpark (29-12) at 2 p.m. in 
the regional at Palomar. Palomar (33-11), the defending State champion, plays 
Ventura (20-20) at noon. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach (35-5) will play host to the final regional. The Vikings play 
College of the Desert (16-16) at noon and Chaffey (29-12) plays San Diego Mesa 
(19-19) at 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner at each of the four regional sites advances to the State 
tournament, May 20-22 at College of the Sequoias in Visalia.

BID TO REINSTATE SCYPHERS AS COACH DENIED BY JUDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A bid by parents to reinstate Mike Scyphers as Simi Valley High baseball coach 
was rejected Wednesday in Ventura County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge John J. Hunter denied the request for a temporary restraining order, 
saying the parents have no standing in the case, according to Lawrence 
Trygstad, the attorney representing the parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said if the coach wants his position back he should be here asking for 
it," Trygstad said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trygstad said he and Scyphers' attorney, Brian O'Neill, discussed the 
possibility of refiling the request with Scyphers included as a plaintiff. 
Trygstad said should Scyphers choose that option, another hearing would be 
sought by Friday, the final day of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley clinched a Southern Section Division I playoff berth Wednesday 
with a victory over Agoura. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, I'm very disappointed," Scyphers said, adding that he believes 
problems with his program could have been addressed after the season. "It's 
very difficult to comprehend this whole ordeal." 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers said he is unsure whether he will seek another court date. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pioneers have played three games since last Tuesday, when Scyphers, 41, 
was suspended pending police and district investigations into possible 
financial and disciplinary improprieties. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Wednesday, a group of about 15 parents who support Scyphers met with 
Supt. Mary Beth Wolford, Simi Valley High Principal Kathryn Scroggin, board 
members Doug Crosse and Judy Barry and Director of Secondary Education Leslie 
Crunelle at the district office. The meeting lasted about 50 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't get a whole heck of a lot accomplished," said Kathy Kozlowski, the 
mother of senior Kary Kozlowski. "We were trying to focus on getting the coach 
back on the field and that just doesn't seem like it's going to work because 
the police investigation isn't done." 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Mark Layhew of the Simi Valley police department said the investigation 
will last another week to 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
 The parents also repeated their concern to the district about their children 
being interviewed by police last week at school without parental consent and 
without a school official present, Kozlowski said. 
</P>
<P>
 A school district press release issued Wednesday stated that school officials 
remain concerned about Scyphers' admissions of violating district rules by 
accepting money for use of the Simi Valley High baseball field and his 
disciplinary practice of having players bid for the right to paddle teammates 
who violate team rules. 
</P>
<P>
 The release read in part: "Because of the serious nature of the allegations in 
this matter, the school district believes that it is in the best interests of 
all parties to continue Mr. Scyphers' paid administrative leave from his 
coaching duties pending the outcome of the complete investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 Barry sympathized with the frustration of the parents and players, but said 
the school is acting properly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do feel the administration has acted appropriately and the board is 
supporting our administration in the steps they've taken," she said. "I'm not 
sure (the parents) really understand what's happening and the process we need 
to go through." 
</P>

POLICY DICTATED DISCIPLINING OF BASEBALL COACH; HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETICS: SIMI 
VALLEY SCHOOL BOARD HAS BEEN PRESSING ADMINISTRATORS TO ACT AS WATCHDOGS IN 
REGARD TO EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Simi Valley High Principal Kathryn Scroggin suspended baseball Coach Mike 
Scyphers for alleged financial and disciplinary improprieties, the school's 
district office was flooded with calls from parents and residents opposing the 
suspension. 
</P>
<P>
 But school board members said Wednesday that Scroggin simply acted according 
to an informal Simi Valley Unified School District directive initiated in late 
1990 by Robert Purvis, the superintendent at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Purvis, who retired in June, felt that some district athletic programs had 
grown too independent and failed to adhere to district regulations. The school 
board has continued to emphasize that administrators serve as watchdogs over 
all extracurricular activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Scroggin vehemently denies that she or the school board targets athletics. The 
district is tough on every program, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's always more to any story than anyone has knowledge of," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scroggin has the full support of the board, member Diane Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally I support what Kathryn Scroggin is doing," she said. "She's just 
doing what the school board has asked her to do. It's the direction the school 
board would like to see." 
</P>
<P>
 School board members assert that abuses in athletics have existed for years. 
Therefore the board has directed administrators to warn violators verbally and 
follow up with written notices in personnel files when appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 Because those are personnel matters, she said, they remain private. Collins 
added that violations must be excessive and continuous before they become 
public matters. The Scyphers situation falls into that category, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not something new," she said. "To get to this point, it's been 
accumulating for some time. It didn't just happen overnight." 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers blasted district officials, saying that no one has discussed 
financial or disciplinary abuses with him. He added that since he was suspended 
May 3, the district has refused even to meet with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody ever told me anything about the financial dealings with the baseball 
program -- ever," he said. "It's a farce, really, that they won't even talk to 
me. I am a very ethical, moral (person) and a man of integrity. And they're 
trashing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers also objected to the timing of the suspension, saying it unfairly 
interrupts the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want to crack down, they want to get a stranglehold on the program. . . 
. I never knew we were out of control to begin with. But that's fine. I don't 
think you do something like this with four games left in the season. This is 
not the way to do things," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Jackson, a self-proclaimed advocate of high school sports who is now in 
private business, was forced out as Royal principal last July after six years. 
</P>
<P>
 "True, I know most of the board members well and very few are pro-athletics," 
he said. "But the policy clearly says to regulate and scrutinize all programs, 
not just athletics." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson has known Scroggin for many years and says she doesn't deserve 
criticism for disciplining Scyphers. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's not out to get the baseball program," he said. "She's just doing what 
she is supposed to do. If it happened to be a problem with the drama club, 
she'd do the same." 
</P>
<P>
 Parents of Simi Valley baseball players have trouble believing that. Irene 
Michael, mother of Simi Valley first baseman Jeff Michael, says the school 
board is ruining high school sports in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sports are being scrutinized by the board," she said. "Just look at the 
figures. All of a sudden these great coaches are slowly being annihilated." 
</P>
<P>
 Scroggin rejected that analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things tend to go in cycles so it might appear that one school is more 
heavy-handed than others," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Scyphers controversy is the latest in a series involving sports programs 
in the Simi Valley district. Scyphers, one of Southern California's top high 
school baseball coaches, has admitted that he accepted money from an adult 
baseball group for use of the Simi Valley High field, a violation of district 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 He also acknowledges that he has used a disciplinary system called "the block" 
in which players bid for the right to paddle teammates. The system reportedly 
violates the state education code. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have refused to reveal the subject of the investigation into Scyphers. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in the district, Frank Maye was not rehired in 1992 as Royal 
softball coach because he took a 16-year-old girl to a rock concert. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, 1993, Simi Valley football Coach Stan Quina was fired after asking for 
a full-time teaching position. He had led the team to back-to-back playoff 
appearances for the first time in school history. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, Simi Valley boys' basketball Coach Dean Bradshaw was suspended 
for the remainder of the season for shoving a player to the team bench during a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members vow to continue to monitor all programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is accountability," board president Carla Kurachi said. "There has 
to be for all employees and students. Unfortunately, sports programs in the 
past didn't have a lot of overseeing so they're used to doing things their own 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well it's different now. There's a new board and we do things differently."

HOVSEPIAN KEEPS LIT TORCH OF PIERCE TENNIS PATRIARCH; PROGRAM THRIVING UNDER 
THE GUIDANCE OF XANTHOS DISCIPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 His flame was not burning as bright or as hot as it once had, so Paul Xanthos 
passed the torch last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The man who had produced men's tennis championships in 23 of 29 seasons at 
Pierce College bowed out quietly after his team -- ranked No. 2 in the state -- 
was upset in the second round of the Southern California regional. 
</P>
<P>
 But Xanthos, 73, knew the program would be in good hands when Pierce hired 
Aris Hovsepian. 
</P>
<P>
 Hovsepian couldn't crack the lineup for Xanthos when he came to Pierce as a 
freshman in 1986, but he returned in 1992 as a player -- and as a Brahma 
assistant coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went out to a practice this year and I saw the players running up and down 
the stadium bleachers 10 times and my legs hurt," Xanthos said. "I thought it 
was great. They're in great shape." 
</P>
<P>
 Physically and otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce is ranked second in the state. The Brahmas (21-1) won the Southern 
California regional with a 5-1 victory over San Diego Grossmont last week. 
Today, they face No. 1 Los Altos Foothill for the state championship in a match 
at La Costa Resort and Spa. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce's only defeat came April 2 in an invitational tournament to Tyler 
(Tex.), then ranked No. 1 in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hasn't been easy," Hovsepian said. "But one thing is I didn't want to 
disappoint my coach, Paul Xanthos, because he took a chance on me." 
</P>
<P>
 Hovsepian, 27, was the youngest of seven applicants interviewed by Pierce. He 
had no head-coaching experience, but he did have the recommendation of Xanthos, 
who finished with a record of 548-103 and next week will be the first junior 
college coach to be inducted in the ITCA Coaches Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 In his last two seasons at Pierce, Xanthos would look at Hovsepian and have 
flashbacks. What he saw was a young Paul Xanthos. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got his own style, but he handles, he prepares and he drills the guys 
the way I did," Xanthos said. "Like me, he doesn't stand for any foolishness." 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce players realized that as soon as they started training under Hovsepian 
last fall. They spent as much time on the track, in the weight room and in 
Pierce's Olympic pool as on the court. Hovsepian's program of swimming, lifting 
and running was a radical departure from Xanthos' regimen, but the players took 
to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was very good," said Philip Leonhardt, Pierce's No. 4 singles 
player who is one of three Brahmas to play for both Xanthos and Hovsepian. "It 
gets too boring to stay on the court three hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aris is really excited and he wants to do everything perfect. He's trying to 
give us the edge, physically and mentally. He's a coach 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Filling in for Paul is a big thing. Paul got a little burned out. I don't 
mean that in a negative way. He was a very good coach, but it was kind of a 
daily routine and he kind of lived from the past." 
</P>
<P>
 Xanthos' success is unparalleled. His legacy includes 23 conference 
championships -- 15 in a row -- and a 96-match conference winning streak from 
1973-87. But in his last seasons, he suffered from heart troubles and clashed 
with the administration over lack of funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "I let up a little bit and started having fun with the guys," Xanthos said. 
"Former players would come up to me and say, 'Boy, you've really changed.' I 
was strict. Aris is strict." 
</P>
<P>
 As a youth growing up in Tehran, Hovsepian would play nine to 10 hours a day 
on clay courts. He has brought the same dedication to coaching. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent 24 days in Florida in December learning the finer points of the game 
from former UCLA Coach Glenn Bassett (doubles) and academy gurus Nick 
Bollettieri (training), Dennis Vandemere (techniques) and Jack Groppel and Jim 
Loehr (bio-mechanics). 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce players have a volunteer chiropractor, Paul Anding, who helps them with 
both physical and psychological therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 Hovsepian continues to push new ideas on his players. 
</P>
<P>
 "I use swimming, because it loosens and aligns all your muscles and helps 
prevent injuries," Hovsepian said. "I knew about track because I used to run 
track. Most of (my ideas) came from books. I've studied about different energy 
levels. Maybe it sounds like B.S., but it comes from a lot of reading and 
learning about the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Hovsepian, like Xanthos, was not a very good player. Coming to the United 
States as a teen-ager, he played No. 3 singles at Cleveland High as a senior. 
He didn't make the ladder at Pierce a year later. But Hovsepian re-emerged at 
Pierce two years ago and earned the No. 6 singles position at age 25. That's 
when Xanthos started grooming him as an assistant coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Hovsepian sees much of himself in his players. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're average junior college players," Hovsepian said. "I wouldn't say 
they're very talented. They work hard for what they have accomplished. They've 
tried to improve their games." 
</P>
<P>
 No. 1 singles player Doug Young has a 29-6 record. No. 2 Jenia Karimov is 
29-11, No. 3 Kasper Nielsen is 19-7, No. 4 Leonhardt is 27-5, No. 5 Josh 
Goodley is 19-4 and No. 6 Ray Kheshvadjian is 22-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Young and Leonhardt qualified for the state individual tournament by reaching 
the semifinals of the regional. The doubles teams of Leonhardt-Nielsen and 
Young-Karimov also qualified for the state tournament, which will start Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The undercurrent to Pierce's success -- to Hovsepian's toil and his players' 
efforts this season -- is a tradition and a high standard that was set by 
Xanthos 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm lucky enough to be here," Hovsepian said. "I'm lucky enough to coach a 
team that Mr. Xanthos has made to be one of the best in California and the 
Western United States. He's definitely a legend. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way I'm going to disappoint him. I have to do my best. It's a lot 
of challenge. It's a lot of pressure."

LIFTING HIMSELF TO NEW HEIGHTS; BURROUGHS' 18-YEAR POLE VAULT MARK IS SHATTERED 
BY FINLAND'S SALLINEN, WHO HAS SCALED 16-4 3/4 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Finnish athletes have won more Olympic gold medals in distance races and the 
javelin than any other nation. But ask around Burroughs High these days and 
some folks might guess that Finland exports pole-vaulters. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason rests with Esa Sallinen, an exchange student from Porvoo, outside 
Helsinki, who has not only shattered the 18-year school record in the event but 
has become one of the premier vaulters in area history. 
</P>
<P>
 Sallinen, an 18-year-old senior, got the school's attention earlier this 
season when he broke Jon Switzer's mark of 15 feet 7 inches, set in 1976. In a 
dual meet at Burbank High last month, Sallinen vaulted 16 feet 1/4 inch. 
</P>
<P>
 He has since cleared 16 feet or higher in three consecutive meets, and won the 
Foothill League title last week at Birmingham High with a mark of 16-4 3/4. Not 
only is that a league record but it ranks fourth on the all-time regional list 
and second on this season's state list behind Scott Slover (17-0) of San Jose 
Leland High. 
</P>
<P>
 Sallinen is also an accomplished triple-jumper. During the same meet in which 
he broke the school pole vault mark, he recorded a personal best of 43-6. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's extremely exceptional and it's directly related to his speed," said Mike 
McHorney, who coaches field events at Burroughs. "He's so much faster than any 
of the other vaulters we've had. I expect him to do more before the season is 
over. I really feel he can break 17." 
</P>
<P>
 Sallinen, who will compete in the Southern Section Division I preliminaries 
Saturday in Long Beach, also is among the team's best long-jumpers (top mark of 
20-10) and he runs the first leg of Burroughs' 400-meter relay team, which was 
undefeated in league competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a power runner and he has a smooth, long-gaited stride," Burroughs 
sprint coach Todd Dellutri said. "He usually runs down everybody's first 
runner." 
</P>
<P>
 But Sallinen's specialty is the vault. The 5-foot-9, 165-pound senior picked 
up the sport as a 13-year-old in Finland. By the time he moved to California in 
August as part of a student exchange program, he ranked fourth in his country 
in the 18-and-under division with a personal best of 15-5. 
</P>
<P>
 His future might rest in America. He will return to Finland in June to 
complete high school because his credits at Burroughs are not honored in his 
homeland, but he has attracted the attention of the track programs at UCLA and 
Tulane. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to come back for college," Sallinen said. "There are no college 
sports in Finland so I would like to go here." 
</P>
<P>
 Sallinen loves the United States. He studied English for eight years in 
Finland, so he didn't face a language barrier. 
</P>
<P>
 And teen-age life in Finland resembles its American counterpart, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, he said he feels so comfortable with his host family (McHorney, 
his wife and three children) that he seldom misses home.  
</P>
<P>
 Sallinen hooked up with McHorney through Ron Morris, a 1960 Olympic silver 
medalist pole vaulter, who knows a friend of Sallinen's father. 
</P>
<P>
 When Sallinen's father, an engineer, inquired about sending his son to 
America, Morris immediately referred him to his longtime friend, McHorney. 
</P>
<P>
 So what was the toughest adjustment to California? 
</P>
<P>
 "The smog and the heat," Sallinen said laughing. "It was really hard to 
breathe the first few days. In Finland it gets close to zero and the summer is 
only three months. Here it's always like summer." 
</P>
<P>
 Sallinen, modest and shy about his accomplishments, has made a lot of noise in 
the Burroughs program.  
</P>
<P>
 Krose believes Sallinen has a bright future in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's exceptional and he will probably be an Olympic decathlete," Krose said. 
"He can do it because he's got great technique. He's going to score a lot of 
points. He's definitely decathlete material." 
</P>
<P>
 Before adding seven events to his track schedule, however, Sallinen has other 
items on his plate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I plan to open a Taco Bell in Finland," he said with a smile. "I love Mexican 
food and we don't have it there. It's the best."

SHOTPUT STANDOUT TADE SIGNS WITH CSUN 
</P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shotputter Brian Tade of El Camino Real High and middle distance runner Emani 
Barfield of Alameda High have signed letters of intent with Cal State 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Tade (6-foot-4, 270 pounds) placed third in the shotput in last year's City 
Section championships during his first season and he leads the region with a 
personal best of 57 feet 7 1/2 inches this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Tade, a tackle in football, plans to concentrate on track at Northridge, where 
he is expected to also compete in the discus and hammer throw. "This has been 
overwhelming," Tade said. "I went out for track last year just to have some fun 
and it ends up getting me a college scholarship." 
</P>
<P>
 Barfield has personal bests of 2 minutes 21 seconds in the 800 and 5:13 in the 
1,600. JOHN ORTEGA

HARTMAN RUNS OFF TO TEXAS SAN ANTONIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dave Hartman, the 1991 state champion in the 3,200 meters for Canyon High, has 
withdrawn from Villanova University and will run cross-country for Texas San 
Antonio in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartman, 21, said a lack of progress in track was his primary reason for 
transferring. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't been real pleased with the way things have been going in track 
during the last couple of years," Hartman said. "I had some pretty good 
cross-country seasons (at Villanova), but I never ran like I felt I should have 
in track. It just wasn't a real good training environment for (a 
5,000/10,000-meter runner) like myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Hartman placed 33rd as a sophomore in the 1992 NCAA cross-country 
championships to help Villanova to a fourth-place finish, but his track bests 
of 8 minutes 23 seconds in the 3,000, 14:21 in the 5,000 and 30:49 in the 
10,000 fell far short of his expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 He will attend Texas San Antonio -- an NCAA Division I school -- on a full 
athletic scholarship and has one season of eligibility remaining in 
cross-country and two in track. JOHN ORTEGA

STATE CITATIONS POSSIBLE IN FIRE DEATHS OF 2 MEN; INVESTIGATION: CAL/OSHA MAY 
CITE THE COUNTY SANITATION DISTRICT OR EMPLOYER OF WORKERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State authorities are expected to issue citations after a two-month 
investigation into possible safety code violations and other irregularities 
that may have caused a flash fire that killed two workers at an Orange County 
Sanitation District plant in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Brown, district manager of the state's Occupational Safety and Health 
division, said it was likely that the agency would issue the citations against 
either the sanitation district or an Ontario-based engineering firm that 
employed the two workers who were severely burned in the Feb. 2 accident and 
later died of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The sanitation district has been conducting its own investigation of the fire 
but is not expected to make the findings public until after Cal/OSHA 
authorities issue their report, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, sanitation district staff members have recommended that the same 
Ontario engineering firm, Pascal and Ludwig Engineers, be awarded a new 
$1-million contract for future construction work, even though both 
investigations have not been completed. 
</P>
<P>
 The staff recommendation has rankled some district directors who have delayed 
a vote on the contract until the investigations are finished. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most directors have been surprised that things have not been brought forward 
to us," said Orange City Councilman Fred L. Barrera, one of the district's 42 
directors, referring to the accident. "We're all very concerned about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Barrera declined to discuss details of the district's investigation and 
deliberations about the engineering contract, referring all inquiries to 
sanitation district attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 But another director, Irvine Councilman Barry J. Hammond, said the February 
fire and concerns about safety and other issues will likely be studied further 
in a recently ordered audit of the district. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have asked for a full evaluation of our management practices," Hammond 
said. "There are concerns about a few projects in particular, and this (fire) 
happens to one of them." 
</P>
<P>
 The audit and review of the fire come as the Orange County district attorney's 
office has been reviewing unrelated allegations that district employees had 
improperly accepted gifts from contractors doing business with the district. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's inquiry was confirmed by prosecutors and in a letter 
Wednesday to the sanitation district from an attorney representing Dr. Louis 
Sangermano, a sanitation district laboratory manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Mark H. Freeman wrote that Sangermano has been "working with the 
Orange County district attorney with its investigation of certain illegal 
activities within the county sanitation districts. . . . " At the same time, 
Freeman stated, that Sangermano has been the "object of unwarranted internal 
investigations, harassments, retaliations and other acts of misconduct" by the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter asks that district officials take steps to relieve the "stressful 
conditions" in which Sangermano must work. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Cal/OSHA inquiry, Brown said the agency has "been looking at" both the 
sanitation district and the engineering firm on various code-compliance issues 
related to safety standards, employee training and equipment in its 
investigation of the accident, which claimed the lives of Robin Miller, 37, and 
Joe Patterson, 32, both of Rancho Cucamonga. Both were employees of Pascal and 
Ludwig. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire occurred while Miller and Patterson were working in a seven-foot-deep 
concrete channel at a sewage treatment plant at Brookhurst Street and Pacific 
Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, the workers were using a hammer, similar to a jackhammer, to 
install a valve. Officials said that a combustible oxygen mixture is used in 
the sewage treatment process, but it was not known whether a possible spark 
from the hammer could have ignited the gas, causing the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some things that we will report, but those are things I cannot 
comment on at this time," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Ludwig, the engineering firm's chief executive officer, said the firm has 
been in contact with Cal/OSHA officials, adding that he "would not be 
surprised" if the agency's findings went against the company. He declined to 
comment on what those findings could involve. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two guys died there," Ludwig said. "They were good workers, longtime 
employees. They are missed. Eventually it will all be known." 
</P>
<P>
 Just a month after the accident, with the Cal/OSHA investigation in its early 
stages, Ludwig's firm was recommended by sanitation district staff members for 
a separate $1-million construction and seismic retrofitting project at the 
district's Fountain Valley and Huntington Beach plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Directors said the recommendation was questioned because of the pending 
accident investigation, and the contract award was delayed. Wednesday, 
directors again recommended that the contract be delayed until the 
investigations are completed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Several directors are concerned about this," said another director who asked 
not to be identified. "We felt we should have some answers on this incident 
before we go forward." 
</P>
<P>
 Ludwig said he was aware that the district had delayed its action on the 
pending $1-million contract, but did not know that the delay was related to the 
February accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were given no notice about why (the contract) was deferred," Ludwig said. 
"We are hopeful that it will eventually be approved."

PROBE BY D.A. STIRS ASSEMBLY CAMPAIGN; POLITICS: DEMOCRATIC RIVALS TED MORENO 
AND ZEKE HERNANDEZ ACCUSE EACH OTHER OF ATTEMPTED BRIBERY, ILLEGAL TAPING IN 
69TH DISTRICT PRIMARY RACE. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For weeks now, speculation about an Orange County district attorney's 
investigation into the Democratic race for the 69th Assembly District seat has 
nearly consumed the campaigns of two of the candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Councilman Ted R. Moreno, one of four Democratic candidates in the 
race, confirms that political rivals -- both Democrat and Republican -- are 
accusing him of many misdeeds, from bribery to pressuring businessmen who have 
projects in Santa Ana into contributing to his Assembly campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office says its probe is centered on two claims: a 
charge filed in February by Democratic candidate and Latino activist Zeke 
Hernandez, who alleges that Moreno offered him money to stay out of the race; 
and a counterclaim by Moreno that Hernandez taped their telephone conversation 
without Moreno's knowledge in an effort by Hernandez to set up the bribery 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Both deny the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk of the probe in this central Orange County district, which includes 
Anaheim, Garden Gorve and Santa Ana, seems to have superseded any discussion of 
the issues. 
</P>
<P>
 And Democrats privately fear that the speculation about the district 
attorney's investigation may stain the credibility of their field of 
candidates, even if no charges are filed, and possibly weaken their chances of 
holding onto the only Orange County legislative seat now in their hands. 
</P>
<P>
 The current occupant, Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove), is stepping 
aside to run for state attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
 Publicly distancing themselves from the Moreno-Hernandez dispute are the two 
other Democratic candidates, Santa Ana Chamber of Commerce President Michael 
Metzler, who has Umberg's endorsement, and businessman John Michael Patterson, 
who ran an unsuccessful campaign for Santa Ana City Council in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hernandez and Moreno have also turned their anger on Metzler's supporters, 
primarily Umberg and prominent members of the Democratic Foundation of Orange 
County. They contend the Umberg camp is supporting Metzler because it does not 
want a Latino to represent the district. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's patently untrue," Metzler responded. The Umberg camp is "very interested 
in making sure they can return the seat (to Democrats), and they went out and 
looked for the best candidate they could find, regardless of race, in an 
attempt to hold on to the seat, and that happens to be me." 
</P>
<P>
 Latinos make up about two-thirds of the district's population, with whites 
representing less than one-fourth of the population, according to a 1993 Times 
Orange County computer analysis. But because voter registration among Latinos 
is traditionally low, whites account for more than 70% of the district's 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno said he is trying to appeal to all voters and has the backing of 
several law enforcement associations. 
</P>
<P>
 But more significantly, he is about to receive a major cash infusion from 
members of the Legislature's Latino Caucus, including its chairman, Assemblyman 
Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles). Moreno refused to disclose the dollar figure, 
but political insiders estimated Polanco might funnel anywhere from $80,000 to 
$150,000 to the Moreno campaign -- a major boost compared to the $50,000 that 
Metzler claims to have raised to date. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno's opponents argue that Polanco's drive to elect more Latinos to the 
Assembly is ironic, since Polanco is backing his chief of staff -- who is white 
-- over other Latino candidates to succeed him in his own district. Polanco is 
running for the state Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno says the political heat is on him because he is a leading candidate in 
the race. Moreno blames the rumors about him on the Umberg camp and Republicans 
in general who might fear facing him in the general election in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the three Republican candidates seeking their party's nomination in the 
69th district -- attorney Martin Ageson, businessman Jim Morrissey and 
businessman Virgel L. Nickell -- two of the camps dismissed Moreno's fear that 
the GOP may be fueling the speculation about him. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Q. Thompson, a consultant for Morrissey, said: "We are all not behind the 
rumors. If I had a choice, I would prefer to go up against Mr. Ted Moreno 
because he's obviously got a big mouth." 
</P>
<P>
 Ageson said he has "been so overwhelmed in my own (race) that I don't know 
about any rumors." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno lays most of the blame on Hernandez. "Zeke is the one that started it. 
Zeke is the one that's keeping the fires going," he said, calling the district 
attorney's investigation "nothing, at this point." 
</P>
<P>
 In his initial charge filed with the district attorney's office, Hernandez 
claimed that Moreno had offered through a third party to raise $10,000 from a 
group of local attorneys if Hernandez ran for a Santa Ana City Council seat 
instead of the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez also released a tape recording of a telephone conversation that he 
said demonstrated Moreno's attempts to intimidate him and force him out of the 
race. Moreno countered that the tape was illegally obtained. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not real close" to finishing a review of the case, said Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Guy Ormes, who is in charge of the investigation. "We are having some 
problems with people cooperating." 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez maintains that there is more to the probe than has been publicly 
confirmed by the district attorney's office, and he plans to press the case 
with the state attorney general's office if he is not satisfied with the 
results of the local investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 If the charges are proven true, Hernandez said, "it undermines the integrity 
of an officeholder." 
</P>
<P>
 But Moreno strongly rejected the allegation that he "strong-arms" 
contributors, calling the charge "a bunch of b.s." 
</P>
<P>
 "I go up to them and I say, 'I need help on this election, can you help me 
out?' " he said. "There was no (threat) of, 'If you are not going to give, I am 
going to do this and that.' " 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Hernandez admits his campaign has been "rough." He has received 
support from local school board officials and Rep. Esteban Torres (D-Los 
Angeles), but has raised only about $5,000 for his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson, the fourth candidate seeking the Democratic nomination, said he has 
raised even less money than Hernandez. The lack of funds has forced him to hand 
out his campaign flyers door-to-door. But it has resulted in a surprising, 
though humorous, benefit, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The voters, Patterson said, still remember the name of their former 
congressman, Democrat Jerry Patterson. And when Michael Patterson introduces 
himself, "They say, 'I remember you!' And I say, 'You do?' "

COALITION CHAMPIONS IMMIGRANTS; CAMPAIGN: GROUP OF LABOR LEADERS, ACADEMICS AND 
CLERGY SAYS IT WILL FOCUS ON EDUCATION IN ITS BATTLE AGAINST ELECTION-YEAR 
RHETORIC. 
</P>

<P>
 A broad-based coalition that includes activists, academics, clergy and labor 
leaders has formed to counter negative stereotypes of immigrants in Orange 
County and wage an educational campaign they hope will stem anti-immigrant 
rhetoric during this election year. 
</P>
<P>
 After more than four months of planning, the Orange County Alliance for 
Immigrant Rights will have its first public meeting Friday at the Sisters of 
St. Joseph of Orange, where David E. Hayes-Bautista, director of the Alta 
California Policy Research Center in Los Angeles, will speak about immigrants 
and health care. 
</P>
<P>
 "Much of the misinformation is fueled by stances public officials have taken 
on immigration," said Javier Inda, the group's media coordinator. "They tend to 
portray all immigrants as criminal undocumented people who use social 
services." 
</P>
<P>
 "Very few times do these public officials bring out how immigrants work a 
lot," he added. "In Orange County, much of the Latino community is an immigrant 
community, and studies have shown they do work a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 people have been attending meetings since February to discuss the 
group's goals, said Inda, a Santa Ana resident who is doing his doctoral 
dissertation on perceptions of immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Inda said the group has decided not to take positions on policy issues, such 
as how to handle illegal immigration across the U.S.-Mexico border, but rather 
to focus on education, pointing out what they believe are significant flaws in 
certain studies and drawing attention to other research they say offers a less 
negative assessment of immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 A guest with a particular area of expertise will speak at each meeting, Inda 
said, and the public is encouraged to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 One target of an alliance letter-writing campaign is Assembly Bill X70, 
written by state Rep. Mickey Conroy (R-Orange). That bill, which will be heard 
Tuesday by the Assembly Committee on Public Safety, would make it a felony for 
any student who cannot show proof of legal status to enroll in any public 
post-secondary school. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill would also make it a felony for anyone to assist a student in 
enrolling. 
</P>
<P>
 The group will track other immigration-related legislation and plans to fight 
proposed budget cuts that would deny prenatal care to undocumented women, said 
Irene Martinez, executive director of the 25-year-old Delhi Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Alliance meetings have drawn a mixed group, including religious leaders, 
students, attorneys, labor union representatives and a Santa Ana schoolteacher 
who lives in Newport Beach and says her community is coming down too hard on 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope that through educating the public at large the alliance can put a 
brake on this (anti-undocumented immigrant) legislation," said Mary Erin Crook, 
a field organizer with the United Electrical Radio and Machine Workers of 
America, who is on the alliance membership committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "We work with the immigrant workers. I see the situation they're in and were 
in even before all the politicians got on the bandwagon of the backlash against 
immigrants," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 John Hernandez, assistant dean of student affairs at Cal State Fullerton, who 
works with a network that provides information to undocumented students 
attending college, said the alliance will enrich the debate on immigration. It 
will also help community organizers who are reaching out to immigrants to share 
information, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting will be from 3 to 5 p.m. Friday in the multipurpose room at 480 S. 
Batavia St., Orange.

MAYOR, SCHOOL SUPT. BACK PLAN TO AID SANTA ANA YOUTH; ACTIVISM: BUT THEY SAY IT 
WILL TAKE TIME TO IMPLEMENT PROGRAM FORMED BY CHURCH GROUP AFTER FAMILY SURVEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The city's mayor and its public school superintendent assured a cheering 
audience of more than 1,500 residents packed into St. Anne Catholic Church on 
Wednesday that they support a sweeping plan to help the city's youth but said 
it could take time to implement. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Orange County Congregation Community Organization, representing 
15 churches countywide, have spent five months surveying 10,000 Santa Ana 
families, researching other programs across the country and meeting with city 
and school officials to develop the plan. It is designed to reduce gang 
violence and provide jobs, security and after-school programs to Santa Ana 
youth. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gone over in some detail each and every one of the suggestions. I think 
your leaders fully understand some will require funding from the federal 
government or private industry, and a few will require more meetings," Mayor 
Daniel H. Young said. "With that understanding, I am here to endorse each and 
every one of these goals." 
</P>
<P>
 The gathering was a follow-up to a meeting at the church last December, which 
drew an unprecedented crowd of 1,000 residents seeking solutions to gang 
violence and youth crime and pledging their commitment to draft a plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Youth Action Plan presented Wednesday to Young and Santa Ana Unified 
School District Supt. Rudy Castruita calls for: 
</P>
<P>
 * An apprenticeship program at a Santa Ana high school that would prepare 
youths for jobs in a particular industry. 
</P>
<P>
 * An increase in city summer job openings from 500 to 2,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * Creation of homework centers and an expansion of the city's PRIDE 
gang-prevention program. 
</P>
<P>
 * A family support center for parents and teens involved with drugs and gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hiring more school counselors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Providing more community policing in three targeted areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can still hear the cry of a mother whose son was in trouble. She called me 
in the middle of the night for help, and I was unable to give it," said 
resident Catalina Munoz as she asked for support for the plan. "We need crisis 
centers so our youths have somewhere to go." 
</P>
<P>
 "My son left the house one night and didn't return," Carmen Aguirre said. "We 
found out he was in jail, but no one at school had let us know that he was 
headed for trouble. We need more counselors in the schools to communicate with 
parents, because otherwise this will continue. We want a better future for our 
children." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Young and Castruita pledged to meet again with leaders of the 
organization in 60 days to talk about implementation. 
</P>
<P>
 Young said the city could take immediate steps to provide homework centers in 
city neighborhoods, find a building to house a youth program of the Sisters of 
St. Joseph of Orange and provide more money for Project PRIDE. But other goals 
will take more time and creative financing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Castruita said the school district can open its doors to after-school programs 
and expand an existing apprenticeship program to other high schools and will 
consider creating another fundamental school. But an increase in school 
counselors is costly and will have to wait, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We support every goal and we endorse every goal," Castruita said. "I am 
deeply honored that the community is here tonight to stand up and be counted 
and hold us accountable for our youth." 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Congregation Community Organization has a membership of 
50,000 families in Orange County, 20,000 of them in Santa Ana. Members include 
congregates from five Santa Ana Catholic churches and 10 congregations of 
various denominations elsewhere in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers spread the word about the plan and sought input by knocking on 
doors, working phones and distributing surveys at churches.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: YORBA LINDA; MAYOR RESIGNS POST WITH CANCER SOCIETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mayor Barbara Kiley on Tuesday resigned as president of the North District of 
the American Cancer Society amid criticism over her vote last month against an 
ordinance that would ban smoking in restaurants, places of employment and other 
public places. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiley was asked to resign by Hal Massey, chairman of the Board of Directors 
for the Orange County Unit of the American Cancer Society. Margaret Edwards, 
director of marketing and communications for the organization, criticized Kiley 
for abandoning the group's anti-cancer goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our mission is to conquer cancer," Edwards said. "We want her to believe in 
our goal to enforce a stricter (smoking) ordinance. We need a leader in (the 
president's) position who believes in tobacco control, one who will take a 
stand." 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor was also criticized by a former president of the California division 
of the American Cancer Society for mentioning her affiliation with the 
organization as she was voting against the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 James Nethery, a dentist who works only with cancer patients, said Kiley used 
her position to appease residents who support the ban, then voted against it on 
behalf of merchants who oppose it.  
</P>
<P>
 "Kiley was trying to have the best of both worlds," Nethery said. "If you 
volunteer in the American Cancer Society you are . . . not free to bandy the 
organization's name around, then (vote) against its policies and positions."  
</P>
<P>
 But Kiley contends she did not vote against the ordinance, rather she wanted 
to let voters decide on the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yorba Linda does have an ordinance limiting smoking in public places, and my 
vote was not to deny the stricter ordinance but to put the ordinance on the 
November ballot and let the good people of Yorba Linda cast their own vote, so 
as to limit any legal liability or possible litigation by the powerful tobacco 
associations," Kiley wrote in her resignation letter. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; SECURITY IS BUFFALOED BY CALF'S BIRTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLSON CUMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A bison named Becky gave birth to an 80-pound calf early Wednesday morning at 
the County Fairgrounds to the surprise of a security guard who witnessed the 
delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's feet coming out of the buffalo . . . what do we do?" the guard asked 
Livestock Supervisor Jim Bailey in a 4:30 a.m. telephone call, according to 
fairgrounds spokeswoman Georgia Cluver. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't a complete surprise to everyone, though. 
</P>
<P>
 When Becky the Buffalo arrived at the fairgrounds in February from the 
historic Buffalo Ranch in Irvine, she was believed to be pregnant. The owner at 
the ranch had observed her mating before the ranch was sold early this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, after the sale, four North American bison, including Becky, were put up 
for sale. Because Becky is a wild animal, fairground workers were unable to 
examine her belly to see if she was with calf, Cluver said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She looked fat for a buffalo, but she gets a lot more food as a domestic 
buffalo," Cluver said. "We thought she was just maybe a little heavy." 
</P>
<P>
 Becky, who weighs about 1,000 pounds and is 7 years old, delivered her calf 
without help.  
</P>
<P>
 According to Cluver, Becky has taken on a new behavior with motherhood -- she 
growls gently when people come too near to her and the calf. 
</P>
<P>
 The two bison are penned near the Centennial Farm at the fairgrounds. There, 
hundreds of schoolchildren on farm tours were able to admire Becky and the calf 
Wednesday morning. In addition, fairgrounds workers stopped by the pen all day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good; now she won't be lonely," security guard Beth Renkoski said. 
</P>
<P>
 Spring has apparently sprung with a vengeance at the fairgrounds, and many 
other animals have also given birth recently. There are twin baby goats, a baby 
donkey, lambs and a litter of eight piglets. Admission to the farm is free. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a contest to help name the bison calf. Send entries to the Orange 
County Fair, attention Becky the Buffalo, 88 Fair Drive, Costa Mesa, CA 92626. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner gets a season pass to the summer fair and a picture of Becky and 
her calf.WILLSON CUMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; BERGESON HOUSING BILL WINS KEY VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Taking the first step in what promises to be an uphill fight, a measure that 
would allow Santa Ana and other cities to reduce overcrowded housing conditions 
and ease fire dangers won approval Wednesday from a key state Senate committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite harsh criticism from housing activists, the Senate Local Government 
Committee voted 7 to 0 to send the measure by Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport 
Beach) to the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson dramatically revamped the bill before Wednesday's hearing in an 
effort to ease fears that it could be used by unscrupulous civic leaders to 
unfairly evict low-income residents and minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 As originally introduced, the bill would have allowed cities such as Santa Ana 
to set their own occupancy limits, an idea that met with sharp resistance when 
the measure was first heard by the Local Government Committee in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson's new version prohibits cities from tampering with occupancy limits. 
Instead, the bill would weave stricter standards into the state housing code, 
tying occupancy limits to the size of a home's bedrooms, not the square footage 
of the entire dwelling. 
</P>
<P>
 While the approach is different, the new version would have essentially the 
same effect as Bergeson's earlier effort. Although current law allows up to 10 
people in an apartment of about 500 square feet, Bergeson's proposal would cut 
the allowable occupancy roughly in half. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson argued that the tougher standards are needed to lessen the fire 
danger caused by crowded dwellings, which can become a tinderbox stuffed with 
mattresses, clothing and other personal belongings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very modest, reasonable approach to dealing with overcrowded housing," 
said Bergeson, whose bill is backed by more than 50 city councils, fire 
departments and government associations.  
</P>
<P>
 Housing advocates, however, say the measure would push minorities and the poor 
out onto the streets, increasing the homeless problem. Moreover, they suggested 
it would prove difficult to determine exactly what rooms qualify as bedrooms. 
Some expressed concern it would criminalize poor people and prompt landlords to 
discriminate against large families. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcus B. Brown Jr. of California Rural Legal Assistance said the measure 
would simply put additional pressures on those municipalities that didn't 
enforce the tougher standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "This just moves the problem around," he said. "Overcrowding might lessen in 
Orange County, but it could increase in L.A. and other urban centers." ERIC

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; GIRL DIVES IN FRONT OF TRAIN, IS KILLED

 Two Amtrak trains were delayed for more than two hours Tuesday night after a 
17-year-old girl dived onto the tracks in front of one of the trains and 
committed suicide, police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident occurred at 10:25 p.m. on the Santa Fe tracks at Culver Drive, 
Sgt. Jeff Kermode said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim was struck by a southbound train running from Santa Barbara to San 
Diego with more than 100 passengers on board. It was delayed for two hours, 
Amtrak spokeswoman Debbie Hare said. 
</P>
<P>
 No passengers were injured. 
</P>
<P>
 A second Amtrak train traveling north from San Diego to Los Angeles was not 
involved in the accident but was delayed for two hours and 43 minutes. That 
train was forced to wait until the accident scene was cleared, Hare said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim was an Irvine resident who had apparently made statements about 
suicide following a family argument, Kermode said. GREG HERNANDEZ

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; 11-YEAR REMODELING OF HOME IS INSPECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With police officers at their sides, city building inspectors conducted a 
search Wednesday of a home at the center of a long-running controversy over a 
remodeling project that has taken more than a decade to complete. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the search is part of an investigation into numerous 
allegations of building, safety and health code violations at the Kron Street 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 Building inspectors spent more than an hour Wednesday taking photos of the 
interior in an effort to "secure evidence of noncompliance" with city codes, 
police Lt. Sam Allevato said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city may eventually ask the district attorney's office to review the case 
for possible prosecution, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The house's owners, Victor and Fern Ganish, denied that they have done 
anything wrong and criticized the search as "harassment." 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1983, the Ganishes have slowly transformed their one-story ranch-style 
home into a two-story Tudor structure that critics have likened to a baroque 
castle. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby residents have complained about the home's appearance and the slow pace 
of the remodeling project, which has yet to be completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's action occurred after the city obtained a search warrant. City 
officials refused to answer specific questions about the investigation 
Wednesday. But in a written statement, officials said "the warrant was 
necessitated by the city's inability to obtain the owner's consent to conduct 
building inspections." 
</P>
<P>
 Fern Ganish said the 10:30 a.m. search took her family by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "To have policemen come into your house like you are a criminal, there's 
absolutely no reason for it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ganishes have long feuded with the city over their remodeling project. The 
couple appeared before the City Council several times in the mid-1980s as 
officials pressed them to finish the work. 
</P>
<P>
 Fern Ganish said the exterior of the home is now finished but flooring, 
plumbing and drywall still must be installed inside. 
</P>
<P>
 She blamed the length of the project on her husband's poor health and on years 
of "harassment" by city officials.SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON/PLACENTIA; 2 DISTRICTS DIFFER ON GIVING CLAS 
TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE and MIMI KO 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 One school district has announced that it will resume the controversial 
California Learning Assessment System, while a neighboring district decided to 
postpone administration of the test until the 1994-95 school year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District decided Tuesday to resume 
testing after a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge ruled that the tests do 
not violate the state's Education Code. The district will continue to give 
parents the option to exempt their child from the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the test claim portions of the language arts section contain 
questions about a student's personal beliefs or practices in sex, family life, 
morality and religion, topics that require parental permission under Section 
60650 of the California Education Code. 
</P>
<P>
 But Judge Robert H. O'Brien ruled the tests do not contain questions "designed 
to elicit the prohibited information." O'Brien also ruled that the code's 
reference to family life and morality, if constitutionally challenged, would 
likely be ruled too vague. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to resume CLAS testing was announced at a meeting of the Board of 
Trustees, which was attended by dozens of parents opposed to the test. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the speakers urged the board to vote to halt the tests, which is 
mandated by state law. 
</P>
<P>
 But school board members, who were allowed to read the tests, said even though 
they share many of the concerns expressed by parents, they were unwilling to 
violate the state law. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state has threatened to withhold funding (from districts that do not give 
the test)," said board member William Kielty. "I am not going to advocate civil 
disobedience." Not all the board members were opposed to the test. President 
Judy Miner, who is a language arts teacher in the Tustin Unified School 
District, said the literary selections on the test were "inspirational and a 
springboard to creative expression." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Fullerton School District Board of Education voted 5-0 this 
week to defy the state mandate requiring school districts to give the 
California Learning Assessment System tests by May 31. 
</P>
<P>
 They said teachers received the testing materials last week and did not 
believe one week was sufficient time to prepare students for the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers, who were scheduled to begin testing students Wednesday, agreed with 
the decision. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE and MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; CITY PLANS SUIT OVER BRANCH JAIL INMATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council unanimously voted to initiate legal action against Sheriff 
Brad Gates this week in an effort to block county plans to house 
maximum-security prisoners at Theo Lacy Branch Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 After a closed meeting Tuesday night, city officials contended that Gates had 
violated state law by suddenly introducing 48 maximum-security inmates into the 
jail in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates failed to give the public time to review the county plan to transfer the 
maximum-security prisoners to Theo Lacy, Orange City Atty. Robert Franks said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say there are now more than 60 maximum-security prisoners at 
the 1,326-bed facility. Before April, the jail typically housed medium- and 
minimum-security prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to take some sort of action," Mayor Gene Beyer said Wednesday. "We are 
getting trampled on by the sheriff." 
</P>
<P>
 The introduction of maximum-security prisoners at Theo Lacy incensed city 
leaders, who accused Gates of breaking a verbal promise to keep such inmates 
out of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department has denied that such a promise was ever made and 
points out a county study issued in April providing ample legal justification 
for the transfers to Theo Lacy. Sheriff's officials add that if the transfers 
are not allowed, the county will be forced to release criminals well before 
their sentences are scheduled to expire. The county jail system is suffering 
from extreme overcrowding, sheriff's officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with the Sheriff's Department were unavailable Wednesday for comment 
about the potential lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange lost a costly two-year legal battle with the county in 1993 when it 
tried to prevent an increase in Theo Lacy's jail population. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials expect to file the lawsuit Friday.MARTIN MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; 2 HIRED TO APPEAL LANDOWNERS' VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to overturn its most staggering legal defeat, Laguna Beach will hire 
two high-profile attorneys -- including a former U.S. secretary of education -- 
to appeal a $19-million judgment won by landowners in the Diamond-Crestview 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials announced they will hire Shirley Hufstedler, secretary of 
education under President Jimmy Carter, and Otto M. Kaus, a former state 
Supreme Court associate justice, to continue waging one of Southern 
California's longest-running land-use battles. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Ann Christoph said the City Council's decision to hire the attorneys 
reflects the seriousness with which the city views the Orange County Superior 
Court ruling in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach has been represented by City Atty. Philip D. Kohn of the Costa 
Mesa law firm Rutan and Tucker. The law firm of Hufstedler & Kaus is in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Diamond-Crestview case involves 38 landowners who sued the city more than 
eight years ago, claiming it had essentially taken their property by not 
installing streets in a timely manner so they could build homes in the rural 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Following other court rulings, Orange County Superior Court Judge David E. 
Brickner said in October that the city must pay the property owners $11 million 
for their land, $3.4 million for attorney's fees and other costs and interest 
that amount to about $4.4 million, according to the city's news release. 
</P>
<P>
 The almost $19-million total is equal to the city's annual general fund 
budget, the statement said. LESLIE EARNEST

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; TEACHERS GET AN A+ FROM CANDIDATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Visiting a local school in conjunction with the nationwide "Day of the 
Teacher," a candidate for state superintendent of public instruction on 
Wednesday hailed teachers as "the heroes of America." 
</P>
<P>
 After a 30-minute tour of Century High School, which has been recognized for 
its extensive use of computers and other technology, candidate Delaine Eastin 
spoke to students and teachers about the importance of education and the 
crucial role instructors play in society. The job, she said, demands more 
respect. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are probably the most unsung profession in the state of California. We 
have underestimated what they're doing for us in the face of overwhelming 
odds," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She pointed out that most teachers spend dozens of hours at home grading 
papers and preparing lessons, in addition to the work they do at school. And 
many also routinely spend hundreds of dollars of their own money each year to 
buy books, paint and other instructional materials for their classes, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastin made her comments after visiting about a dozen classrooms where 
teachers used computers as a tool to teach students English, word-processing, 
science and other subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, students said they were grateful to participate in a day of special 
recognition for their teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we honor them enough. They do a heck of a job, and they deserve 
the credit for giving us our education," said Matt Carr, 18. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people really care about the future, they need to care about teachers and 
how well they are teaching," said Debra Russell, 17. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday morning, teachers ate a breakfast of bagels and orange juice and 
received white carnations in honor of their profession. Several said they were 
touched by the students' gifts and words. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a lot of society's ills get blamed on us and it's nice to have a day 
when people appreciate the work we do," said teacher Susan Eichinger. 
</P>
<P>
 Health teacher Jeff Davis noted, however, that the most important recognition 
for a job well done comes not on special appreciation days, but daily in the 
classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 That recognition comes "when a student tells you, 'Gee, I understand.' That's 
when you know you're appreciated," he said.JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; FORMER COUNSELOR SUES COLLEGE DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICIA DI RADO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former career counselor and union representative at Coastline Community 
College has sued the Coast Community College District, claiming her supervisor 
harassed her and the district wrongfully fired her. 
</P>
<P>
 Helen Evers, who worked for the district from September, 1976, to April, 1992, 
filed the suit Monday in Superior Court against the college district, her 
supervisor and four other district officials. Evers, 49, currently on 
disability from work-related emotional distress, is involved in a separate 
workers' compensation claim against the district. She had worked as an athletic 
equipment manager at Coastline College, and later became a student career 
counselor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lost my career," Evers said. "I don't have it any more." 
</P>
<P>
 College district officials said they were unfamiliar with the suit and 
declined to comment Wednesday. But Ann Garten, spokeswoman for the district, 
said, "She is still an employee here." 
</P>
<P>
 In the civil suit, Evers alleges that Carol Barnes, her supervisor, repeatedly 
assailed Evers in front of peers and openly criticized her work performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes, who is associate dean of counseling at the college, could not be 
reached for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Evers said the alleged harassment began after she represented a group of 12 
faculty members who charged in 1992 that a Coastline Community College dean 
sexually harassed and physically intimidated his employees. Evers represented 
the employees through American Federation of Teachers Local 1911. 
</P>
<P>
 George P. Melican, the top administrator at Coastline's satellite campus in 
Huntington Beach, resigned amid those allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a condition of the settlement between the district and the faculty 
members that (Evers) not be retaliated against for her union representation," 
the lawsuit states, but named defendants "have done nothing but breach this 
provision of the settlement." 
</P>
<P>
 The suit names Barnes as well as Ronald Berggren, administrative dean of 
vocational education at Coastline; William M. Vega, chancellor of the college 
district; James Garmon, vice president of student services at Coastline; and 
Armando R. Ruiz, a member of the district's board of trustees. ALICIA DI RADO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS; CITY MANAGER'S NEW CONTRACT APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Manager Robert C. Dunek received additional benefits but not a pay raise 
under a new contract approved this week by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunek, 42, city manager since 1989, receives more than $86,000 a year in 
salary as well as health, disability, retirement and other benefits granted to 
the city's executive employees. 
</P>
<P>
 But starting immediately, Dunek also will receive a guarantee of six months' 
pay in case of disability, minus whatever benefits he gets from workers' 
compensation and other sources. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the city will contribute to a deferred compensation plan an 
amount equal to 2% of his base salary, a pay scheme comparable to the 401(k) in 
private companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "This formalizes my employment agreement with the city," said Dunek, who has 
worked for five years under a council resolution. "This provides for a more 
stable and predictable working relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunek said that his contract does not have an expiration date, but the council 
can fire him at any time. The council reviews his performance every year. 
</P>
<P>
 Under his contract, Dunek must notify the city three months in advance if he 
plans to resign and work for a private company. If he wants to work for another 
public agency, he must give a two-month notice, unless the city agrees to a 
shorter notice. 
</P>
<P>
 The city provides a car for Dunek and use of a cellular telephone, although he 
has to pay for personal calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he became Los Alamitos city manager, Dunek was executive director of 
the Orange County division of the League of California Cities. He was an 
assistant city manager in Garden Grove and started his public service career as 
police officer in Buena Park in the 1970s. BERT ELJERA

<P>
 Virginia Alleman of Huntington Beach, a retired librarian, is the 1994 
recipient of Golden West College's Outstanding Citizen Award. 
</P>
<P>
 Alleman, 75, retired as librarian at the college in 1985 after 17 years of

<P>
 "For more than half a century, Virginia Alleman has rolled up her sleeves to 
help other people," said Lori Thomas, a spokeswoman for the college. "Wounded 
soldiers, functionally illiterate workers and students learning to master the 
complexities of English have all benefited from her commitment to improving her 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 Alleman's work on campus includes being a "study buddy" for students at the 
Intercultural Center.  
</P>
<P>

honor and is presented annually. Alleman will be formally honored with the 
award during Golden West's 27th annual commencement May 25 in the college's

 Repair work on a 15-month-old massive landslide that still covers Pacific 
Coast Highway with debris could start as soon as late June if written 
authorization of funding arrives this week, city officials said Wednesday.

 "We've been given the verbal assurances that the money is there," Anderson 
said. "But we don't have the written authorization yet and we cannot proceed 
without it." 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council voted 5-0 Tuesday night to approve the plans and 
specifications for what is now officially called the Coast Highway Landslide 
Remediation Project. Because the job includes clearing Pacific Coast Highway, 
the Federal Highway Administration will pay for it, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 22, 1993, the bluff top along La Ventana street collapsed, destroying 
six homes and endangering many others. A 30-foot pile of rubble collapsed on to 
Pacific Coast Highway, 75 feet below, and remains there. 
</P>
<P>
 After months of bureaucratic haggling between the cities of San Clemente, Dana 
Point, Caltrans and the homeowners, an agreement on the plan to repair the 
bluffs and clear the highway was finally reached last February. Then, in April, 
the California Coastal Commission approved the bluff top repair project. 
</P>
<P>
 If the confirmation comes promptly, the city could still award the project to 
a qualified bidder by mid-June to get construction underway by the end of the 
month, Anderson said. At the earliest, the project could be finished and the 
highway reopened to traffic by January, 1995, Anderson said. LEN HALL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUANA HILLS; CITY DELAYS VOTE ON INTERSECTION WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Saying they need more information, the City Council this week delayed voting 
on the first of three major-intersection improvement projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The city plans to reconstruct the intersection of Alicia and Moulton parkways 
at a cost of $1.66 million, tentatively starting in late summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important we have more time to review the site elevations," Councilwoman 
Melody Carruth said. "We want to see what the improvements will look like for 
our pedestrians." 
</P>
<P>
 The roadways are heavily used by joggers, walkers and bicyclists, particularly 
along a bike trail that parallels Alicia Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
 A representative of the Lomas Laguna Homeowners Assn. asked for more time for 
the homeowners group to look at renovation plans. 
</P>
<P>
 The project will improve traffic circulation at the intersection by creating 
dual left-turn lanes and exclusive right-turn lanes at the approaches in all 
directions at Alicia and Moulton parkways. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the medians on both streets will be landscaped, with most of the 
work centering on Moulton Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
 City engineers plan to install planted median islands on Moulton Parkway, from 
Via Lomas to Gordon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The landscaping will feature split rails running between a series of stone 
columns. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's intended to represent a property-line fence you would see in an 
equestrian neighborhood," City Engineer Ken Rosenfield said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alicia Parkway will be widened to accommodate the extra lanes. The work will 
cut into slopes on the street, requiring retaining walls at heights from two to 
five feet high. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenfield said some trees will have to be removed, but each one will be 
replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 The road work is part of the city's Moulton Smart Street Project, which will 
expand traffic capacity at two other major intersections in the city: Moulton 
Parkway and La Paz Road and Moulton and Oso parkways. FRANK MESSINA

PARKING GARAGE FUNDS EXPECTED IN HIGHWAY BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FAYE FIORE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal funds for a 12,000-space parking structure, that is considered by the 
Walt Disney Co. to be pivotal in its plans to build the Westcot Center project, 
are expected to be included today in a massive national transportation bill now 
wending its way through the House. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Disney and Orange County transit officials must first clear a 
legislative thicket before the money is actually in hand, they regard as a 
victory indications that a House public works subcommittee will vote today to 
approve $15 million toward building not only the parking garage but special 
car-pool lanes at the San Diego and Costa Mesa freeways interchange. 
</P>
<P>
 The money would be included in the National Highway System bill, which must be 
approved by the House Committee on Public Works and Transportation and then the 
House. It then moves to the Senate, where it is likely to slam into a wall, 
because the upper chamber has no intention of taking up the bill this year, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the first time the federal government has given its blessing to 
the parking garage, which Disney has said it needs to keep Disneyland open if 
it is ever to build a $3-billion Westcot project next to the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Another $15.5 million was granted last year for the same two projects, but it 
has yet to be spent because of concerns the Federal Transportation Authority 
has about the seven-story garage, which would be one of the biggest in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 If authorization for more funding is won today, county transportation 
officials said it could help allay the Federal Transportation Authority's fears 
so last year's money can finally be spent. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a giant step for us," said Stan Oftelie, head of the Orange County 
Transportation Authority, which would own the parking structure if it is built. 
</P>
<P>
 If this year's money wins final approval, the county would have as much as 
$30.5 million in federal funds to spend over the next three years on the garage 
and freeway projects, meaning that the federal government will have picked up 
about 10% of a $318-million tab.

MAN, 25, SLAIN IN ANAHEIM ALLEY FIGHT IDENTIFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man who died after being stabbed in the throat during an argument has been 
identified as 25-year-old Lorenzo Herrera, but his assailant remains at large, 
police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Herrera, a resident of Anaheim, was stabbed in an alley about 3 p.m. Tuesday 
in the 3400 block of West Canoga Place, near Del Monte Drive. Sgt. Steve Rodig 
said the victim knew his assailant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Apparently there was some kind of verbal altercation prior to the stabbing," 
Rodig said. Police said they have a definite suspect but declined to release 
his name Wednesday because of the ongoing investigation. Authorities are still 
trying to locate the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of an apartment complex near where the stabbing occurred said both 
men frequented the complex, where they have a friend. Apartment manager Bobbie 
Norton said neither man lived there. 
</P>
<P>
 "From what I understand, they were fighting over a Walkman radio," Norton 
said. "This whole thing has made us all a little nervous. We've been up all 
night."

UNZ URGES END TO WORKERS' COMP SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEBE MARTINEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to tap into Orange County's strongly conservative voter sentiment, 
Republican gubernatorial candidate Ron Unz returned here Wednesday night and 
promised a complete elimination of the state workers' compensation system. 
</P>
<P>
 During a meeting of the Orange County Young Republicans, Unz said Gov. Pete 
Wilson's attempt to reform the workers' compensation system "was simply putting 
a Band-Aid on cancer." 
</P>
<P>
 The hourlong discussion sometimes drew skeptical questions from the audience 
of about 60. But Unz maintained that even though employers pay for workers' 
compensation, doing away with it would eliminate an estimated annual cost of 
$1,000 per worker, and that money could end up in the hands of the employees. 
</P>
<P>
 He conceded it was a radical proposal that probably would have to be 
implemented through a statewide initiative, but to not do so would further 
cripple the state's economy, he said. Currently, Unz added, trial lawyers and 
those who file fraudulent claims are the primary beneficiaries of the system. 
</P>
<P>
 "No welfare for the poor, and no welfare for the rich," said the 32-year-old 
owner of a Silicon Valley computer software company who is running as the 
conservative alternative to Wilson in the June 7 Republican primary. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked how those with legitimate claims could be served, Unz responded 
that with the extra money going back to the workers, they can buy extra 
insurance to cover their needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Unz also said he supports judicial reforms that would require the loser in a 
lawsuit to pay the costs incurred by the winner, to discourage the filing of 
frivolous lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Unz said Wednesday that he had not completed his study of some issues and next 
week would release a plan to cut the state's welfare programs, which he said 
are "magnets" for legal and illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Unz frequently spoke of returning California to the way it was in the 1960s, 
which he called a "paradise on Earth." Using public schools as an example, he 
said: "What we have done is take the worst aspect of the legacy of the 1960s -- 
New Age psychobabble, political correctness, ethnic consciousness -- and made 
that the fundamental core of our public educational system."

MORE THAN ONE-THIRD IN UCI SURVEY COMPLAIN OF BIAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICIA DI RADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than a third of UC Irvine employees who responded to a survey reported 
that they were the victims of harassment or discrimination at work, UCI 
officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey, conducted by the Staff Assembly Affirmative Action Committee in 
early 1993 to examine staff opinions on discrimination issues, gathered 582 
responses from employees on the main campus as well as at the College of 
Medicine and UCI Medical Center in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 About 8,700 staff and more than 1,000 faculty are employed by the university. 
</P>
<P>
 Results of the survey were described in UCI News, a weekly account of campus 
happenings written by university public information officers. The newsletter is 
accessible electronically to students, faculty and staff with computer accounts 
at UCI; outsiders with Internet accounts can also read UCI News postings, which 
are updated each week. 
</P>
<P>
 UCI officials could not be reached for comment on the survey late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the UCI News report, Marion Metivier-Redd, assistant executive vice 
chancellor for affirmative action, cautioned that the number of responses to 
the survey may be too small to assume it reflects the experiences of the entire 
university staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Some staff members did not receive the survey through campus mail, while 
others sent the surveys back to an incorrect office, UCI officials reported. 
</P>
<P>
 But of the 582 people who responded to the survey, 220 staff members -- or 38% 
-- said they had been harassed or experienced discrimination, according to the 
UCI News report. Among other comments, people complained that they received 
physical threats, were told offensive jokes and remarks, were excluded from 
decisions or groups, were refused promotions or pay raises and were victims of 
favoritism. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 15% said they went through the experiences at least five times. Of 
the total number who submitted responses, almost 20% said their experiences 
could be termed sexual harassment, according to the report. Others said factors 
for discrimination included age, ethnicity, sexual orientation and political 
views. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than half of those responding to the survey said they knew where they 
could go to file complaints or grievances. Christine Moseley, chairwoman of the 
affirmative action committee, said in the report that her committee will act as 
a watchdog on staff discrimination and harassment issues, according to the news 
account.

2 SISTERS HURT WHEN STRUCK BY VAN WHILE WALKING TO SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two sisters were injured, one seriously, while walking to school Wednesday 
morning when a van swerved onto a sidewalk after being hit by a car, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Josepha and Roberta Miranda were on their way to Lathrop Intermediate School 
in the 1100 block of South Broadway about 8:15 a.m. They were near Standard and 
Edinger avenues when the accident occurred, according to Sgt. Dick Faust. 
</P>
<P>
 A man driving a Buick Regal pulled out of a convenience store parking lot in 
the 1500 block of Standard as a Ford Aerostar van driven by a Santa Ana woman 
was heading south on Standard, according to the accident report. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman told police the right rear of her vehicle was hit by the Buick, 
causing her to lose control and swerve onto the sidewalk, hitting the two 
girls. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the driver of the Buick left the scene but was found later in 
Yorba Linda by Brea police, who returned him to Santa Ana for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither he nor the driver who hit the girls was cited, but Faust said charges 
could be filed in the case at any time and that an investigation was 
continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 Josepha, 12, an eighth-grader, broke her right leg and pelvis and had numerous 
cuts and internal injuries. Officials at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana said 
she was in guarded condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberta, 11, a sixth-grader, suffered cuts and scrapes and was released from 
the hospital after 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Hinshaw, an assistant principal at Lathrop, said she was taking get-well 
cards from the sisters' classmates to the hospital.

MAN ARRESTED IN '93 THEFT OF RARE COINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The co-owner of a Glendale coin shop is responsible for the recovery of nearly 
$500,000 in rare silver and gold coins stolen more than a year ago from a Long 
Beach coin show, and the arrest of a suspect in the theft, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Van Bebber recognized the coins Monday when some of them were brought 
into his Coin and Stamp Galleries by a man attempting to sell them, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas J. Riccio, 31, of Bell, described by authorities as a baseball card 
dealer, was arrested Monday by Glendale police who responded to a call from the 
employee, said Officer Robert Velasco of the Long Beach Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coin dealers are a close-knit group, they know each other and when there is a 
theft like that, they are aware of it," said Det. Sgt. Jim Rodriguez of the 
department's burglary division. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the man's home, detectives found two safes containing most of the 1,100 
coins, which are valued at between $350,000 and $500,000, Velasco said. 
</P>
<P>
 Riccio was booked on suspicion of grand theft, receiving stolen property and 
on outstanding traffic warrants, Velasco said. The FBI is conducting a separate 
investigation into possible charges of federal interstate theft and 
transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 The coins were taken from the Long Beach Convention Center after the show 
closed sometime between Feb. 6 and 7 last year, Rodriguez said.

SLAYING SUSPECT KILLS HIMSELF IN STANTON MOTEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 An unemployed parolee, suspected of shooting to death a Santa Fe Springs 
computer sales clerk in a videotaped robbery earlier this week, killed himself 
on Wednesday during a five-hour standoff with police at a Stanton motel, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 An Orange County SWAT team found Mark Anthony Murphy, 24, dead from a gunshot 
wound to the head after bursting into his motel room in the early afternoon, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy, who spent much of his childhood in Orange County, was paroled in 
September after a string of local convictions and was also wanted in the 
shooting of a childhood friend in Anaheim last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Early Wednesday, nearly 50 police and SWAT members from Los Angeles and Orange 
counties surrounded the Golden West Motel on Beach Boulevard after receiving a 
tip late Tuesday night from a television viewer who apparently recognized 
Murphy on a newscast showing a videotape of that day's robbery and slaying. The 
tipster said Murphy had been staying at the motel. 
</P>
<P>
 By 8 a.m. Wednesday, police had evacuated the two-story motel and contacted 
Murphy in Room 212 on the motel phone, demanding that he surrender, Orange 
County Sheriff's spokesman Lt. Dan Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy ignored repeated calls and instead disconnected the phone line, police 
said. By the time the SWAT team stormed the room at about 1:30 p.m., Murphy was 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier on Wednesday, Stanley Perryman, 25, of Stanton, who is believed to 
have driven the getaway car used in the Santa Fe Springs slaying, turned 
himself in to Buena Park police after viewing the videotape on television, 
authorities said. He was being held without bail in Norwalk on suspicion of 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators believe that Murphy did the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Murphy had posed as a customer at Dynamic Computers in Santa Fe 
Springs, authorities said. When a store clerk, Hyman Wiener, 56, rang up a sale 
of a keyboard extension cord, Murphy pulled out a handgun from his waistband 
and fatally shot Wiener before fleeing with a handful of computer equipment, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they were shocked by the senselessness of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a despicable, cold-blooded murder. He shot the guy when his back was 
turned to him. As he was walking out the door, it looked like he was smiling, 
carrying the computer equipment out the door," said Sgt. Ron Spear of the Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident was captured on the store's security video camera. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Sheriff's Department's request, several local television stations aired 
parts of the footage on their 11 p.m. news broadcasts, showing the suspected 
assailant calmly ripping computer equipment out of the walls just moments after 
he shot the clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 The publicity quickly paid off: About 11:20 p.m., a viewer reported that the 
man seen in the videotape was at the Stanton motel, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The tipster was not the only person who recognized Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect's mother, Gail Jenkins, 46, of Buena Park, said a friend of the 
family called her house about 11 p.m. Tuesday and said that Murphy was on 
television. She ran to turn on the set. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just about died," she said in an interview. "I couldn't believe it. I was 
half-asleep. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I was up all night, 
worrying." 
</P>
<P>
 Jenkins said her son went to high school in Buena Park but dropped out after 
the ninth grade. He worked as a mover through the years but, finding the work 
too hard and the pay too low, soon turned to small-time crime and drugs, she 
said. Jenkins said she believes he tried to rob the computer store as a way of 
getting enough money to move out of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy was on parole after a string of convictions for auto theft, assault and 
burglary, and he was also wanted by Anaheim police. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Police Sgt. Steve Rodig said Murphy was suspected of shooting a man 
repeatedly on April 19 in a strip mall parking lot at Lincoln Avenue and Dale 
Street. Rodig declined to give the name of the victim, who survived the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodig said his department had been preparing to ask for a warrant for Murphy's 
arrest in connection with the Anaheim shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Police refused to divulge details of the shooting, but Michelle Cotney, the 
former girlfriend of Murphy and the mother of his 10-month-old son, said the 
incident grew out of "kind of like a love triangle between me, him and someone 
else" who got shot. Murphy's mother said the man who got shot was his best 
friend from childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours before the SWAT team entered Murphy's room, Cotney stood anxiously at a 
pay phone across the street from the motel, just beyond the knot of curious 
bystanders and television cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotney, 24, who lives in Anaheim, said she had just paged Murphy on his 
beeper, and was hoping he would call her from inside the motel. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotney said Murphy was a good man and a hard worker before his addiction to 
amphetamine overwhelmed him. 
</P>
<P>
 The drug, she believes, led him to kill. "He has done bad, but it's not him. 
It's the drugs talking," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotney shook her head and said, "I just hope he's not dead." 
</P>
<P>
 But he may well have been. 
</P>
<P>
 While authorities did not know for certain when Murphy shot himself, police 
said they heard a single gunshot early in the standoff. Police waited several 
hours before entering the room because they detected movement at the window and 
considered Murphy dangerous, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before storming the motel room, SWAT members -- armed with automatic 
rifles and shotguns -- smashed the window and tossed inside a smoke bomb. They 
then discovered the body. 
</P>
<P>
 But Murphy's death did little to mollify those who knew the slain store clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach resident Deborah Wren, a next-door neighbor of Hyman Wiener who is 
in her late 30s, said his death came as a "shock. . . . I'm in disbelief." 
</P>
<P>
 Wren, who said she grew up with the three children of Hyman and Joanna Wiener, 
said Murphy's suicide "doesn't take the bullet back that killed my neighbor." 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't comprehend anybody that can kill," she said. "It's the worse thing 
you can do -- life is so precious." 
</P>
<P>
 She described Hyman Wiener as a wonderful person who thought nothing of 
getting up from the dinner table to help his neighbors connect a VCR. 
Ironically, she said, it was his penchant for electronics, particularly 
computers, that became "the hobby that killed him." 
</P>
<P>
 Retired from management at GTE about six years ago, Wiener made computers his 
life, which took him to Dynamic Computers, Wren said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiener is survived by his wife, three grown children and three grandchildren, 
Wren said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wren's 18-year-old son, Steven, said, "This kind of makes you wonder what the 
world's coming to."

SPACE STATION'S DEMISE WOULD BE FELT IN O.C. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FAYE FIORE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The space station -- an orbiting laboratory that supporters claim represents 
the future of America's space exploration -- is again in danger of being 
killed, this time by the godfather of the program who has spent years 
persuading Congress to keep it alive. 
</P>
<P>
 The space station's fate hinges on a shrinking National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration budget, a wariness about Russia's recent involvement in the 
program and wavering support by crucial members of Congress -- in particular 
Rep. George E. Brown Jr. (D-Colton), the influential chairman of the science 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Long a powerful champion of the station, Brown now says he will reluctantly 
recommend pulling the plug if NASA's overall budget is slashed again next year 
or it appears the costly mission is raiding other NASA projects. President 
Clinton has requested $14.3 billion for NASA next year, $2.1 billion of that 
for the space station. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been a staunch supporter of human space flight for a helluva long 
time," Brown said. But continued decreases in NASA budgets "would be tantamount 
to a death sentence anyway, and we might as well face it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials close to the project agree the space station hasn't a hope of 
survival without Brown's support. 
</P>
<P>
 "He goes against it, it's dead," said Tim Kyger, an aide to Rep. Dana 
Rohrabacher, (R-Huntington Beach), a member of the House Committee on Science, 
Space and Technology, where support for the station is shaky. "Last year the 
space station was in the intensive-care unit, this year it's on the operating 
table and we're trying to restart the heart." 
</P>
<P>
 The demise of NASA's illustrious orbiting laboratory would mean another blow 
to a California economy already reeling from defense cuts. Among the hardest 
hit would be McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Co. in Huntington Beach, whose 
3,000-member space-station team was cut in half after budget reductions last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 First announced by then-President Reagan in 1984, the space station became the 
most ambitious project since the development of the space shuttle. Two of its 
prime contractors -- McDonnell Douglas in Huntington Beach and the Rocketdyne 
Division of Rockwell International in Canoga Park -- together hold space 
station contracts worth more than $6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 But the station has been dogged by redesigns and setbacks. With federal money 
tight in recent years, critics began to question the wisdom of keeping alive a 
space program that, after 10 years and $12 billion in spending, had yet to 
produce a substantial piece of hardware. 
</P>
<P>
 The House approved further spending for the space station by a single vote 
last year. Then in December, a deal to bring Russia into the project gave the 
troubled program a political boost. The White House regards it as much a space 
mission as a foreign policy device to help a struggling democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 But in light of Russia's economic and political chaos, some members of 
Congress are having second thoughts about the extent of that country's 
involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 During a fact-finding mission in the former Soviet Union last fall, Brown said 
he saw a launch site so substandard that a major investment would be required 
to bring it into compliance. He concluded the United States would be better off 
if Russia's partnership were limited. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the last year I have warned . . . that the arrangement that made us 
dependent on the Russians would be dangerous," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 NASA officials are working hard to persuade Congress that Russian 
participation is not only wise, but also scientifically profitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Space is absolutely woven into the fabric of life in Russia -- there is no 
way they will walk away from this," said NASA spokesman Mark Hess. "Russian 
participation is allowing us to get it built sooner and start getting the 
scientific return faster." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said he will know in about a week whether House Appropriations 
subcommittee chairmen intend to make sufficient money available to NASA. Even 
then, however, a long budget battle lies ahead before a final figure is 
approved, and the future of the space station will not be determined for a 
couple of months, he said.

U.S. WILL ACT TO KEEP GNATCATCHER PROTECTED; WILDLIFE: BABBITT SAYS HE'LL ASK 
FEDERAL JUDGE TO RETAIN THREATENED LISTING, PLEDGES COMMITMENT TO BIRD AND 
HABITAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE and FAYE FIORE, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt announced Wednesday that he will ask a 
federal district judge to keep the California gnatcatcher on the threatened 
species list while Babbitt provides evidence that he says will prove the tiny 
songbird should remain protected. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement applauded by conservationists, Babbitt made clear he is 
committed to keeping both the songbird and its nesting ground safe. 
Conservationists have feared that developers would proceed with projects and 
destroy the bird's fragile habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 "We remain confident that the listing of the gnatcatcher was done on the basis 
of sound scientific information, despite a judge's ruling that the Fish and 
Wildlife Service committed a procedural error in the listing process," 
Babbitt's statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the Building Industry Assn. of Southern California and the 
Orange County Transportation Corridor Agencies, which successfully petitioned a 
federal judge to remove the gnatcatcher from the threatened list, immediately 
said they would oppose Babbitt's request. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the chances of him persuading the judge of reaching a different 
conclusion is very, very small," said Richard Jacobs, lead attorney for the 
BIA. "The matter was extensively briefed. Basically, what (Babbitt) is asking 
the judge to do is allow (the Interior Department) to continue doing something 
that (the judge) has already concluded is illegal." 
</P>
<P>
 In his controversial ruling May 2, U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin ordered 
the bird removed from the list, saying that the government had failed to make 
available to the public all of the raw data it relied upon when it declared the 
gnatcatcher threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 Babbitt said Wednesday that the author of an important gnatcatcher study -- 
Massachusetts ornithologist Jonathan L. Atwood -- has agreed to make his raw 
research available to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in order to 
"straighten out the record." 
</P>
<P>
 In turn, the government will make that data available to the public -- but 
only if the judge agrees to reinstate the bird's protected status in the 
meantime. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the judge does not agree," Babbitt said, "we will consider filing an 
appeal, and will also consider listing the gnatcatcher as a threatened species 
on an emergency basis while we take steps to obtain, make available to the 
public and evaluate all the relevant information." 
</P>
<P>
 While conservationists applauded the secretary's move, people on both sides of 
the issue said it was not likely to derail an extensive habitat conservation 
plan being developed in California. Under the plan, developers will voluntarily 
preserve crucial habitat in exchange for permission to develop on land 
considered less essential to various species, including the gnatcatcher. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter what happens we will continue working on the program," Christine 
Diemer, executive director of the BIA's Orange County branch, said of the 
project, called the Natural Communities Conservation Plan. "We're still 
supportive of habitat conservation." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Broming, vice president of planning and entitlement for the Santa 
Margarita Co., which manages 40,000 acres in Orange County, agreed. The 
company, he said in a statement, "remains committed to the (conservation 
program) regardless of whether the gnatcatcher is listed as threatened. I don't 
believe that a request for a stay of the judgment will significantly affect our 
position." 
</P>
<P>
 Laer Pearce, executive director of the Coalition for Habitat Conservation, 
which represents major developers enrolled in the plan, said the process would 
continue whatever the outcome of Babbitt's request. "We're not dumb," he said. 
"No one is going out and grading since the judge's ruling." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Joel Reynolds, senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense 
Council which successfully petitioned for the gnatcatcher's original listing, 
expressed skepticism that the conservation plan would work without the legal 
pressure provided by government involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's the right move," he said of Babbitt's request for the 
gnatcatcher re-listing. "The stay is necessary to maintain the momentum that 
has been generated in Southern California toward regional conservation 
planning. That effort is dependent on the listing of the gnatcatcher (as 
threatened) to force all necessary participants to the bargaining table." 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Mitchell, spokesman for the environmentalist group Earth Now!, spent 
Wednesday morning with 17 other conservationists demonstrating at the BIA's 
Orange County headquarters in protest of the recent delisting even before 
Babbitt's move was announced. 
</P>
<P>
 "We definitely support the decision," Mitchell said later of the secretary's 
request that the gnatcatcher's threatened listing be reinstated. "This is a 
first step. Let's see how far it goes."

PALESTINE POLICE GIVE GAZA ARABS A 'TASTE OF FREEDOM' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 The moment was one that Palestinians had dreamed of for more than a generation 
-- soldiers of the Palestine Liberation Army returning to their homeland to end 
the Israeli occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 For Fatma Deeb, the reality on Wednesday, as the new Palestine Police took 
control of Deir al Balah, was almost as sweet as all those songs she had sung 
as a schoolgirl and poems she had given her students to read as a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 "I walked out this morning and saw not a single Israeli soldier -- no 
watchtowers, no patrols, no trucks, nothing," said Deeb, 34, "and this for the 
first time in my memory. What I saw instead was truly wonderful -- our 
soldiers, some youths but many veterans, come back as liberators. For me, this 
was the first taste of freedom." 
</P>
<P>
 Although stretched almost beyond the patience and understanding of most 
Palestinians, the replacement of Israeli occupation forces by Palestinian 
police finally began here Wednesday under the agreement on limited self-rule 
for the Gaza Strip and the Jericho district on the West Bank. The 
stage-by-stage process is now scheduled to be completed within a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the moment for which we have worked and waited for so long," Maj. 
Gen. Nasser Yussef, the commander of the new force, said as he moved into his 
headquarters in Gaza City. "Words are not enough to convey our emotions or to 
give full meaning to this step. There is nothing more beautiful than this day. 
. . . It is the first step on the road to independence and freedom for our 
Palestinian people." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of Gazans had stayed up through the night, wrapping themselves in 
blankets and huddling around campfires against the chilly desert winds, to 
welcome the 157 police who arrived here in a convoy from the border with Egypt, 
11 miles to the south, about an hour before dawn Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "To wait another night after 27 years is not much," Mohammed Salman abu Silmi, 
60, a truck driver, said as he waited, seated on a plastic chair in the back of 
a pickup truck, outside the border terminal at Rafah. "These men are making 
history, and for me this is a chance to see good history after living so much 
bad history." 
</P>
<P>
 When the convoy arrived in Deir al Balah, a town of 35,000 including the 
adjacent refugee camp, people poured into the streets, singing the Palestinian 
anthem, "Biladi, Biladi," or "My Homeland," and dancing in the dusty lanes. 
Many embraced and kissed the policemen, draping them with garlands of flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the happiest day of my life," said Lt. Amjad Deeb Shaker, who left 
the West Bank when Israeli forces captured it and the Gaza Strip in the 1967 
Middle East War. "I had tears in my eyes as I arrived here." 
</P>
<P>
 As the crowd grew through the day, it virtually swamped the white-walled 
police station and adjoining army base, evacuated by Israeli troops just after 
midnight, and members of the Fatah Hawks, one of the Palestinian militias here, 
fired their rifles in the air in jubilation -- then in an effort to clear the 
compound. 
</P>
<P>
 "These policemen have brought us peace and security after years of Israeli 
occupation," said Mahmoud abu Samhadeneh, 40, a tailor. "It may seem a funny 
thing to say of a police force, but I feel they have come to protect us and 
free us from the occupation. To me, they are the first step toward Palestinian 
independence." 
</P>
<P>
 Samir abu Zeid, a building contractor, added: "No more curfews at night, no 
more stone-throwing -- I think stability will return to this town. The years of 
trouble we had in Deir al Balah ended when the Israelis left." 
</P>
<P>
 The first move by the new police was to order bulldozers to push aside 200 
concrete-filled metal barrels that Israeli forces had set up in the market to 
keep stone-throwers away from the army base. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first benefit will be the absence of the occupation forces," Yussef 
commented in Gaza City. "So much aggravation, not to say bloodshed, came from 
the cruel fact of the occupation. End the occupation, and life gets better -- 
that is the heart of our mission." 
</P>
<P>
 Freij abu Midan, a prominent Gaza lawyer who is expected to become a member of 
the interim government, the Palestinian Authority, observed that Gazans were 
also liberating themselves from the regulations of the occupation, including 
the 8 p.m. curfew in the territory. 
</P>
<P>
 "The curfew is finished," he said. "The people decided it was over, and they 
came out on the streets to greet the policemen. It seems such a little thing, 
but for us it was throwing off the occupation." 
</P>
<P>
 Preparations were under way for a transfer from Israeli forces to the 
Palestine Police in Jericho as well, but there residents clashed again with the 
soldiers Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble began when the troops, acting on orders of Maj. Gen. Ilan Biran, 
the regional Israeli commander, moved to clear the town of journalists, even 
dragging some out by their arms and legs. Palestinians shouted in protest. The 
troops fired stun grenades, tear gas and rubber bullets at them in response, 
according to correspondents who were forced to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior PLO official said Tuesday that he expected about 1,800 Palestinian 
police to reach Gaza by Friday and about 400 to deploy in the Jericho area. 
</P>
<P>
 The police force, which will have 9,000 members, is a key part of the 
agreement on autonomy, and many Palestinians regard the deployment of the 
police as the first step not only in ending the Israeli occupation but in 
achieving eventual independence. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli Environment Minister Yossi Sarid said Israel will yield control of the 
southern half of the Gaza Strip and Jericho to the Palestine Liberation 
Organization on Friday under current plans and will complete its hand-over 
throughout the Gaza Strip next Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope that as the Palestinians take control of Gaza and Jericho they will 
act to halt terrorism or at least minimize its impact," Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhak Rabin told the Knesset, the country's Parliament, in a debate on the 
agreement signed last week in Cairo. "We see that as the main test of the 
Palestinian police created under the accord." 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement was approved unanimously by the Cabinet and then ratified, 52 to 
0, by the Knesset after opposition members walked out following hours of stormy 
debate.

DEFIANT HAITI PICKS A NEW PRESIDENT; CARIBBEAN: FLOUTING U.N. RESOLUTION, 
MILITARY RULERS AND RENEGADE LEGISLATORS CLAIM ELECTED LEADER ARISTIDE 
ABANDONED OFFICE. THE WHITE HOUSE CONDEMNS THE MOVE. 
</P>

<P>
 In direct defiance of the United States and United Nations, Haitian military 
rulers and renegade legislators on Wednesday named a new government to replace 
exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and all but dared the international 
community to stop them. 
</P>
<P>
 With army commander Raoul Cedras and other military officers looking on in the 
Parliament's main hall, Sen. Bernard Sansaricq, one of two rival presidents of 
the Haitian Senate, declared that Aristide, overthrown by a violent coup in 
September, 1991, had abandoned his office and betrayed the country. They picked 
Supreme Court President Emile Jonassaint as president. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, the White House denounced the Haitian action, which Press 
Secretary Dee Dee Myers called, "cynical, unconstitutional and illegal." 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't recognize that there is a vacancy" in the Haitian presidency, Myers 
said, noting that the Clinton Administration still considers Aristide to be 
Haiti's legitimate president. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jonassaint's elevation raised a key question as to what steps the 
international community might take next, including military intervention. And 
on this topic, officials in Washington on Wednesday took special pains to 
criticize a Times report Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, citing diplomatic sources, said the United States plans to send at 
least 600 heavily armed and protected troops to purge Haiti's military, even if 
a broader, tougher program of sanctions forces the Caribbean nation's military 
rulers from power. 
</P>
<P>
 "The story is wrong," Myers said. But she added that the President is not 
willing to rule out the use of force. 
</P>
<P>
 And Madeleine Albright, American ambassador to the United Nations, said that 
no matter what happens in Haiti, officials think that some kind of a U.N. 
force, with an American component, will eventually be needed in the country. 
She said on NBC's "Today" show that the Administration is doing "contingency" 
planning as it awaits the results, if any, of tough new sanctions against the 
military regime. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, in Port-au-Prince, in a speech marked by bellowing attacks on the 
United States and the United Nations, Sansaricq said the new government would 
take office immediately and serve until new elections are held later this year. 
As he spoke, four cannons were rolled onto the grounds of the Presidential 
Palace to fire a 21-gun salute. 
</P>
<P>
 By naming the little-known, frail, 81-year-old Jonassaint as president, 
Sansaricq, who acted with Cedras' support, openly defied the U.N. Security 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The council approved a resolution last Friday aimed at forcing Aristide's 
return with tough economic sanctions. That resolution "condemns any attempt 
illegally to remove legal authority from the legitimately elected president 
(and) declares that it would consider illegitimate any purposed government 
resulting from such an attempt." 
</P>
<P>
 Sansaricq called the resolution an "invasion of national sovereignty" and said 
Haiti will "resist" any effort by the United States to restore Aristide, 
including the use of military advisers and other troops as contemplated by 
President Clinton as part of an earlier agreement to reorganize and retrain 
Haiti's military and police. 
</P>
<P>
 One diplomat here said the move Wednesday was "the military's way of saying 
'Take your best shot.' " The move was condemned by American officials and 
representatives of other nations. 
</P>
<P>
 But beyond its symbolism, the naming of a new government has practical, 
potentially threatening aspects, most alarming among them the possibility that 
Jonassaint will order the U.N. Civil Mission, which monitors human rights and 
represents the United Nations, to leave the country. Haitian Defiance 
</P>
<P>
 The naming of the new president on Wednesday escalated the conflict between 
the Haitian regime and the international community. 
</P>
<P>
 In Haiti, Sansaricq indicated he was dismissing the likelihood of an American 
military reaction by "blessing" public opposition to such a move from 
individuals such as former President George Bush, Senate Republican leader Bob 
Dole and former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger. 
</P>
<P>
 Sansaricq -- who claims the Haitian Senate presidency based on a 1993 election 
that even the military in Haiti has acknowledged was fraudulent -- denounced 
the U.N. mission here. It is made up of about 100 observers and administrative 
personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 He called the U.N. mission illegal, saying the agreement permitting its 
presence is no longer valid. "The international community," he said, "wants to 
wipe us off the face of the earth. . . . May God spare us this vile and 
murderous pursuit of pseudo-democracy." 
</P>
<P>
 In elevating Jonassaint, Sansaricq operated unilaterally and in violation of 
the constitution he claimed as justification for his decree; neither chamber of 
the Parliament approved the action, as required. There was never even a legal 
vote, and the swearing-in was boycotted by the majority of the legislators. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the U.N. Security Council condemned what it called "the attempt 
to replace the legitimate president of Haiti." In a statement read to the press 
by Ambassador Ibrahim A. Gambari of Nigeria, the council president this month, 
the 15 ambassadors reminded anyone taking part in the new government that they 
will automatically fall under special sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the sanctions resolution passed last Friday, the Security Council banned 
anyone taking part in an illegal Haitian government from traveling outside the 
country or using any funds deposited in foreign bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 In Port-au-Prince, U.S. Embassy spokesman Stanley Shrager said Wednesday's 
events "will not prevent nor delay" the implementation of new, stringent 
economic sanctions. Neither, he said, will the United States be "diverted from 
pursuing the restoration of democracy or the return of President Aristide to 
Haiti." 
</P>
<P>
 But the question now, said one international official, is "whether the U.N. 
would refuse to go and what it would do if the military forced them out." Story 
Questioned 
</P>
<P>
 In reacting negatively to The Times' report on Haiti, Administration officials 
confirmed that Clinton is actively planning to send troops if the regime quits. 
And if it does not, the Administration has said it is considering unspecified 
military options. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times' report Wednesday, citing diplomats and American officials in Haiti, 
said the Administration would prefer to send the troops in after Haiti's 
military leaders step down but would also do so if the military remained in 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 The only question remaining, The Times said, was the timing and ultimate size 
of the force. 
</P>
<P>
 While Myers disputed The Times' story, the White House said the United States 
still plans to take part in a U.N. military and police advisory group that 
would go to Haiti after democracy was restored to train a new police force, 
restructure the army and build roads.

 "The use of force, the President is not willing to rule out," Myers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I haven't heard discussed, and I can't imagine discussing, sending in 
some kind of people to try to achieve a mission like that," she said of The 
Times' report that the United States would consider a reform of the Haitian 
military even if the ruling regime does not step down. 
</P>
<P>
 At a photo opportunity, Defense Secretary William J. Perry observed of The 
Times' story: "I read that report. I didn't recognize it as any plan we're 
working on." Pressed, however, to describe American options in the matter, 
Perry said he could not discuss "any of our contingency plans." 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher said the Administration wants to 
assemble a multinational force, including American troops, to help "train and 
professionalize the Haitian army." 
</P>
<P>
 "In our discussions, we're once again reviving that concept, in feeling the 
need for some military forces there to try to ensure that the transition there 
is a peaceful and positive one," he told reporters at the State Department. 
"That's the kind of force that's being discussed at the present time." 
</P>
<P>
 The Times' story Wednesday quoted sources as saying that such a force would be 
called a U.N. military advisory group but, in reality, would be almost entirely 
an American operation because of the reluctance of other nations to 
participate. Refugee Quandary

 The U.S. Coast Guard on Wednesday was ordered to return to Port-au-Prince 14 
Haitians who were intercepted off the coast of Florida last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 16 refugees were traveling in a 25-foot motorboat stopped about 60 
miles east of Daytona Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 A 4-year-old boy who was found near-dead from dehydration was airlifted off 
the patrol boat Pea Island and transferred to a hospital in Orlando, Fla. His 
father, also aboard the boat, was later allowed to join him. 
</P>
<P>
 The Haitians, believed to be longtime residents of the Bahamas, presented 
special problems for the Administration since last month the Bahamian 
government announced it would no longer accept the return of illegal 
immigrants, either Haitian or Cuban. 
</P>
<P>
 At least some of the 14 Haitians still on the boat have been residents of the 
Bahamas for years, according to one reliable source. 
</P>
<P>
 The 14 Haitians now are being held aboard the Coast Guard cutter Confidence, 
which has remained offshore for the last six days while a decision was being 
made on where to take them, according to Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. James Howe in 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 They are scheduled to reach Haiti on Friday.

NEWS ANALYSIS; PUGNACITY IS GARAMENDI'S STRENGTH -- AND WEAKNESS; POLITICS: HIS 
TACTICS WON MORE COVERAGE FOR OAKLAND FIRE VICTIMS BUT BACKFIRED IN EXECUTIVE 
LIFE TAKEOVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As California's first elected insurance commissioner, John Garamendi sometimes 
seems to operate on the principle that there's no point in knocking on a door 
when a lowered shoulder gets it open just as quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Brute force has been an element of Garamendi's style in the courtroom and in 
his dealings with the powerful industry he regulates, and he makes no apologies 
for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "My predecessors kissed the insurance industry's butt here for 100 years, and 
consumers got screwed for it," Garamendi said. "Damn right I'm confrontational. 
I've kicked butt instead of kissed it." 
</P>
<P>
 The commissioner wins praise from admirers for his energy, his intelligence 
and his work ethic, but if any single trait recurs in descriptions of Garamendi 
by friend or foe, it's his combativeness. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the sledgehammer works spectacularly, as in the aftermath of the 
1991 Oakland firestorm, when Garamendi's pounding -- through critical press 
statements and the record $1-million fine he handed giant Allstate Insurance 
Co. -- got insurers to provide an extra $300 million in coverage beyond the 
limits of the fire victims' homeowners policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Fear of "another Oakland" may have inspired insurers to do a better job in 
subsequent catastrophes, such as last fall's Laguna Beach and Malibu wildfires 
and the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the all-out approach backfires, however, as in litigation over the 
failed Executive Life Insurance Co., when an appeals court rejected Garamendi's 
attempt to provide nearly $2 billion more for traditional policyholders by 
cutting a large class of investors out of his rehabilitation plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "He bulls his way through, never giving up even a losing position," says Mark 
Oberhofer, a portfolio manager at the brokerage firm of Smith Barney Shearson 
in Los Angeles, some of whose clients held securities backed by Executive Life. 
Oberhofer sees a legacy of Garamendi's days as an all-conference guard on the 
UC Berkeley football team: "He was a lineman. I would rather that he had been a 
quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
 Without question, Garamendi has made the commissioner's job highly visible, to 
the point where it has become a sturdy springboard for his current campaign for 
governor. He faces state Treasurer Kathleen Brown and state Sen. Tom Hayden of 
Santa Monica in the June 7 Democratic primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Making the job politically attractive was exactly what lawyer-activist Harvey 
Rosenfield had in mind when he included in Proposition 103 -- his 1988 
insurance rollback initiative -- a provision to make the insurance commissioner 
an elective post instead of an appointive one. 
</P>
<P>
 "We created this job hoping that ambitious people would apply, knowing that if 
they wanted to move on to higher office, they'd have to deliver on Proposition 
103," Rosenfield says. 
</P>
<P>
 He did not support state Sen. John Garamendi's candidacy in the 1990 election. 
Garamendi, a Harvard Business School graduate and veteran of a Legislature that 
had long been friendly to insurance interests, didn't fit Rosenfield's picture 
of a likely consumer champion. 
</P>
<P>
 But today Rosenfield thinks Garamendi has done "pretty damn close to as good a 
job as could be done under the circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 True, policyholders have yet to receive the bulk of the premium rebates 
expected under Proposition 103, but Rosenfield says the shortfall has been more 
than offset by the savings consumers have realized from Garamendi's refusal to 
approve most rate increases. 
</P>
<P>
 Other consumer activists and fellow regulators praise Garamendi for cracking 
down on unfair claim-handling practices, fighting suspected urban redlining or 
discrimination in insurance sales, improving consumer information and showing 
leadership in workers' compensation and health reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Garamendi's ideas for revamping the nation's health system were 
adopted by the Clinton Administration for its national health plan. 
</P>
<P>
 He recently won approval of new anti-redlining regulations that will require 
insurers to file annual statements -- similar to those filed by lenders -- on 
their inner-city sales practices. Garamendi says the regulations will enable 
him to identify and punish discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas Insurance Commissioner J. Robert Hunter, former head of the National 
Insurance Consumer Organization, calls Garamendi "one of the best insurance 
commissioners nationally in recent years." 
</P>
<P>
 It should be no surprise that the insurance industry's assessment is far less 
complimentary. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies and agents blame Garamendi for needlessly polarizing every debate by 
scapegoating them. They question his competence as an administrator, citing 
state audit reports that criticize the Insurance Department's accounting and 
asset management. They say he ignores the law in refusing to consider some 
legitimate rate increase requests. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a good reason why John Garamendi doesn't want a second term," said 
James A. Snyder, president of the Personal Insurance Federation of California, 
a lobbying group that represents several of the state's largest 
property-casualty carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 "What he's built is a house of cards that his successor is going to inherit," 
Snyder adds, predicting that the next commissioner will have to either approve 
unpopular but necessary rate increases or watch the availability of some lines 
of insurance dry up. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi counters that he did the industry a favor by clamping down on rates. 
When companies were confident of regular increases, he says, they lacked the 
incentive to control overhead or undertake creative risk-management or 
anti-fraud measures to reduce what they paid in claims. Without rate increases, 
they became more cost conscious, which improves profitability. 
</P>
<P>
 On rates, Garamendi was the unintended political beneficiary of an action by 
his predecessor, Roxani Gillespie. Just before leaving office, Gillespie 
approved a slew of rate increases. That, plus low inflation and a weak economy, 
kept the pressure off Garamendi to grant new increases. 
</P>
<P>
 When he arrived in office two years ago, Garamendi's primary charge was to 
deliver on Proposition 103, particularly on an expected $2.5 billion in 
rebates. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi has pressured more than a dozen large companies to provide rebates 
totaling more than $700 million. Allstate Insurance Co., for example, agreed in 
August to pay $110 million. That is the largest rebate so far, but it came to 
less than half the $244 million Garamendi ordered the firm to pay in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 To criticism that that settlement and others have been overly generous, 
Garamendi says his original rebate order was based on incomplete information. 
The deals he has struck are the products of more accurate information and, he 
says, tough negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi had promised that no company would receive a new rate increase 
unless its Proposition 103 liability was settled. Several months after the 
Allstate settlement, Garamendi granted the company a 6% increase in its 
homeowners rates. He continues to be tougher on such rebate holdouts as 20th 
Century Insurance Co. and State Farm Group. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, nothing upsets Garamendi more than the continued criticism of his 
handling of the Executive Life insolvency. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles-based insurer had fueled its explosive growth in the 1980s by 
selling attractively priced insurance products and buying high-yielding but 
risky junk bonds. When the junk bond market crashed at the end of the decade, 
Executive Life reported a series of huge losses, sparking a run by worried 
policyholders who cashed in their policies. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, 1991, three months after taking office, Garamendi seized Executive 
Life in what was then the largest U.S. insurance failure, jeopardizing 350,000 
policyholders. During 2 1/2 years of litigation, Garamendi engineered the 
firm's sale -- completed in September -- to a group led by French insurer 
Mutuelle Assurance Artisanale de France. 
</P>
<P>
 But while in control, he took some steps that have been second-guessed ever 
since on Wall Street, in the news media and in court. 
</P>
<P>
 He insisted on selling most of Executive Life's junk bond portfolio as one 
package rather than in pieces over time. The price he got -- $3.25 billion -- 
was barely half the bonds' $6.1-billion face value and, critics say, hundreds 
of millions of dollars less than a more deliberate sale would have reaped. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi argues that junk bond markets were so shaky at the time that nobody 
could have predicted the strong recovery they eventually made. Holding the 
bonds to sell them gradually -- as New York regulators successfully did after 
seizing sister Executive Life of New York -- would have meant exposing 
policyholders to risk of further losses, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The California bond sale is the subject of an ongoing court appeal by a group 
of Executive Life investors who want it rescinded. 
</P>
<P>
 The same investors -- holders of municipal guaranteed investment contracts, 
called Muni GICs -- rebuffed Garamendi's effort to cut them out of the 
rehabilitation plan by putting them in the creditors' line behind the 
traditional insurance policyholders. When the courts ruled against Garamendi, 
the potential recovery for the rest of the policyholders suddenly dropped by 
nearly $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our analysis was that those (Muni GICs) were not insurance products," 
Garamendi says in defending his legal strategy. "My charge was to take care of 
the policyholders." 
</P>
<P>
 Some policyholders who once supported him have become critics, accusing 
Garamendi of bumbling in court and of overstating the value of the deal they 
finally got from the consortium that took over Executive Life. 
</P>
<P>
 Accident victim Tony Griffiths of Solvang, for one, saw his monthly check from 
an Executive Life annuity -- received in a legal settlement -- shrink to 57% of 
its former value when the sale closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Anticipating retirement, Reuben Goldman of Hemet bought $235,000 worth of 
single-premium whole life insurance policies from Executive Life in the 
mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the rehabilitation plan, if he stays in for the full five years, his 
estimated recovery will be $150,000. If he had cashed out immediately, he would 
have gotten only $36,500. 
</P>
<P>
 "Garamendi sold us down the creek," Goldman says. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi maintains that 92% of the policyholders will eventually be made 
whole. As he was taking office, he adds, Gillespie warned him he would have to 
"figure out a way to bury" Executive Life. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't bury it," he says, "we resurrected it." 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of legal fees has been a lightning rod for criticism of Garamendi's 
handling of Executive Life. As of March 17, Garamendi had paid out $34 million 
in such fees. 
</P>
<P>
 He is now under attack in Sacramento for his practice of bypassing the 
attorney general and hiring outside lawyers to represent the Insurance 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi won the authority to hire outside counsel as a result of 1992 
legislation. But state Sen. Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco) is carrying a bill 
to revoke that right. Kopp's bill, which has cleared one legislative hurdle, 
would require the commissioner to obtain approval from the attorney general 
before hiring private attorneys, as was the practice before 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Kopp says that Garamendi has paid about $60 million to outside law firms, 
including some that have donated to his gubernatorial campaign. The money, as 
much as $350 an hour to some outside lawyers, comes from the assets of seized 
insurance companies, such as Executive Life. 
</P>
<P>
 The law firm of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliff has received $8.7 million for 
its work in the liquidation of First Capital Life Insurance Co. of San Diego. 
The firm and its lawyers have contributed $33,500 to Garamendi since he took 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 "This just boggles the mind," Kopp says. "It is outrageous to hire outside 
lawyers for $250 an hour when the attorney general has people who have been 
doing this for 20 or 30 years and charge $90 an hour." 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi defends the practice, saying he has fiduciary obligations to 
policyholders and should be able to hire his own lawyers. He contends that the 
attorney general cannot move quickly in some instances and does not have enough 
attorneys to handle complex cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance specialists in the attorney general's office say they willingly hire 
outside attorneys when necessary, have the expertise, and note that the system 
worked for 60 years before Garamendi's election. 
</P>
<P>
 There is still plenty of legal work to do. Garamendi remains embroiled in 
numerous court and administrative wrangles, including battles with 20th Century 
and others over Proposition 103, with the Muni GIC investors in the Executive 
Life case and with State Farm over his broad allegations that they engage in 
overcharging and other illegal practices. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was given a difficult job because of the attitude of the insurance 
industry, which would not be brought to heel," one prominent consumer advocate 
says. "They've gone at each other like gladiators. The bad news is the industry 
hasn't been brought to heel, but the good news is, Garamendi hasn't backed away 
either."

SENATE OKS STRICT CURBS ON GIFTS TO LAWMAKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT L. JACKSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Senate, in an election-year effort to refurbish the image of lawmakers, 
Wednesday overwhelmingly approved the strictest gift-reform measure ever passed 
by either house of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Voting 95 to 4, the chamber banned virtually all gifts, meals, travel and 
entertainment paid for by lobbyists, special-interest groups and even ordinary 
constituents. The principal exceptions are for modest meals and entertainment 
in a lawmaker's home state or district and gifts from relatives or longtime 
personal friends. 
</P>
<P>
 In supporting the ban, many senators said they hoped to enhance the image of 
Congress, which has been sullied by exposes showing lawmakers cavorting with 
lobbyists on golfing trips or at Caribbean resorts. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), chief sponsor of the legislation, said the vote 
"should help restore confidence in Congress and demonstrate that we're not too 
cozy with lobbyists." 
</P>
<P>
 A joint Senate-House conference committee must now reconcile the Senate's 
near-total gift ban with a slightly less restrictive version passed by the 
House in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Levin predicted disputes in the conference committee over several details and 
called the Senate vote "a significant step but not the final step." 
</P>
<P>
 The House-passed bill restricts benefits from lobbyists and their clients but 
does not prohibit gifts from others -- as the Senate measure does. It also 
allows some controversial practices to continue, including gifts of travel to 
charity golf and tennis tournaments and meals paid for by lobbyists' clients, 
both of which are banned under the Senate legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Levin said the ban on gift travel to corporate-sponsored charity events 
probably would produce the most sparks in the conference committee. Under the 
Senate measure, members of Congress still could participate in charity golf 
tournaments but only if they paid for their own travel and lodging. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of senators complained during debate on the legislation that the ban 
on gifts of travel and lodging could harm worthwhile charities in their home 
states. But after failing last week to amend the measure on that point, most 
joined in approving the package. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sen. Malcolm Wallop (R-Wyo.), one of four who voted against the measure, 
called the legislation "an insult to Congress." 
</P>
<P>
 "What we do is a matter between ourselves and our constituents," Wallop said. 
"But these rules suggest that we can't trust ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Others who voted against the ban, citing similar reasons, were Sens. Robert F. 
Bennett (R-Utah), Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.) and Frank H. Murkowski 
(R-Alaska). Murkowski, declaring that reform of political campaigns is more 
important, sponsored a successful amendment last week to prohibit senators from 
accepting donations from political action committees. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein, California's Democratic senators, 
voted in favor of the package. One member, Sen. Richard C. Shelby (D-Ala.), was 
absent. 
</P>
<P>
 The restrictions are aimed at all Senate staff employees as well as elected 
members in an effort to guarantee that lobbyists cannot heap favors, for 
example, on the chief counsel of an important committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who sponsored an unsuccessful amendment last 
week that would have watered down the restrictions, voted for the bill. But he 
complained that the complexities in the bill, such as exempting gifts from 
friends, would overburden Senate ethics experts and eventually damage the 
reputations of honest members. 
</P>
<P>
 Levin acknowledged after the vote that some members may try to find loopholes 
in the gift ban by claiming gift-givers as longtime friends. 
</P>
<P>
 The overall intent of the legislation is to prohibit members and aides from 
accepting gifts of any value -- such as bottles of liquor, free tickets to 
sporting events or meals at posh Washington restaurants -- from people other 
than relatives or close personal friends. Gifts worth $250 or more from friends 
would have to be approved by House or Senate ethics committees. 
</P>
<P>
 While some said the ban eventually could alter the dining, night life and 
traveling habits of many lawmakers, Sen. William S. Cohen (R-Me.), an outspoken 
advocate of the new rules, disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see an amazing shift," Cohen told reporters after the vote. He said 
he rejects "the whole notion that lawmakers spend most of their time having 
lunch with lobbyists." 
</P>
<P>
 Most senators said Congress must act to correct the public's perception that 
members are too close to lobbyists and special-interest groups, whether or not 
that image is justified. They said they fear an election-year backlash if 
nothing is done. 
</P>
<P>
 On the theory that most frowned-upon "wining and dining" takes place in 
Washington, the Senate legislation generally allows members to accept meals and 
entertainment from business people or other constituents in their home states 
or districts, as long as the gifts are not from a registered lobbyist. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawmakers also would be permitted to accept modest trinkets, such as ballpoint 
pens emblazoned with an organization's emblem, or such home-state products as 
oranges or avocados. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation would also double, to two years, the "cooling-off period" 
during which former top-level congressional and executive branch officials 
would be barred from lobbying their former colleagues. The legislation would 
also bar top federal trade negotiators from lobbying members of Congress or the 
executive branch for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate passage drew immediate praise from Fred Wertheimer, president of Common 
Cause, the citizens lobby. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is far too much money flowing from far too many interest groups," 
Wertheimer said. "This closes down one central form of the spigot."

NEW LAW HAS SCHOOLS EXTOLLING THEIR ASSETS; EDUCATION: OPEN ENROLLMENT DEBUTS 
NEXT WEEK. SOME CAMPUSES ARE RECRUITING THROUGH TV AND NEWSPAPER ADS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 More than 22,000 classroom seats in the Los Angeles Unified School District go 
up for grabs next week when state-ordered open enrollment takes effect, 
unleashing a new era in which schools enter the world of marketing in a frenzy 
to recruit students. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers at Grant High School in Van Nuys took out a $400 newspaper ad listing 
the school's attributes, comparing them with those of private schools and 
asking: "Why pay $12,000 when you can get the same plus more for FREE?" 
</P>
<P>
 At least 20 Los Angeles Unified schools have produced 30-second infomercials 
to be aired on the district's public access television channel, complete with 
snappy slogans touting everything from high-tech computer labs to crime-free 
campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a safe, air-conditioned, closed campus that has won five 
school-beautiful awards," boasts Braddock Drive Elementary School in its TV 
spot. Other schools, such as Lincoln High on the Eastside, have launched a 
multi-pronged campaign with newsletters, a TV spot and weekly visitor tours. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the new age of advertising and marketing -- some people think that 
those are dirty words, but we are going to market our little school," said 
Howard Lappin, principal of James A. Foshay Middle School in South-Central Los 
Angeles, which wants 150 more students in order to launch a major reform 
program. "It's time that schools realize we are living in the real world and we 
better start doing this." 
</P>
<P>
 The activity results from a state law that lets parents enroll their children 
in any school in the same district that has available space. In Los Angeles, 
the hotbeds of school shopping are the West San Fernando Valley and the 
Westside, where declining enrollments and the flight to private schools have 
left empty seats. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to compete," said Santa Campuzano, principal of Braddock Drive 
Elementary in Mar Vista, whose TV pitch opens with a crowd of youngsters 
proudly holding the school's trophies and plaques. "I know we have children who 
live in this area and attend other schools. We are trying to show parents that 
we have a great reputation and their children can do very well at this school." 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere is the state's new law, which was approved last summer, expected to 
have more impact than in Los Angeles. And nowhere, experts say, will the 
advantages and disparities of the choice movement be more clearly visible or 
closely watched. 
</P>
<P>
 The law and the school board's policy will give parents the opportunity to 
send their children to virtually any school that has space, but will not offer 
transportation, which some people see as limiting opportunities for poor 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given the fact that there is physical room to move around in the district, 
L.A. may in fact become the laboratory for what is going to happen" in the 
school choice movement, said Julia Koppich, deputy director of Policy Analysis 
for Education, a research center at UC Berkeley. "Will parents actually select 
different schools? Do schools try to (recruit) certain types of students or do 
they try to develop programs that are available to a wide variety of kids?" 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles school officials say it is difficult to predict whether there will 
be wholesale shifts of students before the application process closes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no idea what this is going to be like, no idea," said Joyce Peyton, 
director of the district office that tracks available campus space. "It's new. 
We have no history." 
</P>
<P>
 More than half of the district's schools -- 382 -- have open enrollment space, 
with middle schools and high schools showing the largest blocks, some ranging 
into the hundreds. Elementary schools run the gamut of space availability, from 
just two to more than 100 seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the schools reporting no space are in the Eastside, South-Central Los 
Angeles and the East San Fernando Valley, areas where the immigrant population 
mushroomed during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Many schools that are perceived to be highly desirable by parents and which 
annually draw many transfer requests -- among them Carpenter Avenue Elementary 
in Studio City and Warner Elementary in Westwood -- report being filled to 
capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools involved in major reform efforts, such as the district's LEARN plan or 
the state's charter school program, also tend to have little or no space, 
possibly an indication that parents are eager to send their children to 
cutting-edge schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1980s saw a phenomenal spurt in school enrollment. During that decade, 
schools across the district were forced to hastily expand by installing 
bungalows and turning to year-round schedules. But the growth suddenly stopped 
two years ago for a variety of reasons, including population declines as a 
result of the poor local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials left it up to principals to determine the number of open 
enrollment seats. Estimates were largely based on empty space on the campus and 
projected enrollment from the local neighborhood. Students from a school's 
neighborhood are guaranteed seats even at full schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Some principals underestimated their space. Principal Clarke Marrow at Grand 
View Boulevard School on the Westside said he declared six open enrollment 
seats, instead of the 12 spaces he might be able to absorb, to leave room for 
recruitment into the school's bilingual education classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to bolster the bilingual program," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the other end of the spectrum, Michael Bennett, principal at Parkman Middle 
School in Woodland Hills, said he estimated liberally, at 300 open seats, to 
attract as many students as possible. "I just want to get the most kids I can," 
Bennett said. "I wanted people to know there is room here." 
</P>
<P>
 Early indications are that parents are spending time checking out schools and 
investigating possibilities close to home or work, pleased to be free of 
district regulations that once bound their children to attend only their 
neighborhood school. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Lightfoot of Canoga Park said he has visited elementary schools in 
Woodland Hills near his wife's workplace. When out touring, Lightfoot said, his 
first impressions were the ones that lasted the longest. 
</P>
<P>
 "One school wasn't well kept, there didn't seem to be anyone to answer our 
questions, we were looking all over the place for the office, and no one 
noticed us" he said, adding that it will not be his school of choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Open enrollment is expected to have a profound impact on sports teams 
throughout the city as high school athletes shop for the best team instead of 
the best classrooms, said Barbara Fiege, the district's director of 
interscholastic athletics. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the California Interscholastic Federation changed its eligibility 
rules to accommodate the open enrollment law. Under the new guidelines, varsity 
athletes can make a one-time move to a high school outside their home districts 
without losing eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the old rules, they would have had to sit out a year if they 
transferred. Coaches are still prohibited from recruiting athletes.

OFFICIALS FAKED DATA TO JUSTIFY COMPUTER, SUIT SAYS; COURTS: WHISTLE-BLOWER 
ALLEGES HE WAS DISMISSED FOR ALERTING INVESTIGATORS TO COUNTY'S $8.6-MILLION 
PURCHASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Top county education officials falsified information to justify the purchase 
of an $8.6-million computer system and later dismissed the whistle-blower who 
alerted investigators, according to a lawsuit that went to trial Wednesday in 
Norwalk Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 A suit by computer analyst Allen M. Weil, 62, alleges that he lost his job 
because he revealed that top officials misled the County Board of Education, 
which authorized a new main computer system in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Office of Education, the suit said, did not yet need 
the computer, which will cost $13.7 million, including finance charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "Allen was harassed, discriminated against and eventually fired (because) he 
was making statements trying to protect the taxpayers," said Weil's attorney, 
Robert L. Esensten. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials named in the lawsuit have denied any wrongdoing and characterized 
Weil as a vindictive malcontent whose analysis about the need for the computer 
was incorrect. 
</P>
<P>
 "Allen Weil thinks he knows more about computers than anyone at the Los 
Angeles County Office of Education, but he does not, " said Eric Bathen, the 
attorney representing the county education office and its officials. "There's 
no validity in his claims." 
</P>
<P>
 Weil's allegations led to a critical audit last year of the education office. 
The dispute also has touched off four lawsuits and resulted in hundreds of 
thousands of dollars in legal costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The state attorney general has taken the unusual step of entering one of the 
lawsuits -- a pending whistle-blower action -- on Weil's side. 
</P>
<P>
 Those named in Weil's wrongful dismissal suit include county schools Supt. 
Stuart E. Gothold and former Assistant Supt. Calvin W. Hall, who retired in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
 Bull HN Information Systems, the company that manufactured the computer 
system, is a defendant in the whistle-blower's suit, but Gothold is not. 
</P>
<P>
 In documents supporting that suit, Weil alleges that his superiors asked him 
to provide false data showing that a new computer was needed because the old 
one was operating at capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 After Weil refused, the suit alleges, administrators prepared such materials 
with the assistance of a Bull HN salesman, and presented the information to the 
Board of Education at three meetings in December, 1990. The board voted Jan. 8, 
1991 to buy the new system that among other tasks processes the payrolls for 
most public school districts in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Documents supporting the purchase stated that on the old computer, "the 
average daily processor utilization was at 90%" and peaked "at 100% or more for 
periods of up to six hours" a day, resulting in delays. 
</P>
<P>
 Using data supplied by Weil, county auditors later concluded that the average 
actually ranged from 54% to 72% over the last two years the old computer was 
used. Weil told auditors that the average was less than 60% at the time 
officials informed the board that the processor was at 90% capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Misleading data was included in the board's proposal" for the new computer, 
auditors reported. "One board member stated that had the accurate information 
been distributed to the board, a more in-depth analysis and discussion would 
have been needed and a different decision may have been reached." The board 
member was not identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Included in the court records was a portion of the draft audit, which said, 
"We believe the management team purposely included incorrect information in the 
board's proposal in order to sway their decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Auditors deleted the latter statement from the report at the request of 
officials from the education office, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Top administrators said they disputed some language in the draft as well as 
critical portions of the final audit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The audit team either did not take sufficient time or lacked adequate 
expertise," wrote Bathen, who prepared a response to the audit for the 
education office. "Based on all of the information supplied to the board, the 
recommendation to purchase the (computer) can easily be supported." 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney general's office supports Weil's contentions in court papers 
filed for the whistle-blower's lawsuit. As a result of Weil's whistle-blowing, 
he "was terminated from his position with the Los Angeles County Office of 
Education by the defendants," according to a joint complaint filed by Weil's 
attorneys and the state attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney general's office decided in September to join Weil's 
whistle-blower lawsuit under laws set up to protect whistle-blowers and 
prosecute companies and public officials who defraud public agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The essential wrong here derives from an excessive closeness between a 
computer vendor and a government agency," said Deputy Atty. Gen. Brian Taugher. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Plicet, a representative for Bull HN, was in charge of the sale of new 
equipment and the servicing of old equipment, including a computer system 
purchased in 1986, Taugher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Plicet has referred questions to an attorney representing Bull HN. The 
attorney denied that Bull HN did anything wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "This litigation involves highly technical and complicated issues that are not 
susceptible to a discussion among untrained individuals," said attorney William 
E. von Behren. "We believe that Bull will be completely vindicated." 
</P>
<P>
 After raising concerns in 1991 about the computer purchase, Weil said he was 
harassed by superiors, according to the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, Hall and two other administrators sued Weil for libel and slander. 
A Superior Court judge dismissed their suit on the grounds that Weil was 
entitled to criticize the job performance of public officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Weil's attorneys later filed a suit against Hall and the others, charging that 
the libel and slander action was malicious prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 "Government fraud and abuse will never be curtailed unless people like Allen 
come forward without fear of losing their livelihood when they do so," said 
Weil attorney Steven Geffner. 
</P>
<P>
 The whistle-blower's suit also alleges that the education office paid $800,000 
to Bull HN for computer maintenance contracts that were not fully honored. 
</P>
<P>
 The auditor's report found no evidence that Bull HN was at fault for not 
fulfilling its maintenance contract. 
</P>
<P>
 In earlier interviews, Hall said small portions of some board reports were 
potentially misleading. In preparing the report, some clarifying information 
was omitted about how frequently the old computer was overtaxed, Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Evidently when it got typed, it just got on the wrong way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 100% capacity figure was not meant to be taken literally, said James K. 
Magill, an assistant director in Weil's department. Magill denies allegations 
in Weil's suit that he had asked the computer analyst to provide misleading 
information about the need for a new computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay M. Stevens, the administrator who presented the case for the new computer 
to the board, also was named in the lawsuit. "The essential argument was that 
we weren't completing our payroll processing" during the time available, he 
said in an interview. "Our speed of processing and all things that relate to 
processing were not adequate or fast enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Data processing is a main function of the education office. The office also 
develops curriculum, oversees school district budgets and operates education 
programs for disabled children, wards of the juvenile court and other special 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Weil was laid off from his job in March, 1993. He is seeking lost wages and 
punitive damages from the education office and several administrators. His 
attorneys contend that administrators engineered Weil's dismissal and disguised 
it as a budget-cutting move. 
</P>
<P>
 Bathen, who represents the education office and its officials, denies those 
charges. Weil, he said in an interview, could have applied for another 
available position and he probably would have been hired. 
</P>
<P>
 Bathen described Weil as a vindictive, unhappy employee who complained 
incessantly about matters ranging from the parking lot to the copying machine. 
He said Weil could not accept any analysis about the computer system but his 
own. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anyone was doing the harassing, it was Allen Weil," Bathen said.

GM WILL BOOST PENSION FUND BY $10 BILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a landmark deal between the nation's largest corporation and the Clinton 
Administration, General Motors has agreed to pay $10 billion in cash and stock 
into its badly underfunded pension plan, the largest private plan in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said the agreement calls for GM to make the 
largest contribution to a private plan ever required of an American 
corporation. The $10 billion should be sufficient to shore up the fund, which 
covers more than 600,000 workers and retirees, for the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Reich said the arrangement is only the first step in the Administration's 
efforts to overhaul the nation's pension system before an S&L-style crisis 
erupts, potentially prompting the need for a massive taxpayer-financed bailout. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the federal government guarantees payments to the nearly 41 million 
beneficiaries of private corporate pension plans, taxpayers could be liable if 
the corporations are unable to meet their obligations. 
</P>
<P>
 Underfunding of corporate plans has roughly doubled since 1987, and today the 
government's potential liability has risen to $53 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Many critics have argued that Congress and federal regulators have been lax in 
forcing corporations to maintain their pension funds at appropriate levels. 
Furthermore, pension obligations are likely to undergo explosive growth by the 
turn of the century, largely as a result of the onset of retirement for the 
oldest members of the Baby Boom generation. 
</P>
<P>
 Calls for reform of the federal government's pension insurance system have 
increased recently as it has become clear that taxpayers' potential liability 
far exceeds initial expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to head off a crisis, the Administration has proposed legislation to 
reform the system. It would force corporations with underfunded plans to 
increase the premiums that they pay for federal insurance of their plans. It 
also would give regulators more power to force compliance and require 
corporations to provide more detailed information to workers and retirees about 
the financial health of their pension plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no reason to panic now but legislation is necessary if we are to 
avoid a crisis in the future," Reich said. The potential taxpayer liabilities 
from underfunded pension plans "is a serious problem and it's growing worse. I 
don't want to get into scaremongering by comparing this to the S&L crisis, but 
we need to get a handle on this to get it under control." 
</P>
<P>
 Reich said the problem must be dealt with while the economy is still growing. 
"The economy is now improving and this is the time to do it," Reich said. 
"Let's not wait until we have another downturn." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Slate, executive director of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., the 
federal agency that regulates pension plans and guarantees benefit payments, 
noted that the agreement with General Motors should "make a substantial dent in 
the problem" of underfunded pension plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it will not solve the entire problem at GM -- the auto maker faced a 
$22.3-billion shortfall in its pension plans at the end of last year -- he said 
the new agreement at least allows the agency to "get a decade ahead of the 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, GM said it will contribute to the fund $4 billion in cash 
and 177 million shares of GM Class E stock, worth more than $6 billion at 
current market prices. GM's Class E shares are stock in its Dallas-based 
Electronic Data Systems subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
 Terms of the agreement free the subsidiary of further liability for shortfalls 
in the pension system, if it is sold. In effect, that deal makes EDS more 
attractive to potential buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, GM agreed not to use any credit balances created by the infusion 
of funds in its pension plans for other purposes until 2003. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, GM had announced that it would agree to pay the $6 billion in stock 
into its pension fund but had not previously stated that it would be willing to 
place another $4 billion in cash into the plan as well. 
</P>
<P>
 At least $2 billion of the cash will be contributed at the same time as the 
stock contribution, with the balance to come no later than Sept. 30, 1995. GM 
also will continue to make its regular pension contributions, which will total 
$8 billion by 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 "GM's willingness to contribute funding of this magnitude to its workers' 
pensions is a welcome step," Reich said. GM's stock payments require approval 
of the Labor Department's Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, but 
officials said they expect the agreement to be completed later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 GM said the agreement represents a "major step" for the company in its efforts 
to cover its pension obligations. "We would like to see our plan pretty much 
funded before the next downturn," in the auto industry, said Heidi Kunz, GM's 
treasurer.

 Out Dexter Charles' 35th-floor window is a stunning view of lower Manhattan. 
In front of him, a flickering, color-coded array of computer screens gives a 
second-by-second read of the prices of securities in a half-dozen markets 
around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 But as he starts his workday, Charles' attention is focused on a few pages in 
his hand -- data showing what will happen to his $350-billion portfolio of 
complex financial deals at Chase Manhattan Bank if interest rates change by a 
hundredth of a percent. It's a calculation so involved that it must be done 
overnight on a state-of-the-art computer workstation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to be able to use PCs to do this," Charles says of the portfolio 
"stress test" -- so called because every fraction of a percentage point change 
in rates places exacting strains on his holdings' value. "But they're not 
powerful enough anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the world of derivatives: deals whose value is based on the 
performance of an underlying stock, bond, commodity or index. Thanks to the 
influence of advanced technology, these transactions have become so esoteric -- 
yet pervasive -- that regulators fret that they are endangering the financial 
system's stability and Congress muses over whether they should be banned 
outright. 
</P>
<P>
 During the last few weeks, such august corporations as Procter & Gamble, Mead 
Corp. and Gibson Greeting Cards have reported major losses -- $102 million, 
$7.4 million and $19.7 million, respectively -- from derivative transactions 
gone sour. Securities and Exchange Commissioner Richard Y. Roberts says the SEC 
expects many more American firms to report heavy losses this year from similar 
deals. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, big investors like George Soros used derivatives to place huge 
speculative bets on the direction of interest rates. When the wagers proved 
wrong, their forced sales of assets to cover the losses aggravated this 
winter's sharp drop in stock and bond prices. Some regulators and members of 
Congress are seeking to tighten government oversight. 
</P>
<P>
 Derivatives have been cursed as the ultimate in useless financial speculation 
and praised as indispensable management tools. Sometimes the praise and 
condemnation come from the same source: All three of the companies posting the 
most recent losses previously were content users, but all say the troubled 
deals were uniquely complex and did not belong in their portfolios in the first 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 That is important because almost everyone in the derivatives business agrees 
on one point: The transactions stand to become only more complex as users 
discover new needs and computers become powerful enough to design new 
solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in the early days in all of this," says John G. Heimann, director of 
global derivatives trading at Merrill Lynch & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The growing derivatives industry can be viewed as a case study of the life 
cycle of innovation on Wall Street. Like technological advances in many walks 
of life, derivatives have elicited fear, suspicion and blame for market crashes 
and heavy losses -- a reputation many observers say is undeserved. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still possible to lose money in all the old familiar ways," says Merton 
Miller, a Nobel economics laureate and professor of finance at the University 
of Chicago. The $751-million loss faced by Germany's Deutsche Bank from a 
recent garden-variety real estate collapse, he notes, makes Procter & Gamble's 
woes look minor. 
</P>
<P>
 "But derivatives are a novelty item," Miller says. "And the very notion that 
some of it is done by computer has an ominous ring to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, derivatives over the last few years have quietly worked their way into 
the hearts of thousands of companies and investment firms. Precise figures are 
not available, but it seems likely that almost every major corporation in 
America uses them in some form. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, some large institutional investors are required by their bylaws to 
hedge certain risks using derivatives. The managers of New Jersey's $350 
million in state pension funds were not permitted to sink $35 million into 
foreign stocks until they came up with a way to hedge the investment against 
losses from currency fluctuations. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, such a hedge might have been difficult to find. But starting 
in the 1980s, Wall Street's innovators learned how to assemble options, futures 
and other commitments in ways that allowed them to fine-tune hedges to the 
financial world's ever more exacting specifications. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of hedging against the simple risk that the British pound might rise 
over the next six months -- that can be accomplished using a derivative known 
as a currency forward -- a company might want to hedge against the possibility 
of the pound rising against the Japanese yen under certain interest-rate 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Hedging such interrelated risks as interest rates and currencies requires 
exceedingly complex matches of options, futures and other securities. Just 
knowing what to charge customers for such transactions required banks and 
investment firms to employ the most sophisticated computers available. The same 
computers were needed to track the values of the hybrid derivatives, which 
theoretically could change second-by-second. 
</P>
<P>
 As befits products on the leading edge of financial innovation, derivatives 
have accumulated a correspondingly abstruse jargon. Among the more than 1,200 
known varieties are swaps, caps, collars, swaptions, range forwards, quantos, 
IO's, PO's, death-backed bonds, limbos and heaven-and-hell bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 If those terms resemble the whimsical names, like "quarks," which physicists 
give to the ever smaller particles into which they are slicing the atom, that 
is because derivative designers are engaged in the similar task of splitting 
financial risk into ever finer pieces. It is no surprise that some of the 
leading figures in the business got their education not in business school but 
in the engineering departments of places like the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology -- from which Dexter Charles earned degrees in both aerospace 
engineering and business. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also no coincidence that many of the more complex deals behave 
unpredictably when their underlying markets suffer shocks, as the interest-rate 
markets did this year. Just as Newtonian physics mysteriously break down at 
extreme high speeds and infinitesimal distances, conventional economic 
relationships break down at the border of financial turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the bond market, you can easily get outside of the region where 
mathematical formulas work," says John O'Brien of Leland O'Brien Rubinstein, 
the Los Angeles consulting firm whose esoteric formulas for deploying 
derivatives as "portfolio insurance" were blamed for exacerbating the 1987 
stock market crash. "Things get beyond the point of predictability." 
</P>
<P>
 The result of guessing wrong at the technological frontier can be a warp-speed 
wipeout. New York money manager David Askin lost $600 million of his clients' 
money and his entire investment firm in virtually 24 hours this year when the 
"stripped" mortgage-back securities he was trading -- thinly-traded securities 
derived from pools of mortgage loans -- collapsed in value as interest rates 
soared. 
</P>
<P>
 Askin had used an elaborate mathematical formula to hedge his market risk 
using futures and options. But his portfolio was so exotic and the market for 
it so tight that he could not find a buyer for his holdings at a rational 
price. In other words, his hedge failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Such cases contribute to a public impression that some of Wall Street's 
so-called "rocket scientists" are shooting new products into the air without 
enough concern about where they come down. And they add to the sense that 
regulators should be doing something about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not keeping pace with the rate of innovation," says Halsey Bullen, 
project director on derivatives for the Financial Accounting Standards Board, a 
private body that oversees corporate accounting regulations. "The rate of 
change is so great that you're regularly presented with an instrument that 
makes you scratch your head to figure out what it is, what its purpose is and 
how do you break it down into something understandable?" 
</P>
<P>
 One place where the limits of financial innovation are tested daily is at 
Dexter Charles' desk at One Chase Plaza. Charles, a 33-year-old vice president 
in Chase Manhattan's global risk management group, uses the overnight portfolio 
run to tell him what new deals he can accommodate in his portfolio that day. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the essence of the derivatives business today. In its infancy 10 or 15 
years ago, banks largely brokered deals between customers. If one had a 
floating-rate loan but wanted to lock in interest payments as if it were a 
fixed-rate loan, the bank would find a customer that wanted to exchange its 
fixed-rate loan for a floating-rate debt. The clients would swap their 
obligations; the bank took a finder's fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Few deals today are done so directly. Now, bankers behave more like insurance 
companies. When you buy fire insurance for your house, your insurer assumes the 
risk and disperses it throughout its portfolio of policies -- most of which 
will not result in claims. Similarly, a bank in the derivatives business 
assumes its clients' financial risks, dispersing them through its pool of 
similar or opposing deals. It tries to hedge any excess risk through the 
futures and options markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles' key tool in managing his pool of deals is the overnight stress test. 
The numbers he reviews in the morning allow him to appraise every new deal -- 
he might see 20 to 60 a day -- by asking, as he puts it, "Will it mitigate the 
risk already in my portfolio or increase it? If it's the first, I can offer the 
customer a lower price to do the deal than if it's the second." 
</P>
<P>
 To manage the calculations involved in this process requires something more 
than conventional bank training. On graduating from MIT, for instance, Charles 
designed helicopters at Sikorsky. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the developments you're seeing in derivatives are tied to 
developments in technology," he says as he scans his screens. 
</P>
<P>
 Take "basket options," the latest innovation in Charles' arsenal of 
risk-management tools. A basket option is a derivative that allows users to 
hedge against multiple related risks at a lower cost than hedging each risk 
separately. 
</P>
<P>
 An airline might be concerned that a rise in interest rates would cause a 
damaging run-up in payments on its floating-rate bank debt. But rather than pay 
the high cost of using options to hedge against a rate rise, it might buy a 
cheaper hedge that kicked in only when both interest rates and another expense 
-- say, oil prices -- were climbing. 
</P>
<P>
 Linking those risks together increases the complexity of the deal 
geometrically. But Charles foresees a time soon when he can offer clients 
derivatives that manage three or more risks simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
 It is this ability to construct such fine-grained hedges that is the key to 
derivatives' usefulness, as well as their dangers. 
</P>
<P>
 As so often happens with financial innovations, many users, even conservative 
ones, now say they could not manage without derivatives. But as banks and 
investment houses search for clients and situations in which their expanding 
derivative-designing capabilities can be put to profitable use, regulators and 
other observers fear that they are trying to sell relatively unsophisticated 
users on extremely volatile, risky transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 Many financial executives say they have been approached by banks over the last 
year or two with overly complex deals, or with transactions aimed at addressing 
less-than-pressing problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "These bank officers are dreaming up ways to accomplish things that couldn't 
be done normally," says Terry Griffis, treasurer of the Metropolitan Atlanta 
Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA). 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Griffis' agency has employed a derivative known as a swap to lock 
in its diesel-fuel expenses a year at a time. And MARTA's board, he says, still 
believes in the transactions, which have saved the agency about $1 million over 
the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
 But the recent spectacle at Procter & Gamble, like others elsewhere, "has had 
a negative impact on our willingness to look at" any more elaborate deals, 
Griffis says. "They're more difficult to sell to the board." 
</P>
<P>
 There is no question that derivatives place an unprecedented premium on 
management skills. The issue raised by recent highly publicized losses is 
whether the transactions were so complex that corporate managers did not 
comprehend the risks. In other words: Did their bankers take them for a ride? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't agree with the premise that anything is being done that's so 
complicated it can't be understood," says Joseph P. Bauman, recently appointed 
director of Bank of America's derivatives business and the chairman of the 
International Swaps and Derivatives Assn. "If a company's management can't 
understand a transaction, they probably shouldn't be entering into it." 
</P>
<P>
 But even the skills of sophisticated investors can be challenged by some of 
the more esoteric devices. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very difficult for an outside investor, even one as big as us, to 
determine the true costs of some of these transactions," says DeWitt Bowman, 
recently retired as chief investment officer for the $81-billion California 
Public Employee Retirement System, the nation's largest public pension fund. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, derivatives are so complex that they could undermine systems of 
control and regulation that otherwise have survived decades of financial 
experimentation. 
</P>
<P>
 Accountants and regulators are looking for ways to ensure that risks from 
derivatives are somehow disclosed on a company's annual report, for example. 
But no such efforts will overcome the fact that an annual report can be more 
than three months out of date by the time it lands in investors' hands. In the 
world of derivatives, that delay might as well be a century. 
</P>
<P>
 "Regulation has always been based on slowly moving institutional structures," 
observes Myron Scholes, a Stanford University finance professor whose 1970 
formula for setting a price on options, developed jointly with his colleague 
Fischer Black, often is given credit for ushering in the age of financial 
complexity. "But if things are very fluid and dynamic, then perhaps the old 
institutions can't be preserved." 
</P>
<P>
 Others argue that the very history of finance is the story of regulators and 
government trying to keep up with such developments. As Merrill Lynch's Heimann 
puts it, "Traders are always ahead of management, management is always ahead of 
the regulators, the regulators are ahead of the auditors and the auditors are 
ahead of the lawyers." HOW DERIVATIVES WORK 
</P>
<P>
 A HYPOTHETICAL CASE 
</P>
<P>
 1) Albatross Airways wants to insure itself against two risks: a rise in 
interest rates that would boost the cost of its adjustable-rate bank loan and a 
rise in oil prices that would jeopardize its ability to buy jet fuel. Albatross 
can live with one or the other. But if both happen at once, the airline's 
future will be threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 2) The airline's bank agrees to protect Albatross against the double-barreled 
risk. It offers Albatross the equivalent of a put option on U.S. Treasury 
bonds, giving Albatross the right to sell T-bonds at a given price at some time 
in the future. The value of the option rises as interest rates go up and bond 
prices fall. That means any money Albatross makes on the option would offset 
its higher loan costs as interest rates rise. To keep the costs of this 
insurance policy down, the bank offers the option only if oil prices also rise 
above a certain threshold price. That way, Albatross is protected only if both 
interest rates and oil prices rise. 
</P>
<P>
 3) Now the bank, not Albatross, faces the risk that oil and interest rates 
will rise. If Albatross exercises its option, the bank will have to buy 
Treasury bonds from the airline at the option price. But it could only sell 
them at a lower market price, leaving the bank with a loss. 
</P>
<P>
 4) So the bank takes steps to hedge that risk -- that is, to insure itself 
against the cost of paying off Albatross' insurance: 
</P>
<P>
 * 1. To hedge against the risk of a drop in bond prices (the same as a rise in 
interest rates) the bank sells Treasury bond futures on the Chicago Mercantile 
Exchange. As Treasury prices fall, the value of the T-bond position rises, 
creating a gain that counters the bank's loss on the option held by Albatross. 
To hedge against rising oil prices, the bank buys oil futures on the New York 
Mercantile Exchange. As oil prices rise, so will the value of the bank's oil 
futures; that covers its potential loss in the oil market. 
</P>
<P>
 * 2. But the futures play is only a temporary step. As soon as it can, the 
bank finds a client needing to insure against risks that are just the opposite 
of those faced by Albatross -- in other words, a company that would be damaged 
by falling interest rates and falling oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
 WHAT CAN GO WRONG 
</P>
<P>
 Derivatives plays don't always work out, as recent market turmoil has 
underscored. Here's what can happen to the participants: 
</P>
<P>
 THE AIRLINE 
</P>
<P>
 Albatross could buy an option for more oil than it actually needs, perhaps 
because its business ebbs and it needs less jet fuel. In that case, it has 
overhedged its oil needs, which is tantamount to making a speculative bet on 
the future direction of oil prices. To avoid this danger, the airline needs to 
restructure its option to reduce the amount of oil covered. 
</P>
<P>
 THE BANK 
</P>
<P>
 The bank's formula showing how oil prices and interest rates are linked -- its 
basis for balancing its trades in the T-bond and oil futures markets -- could 
prove wrong. In that case, the combined trades would not produce enough income 
to offset its obligations to Albatross. The bank then would record a loss. 
</P>
<P>
 GLOSSARY 
</P>
<P>
 DERIVATIVES--Options, futures, or combinations thereof. "Exchange-traded" 
derivatives are offered for sale on regulated exchanges around the country, 
which theoretically guarantees that buyers and sellers can always be found at 
some price. "Over the Counter" derivatives are designed by banks and investment 
firms and tailored to the hedging needs of sophisticated customers. But because 
they may be unusual or even unique, there is no easy way to set a value on 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 CALL OPTION--A contract allowing, but not requiring, the holder to buy a given 
commodity at a set price (the "strike price") by a certain date. If the strike 
price is higher than the cash price of the commodity at the expiration date, no 
sale takes place and the option simply expires. If the strike price is lower 
than the cash price, the owner of the option exercises his right to buy the 
commodity; he then could immediately sell it at the higher price, pocketing the 
gain. 
</P>
<P>
 PUT OPTION--A contract allowing, but not requiring, the holder to sell a given 
commodity at a set price (the "strike price") by a certain date. If the strike 
price is lower than the cash price of the commodity at the expiration date, no 
sale takes place and the option simply expires. If the strike price is higher 
than the cash price, the owner first buys the commodity at the lower market 
price and then immediately exercises his right to sell it at the strike price. 
The difference is his profit. 
</P>
<P>
 FUTURES--Contracts obligating the buyer to purchase a given commodity from 
another party on a certain date. Among other things, the underlying commodity 
can be grains, other foodstuffs, oil, bonds, stocks, or baskets of stocks that 
make up a stock index. Most futures are traded on regulated exchanges in 
Chicago and New York. In most cases, delivery of the underlying commodity never 
takes place; the deal is closed out by the sale of an equivalent future. 
</P>
<P>
 CAP--A derivative that allows a user to set a ceiling on his or her risk. For 
example, a company may want a cap that protects it from paying interest on its 
debt over a certain level. 
</P>
<P>
 FLOOR--The opposite of a cap. A user might be seeking protection from the 
effects of interest rates falling below a certain level. 
</P>
<P>
 T-BONDS--U.S. Treasury bonds with terms of 30 years. Considered the safest 
long-term investments in the U.S. financial markets.

CLAS DISPUTE GROWS WITH EXAM RELEASE; EDUCATION: MATERIAL OFFERED BY SEN. 
LEONARD APPEARS TO BE PART OF THIS YEAR'S CONFIDENTIAL TEST. HE SOFTENS HIS 
SUPPORT, CALLING FOR REVIEW OF THE PROGRAM.

 Heaping fuel on the controversy over the California Learning Assessment System 
tests, state Sen. Bill Leonard (R-Big Bear Lake) released documents Wednesday 
that appear to include confidential copies of parts of this year's tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard issued a news release inviting public inspection, at his district and 
Capitol offices, of a bundle of materials he said were provided him 
anonymously. He conceded that he did not know whether the tests were genuine 
but said he offered them "to stop the rumors." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the exams, which attempt to assess students' higher-order thinking 
skills by asking them to write about their reactions to literature selections, 
have been circulating materials they purport to be this year's test questions. 
Some have been discredited, but at least a small part of the material Leonard 
offered appears to be a current test booklet. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Education declined comment Wednesday, but it has 
continually battled against disclosure of the annual tests, which are being 
given statewide through mid-June. Like other standardized exams, the 
copyrighted questions are kept confidential to protect the fairness and 
effectiveness of the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Although members of the Senate will be allowed to see the 1994 tests today as 
part of an effort to battle rumors and quell public uneasiness about exam 
contents, Leonard said he will not review the tests because a required 
confidentiality pledge would prevent him from discussing the items. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard said he believes that "by and large, it's a pretty good examination." 
But he said before he decides whether to continue his support for CLAS, he 
wants to consult testing experts to see whether "more neutral" writings should 
be included. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Wednesday, Gov. Pete Wilson's education adviser called 
for letting virtually anyone see the reading and writing portions of the tests. 
Additionally, former state schools chief Bill Honig defended the groundbreaking 
testing system he helped develop and the department's handling of it while 
acknowledging that improvements in both content and political support-building 
are needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Maureen DiMarco, Wilson's secretary for child development and education and a 
candidate for state superintendent of public instruction, said the controversy 
had become so hot and plagued by "crazy charges" that "probably nothing less 
than full disclosure is going to satisfy anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue really is confidence in this test," said DiMarco at a Capitol news 
conference called to announce her endorsement by Wilson C. Riles, a former 
state schools superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles judge, who had studied the exams, ruled earlier this week that 
the tests do not invade students privacy or require advance parental 
permission, as critics have said in a series of suits around the state. 
</P>
<P>
 But DiMarco, who also said she has concerns about possible ethnic or racial 
stereotypes in the literary passages, said controversy is approaching 
"hysteria" and that she had privately urged acting state schools chief William 
D. Dawson to make the tests public. 
</P>
<P>
 DiMarco, in blasting the tests as "seriously flawed" earlier this week, drew 
fire from Dawson, who implied that criticism by DiMarco and the governor was 
tied to their political campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Supt. Honig, reached at home in San Francisco, said he was sorry to see 
political leaders who supported CLAS from its 1991 inception, such as DiMarco 
and Wilson, "jumping on the department" instead of working constructively to 
help it make improvements in the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 CLAS supporters who are taking the department to task for its handling of the 
controversies are playing into the hands of "extremist groups with an agenda" 
to undermine public education, Honig said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was forced to resign early last year when he was convicted on felony 
conflict-of-interest charges. The liberal, reform-minded Honig, who has 
appealed the conviction, blamed his prosecution on a campaign by his 
conservative political enemies, some of the same people he said are bent on 
bending public schools to their ideological will. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Honig said there are problems that need to be addressed in the 
tests, ranging from better administration to an improved balance between 
open-ended, "performance-based" questions and more traditional types aimed at 
testing knowledge of facts. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the department probably should have done a better job of building 
political support and "opening up the process further" during test development 
so "when the attack came," supporters could have been prepared to defend the 
exams with a unified voice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any (radically different) system like this is going to have start-up problems 
and kinks," Honig said. "You have to set those right. But they are not the end 
of the world. . . . Real leadership means that when something is under attack, 
and it is important, you find a way to fix it."

AIDE SAYS SHE CONCEALED JOB AS FUND-RAISER; COURTS: FORMER WORKER FOR ASSEMBLY 
REPUBLICAN CAUCUS TESTIFIES IN STATE SEN. FRANK HILL'S CORRUPTION TRIAL. SHE 
SAYS HER DUTIES INCLUDED TARGETING FIRMS WITH PENDING LEGISLATION. 
</P>

<P>
 A former Assembly Republican aide testified Wednesday at the corruption trial 
of state Sen. Frank Hill that GOP legislators were consumed with raising 
campaign funds from industries with proposals pending in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Making her first appearance at the trial, Karin L. Watson, the star witness 
against Hill, provided a glimpse inside the inner workings of the Assembly 
Republican Caucus when then-GOP Leader Pat Nolan of Glendale believed he was on 
the verge of taking control of the lower house from Speaker Willie Brown (D-San 
Francisco). 
</P>
<P>
 Watson, 47, said that in early 1987 she and other so-called special 
consultants to the caucus became worried when Nolan requested that they prepare 
a memo describing their job duties and give it to one of his top lieutenants, 
Assemblyman Ross Johnson (R-La Habra). 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a public version about what our job was and a private version about 
what our job was," Watson told jurors in the U.S. District Court trial, 
describing how she worried about disclosing the true nature of her job. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were aware it was illegal to fund-raise on state time," Watson said. "And 
that's exactly what we were doing and we didn't want to put it on paper." Her 
job included identifying "silver bullet" legislation crucial to potential 
campaign contributors. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she said, she prepared the memo, which included a section about fund 
raising. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson, who joined the caucus staff in 1985, said Hill knew of the 
fund-raising duties of special consultants because he had "specifically brought 
in two people" to do the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was fully aware of what we were doing," said Watson, addressing jurors in 
a deliberate manner during her 40 minutes of testimony that began late in the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill is charged with three counts of extortion, money laundering and 
conspiracy related to an elaborate FBI sting operation. Also standing trial is 
former legislative aide Terry E. Frost. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson agreed to cooperate with prosecutors and testify against Hill and Frost 
in exchange for a government recommendation that she serve a six-month sentence 
in a halfway house. She is awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty to 
extortion. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson said she gave her job memo to Richard Temple, then the caucus chief of 
staff, who forwarded it to Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who was attending the trial, told reporters he had urged Nolan to 
have job descriptions prepared. However, he denied seeing Watson's memo until 
prosecutors showed it to him after the corruption investigation became public 
in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never saw it. Absolutely not," said Johnson, adding that the caucus staff 
was not involved in campaign fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
 But in her testimony, Watson emphasized that one of her duties was to identify 
the silver bullet bills, which she described as legislation that might have 
meant "life or death" to an industry and thus were ripe for campaign 
fund-raising solicitations. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson said Nolan had grown tired of business groups taking Republicans for 
granted, believing the GOP did not need campaign contributions to side with 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Watson said, she was instructed at some points to lie to potential 
donors and say that Republican legislators "(weren't) that thrilled" about 
proposed legislation as a way to raise money. Watson will resume testifying 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Nolan pleaded guilty to corruption charges and he is 
serving a federal prison sentence.

RUN-IN WITH KLAAS MURDER SUSPECT RECALLED; COURTS: ALLEGED KILLER OF PETALUMA 
GIRL GAVE A BIZARRE STORY FOR BEING IN THE ISOLATED AREA BEFORE BEING LET GO, 
DEPUTY TESTIFIES. POLICE WERE UNAWARE OF THE KIDNAPING AT THE TIME.

<P>
 Less than two hours after Polly Klaas was kidnaped from her Petaluma bedroom, 
two Sonoma County sheriff's deputies questioned an agitated Richard Allen Davis 
on a remote country road where his car had become stuck in a ditch during what 
he described as a midnight sightseeing trip, according to court testimony 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the deputies, providing the first public account of the episode, said 
he found Davis' story bizarre but helped him free his white Pinto and let him 
go after a check of warrants revealed that he was not wanted and had a valid 
California driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Michael Rankin said Davis was anxious at the start of the 30-minute 
interview and testily asked what the deputies were doing in the wooded, 
isolated area north of Petaluma. When the deputies -- unaware of Polly's 
kidnaping -- told him they were responding to a report of a trespasser, Davis 
relaxed, and even attempted to drink a can of beer. 
</P>
<P>
 "He opened it, and I promptly told him he could not drink in public or in 
front of us," Rankin said. Davis tossed the can in the brush, prompting Rankin 
to order him to pick it up. 
</P>
<P>
 Rankin said Davis told him he was a welder from the Bay Area who became lost 
while sightseeing during a drive to visit his brother in Mendocino County. 
Davis had bits of leaves and twigs in his hair, Rankin testified, and his pants 
were wet. 
</P>
<P>
 After towing Davis' car from the ditch, Rankin used his loudspeaker and 
ordered him to leave the area. The murder suspect "shrugged his shoulders and 
drove off down the road," Rankin said. Months later, Davis told police that 
Polly had been alive in the woods nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 The testimony came on the second day of a hearing to determine whether there 
is enough evidence for Davis to stand trial in the abduction and slaying of 
12-year-old Polly in October. If convicted of the most serious charges, Davis 
-- a career criminal paroled from state prison just a few months before Polly's 
killing -- could face the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 The deputies were summoned by a homeowner, Dana Jaffe, reporting a trespasser 
on her steep, winding road near the rural enclave of Oakmont. Jaffe said she 
called authorities after her baby-sitter had a frightening encounter with a 
stranger on her way home. 
</P>
<P>
 In court, baby-sitter Shannon Lynch identified Davis as the stranger. Lynch 
said Davis stuck his fingers in her car window and ordered her to get out of 
her vehicle when she found him stuck in the ditch shortly before midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 After she refused to get out, Davis "demanded to know what was up the hill," 
said Lynch, who broke into sobs on the witness stand. "I told him there were 
people up there and that they would call the cops." Then, Lynch added, "I hit 
the gas and bailed." 
</P>
<P>
 The next month, Jaffe summoned the sheriff again after she found a pile of 
clothing and suspicious strips of fabric in the woods near where Davis had been 
stuck. Those items -- which included a pair of Polly's tights, a man's dark 
sweat shirt and a condom -- ultimately led authorities to Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Wednesday, an FBI forensics expert testified that fibers from Polly's 
clothing and bedroom carpet matched those collected from Davis' Pinto. Fibers 
from Polly's red cotton nightgown were also found on a black sweat shirt worn 
by Davis on the night of the kidnaping, Special Agent Chris Allen said.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / LEGISLATURE; LAW ENFORCEMENT RESUMES REFLECT IMPORTANCE 
OF CRIME ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GLADSTONE and JERRY GILLAM, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With crime as a driving issue, a growing number of candidates who wear the 
badge of law enforcement are seeking Assembly and Senate seats in the June 7 
primary election. 
</P>
<P>
 Capitalizing on mounting public fears about crime, 18 candidates with law 
enforcement backgrounds -- double the number four years ago -- are among those 
running in the primary for all 80 Assembly seats and half of the 40 seats in 
the state Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crime is the mother of all issues for this election, so you are seeing a lot 
of law enforcement candidates or candidates who have past law enforcement 
experience," said Ray McNally, a veteran Republican legislative campaign 
strategist. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the season of fear," he said. "People are afraid of becoming victims 
of criminals." 
</P>
<P>
 Crime is not the only issue on the minds of voters. Other concerns include the 
rising number of illegal immigrants, persistent joblessness, performance of 
public schools and political corruption in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the balloting begins next month, the primary lineup reflects 
another massive exodus of veteran lawmakers. Among the newcomers are expected 
to be more women, Latinos and Asian Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Prompted in large measure by a voter-imposed term limit initiative, 29 
legislators are either seeking higher office or retiring. Twenty-two are in the 
Assembly, where incumbents are limited to three two-year terms, and seven are 
in the Senate, where incumbents are restricted to two four-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, term limits have had a mixed impact -- luring an influx of fresh faces 
to Sacramento, but failing to dramatically reduce political partisanship as the 
newcomers promised they would attempt to do when they arrived in the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 Coupled with the redrawing of legislative district lines to reflect 1990 
census changes, term limits are expected to continue to expand the ranks of 
ethnic and minority groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The 11-member Latino caucus should pick up several new seats, including a new 
Los Angeles Senate seat being sought by Assemblyman Richard Polanco (D-Los 
Angeles). But the Latino community is badly split on his replacement in the 
strongly Democratic district, with Polanco endorsing his aide Bill Mabie, who 
is white, and others favoring Antonio Villaraigosa, a Latino teacher 
representative. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also expected that the 29 female members of the Assembly will build on 
gains made during the much-heralded 1992 "year of the woman" in politics. 
Democrats have high hopes for Susan Davis, a former San Diego school district 
trustee, to win the seat held by retiring Assemblyman Mike Gotch. 
</P>
<P>
 The primary serves as a preliminary to the main election bout in November, 
when Democrats will be attempting to extend their 23-year-long reign in both 
houses of the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Assembly, the party lineup is 47 Democrats and 33 Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Republican lawmakers concede that it is unlikely they will gain more than 
two or three seats. With Democrats retaining control, Speaker Willie Brown 
(D-San Francisco), who is seeking a final term in the Assembly, would probably 
remain for another two years as the Assembly's leader -- a position he has held 
since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's a good likelihood that we'll stay where we are or the numbers 
won't change much at all," said Gale Kauffman, the Assembly Democratic campaign 
strategist. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the Senate, things could be different. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats hold a 22-16 majority over Republicans. Two other members are 
independents. Of the 20 seats in even-numbered districts up for grabs this 
year, 15 are held by Democrats, including several who are retiring rather than 
seeking reelection from marginal districts. 
</P>
<P>
 So, new President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward) faces a much more daunting 
task than Brown as Republicans mount stiff, well-financed challenges around the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 The force behind the GOP effort is Rob Hurtt, an upstart, rookie senator from 
Orange County. In the past two years, Hurtt has joined with three other 
Christian businessmen to lavish $3.6 million on conservative candidates and 
causes. He is the Senate GOP point man on campaign strategy and one of the 
architects of the party's plan to win a Senate majority. 
</P>
<P>
 In a demonstration of his deep pockets, a political action committee founded 
by Hurtt loaned $100,000 to right-wing Republican freshman Assemblyman Ray 
Haynes in late 1993 for his bid to move up to the Senate this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Haynes is battling longtime Riverside County Sheriff Cois Byrd for the GOP 
nomination to run in a Riverside-area district. That contest could become one 
of the most high-profile tests of the ability of a lawman to draw votes in a 
legislative contest. 
</P>
<P>
 The seat is being vacated by Democrat Robert Presley, who is running for the 
State Board of Equalization. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent trend of trying to trade on law enforcement credentials is not 
without precedent. Presley is a former Riverside County undersheriff. Probably 
the best known former law enforcement officer to have served in the Senate in 
recent years was former Los Angeles Police Chief Ed Davis, who retired as a 
lawmaker in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 That year, two Republicans with strong police backgrounds captured Assembly 
seats. They were Richard K. Rainey, a former Contra Costa County sheriff, and 
Larry Bowler, a retired Sacramento County sheriff's lieutenant. Two years 
earlier, Democrat Tom Umberg of Santa Ana, a former assistant federal 
prosecutor, won his Assembly seat. Umberg is now running for attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, another primary shootout in which law enforcement credentials are 
likely to be a decisive factor is over the Assembly seat left vacant by the 
resignation of Pat Nolan, the Glendale Republican who pleaded guilty to 
political corruption charges. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Glendale-Burbank district, voters have seen a spirited contest among 
Democrat Adam Schiff, a former assistant federal prosecutor, Republicans Peter 
Repovich, a Los Angeles police officer, and James E. Rogan, a Municipal Court 
judge. Earlier this month, Rogan, pitching himself as tough on crime, won a 
special election to fill the remaining few months of Nolan's term. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, in a neighboring swing district, Democrats are pinning hopes in 
November on Bruce Philpott, a retired police officer who served as Pasadena 
police chief for two years, to oust freshman Assemblyman Bill Hoge 
(R-Pasadena), who has had an undistinguished first term in office. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic strategist Kauffman said Philpott's resume was tailored for such a 
district in which Democratic and Republican voter registration is evenly 
matched. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are fighting in (such) districts we wouldn't fight in before," she said. 
"So that has made us look for different kinds of candidates and in the Hoge 
seat a law enforcement candidate is ideal." 
</P>
<P>
 In the primary, at least three Democratic incumbents face serious intraparty 
challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 They are Sen. Ralph C. Dills of El Segundo, the dean of the Legislature, who 
is opposed by three Democrats, including Torrance City Councilman George 
Nakano, who is bidding to be the first Japanese American to serve in the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Assembly side, two new Democratic women lawmakers are battling to save 
their seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie Assemblywomen Diane Martinez of Rosemead, who quickly gained a 
reputation among her colleagues for outspoken remarks, is opposed by Monterey 
Park City Council member Judy Chu and Garfield High School teacher Roy Torres. 
The district is strongly Latino but also heavily influenced by growing numbers 
of Asian Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 In Northern California, rookie Assemblywoman Vivien Bronshvag of Kentfield in 
Marin County is facing Kerry Mazzoni, a member of the Novato school board. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the liveliest primaries are in districts in which one party has a 
strong majority, meaning that the main competition is in the June primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Three such contests are developing among Democrats in districts that touch on 
the Westside, the home turf of the political organization headed by Reps. 
Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) and Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
 In one pitched battle in the West Hollywood area, nine candidates, including a 
raft of locally elected officials, are vying to succeed Assemblyman Burt 
Margolin, who is running for state insurance commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 In a neighboring Santa Monica-centered seat, Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman 
(D-Brentwood) is campaigning to become a Superior Court judge. His departure 
has sparked a lively Democratic primary field of nine candidates, including 
lawyer and former television actress Sheila Kuehl. On the Republican side, one 
aspirant, Michael T. Meehan, is a reserve deputy sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
 The third strongly Democratic seat up for grabs is held by Assemblywoman Gwen 
Moore, who is trying to move up to the secretary of state's post. Her exit has 
drawn a field of 13 hopefuls, including Kevin Murray, son of Assemblyman 
Willard H. Murray Jr. (D-Paramount). 
</P>
<P>
 Family ties may also play a role in what is expected to be a GOP donnybrook to 
succeed retiring conservative Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach). Among 
the four candidates is Thomas G. Reinecke, a businessman and son of former GOP 
Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke.

CAPITOL JOURNAL: OF AMBITION, PEOPLE SKILLS AND BROKEN LEGS

<P>
 There could have been a better place to ask John Garamendi about his 
reputation for excessive ambition and not being a good "people person." But you 
take interviews where they're given. 
</P>
<P>
 We were crunched into the back seat of a medium-size sedan -- I in the left 
corner, the 6-foot-2 Garamendi buckled in the middle, with the remainder of 
space occupied by his broken right leg. He obviously was in pain. His voice was 
strained and sweat dripped down his forehead. 
</P>
<P>
 He'd just stood on one foot for an hour while delivering a major speech. Now 
he was headed for a hospital to get the word on his fibula, broken two nights 
before in a fall from the top of a seven-foot ladder. The insurance 
commissioner had been leaning on an oak branch, trying to fix short-circuited 
lights during a barn dance at his 21st annual Basque Barbecue in the Sierra 
foothills. The branch broke. So he was facing the possibility of surgery and 
weeks in a hard cast while campaigning for governor on crutches. 
</P>
<P>
 And there was this newsperson, asking him about being over-ambitious and 
arrogant, tags that have dogged his 20-year career. He ran and lost two 
statewide races before being elected insurance commissioner in 1990. As a 
senator, he'd attempted to oust then-leader David A. Roberti, an ally, and 
gotten only his own vote. Although widely respected for intellect, knowledge 
and energy, Garamendi has few friends in the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 He's as independent as a hog on ice, as they might say around the Sierra 
ranches where he grew up. And on this particular day, a story headlined "People 
Skills May Harm Garamendi" has just been spread across the top of Page 1 in his 
hometown newspaper, the Sacramento Bee. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never been an inside ballplayer in the Capitol," explained Garamendi, 
who used to make long drives home every night to be with his large family 
rather than schmooze in Sacramento. But, of course, that's just part of the 
story. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi was raised by perfectionist parents who instilled a strong work 
ethic; his grandfather was an immigrant Basque sheepherder who inspired the 
offspring. John strove to excel, becoming an honor student and an all-star 
lineman for the Cal Bears. He believed what really mattered was what he could 
prove in class and on the field. Networking wasn't needed; tenacity and talent 
prevailed. He didn't tolerate fools, slackers or backslappers. 
</P>
<P>
 Blessed with brains, brawn and good looks, Garamendi usually succeeded with 
this attitude. But it doesn't always work in politics, where personality and 
pliability often matter more than policy. 
</P>
<P>
 I mentioned some of these observations and Garamendi seemed to agree, adding: 
"I'm also not perfect. I know I've made plenty of mistakes. And I've learned 
from them." 
</P>
<P>
 Mistakes, he said, such as initially seeing the Senate as "just a house of old 
men. It turns out those old men, whatever their shortcomings, also had a great 
deal of wisdom." And challenging Roberti, he conceded, was a very big mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 As for ambition, he said: "Come on, give me a break. I personally like 
ambition. I expect my employees to be very ambitious, to want to improve 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 And that took him to Kathleen Brown, the front-runner for the Democratic 
nomination, whose experience in state government consists of less than 3 1/2 
years as treasurer; whose family lineage is the cornerstone of her candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who's ambitious?" Garamendi asked. "I've been 20 years in major public 
policy. I am prepared to deal with the issues of this state. She's not proved 
anything other than she could get elected treasurer and is the daughter of one 
governor and the sister of another." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the clock is ticking down for the 49-year-old ex-lineman. The primary 
election is in less than four weeks and the latest polls show him trailing by 
double digits. Says his campaign manager, Darry Sragow: "I've maintained we 
would win by grinding out the yards. But I guess we're at a point where we need 
the long pass." 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi hopes to throw the long pass with some TV commercials starting next 
week and continuing through the election. He and his wife, Patti, will help buy 
the ads with family farm money. They're not saying how much, but it'll likely 
be around $1 million. "The family believes in John," says Patti Garamendi. "We 
have to help him cross the finish line." 
</P>
<P>
 At the hospital, the candidate got good news: no surgery and no hard cast, 
just a flexible cast and crutches. 
</P>
<P>
 As for my questions, Garamendi's response about political ambition being a 
virtue made utter sense. And the fact he could tolerate a query about 
personality flaws while throbbing with pain proved he's not all that bad a 
"people person."

NEWS ANALYSIS; UNLIKELY ALLIANCE COULD TAKE SHAPE IN HUNGARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL J. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A convincing comeback by the Hungarian Socialist Party four years after it was 
ousted in Eastern Europe's first free elections has stirred thoughts of a 
once-unimaginable alliance between a liberal party founded by dissidents and 
the former Communists who repressed them. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a marriage of political convenience would seem to hold little prospect of 
enduring a full four-year governing term. But Hungarian voters are afflicted by 
nostalgia for a more stable past and by fatigue from the confrontations that 
have marred the first post-Communist government. 
</P>
<P>
 Socialist candidates won a third of the popular vote in this week's election, 
and they lead in enough individual parliamentary races heading into a May 29 
runoff to be assured of having the upper hand in forming a new coalition -- if 
not an outright majority that would let them govern alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the Socialists and the voters' second choice, the liberal Alliance of 
Free Democrats, claim to recognize the risks entailed in one-party government 
by a leadership that has only a slim majority and was empowered largely by a 
protest vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "People didn't vote for the old regime, they voted against the present 
government. This is the swing of the pendulum back to the left after moving too 
far to the right," said Laszlo Rajk, a leading member of the Free Democrats, a 
prominent dissident in the 1970s and the son of an anti-Communist activist 
executed during Hungary's darkest days of dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Socialists are going to need a counterbalance, as well as a stamp of 
approval," he said. "Hungarians tend to use their votes as a vendetta, and the 
Socialists don't want to be the only ones around to be blamed next time." 
</P>
<P>
 Rajk argues that the proposed alliance, though difficult to fathom on an 
emotional level, would give the Free Democrats influence in defining government 
policy as well as some control over what personalities and factions within the 
Socialist Party emerge to take important ministerial posts. 
</P>
<P>
 Socialist Party leader Gyula Horn has already appealed for a coalition 
government, and other party leaders insist there is no reason to fear that they 
will set back the pace of reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "In no way do the Socialists want to turn the clock back," insisted Imre 
Szekeres, a Socialist Party vice president likely to be nominated to a key 
government post. 
</P>
<P>
 Former political prisoners, like poet and dramatist Istvan Eorsi, concede that 
today's Socialists are a different breed from the party that jailed him after 
the 1956 anti-Communist revolt and censored his work through most of his 
lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, this Socialist Party doesn't represent the old cadres who I grew to 
hate, the ones who sent me to prison and hanged my friends," said the bearded 
writer who is an influential member of the Free Democrats but describes himself 
as a "misunderstood Socialist." 
</P>
<P>
 That anti-Communist crusaders such as Rajk and Eorsi see the Socialist 
resurgence as a natural and not-so-disturbing consequence of this unsettled age 
is likely to comfort both the confused masses and wary foreign investors who 
have plunked $7 billion into new business ventures here over the past four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Hungary led the post-Communist pack in attracting foreign investment. But that 
advantage has gradually evaporated as more enticing tax breaks have been 
offered to investors elsewhere in Eastern Europe and as Hungary's privatization 
ground to a halt amid government bureaucracy and corruption. New jobs failed to 
materialize while the make-work networks of the Communist era were disbanded, 
leaving 13% of the labor force jobless and many others awaiting layoffs at 
bankrupt heavy-industry complexes that have yet to be closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Coupled with inflation that has ranged from 40% a year to the present 22%, the 
social welfare disaster turned the population against the present government. 
</P>
<P>
 The economic policies of the Free Democrats and the Socialists differ little 
in print. But the popular groundswell for an easing of the shift to a 
democratic free-market system is expected to pressure the Socialists to divert 
more resources to social programs that could hamper their ability to stimulate 
economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the Free Democrats agree to form a coalition with the Socialists 
depends heavily on the results of the second voting round, as the liberal party 
risks losing those members who avidly oppose the alliance on principle. "Our 
task now is to prevent the Socialists from getting a landslide victory," said 
Gabor Kuncze, the Free Democrats' candidate for the post of prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
 The Free Democrats plan to campaign heartily in the three weeks before the 
runoff in hopes of collecting enough additional seats to enter coalition talks 
with the Socialists on a more even footing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Otherwise we will be giving them legitimacy and risking defections from our 
own membership while getting nothing substantial in return," said Eorsi. "We 
also have to be very careful not to appear too anti-Socialist, since this is 
clearly the people's choice. We'll have to restrain ourselves and not speak too 
much about the past."

WILDLIFE; TINY DEER STIR UP COLOSSAL CONFLICT ON FLORIDA ISLAND; SOME RESIDENTS 
OF BIG PINE KEY SAY PRESERVATION EFFORTS ARE INTERFERING WITH PLANS FOR A NEW 
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE CLARY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About a million people a year drive through the refuge of one of this 
country's most endangered species. But sometimes, the only Key deer they see is 
the one they hit with their car. 
</P>
<P>
 The body count is posted along U.S. Highway 1, on a sign with changeable 
numbers. Last year, 68 of the diminutive deer were found dead, 53 hit by 
vehicles. So far in 1994, the death toll stands at 22. Road kills account for 
14. 
</P>
<P>
 But deer and motor vehicles are not the only things colliding here. Some of 
this island's residents say the government's efforts to protect the deer are 
infringing on their constitutional rights, especially when it comes to 
providing their children a good education. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is a proposal to build an elementary school on the island, ending the 
need to bus Big Pine Key children to a school on neighboring Sugarloaf Key. 
Local environmentalists, as well as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, oppose 
building a school, saying it will only spur more development. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fear we have is that the school is the foot in the door," said Jon 
Andrew, manager of the Fish and Wildlife Service's 8,000-acre Key deer refuge, 
which includes about half the area of Big Pine Key, largest of the Florida 
Keys. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were 800 people on Big Pine in 1970," he said. "Now the population is 
4,500. That has put a lot of pressure on the deer." 
</P>
<P>
 The often-nasty fight over the school has been going on for five years. 
Swastikas and "kids before deer" graffiti have been spray-painted on highway 
signs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really a bitter battle," said Big Pine resident Debra Harrison, the 
Florida Keys coordinator for the Wilderness Society, which also opposes 
building a school. "I've been called a communist and an agent of Satan, and my 
son has been called a child of the devil." 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of the school say they are not anti-deer. "Nobody wants to see the 
extinction of a species," said Shirley Mart Benson, a real estate agent and 
grandmother of school-age children. "But I believe in children first and deer 
second." 
</P>
<P>
 The creature at the center of the brouhaha is a subspecies of the Virginia 
white-tailed deer that grows no bigger than a large dog. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of hunting and habitat destruction, the Key deer nearly collided 
with extinction in the 1940s, when no more than 50 were believed to remain. But 
with the establishment of the federal refuge in 1957 and stepped-up law 
enforcement, the herd has been stabilized at about 300 deer. 
</P>
<P>
 The deer attract a lot of attention. "They are what I call a charismatic 
megafauna," Andrew said. "Especially when you see a fawn, you want to pick it 
up. . . . People come here from all over the world to see them." 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors and residents also feed them, a practice that can cause as many 
problems as speeding, Andrew said. "When every 10th person feeds them a slice 
of bread, they get tame. The deer concentrate in areas where they are being 
fed, and then if disease breaks out, it spreads quickly. People also leave, and 
the deer who have always been fed are milling around. We call them zombies." 
</P>
<P>
 One particular incident involving the deer earlier this year earned wide 
notice. A doe, nicknamed Pine Needles, was released into the refuge after 
months of rehabilitation on two legs broken in a run-in with a car. But 10 days 
after being released with a radio collar, she was found dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Island resident Arthur K. Hilbert charges refuge managers with negligence in 
releasing the deer before it was able to fend for itself. He suggests fencing 
off an area of the refuge where injured animals could be monitored. 
</P>
<P>
 But assistant refuge manager Stuart Marcus defends the release of Pine 
Needles. "We knew it was risky. But our whole goal is to release deer back into 
wild, not to keep them as zoo animals." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Monroe County school board officials have proposed that an existing 
church building -- outside the refuge area but on Big Pine -- be used as a 
school and expanded as needed. 
</P>
<P>
 But Harrison, for one, remains stalwart in opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I live on Big Pine, and I have a 4-year-old, and I want the best education 
for my child," she said. "But part of his education is being connected to 
wilderness and making certain sacrifices for endangered species."

TRANSPORTATION; FEAR OF 4-WHEEL COMMUTERS KEEPS BIKE KICKSTANDS DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By RAY DELGADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Next time you go for a bicycle ride, you might consider this: More than 100 
million Americans did the same thing last year, but fewer than one in 25 
pedaled to work even once -- even though, for half of the nation's workers, the 
ride would be less than five miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Why didn't more bikers ride to work? The answer is one of many found in the 
"National Bicycling and Walking Study" just released by the Transportation 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The $1-million study, prepared for Congress, attempts to discover why 
Americans do not walk or bike more in general, what those choices mean for 
health and the environment and how people can be encouraged to go from here to 
there by using their feet for something other than gas pedals. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, the study found that bicycling and walking would make 
Americans healthier, cut traffic jams and reduce pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 "It also will lead to healthier, more active lifestyles, an important 
component of the President's health care initiative," Transportation Secretary 
Federico Pena told a rally of bicyclists held here in conjunction with release 
of the report. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans should double the trips they take by bike or foot, which would have 
people leave the car at home about 16% of the time, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
 So why didn't more people bike or walk to work? According to the study, the 
primary reason is concern for their safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Although in recent decades a large number of U.S. cities have built networks 
of walkways and bike lanes, many were designed for recreational purposes -- not 
to move large numbers of walkers or bikers along major commuting routes. 
Perhaps more important, many communities still have no separate lanes or paths 
of any kind for bicyclists. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really don't do a good job in most of our cities in accommodating 
bicycles," said Barbara McMillen of the Transportation Department's Federal 
Highways Bicycle Program Office. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the benefit of special routes, cyclists and walkers are forced into 
the chancy practice of mingling with rush-hour traffic. Accident statistics 
make the point vividly. Car accidents involving bicycles or pedestrians killed 
more than 6,000 people last year and injured 75,000, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent Harris poll showed that nearly half of adult bicyclists said they 
would pedal to work at least occasionally if they were provided with safe 
places to ride. 
</P>
<P>
 To encourage more people to leave their cars at home, government needs to 
provide for bicyclists and pedestrians in local, state and federal 
transportation plans -- building bike lanes alongside new roadways, adding them 
to existing routes and creating sidewalks where needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Transportation Department officials said bicycle plans must be included in the 
long-range transportation plans that every state and metropolitan area is to 
submit within the next eight months under terms of the Intermodal Surface 
Transportation Efficiency Act approved by Congress in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Local authorities can help further, the report said, by considering biking and 
walking routes in land use and law enforcement decisions, which could include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Requiring bikeways and walkways in new housing developments. 
</P>
<P>
 * Discouraging suburban sprawl -- which often leapfrogs beyond the urban 
fringe and puts housing a long distance from jobs and stores -- while 
encouraging more mixed-use neighborhoods in which housing, shopping and work 
are within biking or walking distance. 
</P>
<P>
 * Creating police bike patrols to enhance safety through enforcement of 
bicycle and pedestrian laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Local officials also can reach out to invite citizens to play a role in 
planning. "If you work with these people and let them know that they have a say 
in what the community will be like, then they will participate more," McMillen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 William Wilkinson, executive director of the Bicycle Federation of America, 
called on bikers to pressure government representatives at all levels to adopt 
measures to improve commuter routes.

RUSSIAN PARLIAMENT OKS AUSTERITY BUDGET PLAN; ECONOMY: IN BOOST FOR YELTSIN, 
LAWMAKERS BACK BLUEPRINT. DEEPENING RECESSION IS EXPECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Russian government won a stormy battle over its Western-backed blueprint 
for economic reform Wednesday by persuading Parliament to accept the outline of 
a relatively tight 1994 budget. The squeeze is certain to deepen Russia's 
recession and raise unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
 Heeding a call for austerity by Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, 
lawmakers voted 233 to 73 to adopt his plan to spend $104 billion and collect 
$66 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The deficit is high by Western standards but low enough by Moscow's 
calculations to cripple inflation, which hit nearly 1,000% in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote capped a turnabout in the fate forecast for Russia's free-market 
reform program in January when Chernomyrdin forced its leading architects out 
of the Cabinet. They then predicted that the prime minister, a former Soviet 
gas industry boss, would wreck their program with huge state subsidies to 
ailing Soviet-era factories. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wednesday, Chernomyrdin stood in the Duma, the lower house of Parliament, 
and declared: "Yes, it's a tough budget. Today a tough budget is the only way 
to mobilize the vitality of market forces. . . . It is the starting point 
without which we cannot leave this room." 
</P>
<P>
 And -- to the surprise of many who predicted resistance by foes of reform -- 
most lawmakers took Chernomyrdin's word that the government had no hidden 
resources and voted his way. The main opposition came from reformers who wanted 
an even smaller deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to switch from political ambition to reality," said Antonia Zhilina, 
a deputy from the centrist Women of Russia party. "This budget cannot satisfy 
everyone, but it's our last chance for stabilization." 
</P>
<P>
 The vote was one of the few legislative victories for President Boris N. 
Yeltsin since Parliament was elected last December. Since the Soviet Union 
collapsed 2 1/2 years ago, control of the Yeltsin government has swung 
unpredictably between reformers trying to shrink the state and conservatives 
trying to prop up the industrial giants of the old order. The current period of 
reformist austerity has run eight months, the longest of all, and brought 
inflation below 10% in each of the past three months. 
</P>
<P>
 Chernomyrdin promised a tight budget to the International Monetary Fund in 
March in exchange for a $1.5-billion loan. IMF approval cleared the way for 
talks with Western nations on rescheduling Russia's $80-billion debt. 
</P>
<P>
 But unemployment, unknown in Soviet times, is creeping upward. A growing 
number of factories, many the chief employer in their home cities, are so 
starved for state credits that they are sending workers on unpaid vacations. 
Government officials estimate that 5 million Russians, about 7% of the work 
force, will be jobless by midyear. 
</P>
<P>
 Zil, which makes trucks and Russia's most famous limousines, announced last 
week that as many as 20,000 of the 85,000 workers at its Moscow assembly plants 
will be laid off by year's end. In Ekaterinburg, Uralmash is closing its 
35,000-employee metal factory from May to August. Even cosmonauts are being cut 
from the space program. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Western efforts to help Russia set up a "social safety net" of 
temporary jobs and welfare programs, the government has done little for the 
unemployed. Right-wing and Communist foes are trying to exploit discontent over 
layoffs in a new round of street rallies aimed at driving Yeltsin from office. 
</P>
<P>
 His advisers are divided on the threat of unrest. The Economy Ministry, 
reporting a 25% drop in industrial output over the past year, warned last week 
of "the danger of a social explosion." In an interview after the budget vote, 
Labor Minister Gennady G. Melikyan disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unemployment will grow, of course, but this is not lethal," he said. "The 
concern here is that it does not become an avalanche. We will try to make the 
process gradual. . . . Ten percent (unemployment) is tolerable." 
</P>
<P>
 The budget outline adopted Wednesday sets slightly higher spending and deficit 
figures than the ones Chernomyrdin negotiated with the IMF. Budget allocations 
were left for another day, but the limits are not subject to change. 
</P>
<P>
 During an often raucous debate, several lawmakers called for higher spending. 
Alexander Piskunov, a centrist, called for more defense spending to avoid 
unrest in the army. He suggested a deficit of 41% of all spending, as opposed 
to Chernomyrdin's 36% limit. 
</P>
<P>
 "No way!" the prime minister shouted, leaping from his seat. "Everything must 
stay within 36%." 
</P>
<P>
 It is far from clear that the budget will save the economy. Some observers 
predict that revenues will fall short and the real deficit will be nearly 
double the limit. Other critics say the economy simply cannot recover from 
Chernomyrdin's medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 More optimistic officials in Russia and the West say the dismal employment and 
recession figures do not reflect the dynamism of an emerging, hard-to-measure 
private sector that can only benefit from low inflation. 
</P>

YELTSIN, KOHL AGREE ON TROOPS' PULLOUT CEREMONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARJORIE MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin on Wednesday dropped his objections to 
German plans for separate farewell ceremonies for the final withdrawal of 
Allied and Russian troops from Berlin this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 In an apparent trade-off, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl gave Yeltsin his 
strong backing for an enlargement of the Group of Seven into a Group of Eight, 
including Russia. The G-7 is an organization made up of the world's most 
powerful economies. 
</P>
<P>
 The send-off of Russia's remaining 20,000 troops in Germany has been a prickly 
issue between the two governments for months. Aiming to assuage Russian 
feelings that their troops were getting shabby treatment, Kohl bent over 
backward to embrace his good friend Yeltsin at a news conference on the first 
day of the Russian leader's three-day visit. Kohl stressed the close, historic 
ties between Germany and Russia and said a special telephone hot line would be 
set up between the Chancellery and Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
 The leaders said they would bid farewell to Russian troops together in Berlin 
on Aug. 31 -- a compromise, as Kohl had wanted to move half of the ceremony out 
of Berlin to nearby Weimar and Yeltsin had wanted to be included in a goodby 
parade with Allied forces to honor their joint defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is my special concern that we see off Russian soldiers from Germany in a 
dignified and respectful manner and that this happens from a spirit of 
friendship," Kohl said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he wanted to have a Weimar meeting only to emphasize the countries' 
cultural heritage over its belligerent history in a town that is "the cradle of 
modern, parliamentary democracy in Germany." Kohl said he and Yeltsin would 
meet there at a later date with Russian and German cultural figures. 
</P>
<P>
 American, British and French troops are to mark their Berlin departure with 
June 18 celebrations organized by the city and a send-off by the federal 
government Sept. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 The German government and Western allies agreed that Russia should not be 
included in the Berlin festivities, since the postwar roles of Russian and 
Allied troops were quite different. Western troops defended West Berlin during 
the Cold War, while Moscow's troops were effectively an occupying force behind 
the Communist government in East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin had made clear in a speech Monday that Russia felt it was receiving 
second-class treatment and that its national pride had been offended. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Wednesday, he accepted essentially separate but equal treatment. "I am 
very satisfied that Helmut Kohl sensed the mood among the Russian people and 
the mood of the president and that we now came to this result," Yeltsin said. 
"One should avoid everything that could destabilize the political situation in 
Russia." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin wants to show nationalists back home that he is successfully 
integrating Moscow into the West, and, to that end, Kohl vowed to campaign for 
Russia's joining an expanded G-7 at the group's Naples summit this summer. The 
G-7 now is made up of the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Britain, 
Italy and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 At Wednesday's news conference, Yeltsin appeared to be edging back toward 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization's Partnership for Peace, an American 
proposal for loose cooperation between NATO and former Warsaw Pact countries. 
Yeltsin said he would agree to sign the agreement if a special protocol for 
Russia were completed.

 Battered government soldiers fought fiercely to stall a rebel advance in the 
capital, Kigali, that threatened a key army stronghold near the airport.The 
rebels have attacked Kigali along several fronts over the past week with 
artillery, mortars and infantry. But they have focused their efforts on the 
base on the city's outskirts defended by three government battalions. The camp 
would give the rebels control of the airport.

BUTHELEZI, WINNIE MANDELA JOIN S. AFRICA GOVERNMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nelson Mandela included his chief black rival in the Cabinet of South Africa's 
first post-apartheid government on Wednesday and gave his estranged wife a 
deputy minister post. 
</P>
<P>
 Zulu nationalist leader Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi became home affairs 
minister, and Winnie Mandela was named deputy minister of arts, culture, 
science and technology. 
</P>
<P>
 The 27-member Cabinet, which includes 18 representatives from Mandela's 
African National Congress, six from former president Frederik W. de Klerk's 
National Party and three from Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party, was sworn in 
at the Union Buildings and held its first meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Buthelezi had been expected to join the Cabinet after Inkatha won 10% of the 
vote in last month's election. But the inclusion of Mrs. Mandela came as a 
surprise, especially after Mandela refused to acknowledge her at the first 
meeting of Parliament on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In accepting the home affairs portfolio, Buthelezi takes over the ministry 
that once oversaw his KwaZulu black homeland and other black territories 
created under apartheid. The homelands have been disbanded and the country 
divided into nine provinces. 
</P>
<P>
 Inkatha's Ben Ngubane was named arts, culture, science and technology 
minister, and Sipho Mzimela, also of Inkatha, was named correctional services 
minister. Among the deputy ministers were Bantu Holomisa, former military 
leader of the ANC-aligned Transkei black homeland, and Inkatha negotiator Joe 
Matthews. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the plum Cabinet posts went to ANC leaders, including Alfred Nzo, a 
former exile named minister of foreign affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Modise, who led the ANC's guerrilla wing, is defense minister, and Sydney 
Mufamadi, an ANC activist imprisoned by the apartheid government, is the top 
police official. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Party contributed Derek Keys, who will continue as finance 
minister. Roelof F. (Pik) Botha, who was the world's longest serving foreign 
minister, was appointed minister of mineral and energy affairs.

BOSNIAN SERBS ACCUSE MUSLIMS OF ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bosnian Serbs on Wednesday accused the Muslim-led government of launching a 
new artillery attack on Brcko in northern Bosnia, 24 hours after shelling 
killed four in the town center, sharply raising tensions in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 But in central and southern Bosnia, Muslim and Croatian leaders agreed on 
political and territorial issues of a Bosnian federation. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest attack on Brcko apparently caused no casualties as five tank shells 
hit the town's outskirts. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tuesday evening, a shell killed a 61-year-old man, his pregnant 
daughter-in-law and her 2-year-old daughter. A policeman died later from wounds 
suffered in the shelling. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations fears that Brcko, straddling a vital Serbian supply line, 
will become the focus of the next big battle in the Bosnian war as rivals build 
their forces in the area.

SENATE PANEL VOTES TO DELAY VITAMIN RULES; CONGRESS: MEASURE WOULD PUT OFF FDA 
CURBS ON NUTRITIONAL CLAIMS MADE BY MANUFACTURERS. LAWMAKERS WERE SWAYED BY 
CONSUMER CAMPAIGN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ROSS and MARLENE CIMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Senate committee approved legislation Wednesday that would delay the 
imposition of new Food and Drug Administration restrictions on the nutritional 
claims made by vitamin manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 Rejecting a more restrictive proposal by its chairman, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy 
(D-Mass.), the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee instead approved 
legislation sponsored by Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) on a 12-5 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Hatch's bill, which could go to the full Senate as early as next week, would 
delay for three years labeling regulations for dietary supplements, which are 
scheduled to go into effect on July 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Left unchallenged, those regulations would require manufacturers to show that 
"significant" scientific agreement exists before claiming that a particular 
vitamin or nutritional supplement can help prevent or cure any disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy's bill would have modified but essentially retained the standards 
proposed by the FDA to regulate the $4-billion-a-year nutritional supplement 
industry, which critics claim often makes misleading and unsubstantiated claims 
about the health benefits of some of its products. 
</P>
<P>
 But, clearly influenced by a flood of mail and phone calls from consumers who 
fear that the regulations could result in many dietary products disappearing 
from the shelves, a majority of the committee members sided with Hatch's 
industry-backed bill. It would require the FDA to disprove a nutritional claim 
before barring a manufacturer from using it. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee "responded to the largest letter-writing campaign and largest 
outcry in the history of our country. They responded to their constituents," 
said Gerald Kessler, executive director of the Nutritional Health Alliance, an 
industry-led group. 
</P>
<P>
 FDA officials had no immediate comment, but FDA Commissioner David A. Kessler 
argued in testimony before another Senate committee Tuesday that dietary 
supplements should be governed by the same regulations Congress has already 
imposed on food products. 
</P>
<P>
 Those regulations require that manufacturers meet the "significant scientific 
agreement" standard before making health claims about their products. 
</P>
<P>
 But, noting that the attempt to impose the new restrictions had put the FDA on 
a collision course with "hundreds of millions consumers (and) their efforts to 
make themselves healthier," Hatch argued that "dietary supplements aren't drugs 
or food additives and should be protected against arbitrary FDA actions." 
</P>
<P>
 Denying that manufacturers were making false claims about their products, 
Gerald Kessler, who is not related to the FDA administrator, said safeguards 
written into the Hatch bill in an attempt to reach a compromise with the FDA 
would secure "the right of consumers to have access to dietary supplements" 
while assuring that they are not misled by unsubstantiated advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics called the compromise inadequate and argued that it could even lower 
existing safety standards by restricting the FDA's authority to bar potentially 
hazardous products from the shelves of health food stores. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hatch bill, as passed by the committee, "opens the floodgates to 
misleading health claims for at least another three years," said Bruce 
Silverglade, a spokesman for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a 
public-interest food and nutrition group. 
</P>
<P>
 "In addition, the bill lowers safety standards for dietary supplements . . . 
(because) the FDA could only remove products that pose an imminent danger -- 
not those that pose a potential hazard, such as products that cause allergic 
reactions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to address some of those concerns, Hatch incorporated a proposal 
into his legislation that would form a congressionally appointed commission to 
conduct a two-year study into a more effective process for ruling on 
manufacturers' health claims. 
</P>
<P>
 He also promised that he would rewrite some of the legislation before it goes 
to the Senate floor in order to address concerns, voiced by several senators, 
that his bill would strip the FDA of too much of its authority to safeguard 
consumer interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy had argued that any easing of the standards could invite some 
manufacturers of supplements and herbal extracts to dupe customers into buying 
products with unsubstantiated claims about cures for cancer or AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the senators did not dispute the need for safeguards to prevent 
abuses, the majority agreed with Hatch that the standards of scientific proof 
sought by the FDA were both unnecessary and too high for the manufacturers of 
most dietary supplements to meet.

DEMOCRATS, GOP SELECT MODERATES FOR PENNSYLVANIA GOVERNOR'S RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Voters picked moderates in both parties for the race to succeed Gov. Robert P. 
Casey, while Republicans broke tradition by choosing a conservative as their 
standard-bearer against Democratic Sen. Harris Wofford. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Tom Ridge defeated Atty. Gen. Ernie Preate on Tuesday in a hotly 
contested race for the GOP gubernatorial nomination. The Erie congressman had 
35% of the votes to 29% for Preate. Three other candidates trailed. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Democratic side, Lt. Gov. Mark S. Singel led a field of six candidates 
with 31% of the votes. State Rep. Dwight Evans was next with 21%. Lynn Yeakel, 
who had upset Singel in the 1992 Democratic Senate primary, finished fourth 
with 14% of the votes. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Senate primary, U.S. Rep. Rick Santorum, 36, easily defeated former 
George Bush aide Joe Watkins to win the GOP nomination to challenge the 
68-year-old Wofford, who was unopposed. 
</P>
<P>
 And Democratic Rep. Lucien E. Blackwell of Philadelphia became the second 
congressman this year defeated in a primary, losing to state Sen. Chaka Fattah. 
The first was Democratic Rep. Craig Washington of Houston, who was upset in the 
Texas primary in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said Ridge and Singel will have to define themselves before the 
November general election. Both favor capital punishment, abortion rights, a 
ban on assault weapons, new prison construction and cuts in the corporate net 
income tax, said political scientist Terry Madonna of Millersville University. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both candidates are essentially moderates. They'll work hard to distinguish 
differences between themselves to the voters," Madonna said. 
</P>
<P>
 With a campaign slogan of "Ready right now," Singel had touted his six months 
of experience as acting governor last year when Casey was recovering from a 
heart-and-liver transplant. 
</P>
<P>
 In voting elsewhere Tuesday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.) defeated two little-known challengers to win 
the Democratic nomination for a seventh term. 
</P>
<P>
 * Newark, N.J., Mayor Sharpe James won reelection to a third term in the 
state's largest city. 
</P>
<P>
 * A measure that would have made Oklahoma the 37th state to have a lottery was 
defeated by a 3-to-2 margin.

HUNGER STRIKERS TO PROTEST FORCED RETURN OF HAITIANS; POLICY: LOS ANGELES 
RELIGIOUS, POLITICAL AND CIVIC LEADERS TO HOLD ONE-DAY FAST TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A broad coalition of Los Angeles religious, political and civic leaders said 
Wednesday that it will hold a one-day hunger strike today to protest President 
Clinton's policy of sending Haitian refugees back to the embattled nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The protest, which will be joined by people in several other major cities, is 
designed to show solidarity with Randall Robinson, the executive director of 
the Washington-based TransAfrica foundation who recently ended a 27-day hunger 
strike directed against the forced repatriation of Haitians. 
</P>
<P>
 "The average person has got to take a moral stand," said the Rev. Louis Chase 
of Lynwood, who recently visited Haiti. "We are an interdependent world." 
</P>
<P>
 From religious leaders to immigrant-rights activists to members of the City 
Council, several dozen local activists argued that Clinton's policy of 
preventing boatloads of Haitians from reaching U.S. shores is flawed and 
racist. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once again, we are shutting the door based on color," said Angelo Ancheta of 
the Coalition for Humane Immigration Reform of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of Haitians have fled by boat since the military ousted the 
country's first democratically elected president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, in a 
September, 1991, coup. 
</P>
<P>
 Until last weekend, the Clinton Administration's policy was to block these 
would-be refugees at sea and return them to Haiti for consideration of their 
applications for political asylum. Often, those returned were met on the docks 
by Haitian officials. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Clinton modified the policy, saying intercepted Haitians would soon 
be interviewed on board ship about their eligibility for political asylum. In a 
letter to the President, the local group expressed concern about statements by 
some Clinton aides that the Administration expects that 90% to 95% of all 
interdicted Haitians will still be returned to Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas introduced a motion Wednesday urging the 
city to stop doing business with U.S. companies that operate in Haiti. The 
group members also called for a public boycott of those companies, which 
include manufacturers of baseballs, electronic goods and clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who joined in opposing the policy were council members Jackie 
Goldberg, Mike Hernandez, Nate Holden and Rita Walters; the Rev. Cecil R. 
Murray of First African Methodist Episcopal Church; Joe Hicks, executive 
director of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and Ramona Ripston, 
executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern 
California.

OPPOSITION TO BABBITT AS JUSTICE IS ASSESSED; SUPREME COURT: CLINTON SOUNDS OUT 
SENATORS ON THEIR REACTION TO POSSIBLE NOMINATION. INTERIOR SECRETARY IS 
BELIEVED TO BE TOP CHOICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 President Clinton on Wednesday sounded out senators about a Supreme Court 
nomination of Bruce Babbitt, amid signs that he may end a five-week search 
today by choosing among the Interior secretary and federal judges Richard S. 
Arnold and Stephen G. Breyer. 
</P>
<P>
 As Clinton sought to gauge lawmakers' opposition to Babbitt -- probably the 
most liberal of the trio -- some senators and Administration officials said 
that they believe Clinton is inclined to name the Arizonan. However, some White 
House aides, noting that Clinton often had made liars of those who tried to 
divine his choices, insisted that Arnold and Breyer remain strong contenders. 
</P>
<P>
 One aide said that an announcement is "likely" today. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton spent much of Wednesday making telephone calls from the Oval Office 
and the White House residence in an effort to gauge the strength of support or 
opposition to the candidates and White House aides did the same. By early 
evening, however, the President had spoken to none of the candidates directly 
nor had any visited the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton met with First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton on Wednesday afternoon and 
at 5 p.m. summoned Chief of Staff Thomas (Mack) McLarty and Counsel Lloyd N. 
Cutler for a 2 1/2-hour meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The nomination seemed to be boiling down to a question of how much controversy 
Clinton would be willing to endure at a time when his health reform bill is 
mired in Congress, his foreign policy is under fire and his poll ratings are in 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
 In their talks with senators, Clinton and his aides were trying to judge 
whether the objections Republicans surely would raise to Babbitt over his 
Western lands policies could open up a broader review of his record and turn 
even some Democrats against him. Among other moves, Babbitt has angered Western 
business interests by advocating higher mining and grazing fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), the ranking minority member of the Judiciary 
Committee, has indicated that he would challenge Babbitt's record, and 
Republican Sens. Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming and Hank Brown of Colorado are 
expected to join the critics as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Some congressional aides noted that Hatch is facing reelection this year and 
has been criticized by some conservatives as taking too conciliatory a position 
on Administration nominations -- two factors that might sharpen his attacks on 
Babbitt. Some aides also contended that even some Democratic support for 
Babbitt is tepid. 
</P>
<P>
 There was agreement, however, that Clinton probably would win a Babbitt 
confirmation by a lopsided vote. 
</P>
<P>
 One key aide predicted that the proceeding would not be as smooth as last 
year's confirmation of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, "where they sat back and 
let it happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Other Democrats who favor a Babbitt nomination suggested that Clinton should 
persevere, contending that he cannot afford to let it appear that Hatch and the 
Republicans have a veto over his Supreme Court choices. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'd really look like a weeny if he backs down now," said one liberal 
advocate. And some suggested that Clinton actually has an opportunity to win 
political points if he takes on a controversy over Babbitt -- and wins. 
</P>
<P>
 One potentially important voice of support came from Sen. John McCain, the 
Arizona Republican, who called Babbitt "one of the most thoughtful, 
intellectual individuals I've known on the political scene" and "an ideal 
member of the Supreme Court." 
</P>
<P>
 Some also asserted that the support of a home-state senator from the 
opposition party could help deflate opposition to Babbitt from other 
Republicans. 
</P>

 Times staff writers Melissa Healy, Ronald J. Ostrow and Karen Tumulty 
contributed to this story.

CLINTON'S WELFARE REFORM PLAN NOT LIKELY TO PASS IN 1994, BENTSEN SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said Wednesday that he does not expect the 
Clinton Administration's welfare reform initiative to be enacted by Congress 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he said, the President plans to make health care reform the central 
focus of his legislative agenda for the remainder of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen said that welfare reform faces a squeeze as a result of several 
factors: the Administration's legislative agenda is too crowded, Congress is in 
the midst of an election year and the White House is having trouble finding 
ways to pay for all of its costly new initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be surprised if we could do welfare reform this year -- pleasantly 
surprised," Bentsen said in an interview. "We can't get everything done this 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 In his State of the Union Address, President Clinton urged Congress to move 
quickly to pass a plan to "end welfare as we know it." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Administration's inability to find adequate sources of funding for a 
broad welfare reform plan has forced the White House to scale back sharply the 
scope of its reform proposal, and also has led to repeated delays in the 
official unveiling of the Clinton plan over the last few months. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, as the White House has moved full-speed ahead on health care 
reform, it has become increasingly evident to welfare reform advocates that 
they may have to wait while Congress deals with health care. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House has tried for some time to deflect criticism over the delays 
on welfare reform. In his State of the Union message, Clinton said: "I know it 
will be difficult to tackle welfare reform in 1994 at the same time we tackle 
health care but, let me point out, I think it is inevitable and imperative." 
</P>
<P>
 But Bentsen's comments seemed to confirm the fear that welfare reform will be 
the loser this year on the Clinton agenda.

CHARGES FRUSTRATE, ANGER CLINTONS; WHITE HOUSE: SOURCES SAY THE COUPLE'S 
CONFIDENT PUBLIC IMAGE MASKS THEIR DISTRESS OVER WHAT THEY SEE AS A CAMPAIGN TO 
DISCREDIT THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK NELSON, TIMES WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In public, President Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton have 
remained unfailingly confident, patiently defending themselves against the 
seemingly endless questions and criticisms about their financial investments 
and the President's personal conduct while governor of Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 In private, however, senior aides and others close to the Clintons say they 
are angry, frustrated and frequently distracted by the continuing allegations 
and by what they see as a politically inspired campaign to discredit them. 
</P>
<P>
 White House sources described Hillary Clinton as privately "distressed and 
consumed" by the Whitewater matter -- the failed real estate development that 
critics say led to improper benefits for the Clintons -- and other 
controversies. The sources said she is "incredibly angry that it's distracting 
from health care reform." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton himself rails to associates about what he contends is "unfair media 
coverage" and attacks by conservative critics, the sources said. He fumes that 
no other President has had to endure attacks based on events of 10 or 15 years 
before they entered the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 And he insists that various allegations of financial and sexual misconduct 
were fully aired during the 1992 presidential campaign, even though additional 
allegations have emerged since he was elected President -- many of them at odds 
with explanations given during the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the appointment of special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. to investigate 
the Whitewater allegations occurred in large part because of such disparities 
and seeming contradictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor does it seem likely that the storms will die down anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, former Arkansas state worker Paula Corbin Jones filed a 
long-threatened civil lawsuit accusing Clinton of sexual harassment and 
improper advances in 1991. While the Clintons' attorney, Robert S. Bennett, 
dismissed Jones' accusations as "tabloid trash," they are only the latest in a 
series of allegations of sexual misconduct against Clinton. And the lawsuit 
raises the prospect of round after round of unflattering news reports if it 
works its way through the legal system. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, conservative critics are keeping up their attacks, reporters are 
still digging into the Clintons' past, congressional hearings are in the offing 
and key parts of Fiske's investigation are likely to run well into next year. 
One lawyer working on Whitewater said it could extend into 1996, when Clinton 
likely will be running for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons stumbled in their early responses to the Whitewater controversy 
and resisted the appointment of a special counsel. But Chief of Staff Thomas 
(Mack) McLarty said that "we think we have it managed well now, although it 
will ebb and flow a little -- it's not fully predictable." 
</P>
<P>
 While McLarty said he takes solace from members of Congress who say they do 
not hear much about the Whitewater controversy from their constituents, he 
added: "It is real, and we take it seriously. It feeds on skepticism people 
have about elected officials." 
</P>
<P>
 Said John Podesta, the aide named to head up the White House response to the 
Whitewater matter: "We just have to take it one day at a time now and answer 
all the questions. Underneath it all, the story is already out there in one 
form or another and there are not a lot of new facts to develop." 
</P>
<P>
 Before Podesta was named as the Whitewater point man in mid-March, the White 
House response to questions about the matter was unstructured and 
undisciplined, with what Podesta called "a lot of people" involved in the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said McLarty "told other people they shouldn't work on it or fret about 
it, but leave it to me and others working on it." That made people feel better, 
he said, "because it was out of their faces. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Galled by the ceaseless attacks as they are in private, the Clintons have not 
been diverted from pressing ahead with one of the heaviest congressional 
agendas of recent times. 
</P>
<P>
 Aides argue that one of Clinton's best responses to all the allegations is to 
try to achieve the goals of his presidency. "After going through a roller 
coaster of polls, the suicide of a colleague and all the attacks -- personal 
and financial -- and all the legislative battles, the President still has 
pursued the largest domestic agenda of any President in 30 years," a senior 
aide said. "People will judge him on that." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, aides predicted that Fiske will issue a report confirming the 
finding by U.S. Park Police that the shooting death of Vincent Foster, the 
Clintons' friend and deputy White House counsel, was a suicide and unrelated to 
the Whitewater matter or other controversies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The worst will be behind us after Fiske's report," said a senior aide. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Clintons, though, it has been an anguishing ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
 The President was crying the night last summer that he telephoned his mother 
in Little Rock, Ark., to tell her that Foster had killed himself. The 
President's mother, the late Virginia Kelley, broke down and cried too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every man has his breaking point. We just don't know where it is," she told 
her son. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton later took a long vacation, the first in many years. Kelley wrote in 
her autobiography that it made "his mother happier than I'd been in a long 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, who has read and reread his mother's autobiography, cites it as a 
source of strength as he struggles to keep his Administration moving. 
</P>
<P>
 The most important lesson his mother imparted to him, the President said, was 
"just don't give up."

LEFT, RIGHT SWITCH ROLES ON CLINTON HARASSMENT CLAIM; POLITICS: THOSE WHO 
DISCOUNTED ANITA HILL'S CHARGES AGAINST CLARENCE THOMAS SUPPORT PAULA JONES' 
AGAINST THE PRESIDENT, AND VICE VERSA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Conservative Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) is sporting a new lapel 
button these days: "I Believe Paula." 
</P>
<P>
 Liberal Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio), meanwhile, voices undisguised 
disgust at what he says is the spectacle of the President being pilloried in 
the press by an accuser whose chief motive may be money. 
</P>
<P>
 The unprecedented lawsuit filed against President Clinton by Paula Corbin 
Jones, a former Arkansas state employee who claims that she was sexually 
harassed by Clinton when he was governor, has reversed the roles played by 
liberals and conservatives during the Anita Faye Hill-Clarence Thomas 
controversy during his confirmation hearing as a Supreme Court justice in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 In that struggle, women's groups and liberals rallied to defend Hill, a 
University of Oklahoma law school professor, in her allegations of sexual 
harassment against the conservative nominee. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, though, liberals seem desperate to erase the parallels between Jones and 
Hill as quickly as gleeful conservatives can draw them. And it is clear that 
neither side is comfortable with the ideological role reversal as they trade 
charges of hypocrisy and accuse one another of having double standards on the 
issue of sexual harassment. For their part, women's groups have been tepid in 
their response to Jones' allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Women's groups and liberal Democrats on Capitol Hill accuse conservatives like 
Dornan of exploiting Jones' allegations to undermine the President and exact 
political revenge for the wounds inflicted on Thomas in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Thomas was subsequently confirmed, it is widely assumed that Hill's 
allegations of sexual harassment -- initially made in confidence to the Senate 
Judiciary Committee -- were leaked by liberal staff members hoping to derail 
his appointment. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservatives do not deny that there is an element of sweet political revenge 
in some of their attacks. "Hey, it's pay-back time!" an aide to one GOP House 
member said. But they maintain that it is the liberal lawmakers and 
left-of-center women's groups that are, in Dornan's words, "guilty of the real 
hypocrisy" for taking Jones' credibility less seriously than Hill's. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anita Hill's allegations were entry-level compared to what Jones" has accused 
Clinton of doing, Dornan said. Yet the muted reaction of women's groups shows 
"they are tortured over something and not telling the truth," he declared. 
</P>
<P>
 That truth, according to Dornan, "is that Bill Clinton is the most 
pro-abortion President in 200 years and they (women's groups) find themselves 
caught between a pro-abortion rock and the worst type of sexual harassment in 
the nation." 
</P>
<P>
 Women's groups did not deny that the liberal bent of most feminists makes them 
less inclined to rush to Jones' defense when Democrats like Metzenbaum -- who 
was a strong supporter of Hill's -- question her credibility and motives. But 
they insisted that there are major differences between the two cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hill's complaints against Thomas were leaked because the Senate Judiciary 
Committee wouldn't consider them, and that led to the impression that they were 
trying to sweep things under the rug," noted Patricia Ireland, president of the 
National Organization for Women. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jones' allegations are receiving a public airing and her complaint has 
been filed in a federal district court, where they will be dealt with through 
the judicial process, Ireland said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that Jones' sister has publicly suggested that money may be a motive 
in the suit, which seeks $750,000 in damages, has undermined her credibility, 
Metzenbaum contended. 
</P>
<P>
 "With Hill, there was never any suggestion of money, and so it is really a 
disgrace to compare the two cases because they are about as different as the 
North and the South Pole," he said.

SENATE OPPOSES 'RACIAL JUSTICE' MEASURE; EXECUTIONS: THE NON-BINDING VOTE SAYS 
THE CHAMBER IS AGAINST LETTING DEATH ROW INMATES CHALLENGE THEIR SENTENCES ON 
THE BASIS OF RACE BIAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. EATON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Senate on Wednesday expressed its opposition to a controversial provision 
contained in a House-approved crime bill that would allow persons convicted of 
capital crimes to challenge the death penalty on the basis of racial bias. 
</P>
<P>
 By a vote of 58 to 41, the Senate passed a non-binding resolution opposing the 
"racial justice act" that the House narrowly approved as part of its 
comprehensive crime legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 California's Democratic senators split on the issue. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, 
who faces reelection this year, voted for it. Sen. Barbara Boxer voted against 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome in the Senate -- virtually identical to a vote on a similar bill 
in 1991 -- makes it less likely that the House provision will survive in the 
final version of the crime bill to be worked out by a Senate-House conference 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), the Senate Judiciary Committee 
chairman who will lead the Senate delegation in the conference, said before the 
vote that he hoped to preserve a modified version of the provision. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies have shown that blacks and other minorities are more likely to receive 
the death penalty than whites and the death penalty is imposed much more often 
when the victim is white. The racial justice act would have overturned a death 
penalty if the defendant could prove by statistical evidence that racial bias 
was a factor in imposing the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unusual show of support for the House provision, several members of the 
Congressional Black Caucus took to the Senate floor during the vote in an 
effort to persuade senators to vote against the resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has not taken a position on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The provision was retained in the House crime bill by a narrow, 217 to 212, 
vote after intense lobbying by Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) and his 
lieutenants. Its leading sponsors were Rep. Don Edwards (D-San Jose) and Rep. 
John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.), dean of the Black Caucus. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents, bolstered by strong statements against the provision by prosecutors 
and state attorneys general, called it a sneak attack on the death penalty that 
would halt executions. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates, however, said it was an effort to stop the persistent racial bias 
that has been documented in some parts of the South and West, where the death 
penalty is sought disproportionately in cases involving black or Latino 
defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), ranking GOP member of the Judiciary Committee, 
has indicated that Republicans may filibuster final passage of the crime bill 
if it contains any version of the provision, which he derided as a "Death 
Penalty Abolition Act." 
</P>
<P>
 "It would convert every death penalty case into a massive sideshow of 
statistical squabbles and quota quarrels," Hatch declared. 
</P>
<P>
 Biden, however, said the provision would allow capital punishment to continue 
and would apply only to cases in which the defendant could prove that he or she 
was discriminated against on the basis of race. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) declared: "The simple fact is that a black 
defendant is more likely to be given a death sentence than a white defendant 
and criminals who kill white persons are more likely to receive the death 
penalty than those who kill blacks." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun (D-Ill.), the only black senator, put it more 
strongly: "The administration of the death penalty is truly one of the last 
vestiges of apartheid left in our system. In far too many jurisdictions, race 
is the primary factor -- perhaps even the sole factor -- in determining whether 
a defendant in a capital case will be put to death."

NEW TENNESSEE LAW ALLOWS MOST ADULTS TO CARRY HANDGUNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new state law allows most law-abiding adults to carry handguns statewide if 
they undergo firearms training and post a $50,000 bond. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Ned McWherter signed the bill Tuesday, saying he received more than 900 
phone calls about the measure, mostly in favor of it. Tennessee sheriffs and 
Nashville's chief of police have decided who may or may not carry handguns in 
their counties. 
</P>
<P>
 The law, effective Oct. 1, makes those permits good for two years and lets 
bearers carry their weapons in any of Tennessee's 95 counties. It instructs 
sheriffs to issue permits to anyone older than 21 who undergoes firearms 
training and posts the bond. Background checks are required of all applicants.

UNZ URGES ABOLISHING WORKERS' COMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California's system for compensating injured workers is so fraud-ridden and 
inefficient that it cannot be reformed and should be abolished, Ron Unz, a 
Republican candidate for governor, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Unz, a wealthy Silicon Valley businessman who is challenging Gov. Pete Wilson 
in the June 7 GOP primary, said workers should buy private insurance if they 
want protection from the financial ruin that can come with being injured on the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 Returning to such a market-oriented system would eliminate the intermediaries 
-- mainly doctors and lawyers -- who absorb much of the $11 billion that 
employers pay in workers' compensation premiums each year, Unz said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said those premiums, although paid by employers, represent a hidden tax 
that reduces wages for workers at an average of hundreds of dollars per year 
for employees covered by the system. 
</P>
<P>
 Unz's proposal is part of his libertarian-leaning economic program, which also 
includes a reduction in the top state income tax rate from 11% to 5%. Unz said 
he would balance the budget by cutting welfare spending. He also asserts that 
lower tax rates would prompt economic growth and boost tax revenues.

EXTRADITION OF CARPENTER ORDERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Costa Rican judge has ordered the extradition of former state Sen. Paul B. 
Carpenter to the United States, where he faces sentencing on political 
corruption charges. 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing the decision Wednesday, U.S. Atty.Charles J. Stevens expressed 
confidence that the onetime Democratic politician would be returned to the 
United States within a few months. 
</P>
<P>
 But Carpenter's American lawyer, Charles F. Bloodgood, said it could be years 
before appeals are exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter is being held in a detention center in the Costa Rican capital of 
San Jose, where he fled after being convicted on 11 counts of mail fraud, money 
laundering and obstruction of justice. Those crimes carry a maximum sentence of 
seven years and three months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Bloodgood, who visited Carpenter last week, described his client as "hopeful" 
and "stoic in his present situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter fled the country early this year, telling the federal judge in his 
case that he was seeking "a more adventuristic" treatment for advanced prostate 
cancer. Carpenter has said he expects to die within two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Bloodgood said Carpenter continues to take standard medication for his cancer 
as well as unconventional chemotherapy.

POSSIBLE BAN IGNITES RUSH ON AREA GUN SHOPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNETTE REGALADO and TINA DAUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Throughout Los Angeles, the rush is on as people flock to gun shops for what 
may be their last chance to purchase intimidating-looking weapons with 
high-tech names as well as high-capacity ammunition magazines for semiautomatic 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 After the House of Representatives passed a bill a week ago that would bar the 
manufacture, sale and possession of most semiautomatic weapons and any magazine 
holding more than 10 rounds, aficionados ranging from the serious gun collector 
to the average Joe have been hitting gun shops from the Westside to the High 
Desert. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guns on the lists have doubled (in sales)," said Laura Brunts, manager 
for Santa Fe Gun Galeria in Palmdale, where articles on gun control are copied 
and left on the counter, free for the taking. "We are selling four times as 
many magazines as we did before the ban." 
</P>
<P>
 And prices are climbing. 
</P>
<P>
 At Santa Fe, 30-round AK-47 magazines are going for $35, up from $19.95 just 
last week, and prices on all semiautomatic handguns were raised $50 Wednesday 
morning. There was but one MAK-90 military-style rifle left in the store 
Wednesday, though 10 more will be shipped soon. When they arrive, Brunts said 
the price on them will jump $200, to $750. 
</P>
<P>
 The House version of the weapons ban, approved last week, is similar to one 
passed by the Senate in November. A conference committee must work out any 
differences between the two before the ban law is sent to President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 The ban outlaws 19 types of semiautomatic weapons, but in California most guns 
on the list already were illegal under a five-year-old state ban, except for 
the Intertech-9, MAK-90 and Colt Sporter -- the civilian version of the M-16 -- 
and their copies. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Lesmeister, director of the National Assn. of Federally Licensed Firearm 
Dealers -- which represents 30,000 gun store owners nationwide -- said sales on 
the West Coast have doubled, while Midwest gun shop owners are seeing their 
sales triple. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the guns on the list were already in short demand," Lesmeister said. 
"I think as the shortage gets worse, the demand gets great, as it gets closer 
to becoming law." 
</P>
<P>
 During lunch hour Wednesday, business was booming at Gun Heaven off Fairfax 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 David M. Bell, a investment manager for a firm in Downtown Los Angeles, 
stopped in to purchase a semiautomatic pistol, a Colt Sporter rifle and a 
semiautomatic shotgun -- all slated for banning under the federal law because 
of their large magazine capacities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a hothead," said Bell, who shelled out about $7,000 for the guns. 
"I'm not a white supremacist. I don't think we need to hoard guns for the 
oncoming apocalypse. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if my life is going to be challenged, I want to be able to defend myself. 
The criminals are still going to have guns." 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the increasing prices, B & B Sales in North Hollywood, one of the 
largest gun outlets in the Los Angeles area, also was bustling. There, armed 
customers are asked to turn in their personal weapons before shopping and 
salespeople pack guns in hip holsters. On Wednesday, one salesman was 
highlighting in red the price tags of the guns that may soon be banned. 
</P>
<P>
 Gun merchants there, as elsewhere, defended their recent price hikes, saying 
it is simply a matter of supply and demand leading to higher wholesale prices, 
which in turn get passed on to the retail customer. Barry Kahn, owner of B & B 
Sales, said manufacturers had even raised the price of guns he had already 
ordered before the ban passed. 
</P>
<P>
 And rising price tags certainly did not stop Chris Encinas from purchasing his 
first gun at B & B Wednesday. In fact, it put pressure on him to buy before 
prices skyrocketed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to rush it," said the 25-year-old Van Nuys man as he stood at the 
glass counter, where 20 semiautomatic handguns were displayed. "If we didn't 
have the ban I wouldn't have to, but it's better that I buy it today." 
</P>
<P>
 As the salesman placed the gun on the glass counter and Encinas ran his 
fingers over his $510 choice -- a Glock 40-caliber semiautomatic handgun with a 
15-round magazine -- he said, "I can't wait to get it home." 
</P>
<P>
 The gun itself would remain legal under the ban, but the high-capacity 
magazine would not. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner's in Reseda is among the stores that has not yet raised its prices, 
according to store manager Terry Barnes. Nonetheless, he said he has been 
offered as much as three times the retail price of some models that he does not 
even stock. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are willing to pay whatever," Barnes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many gun shop owners contacted blamed the press for the ban, and refused to 
talk to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The media fuels everything," said Lee Montoya, special project director for 
Turner's Outdoorsman, a chain of hunting and fishing stores in Southern 
California, one of which is in Reseda. "For people who were on the fence about 
buying a gun, this probably decided it for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Anger over the ban also was expressed by many customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sucks," said Jerry McCain, a Mojave resident who said that he wished he 
had the money to buy a semiautomatic gun before they become illegal. "This 
whole notion of banning them to keep them away from outlaws, it ain't going to 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence of the gun-buying frenzy has yet to reach the state level, said Mike 
Broderick of the State Department of Justice. The last available gun 
registration figures were from April, he said, and would not reflect the recent 
buying binge. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won't know anything for a number of days," said Broderick, whose office 
normally processes 60,000, 15-day waiting period applications daily. 
</P>
<P>
 But in many gun shops, empty display cases make it evident that the rush is 
on. Shop owners recalled that a similar increase in business occurred last year 
when Congress passed the Brady law, which required a 15-day waiting period for 
handgun buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 A second burst of sales occurred when Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) 
introduced the ban on assault-style weapons late last year, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 At American Arms International in Glendale salesman Nick Sepian said he sold 
10 guns daily before the ban, and now sells 25 on most days. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody knows exactly what is going to be banned," Sepian said. "But we are 
selling anything that has high capacity and looks intimidating." 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Julio Moran and special correspondent Sharon Moeser also 
contributed to this story.

9,100 VALLEY CLASSROOM SPOTS GO UP FOR GRABS; EDUCATION: L. A. SCHOOLS CAMPAIGN 
FOR STUDENTS TO TRANSFER UNDER STATE-MANDATED OPEN ENROLLMENT PLAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 22,000 classroom seats in the Los Angeles Unified School District, 
including more than 9,100 in the San Fernando Valley, go up for grabs next week 
when state-ordered open enrollment takes effect, unleashing a new era in which 
schools enter the world of marketing in a frenzy to recruit students. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers at Grant High School in Van Nuys took out a $400 newspaper ad listing 
the school's attributes compared to private schools: "Why pay $12,000 when you 
can get the same plus more for FREE?" 
</P>
<P>
 At least 20 Los Angeles schools have produced 30-second commercials to be 
aired on the district's public television station, complete with snappy slogans 
touting everything from high-tech computer labs to crime-free campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a safe, air-conditioned, closed campus that has won five school 
beautiful awards," boasts the Westside's Braddock Drive School in its TV spot. 
Other schools, such as Lincoln High north of Downtown, have launched a 
multi-pronged campaign with newsletters, a TV spot and weekly visitor tours. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the new age of advertising and marketing -- some people think that 
those are dirty words, but we are going to market our little school," said 
Howard Lappin, principal of Foshay Middle School in South-Central Los Angeles, 
which wants 150 more students so it can launch a major reform program. "It's 
time that schools realize we are living in the real world and we better start 
doing this." 
</P>
<P>
 The activity results from a state law that lets parents enroll their children 
in any school in the same district that has available space. In Los Angeles, 
the hotbeds of school shopping are in the West Valley and the Westside, where 
declining enrollment and flight to private schools have left empty seats. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to compete," said Santa Campuzano, principal of Braddock Drive, 
whose TV pitch opens to a crowd of youngsters proudly holding the school's 
trophies and plaques. "I know we have children who live in this area and attend 
other schools. We are trying to show parents that we have a great reputation 
and their children can do very well at this school." 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere is the state's new choice law, which was approved over the summer, 
expected to have more of an impact than in Los Angeles. And nowhere, experts 
said, will the advantages and disparities of the choice movement be more 
clearly visible and closely watched. 
</P>
<P>
 While the law and the school board's policy give parents the opportunity to 
send their children to virtually any school that has space, it does not offer 
transportation, which some say limits opportunities for poor parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given the fact that there is physical room to move around in the district, L. 
A. may in fact become the laboratory for what is going to happen" in the school 
choice movement, said Julia Koppich, deputy director of Policy Analysis for 
Education, a research center at UC Berkeley. "Will parents actually select 
different schools? Do schools try to cream certain types of students or do they 
try to develop programs that are available to a wide variety of kids?" 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles school officials said it is difficult to predict whether there 
will be wholesale shifts of students until the application process closes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no idea what this is going to be like, no idea," said Joyce Peyton, 
director of the district office that tracks available campus space. "It's new. 
We have no history." 
</P>
<P>
 More than half of the district's schools -- 382 -- have open enrollment space, 
with middle and high schools showing the largest blocks, some ranging into the 
hundreds. Elementary schools run the gamut of space availability with anywhere 
from two to more than 100 seats. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of the Valley space is in West Valley schools, which are not 
crowded and lost enrollment because of the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the schools reporting no space are in the Eastside, South-Central Los 
Angeles and the East Valley, areas where the immigrant population exploded 
during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Many schools that are perceived to be highly desirable by parents and that 
annually draw many transfer requests -- among them Carpenter Avenue School in 
Studio City and Warner School in Westwood -- report that they are filled to 
capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, schools involved in major reform efforts, such as the district's LEARN 
plan or the state's charter school program, also tended to have little or no 
space, possibly an indication that parents are eager to send their children to 
cutting-edge schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1980s saw a phenomenal spurt in school enrollment. During that time, 
schools across the district were forced to hastily expand by installing 
bungalows and turning to year-round schedules. But the growth trend suddenly 
stopped two years ago for a variety of reasons, including population declines 
due to the poor local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials left it up to principals to determine the number of open 
enrollment seats. Estimates were largely based on empty space on the campus and 
projected enrollment from the neighborhood. Students from the neighborhood are 
guaranteed a seat even at full schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Some principals underestimated their space. Principal Clark Marrow at Grand 
View Boulevard School on the Westside said he declared six open enrollment 
seats, instead of the 12 spaces he might be able to actually absorb, to leave 
room for recruitment into the school's bilingual education classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to bolster the bilingual program," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the other end of the spectrum, Michael Bennett, principal at Parkman Middle 
School in Woodland Hills, said he liberally estimated 300 open seats to attract 
as many students as possible. "I just want to get the most kids I can," he 
said. "I wanted people to know there is room here." 
</P>
<P>
 Early indications are that parents are spending time checking out schools and 
investigating possibilities close to home or work, pleased to be free of 
district regulations that once bound them to only send children their 
neighborhood school. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Lightfoot of Canoga Park said he has visited elementary schools in 
Woodland Hills near his wife's work. When out touring, Lightfoot said, his 
first impressions last the longest. 
</P>
<P>
 "One school wasn't well-kept, there didn't seem to be anyone to answer our 
questions, we were looking all over the place for the office and no one noticed 
us," he said, adding that this would not be his school of choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Valley principals said they have received calls from parents whose 
children attend private schools and who now want them to return to public 
campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the economy is poor, a lot of people just can't afford private schools," 
said Catherine Lum, principal at North Hollywood High. "This seems like a 
chance . . . to put students back in public schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Miller, assistant principal at El Camino Real High in Woodland Hills, 
said the school has received about 50 to 60 calls from interested parents and 
students. "In general, we have a real good reputation for being an overall good 
school," she said. "Our attendance is very good, we have a low dropout rate and 
we have a lot to offer." 
</P>
<P>
 Open enrollment is expected to have a profound impact on sports teams 
throughout the district as high school athletes shop for the best team, instead 
of the best classrooms, said Barbara Fiege, the district's director of 
interscholastic athletics. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the California Interscholastic Federation changed its eligibility 
rules to accommodate the open enrollment law. Under the new guidelines, varsity 
athletes can make a onetime move to a high school outside their home area 
without losing eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the old rules, they would have had to sit out a year if they 
transferred. Coaches are still prohibited from recruiting athletes.

INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE: PIONEERING THE BIOMEDICAL FUTURE AT NIH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SCHRAGE, Michael Schrage is a writer, consultant and research 
associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He writes this column 
independently for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The most ambitious experiment at the National Institutes of Health today is 
being run out of the director's office. Nobel laureate Harold E. Varmus can 
check up on it every time he looks in a mirror. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because Varmus -- who had never run anything larger than a gang of 
bright post-docs at his UC San Francisco lab -- has spent the last six months 
trying to figure out how to manage the largest and most important biomedical 
research institution in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turns out, winning a Nobel Prize is easier than winning over America's 
multibillion-dollar health sciences bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm always fighting the Defense Department mentality that if I say something, 
it's supposed to happen," says Varmus, who accepted the directorship on the 
non-negotiable condition that he could continue his San Francisco research in 
Bethesda. "I'm used to being surrounded by really smart 22-year-old students 
who have no problem saying that something I suggested is not a very good idea. 
Now I have 50-year-old section chiefs saying OK to things I say. I'm used to 
being contradicted by people who know that half the things I say, I'm just 
trying to be provocative. I have to constantly remember that whatever I say 
here is taken seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 A brilliant experimentalist but no natural technocrat, Varmus is swiftly 
mapping the administrative genome of his $11-billion-a-year complex of 24 
institutes and centers that, in effect, set America's health sciences agenda. 
How he wants to re-engineer the NIH's organizational DNA is still uncertain. 
But he brings the insights of a scientist to the task, not the sensibilities of 
an institution builder. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, I never even had the urge to build a department," says the lanky 
molecular biologist, who is far more comfortable discussing the public effect 
of NIH science than the Byzantine politics of NIH budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 The $11-billion question, however, is whether Harold Varmus will have made a 
greater contribution to science and public health with his Nobel-quality 
research or with his leadership of the NIH. 
</P>
<P>
 From AIDS to breast cancer to gene therapy to Alzheimer's, it is still the 
NIH, rather than the giant pharmaceutical companies or the aspiring biotech 
start-ups, that funds the majority of basic research into the nature of 
disease. This research -- paid for by tax dollars and conducted by hospitals 
and universities across the country -- frequently serves as the essential 
source for commercial drug designs. 
</P>
<P>
 It is almost impossible to overstate the NIH's influence on medical 
innovation. America's leadership in biotechnology -- and Varmus' own 1989 Nobel 
Prize as co-discoverer of cancer-causing oncogenes -- can be traced directly to 
the NIH's lavish support of investigator-driven research during the 1960s, '70s 
and early '80s. Our Genentechs, Chirons and Biogens are all commercial 
offspring of NIH research, Varmus stresses. NIH research is a medical bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I keep encouraging the pharmaceutical companies to put more money into R&D," 
says an exasperated Varmus. 
</P>
<P>
 What do they say? 
</P>
<P>
 Varmus grimaces: "They say, 'We pay taxes.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike the CEOs and research vice presidents he implicitly chastises, 
Varmus has never had to "bet the company" on a breakthrough or try to transform 
an institution under extraordinary pressure. He now has his chance. 
</P>
<P>
 The NIH has been under intense budget pressure and public scrutiny. 
Congressional critics want reforms; every creative-life scientist has a pet 
hypothesis to test; every constituency has a disease it is desperate to cure. 
Varmus desperately wants more money for the institutes, but he's not going to 
get it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our biggest single theme is trying to make the NIH work better with the same 
amount of money," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the astonishing rise of biotechnology and America's balance of trade 
leadership in global medical markets, you might think Varmus would try to 
position the NIH under the banner of industrial competitiveness as a way to 
attract additional funding. Yet "that has not been the forward argument," he 
acknowledges. 
</P>
<P>
 Expect that to change. In fact, expect circumstances to make Varmus far more 
aggressive in encouraging new kinds of research relationships between the NIH, 
academe and industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not interested in giving grants to Merck," Varmus says now. "We're 
interested in giving grants to smaller business." 
</P>
<P>
 But don't be surprised if the Mercks and DuPonts are brought into research 
consortia as Varmus' budget constraints drive him to create coalitions that can 
attract commercial grants as well as fiscal support on Capitol Hill. As Varmus 
notes, only five years ago most of his graduate students went on to jobs in 
academe. Today, "over half of them are taking jobs in industry." 
</P>
<P>
 You can also expect Varmus -- a scientist of global prominence -- to become 
more vocal about encouraging foreign financial support for the institutes. No 
country on Earth has a biomedical establishment even a fraction the size of the 
NIH; the entire world relies on the fruits of its funding. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no question that the European Union and the growing economies of Asia 
need to be persuaded to be more active collaborators in the global battle 
against disease. Varmus will spend more time overseas than his predecessors if 
he hopes to snag an extra $300 million or $400 million in research funding. 
</P>
<P>
 But for now, Varmus the scientist is focusing on how science is done at the 
NIH. He's revamping the institutes' internal research programs -- which take up 
about 11% of the NIH's budget. He's also pushing a re-evaluation of peer 
review, the mechanism for determining the grant-worthiness of research funding 
requests.

JAPANESE SAY SAYONARA TO CALIFORNIA; DROP IN TOURISM BLAMED ON DISASTERS, CRIME 
AND FINANCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The number of Japanese tourists coming to California is expected to drop 
sharply this year to a level that is only about half of what it was five years 
ago, state tourism officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The steep decline -- which began in 1990 -- has coincided with the state's 
increasing problems, including the spread of violent crime. State officials 
expect the number of Japanese visitors to fall to about 600,000 in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 The shrinking number of Japanese visitors is particularly bad news for the 
state's economy. They are big spenders, averaging $3,000 per trip per person, 
among the highest of any foreign visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan sent more tourists to California last year than any country except 
Mexico. And tourism is one of the few economic sectors in which the United 
States has maintained a favorable balance of trade with Japan. In 1993, 
Japanese tourists spent about $10 billion more here than U.S. tourists spent in 
Japan. California counts tourism as its third-largest export. 
</P>
<P>
 The decline is certainly not all California's fault. Japan is in the midst of 
its worst postwar recession, an economic malaise that has drained many Japanese 
of their wanderlust. Total Japanese visitors to the U.S. in 1993 were down 3% 
from the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 The downward trend in California is so dramatic that officials took action 
last year with a $23-million tourism marketing program in Japan -- a campaign 
highlighted by a visit from Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Japanese tourism is a major contributor to the state's economy," said John 
Poimiroo, director of the California Division of Tourism, a state agency. 
"Attracting 10 Japanese travelers to the state is equivalent to selling one 
U.S.-made car or selling five computers in Japan." 
</P>
<P>
 A survey by Poimiroo's agency of tourist-related businesses throughout the 
state indicates spending by Japanese tourists in the first three months of this 
months is down nearly 25% from the first quarter of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Few in the state are expecting Japanese tourists to reappear in droves anytime 
soon. The images of the Northridge earthquake, the fires in 1993 and the riots 
in 1992 made big impressions on most Japanese, said Shigehisa Sako, Japanese 
vice consul in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a series of unhappy events in the last two or three years . . . 
that are affecting Japanese who want to come to the United States," Sako said. 
"Our position is to encourage people to come to America to promote the 
relationship between the two countries. . . . I hope this is a short-term 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps the most traumatic event of all was the March killings of two 
Japanese students in a San Pedro supermarket parking lot. The killings, which 
occurred during a carjacking, made a huge impact in Japan, where violent crime 
is low and handguns are strictly controlled. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident struck home because so many Japanese families send their children 
to the United States, especially to California, to learn English.  
</P>
<P>
 "The news media in Japan shows (the news of crimes and natural disasters) 
because the parents want to know how dangerous it is," said Masaya Shirao, 27, 
a tourist visiting San Diego on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her fears, Shirao said she came to California anyway. "There are many 
places to visit and people are friendly, cheerful and generous," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Collins, senior vice president of the Los Angeles Convention and 
Visitors Bureau, noted that "there are images that have been punishing . . . 
but they are not uniquely Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, California's share in the Japanese tourism market has slid from 
37% of all visitors to the United States in 1987 to 27% in 1993, said Addison 
Schonland, a manager with CIC Research, a San Diego company that tracks tourism 
trends for the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a huge drop," Schonland said. Staying Away 
</P>
<P>
 The number of Japanese tourists visiting California has declined during the 
past five years and is expected to continue to fall in 1994. Tourism officials 
blame state's crime and natural disasters, as well as Japan's recession. 
</P>
<P>

5% STAKE IN IRVINE CO. IS UP FOR SALE; INVESTMENT: MINORITY OWNER'S OFFER -- 
DISCOUNTED AT $500,000 A SHARE -- IS LIKELY TO LURE PENSION FUNDS AND THE 
WEALTHY. 
</P>

<P>
 A minority owner in Irvine Co. has put his shares in the well-known Orange 
County real estate firm up for sale for $94 million as part of a private 
offering that is attracting interest among wealthy investors and major pension 
and trust funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard P. Marguleas, an Irvine Co. director since 1977, wants to sell his 
5.05% stake in the privately held company to meet his other "business 
obligations," according to a confidential stock prospectus distributed to 
select investors and funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Co., which turned a family ranching empire into a sprawling real estate 
giant, is run with an iron hand by billionaire owner Donald L. Bren, who still 
holds 92% of the company's outstanding shares. This means he elects all board 
members and controls all aspects of the company's operations and future plans. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is known for keeping its finances secret. But the prospectus 
reveals that its assets are currently worth about $4.1 billion and that it has 
an estimated $1.8 billion in debt. Irvine Co. officials did not review, 
prepare, provide information or confirm the accuracy of the prospectus and its 
numbers.  
</P>
<P>
 At $500,000 a share for Marguleas' stake, ownership of the stock could become 
the ultimate status symbol for affluent Southern California investors. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is as blue chip as you're going to get in the Southern California real 
estate market," said Winston Elton, principal in charge of the real estate 
group with KPMG Peat Marwick, an accounting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not the sort of stock that's going to double or triple (in value) in 
a year," he said. "This is an investment for the long haul -- a piece of the 
rock." 
</P>
<P>
 And it comes at a discount, according to the prospectus. Marguleas, the former 
chairman of Sun World International, is offering to sell the stock at 19% below 
its estimated value of $617,984 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 But investors would have no voting rights, could not sit in on board meetings 
and, in the short term, would not receive much of a return on their initial 
investment because the company pays only a 0.6% dividend. Even so, that 
dividend comes to $3,000 a share annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Many wealthy Southern California families and high-profile individuals are 
reportedly interested in the shares as a secure, long-term investment that 
could pay off big-time as development continues, or if Irvine Co. eventually 
goes public. 
</P>
<P>
 Major county or state pension funds, such as the California Public Employee's 
Retirement System, would also be likely investors, especially if they join 
together to buy shares, several sources said. Irvine Co. has a total of 3,722 
shares of common stock outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has been the owner and developer of Irvine Ranch, a vast swath of 
land that stretches from the ocean to the Santa Ana Mountains. The company's 
holdings include two hotels, two golf courses, several shopping centers and 
about 11 million square feet of office and industrial space. 
</P>
<P>
 Bren acquired a 35% interest in Irvine Ranch as part of a group that purchased 
it for $337 million from the Irvine family after a wild bidding war in 1977.  
</P>
<P>
 Bren acquired his controlling interest in 1983. Marguleas, as a minority 
shareholder, joined with Bren and other investors in 1977 to purchase the 
company, and he remained a minority shareholder when Bren purchased his 
controlling interest.  
</P>
<P>
 The company's net worth is now estimated at $2.3 billion, up sharply from a 
decade ago. In the late 1980s, after years of litigation by heiress Joan Irvine 
Smith, a judge ruled that as of 1983, the company's stock value was $1.3 
billion.  
</P>
<P>
 Bren did not step forward to buy Marguleas' stake or put together an investor 
group to buy the shares. He has been in a selling, not buying, mode, real 
estate experts said, citing his sale of the company's apartment division to the 
public for nearly $200 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Marguleas is selling his securities through Friend/Danzi Capital Partners, an 
investment banking firm in Irvine. Michael Danzi, the firm's executive 
director, refused to comment.

STUDY FINDS PROGRESS, PROMISE IN FUEL CELLS; TRANSPORTATION: THE TECHNOLOGY 
COULD CREATE 70,000 SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA JOBS AND BE USED TO MAKE POLLUTION-FREE 
CARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 As hearings open today on whether auto makers can put battery-powered vehicles 
on California highways by 1998, a new study sponsored by Los Angeles transit 
officials finds surprising progress -- and the promise of 70,000 new Southern 
California jobs -- in fuel cells, the technology that many expect is next down 
the road. 
</P>
<P>
 The fuel cell is a still-evolving technology that converts hydrogen and oxygen 
into electricity without pollution-forming combustion. And while progress has 
been slower than many hoped in improving electric batteries for cars, the new 
study -- sponsored by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority -- finds rapid progress in fuel cells. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're bullish," Rich Davis, MTA director of equipment engineering and 
advanced technology, said at a technical briefing Wednesday. "There's no 
question that the fuel cell will come." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, many researchers see a hybrid of the two technologies as the best 
zero-emission vehicle over the long term, though this week's California Air 
Resources Board hearings in Los Angeles will focus largely on batteries. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuel cells are still too expensive and heavy for widespread commercial 
application. In theory, they can provide more range than batteries, while 
batteries offer better acceleration than fuel cells alone and can store energy 
recaptured as vehicles brake. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, what was once a technology described as a decade or more away now seems 
much closer. Mercedes-Benz has already equipped a vehicle to run on fuel cells. 
Ballard Power Systems of Vancouver, British Columbia, has one operating 
fuel-cell bus and expects to build 20 more in the next four years. The U.S. 
Energy and Transportation departments are building three buses, and two 
European bus projects are under way as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, fuel cells are also in use as power plants, producing supplementary 
electricity at more than a dozen sites in Southern California, ranging from 
fast-food outlets to hospitals. Last month, ground was broken in Santa Clara 
for a utility-scale fuel-cell power plant. 
</P>
<P>
 All this could mean a significant infusion of jobs for the region, according 
to the new report by the Economic Roundtable, a nonprofit economic research 
group in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The study finds that many of the major industries most likely to build 
fuel-cell parts already have a foothold in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 Of 18 industries needed to make fuel cells, seven are better represented in 
Southern California than elsewhere in the country, according to the study. Of 
those, five that would create 52% of all the new jobs -- manufacturers of 
chemicals, plastics, electronic components, electrical equipment and industrial 
equipment -- are more competitive than their rivals in other states in terms of 
labor and productivity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our assumption is that these five key industries would likely be key players 
in a nascent fuel-cell industry," said David L. Rigby of UCLA's Lewis Center 
for Regional Policy Studies, which conducted technical and financial analysis 
for the study along with UC Davis' Institute of Transportation Studies and the 
Union of Concerned Scientists. 
</P>
<P>
 Rigby acknowledged, however, that "the most difficult thing in a forecast like 
this is to work out the level of demand" for new technologies. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Project California, the blue-ribbon committee charged with 
developing advanced transportation and communications industries in the state, 
the world market for fuel cells could grow to $9 billion in transportation by 
the year 2007. Los Angeles itself offers an enormous market for what experts 
say will be the fuel cell's first likely transportation use: buses. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Economic Roundtable study warns that Southern California 
manufacturers must get into the game fast, because potential rivals outside the 
state are already concentrating on the technology, particularly in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first-mover advantages are absolutely critical," Rigby said. Fueling Job 
Gains? 
</P>
<P>
 Fuel cells turn hydrogen into electricity -- without combustion and the 
resulting pollution. The nonprofit Economic Roundtable predicts that as many as 
70,000 jobs could be created in the Los Angeles area if a fuel-cell-powered 
transportation industry can be developed. Its report recommends that officials 
take several steps to encourage such an industry, including: 
</P>
<P>
 * Formation of a buyers consortium of bus, waste-collection and other 
municipal agencies and private fleets to create a market by buying fuel cells 
that meet common specifications. 
</P>
<P>
 * Preferential consideration for Los Angeles-area firms as fuel-cell component 
suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Assistance for manufacturers seeking financing for product development. 
</P>
<P>
 * Streamlined, one-stop permit processing by the South Coast Air Quality 
Management District and other regulators for fuel-cell component manufacturers.

 Allstate, Nationwide Mutual Accused of Discrimination: A fair housing group 
alleged that the companies discriminated against minorities in the sale of 
homeowners insurance.The National Fair Housing Alliance, which represents 
housing agencies in 35 states, said it filed complaints with the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development alleging that Allstate Corp. and Nationwide 
Mutual Insurance Co. violated the federal Fair Housing Act. The complaints were 
the result of an investigation in Chicago, Atlanta, Milwaukee and Louisville, 
Ky., that showed widespread discrimination, the group said. The companies said 
they have corporate policies that forbid discrimination.

SALES, EMPLOYMENT SOAR AT BLACK-OWNED COMPANIES; MINORITIES: MAGAZINE SAYS 
GROWTH IN 1993 FAR OUTPACED THAT AT MAJORITY-OWNED COUNTERPARTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sales and employment at the nation's biggest black-owned companies surged in 
1993, far outpacing the growth rates of their majority-owned counterparts, 
Black Enterprise magazine reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Its ranking of the top companies shows an annual sales gain of 13.9%, down 
from the 1992 rate of 14.1% but still triple the 4.5% gain achieved by the 
Fortune 500 industrial companies last year. Total revenue exceeded $10 billion 
for the first time in the history of the ranking. Moreover, while the biggest 
mainstream manufacturing and service businesses continued to slash jobs in 
1993, the companies in the Black Enterprise ranking showed a 22% increase in 
employment. 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine attributed the improvements to a fitful but unmistakable economic 
recovery, a spending boom helped by the tonic of lower interest rates, an 
expensive Japanese yen that made U.S. cars more affordable and black-owned car 
dealers more profitable, and the underlying tenacity of black entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite fierce competition and an unforgiving economy, black businesses were 
able to achieve greater productivity from increasingly scarce resources and 
yield a record breakthrough of over $10 billion in revenue," Publisher Earl G. 
Graves said. 
</P>
<P>
 The combined $10.28-billion revenue figure is small in the realm of mainstream 
corporate America -- it's less than the revenue of Merck & Co., the nation's 
biggest drug company and the No. 46 firm on the Fortune 500 list. 
</P>
<P>
 But in contrast to the stagnant growth rate of many Fortune 500 companies, the 
rate of increase among the biggest black-owned companies has been surging. It 
now is more than 50% above its level at the beginning of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 The employment gain also contrasts with staffing cutbacks at majority-owned 
counterparts, and it marks the biggest annual increase in jobs among the 
biggest black-owned companies in six years. 
</P>
<P>
 "While the leading economic indicators were often contradictory and the 
unsettling stench of layoffs filled the air, reports that the nation was 
regaining economic strength had far more credibility in 1993 than they had the 
year before," the magazine said. "That credibility was boosted by the BE 100's 
return to the business of job creation last year." 
</P>
<P>
 New York-based TLC Beatrice International Holdings Inc. remains in first place 
in the magazine's top 100 industrial and service companies, with more than $1.7 
billion in revenue. Johnson Publishing Co. of Chicago remained in second place, 
with revenue of $293.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate ranking of the top 100 automotive dealers, the No. 1 company 
remains Trainer Oldsmobile-Cadillac-Pontiac-GMC Truck Inc. of Warner Robins, 
Ga., with annual sales of $403 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter Federal Savings Bank in New York is the top financial company, with 
assets of $301.7 million. North Carolina Mutual Life, the nation's oldest 
black-owned insurance firm, is the biggest insurer, with 1993 assets of $217.7 
million. Pryor, McClendon, Counts & Co., a Philadelphia investment firm, is the 
top black investment bank, with $1.65 billion under management. 
</P>
<P>
 The list of firms included eighth-ranked Cross Colours, an apparel 
manufacturer based in Commerce. However, the Black Enterprise list -- compiled 
in 1993 -- does not reflect changes at Cross Colours. Threads 4 Life, which 
produced the Cross Colours line of clothing, said it sold its manufacturing 
operations earlier this year to pay debts. 
</P>
<P>
 Black Enterprise reports on the top 100 industrial and service companies, as 
well as the top 100 auto dealerships in its June issue, on newsstands May 19. 
</P>
<P>
 To be eligible, a company must have been fully operational in the prior 
calendar year and at least 51% black-owned. In addition, it must make or own 
the product it sells or provide industrial or consumer services. Top

HOUSE COMMITTEE BALKS AT FUNDING C-17 ACCORD; AEROSPACE: THE BILL ALSO 
AUTHORIZES FOUR PLANES INSTEAD OF SIX, FURTHER CLOUDING MCDONNELL'S TROUBLED 
PROGRAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The proposed deal to settle the C-17 cargo jet dispute between the Pentagon 
and McDonnell Douglas Corp. has been dealt a severe blow by the House Armed 
Services Committee, which declined to fund $348 million to implement the 
agreement in its fiscal 1995 authorization bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The House bill also authorizes production of only four C-17 cargo jets, rather 
than the six called for under the settlement. Without funding for all six 
aircraft, McDonnell could claim the settlement is void and may be forced to lay 
off workers. The C-17 is made in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement was crucial to saving the program from termination, and if 
Congress ultimately blocks the deal, it would clearly heighten the risk of a 
future cancellation and a protracted legal battle between the government and 
St. Louis-based McDonnell.  
</P>
<P>
 The settlement was meant to resolve a number of major problems that have 
dogged the program, including a dispute over who is at fault for the 
$1.6-billion cost overrun on the troubled program. 
</P>
<P>
 But the agreement has been lambasted in Congress as a bailout, because the 
deal includes a $234-million payment to McDonnell for a claim that was 
previously judged without merit by an Air Force contracting officer. 
</P>
<P>
 In an apparent effort to shore up the deal, Defense Secretary William Perry 
sent a letter to House Speaker Thomas Foley (D-Wash.) last week, stressing the 
importance of the settlement and the C-17 to national security. 
</P>
<P>
 "Enactment of this proposal is of great importance to the department, and I 
strongly urge its favorable consideration," Perry wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon is also dispatching John Deutch, undersecretary of defense, to 
testify before House Armed Services Committee Chairman Ronald V. Dellums 
(D-Oakland) next week. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The authorization bill could be amended by the full House or later in a 
House-Senate conference. The Senate Armed Services Committee has yet to take 
action on the settlement issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Bob Dornan (R-Garden Grove), a member of the House Armed Services 
Committee, blamed the Clinton Administration for the rejection, saying it "did 
not sell the C-17." 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan also said Dellums was personally opposed to the request for six 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonnell Douglas spokesman Larry McCracken said he could not comment on the 
potential impact of a congressional rejection of the settlement, but he noted 
that the company is already preparing to spend $50 million to carry out its 
responsibilities under the accord.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the $348 million of funding, the Pentagon needs Congress to 
pass legislation making the settlement legal, because the Pentagon does not 
have authority to cut such an unusual deal. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed legislation, which the House panel declined to pass, calls for 
the secretary of the Air Force to modify McDonnell's contract "as may be 
appropriate without regard to requirements of law."

EMPLOYERS WANT MORE FOR LESS FROM THE CLASS OF '94; JOBS: COLLEGE PLACEMENT 
OFFICES REPORT THAT PROSPECTS HAVE IMPROVED -- BUT THE RULES HAVE CHANGED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<P>
 There are more jobs for this year's 1.2 million college graduates, but 
salaries for many entry-level positions are lower and companies' expectations 
for their young recruits are significantly higher. 
</P>
<P>
 The rules of the job hunt -- and the jobs themselves -- are also changing. The 
corporate restructurings of the past few years have forced companies to revamp 
their hiring practices, making a graduate's first job harder to get. 
</P>
<P>
 DuPont Co. will take on 250 college graduates this year, half with doctorates. 
Although that's 100 more than last year, it's still significantly below the 
1,000 recruits DuPont hired in previous years. 
</P>
<P>
 Citibank will hire 25% more college graduates than last year. The bank will 
also hire more people with bachelor's degrees than in previous years, but it 
has cut the number of business school graduates it takes on. 
</P>
<P>
 College placement offices see the improvement in the market. At Smith College 
in Northampton, Mass., many more companies are recruiting on campus than last 
year, said Barbara Reinhold, director of the Career Development Office. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, hiring of recent college graduates is up 8.8% over last year, 
although companies are taking on only about half the number of workers they 
hired in 1989, said Maury Hanigan, president of Hanigan Consulting Group. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the increase, recruiters are much more selective. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to hire from among the top 10% in a graduating class; now we look 
only at the top 1%," said Lew Shumaker, DuPont's manager of college relations 
and recruitment. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanigan, whose firm advises companies on strategic staffing, said corporate 
reorganizations have made employers more choosy. 
</P>
<P>
 "With corporate cost cutting a focus, it's too expensive for a company to hire 
and train an individual, then have them leave," Hanigan said. "Companies are 
looking much more closely at who they hire." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the biggest selling points for a new graduate is previous job 
experience, recruiters said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's worthwhile for a college graduate to show not just achievement at 
school, but actual work experience," said James E. Challenger of Challenger, 
Gray & Christmas Inc., an international outplacement company. "Companies want a 
track record." 
</P>
<P>
 Corporate training programs have been casualties of cost cutting at many 
companies, Challenger said. "This year's college graduates face a market that 
is much more interested in people they can put to work right away," he said. 
Companies are putting new recruits in entry-level jobs and asking them to learn 
about the product from the bottom up, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps reflecting that trend, salaries for some entry-level jobs have 
declined since last year, Challenger said. 
</P>
<P>
 The College Placement Council in Bethlehem, Pa., said business graduates this 
year saw a 3% drop in average starting salaries, to $23,820. 
</P>
<P>
 Another trend spotted by management consultants is toward hiring for the short 
term rather than permanently. 
</P>
<P>
 "As companies go through recessions and downsizing, they don't want any more 
fixed costs than necessary," said David A. Hofrichter, managing director of the 
Hay Group of management consultants.

 Eye Wear Firm Is Takeover Target: Benson Eyecare Corp. of New York said it 
offered $21 a share for Optical Radiation Corp. of Azusa, which makes 
prescription eye wear and lenses used in surgical implants. The offer consists 
of $17 in cash and $4 in Benson stock.Benson, an eye wear retailer rebuffed by 
Optical last summer, acquired 8% of Optical's stock earlier this year. That 
prompted Optical to hire investment bank Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities 
to explore a sale or restructuring. Optical Chairman Richard Wood said he has 
asked possible buyers to submit "expressions of interest" by Monday and that 
Benson's offer would be evaluated along with any others. Optical's stock rose 
75 cents to $21 in Nasdaq trading. Benson's shares closed unchanged at $7.50 on 
the Amex. Optical had sales last year of $158 million.

 Cable Operators Want to Block PacBell Network: The California Cable Television 
Assn. asked the Federal Communications Commission to look into whether the 
telecommunications network's plans to offer competing video service in some 
parts of the state violate FCC rules. The dispute illustrates the struggle 
between the telephone and cable industries to move into each other's markets so 
they can gain control of future information networks. Pacific Bell expects to 
get FCC approval in July to install fiber-optic and coaxial cables, which can 
carry far more information than traditional copper wires.

BOND YIELDS ROCKET AGAIN; STOCKS SLUMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a stunning reversal of Tuesday's rally, bond yields soared Wednesday after 
a disappointing Treasury note auction spread more gloom over Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The renewed selloff in bonds also pulled the Dow Jones industrials down 27.37 
points to 3,629.04, clipped the dollar and drove gold and silver prices higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Dejected traders and money managers were at a loss to explain the markets' 
wild mood swings, except to state what some believe is obvious: "We're in a 
bear market," said Chris Madell, a trader at First Chicago Capital Markets. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rocketed to close 
at 7.59%, up from 7.49% on Tuesday but down from an intra-day high of 7.66%. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond market crumbled at midday, immediately after the Treasury announced 
the results of its quarterly auction of $12 billion in 10-year notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a good reception for three-year notes auctioned Tuesday, far fewer 
buyers than expected bid for the 10-year notes. As a result, the Treasury was 
forced to pay an average yield of 7.36%, higher than expected. 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of demand for the notes was clear from the bid-to-cover ratio, or the 
number of bids received to those accepted. The ratio was 1.88, far below the 
average of 2.4 for auctions in recent years and the weakest since the Aug. 8, 
1990, note sale, which followed Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said investors' unwillingness to buy 10-year, fixed-rate bonds 
reflected concerns about higher inflation in the strengthening economy, and 
uncertainty over the Federal Reserve Board's next interest rate move. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed is expected to raise short-term rates another quarter- to half-point 
next week, but some Wall Streeters fear the Fed is tightening credit too slowly 
to achieve its goal of moderating the economy's growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Also weighing on the minds of potential bond buyers Wednesday was concern over 
today's government report on April wholesale inflation and Friday's report on 
April consumer inflation. Worried that the numbers might show surprising price 
increases, some traders opted not to take a chance on the Treasury's 10-year 
notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Hintze, money manager at Seattle's Olympic Capital Management, said the 
auction was a sign that investors aren't ready to bet on lower rates anytime 
soon, despite the feeling that rates have run up too far, too fast this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The auction is a reflection of what the investing community is willing to 
do," Hintze said. "People looked up and said, 'I don't want to get long' " in 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stock market, meanwhile, investor sentiment was briefly buoyed after 
Germany cut key short-term interest rates half a point. That raised new hopes 
that higher U.S. interest rates paired with lower German rates will result in a 
stronger dollar, which could attract more foreign investors to U.S. stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 But the selloff in bonds quickly slammed stocks lower. The Dow's loss of 27.37 
points was exactly what it gained Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, losers swamped winners by about 7 to 3 on the New York 
Stock Exchange, as volume retreated to 277.4 million shares. Most major market 
indexes lost about 1% for the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say a key test for the market will be whether the Dow can hold at 
about 3,600, which is where it found support in early April and again in 
mid-April. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Wednesday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Utility stocks plummeted for the fourth time in five sessions, pummeled by 
rising interest rates and by fears of widespread dividend cuts as the industry 
prepares for greater competition. The Dow utility index sank 5.21 points, or 
2.8%, to 178.35, its lowest close in more than five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida utility FPL Group, which plunged earlier this week when it cut its 
dividend, fell another 1/2 to 28 5/8. Other losers included Commonwealth 
Edison, down 1 to 22 1/8; Houston Industries, down 1 3/4 to 30; SCEcorp, down 
3/8 to 14 1/4, and Consolidated Edison, off 1 to 27 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tobacco stocks slumped on new worries about the anti-cigarette furor on 
Capitol Hill. Philip Morris dropped 1 3/4 to 47 1/2, American Brands tumbled 1 
3/8 to 30 3/4 and Monk-Austin sank 1 3/4 to 14 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many industrial stocks were lower. Rockwell fell 1 1/4 to 35 3/8, Monsanto 
dropped 1 5/8 to 79 5/8, Inland Steel was off 1 1/8 to 30 5/8 and Ford tumbled 
1 3/8 to 57 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many tech stocks were weak, led by computer disk drive makers, which were 
downgraded by brokerage Robertson Stephens. Among drive makers, Conner 
Peripherals slumped 1 5/8 to 12 1/4 and Western Digital fell 1 1/2 to 13 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Other tech losers included Compaq, down 2 3/8 to 106 3/8; Dell, down 1 5/8 to 
24 3/8; Autodesk, down 1 5/8 to 52 1/8, and Texas Instruments, off 2 1/4 to 72 
3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 In foreign markets, European stocks felt little effect from German interest 
rate cuts. Frankfurt's DAX index rose 8.48 points to 2,243.63 while London's 
FTSE-100 index eased 5.8 points to 3,130.5. 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo rallied, however. The Nikkei index rose 232.35 points to 20,150.13. But 
Mexico City's Bolsa fell 33.52 points to 2,179.57. 
</P>
<P>
 In commodities trading, gold and silver gained as stocks and bonds lost 
ground. On the Comex, near-term gold futures rose $3.00 to $381.80 an ounce. 
Silver jumped 15 cents to $5.43. 
</P>
<P>
 But the dollar closed mostly lower, unfazed by Germany's rate cuts and unable 
to sustain Tuesday's big rally. In New York, the dollar eased to 104.33 yen and 
1.669 marks, from 104.40 yen and 1.674 marks Tuesday.

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M. KRISTOF: INSURANCE COMMISSION REBATES AT ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Just how much is your insurance agent worth to you? That question is at the 
heart of a soon-to-be-decided legal battle between big insurance companies and 
a handful of California insurance agents who want to rebate their commissions 
openly. 
</P>
<P>
 If the issue is ultimately decided in favor of the insurers, rebates could be 
much more difficult to find -- eliminated by law or in practice. If it's 
decided in favor of the agents, California will gain a greater reputation as an 
oasis where Americans can get what amounts to cut-rate insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 For life insurance customers, millions of dollars hang in the balance. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some people have quietly been getting rebates from their agents, many 
do not realize this is possible. Most of their first-year life insurance 
premium is paid to the agent -- not the company that insures them. Agent 
commissions generally range between 50% and 100% of the first-year premium, 
depending on the company and the type of life coverage purchased. 
</P>
<P>
 Technically, California agents can rebate commissions on any type of 
insurance, including auto and homeowners coverage, but commission rates on 
types other than life are usually less. They range from about 50% on disability 
coverage to as little as 10% on some medical and property policies. With 
narrower margins, fewer health and property insurance agents are willing to 
offer rebates. 
</P>
<P>
 With life insurance, the commissions are fat. Roughly $700 of a $1,000 
first-year premium for a term insurance policy would go to the agent, says Mark 
White, president of Direct Insurance Services in San Diego. On a whole life 
policy, $900 of that $1,000 first-year premium would generally go to the agent, 
he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 (Commission rates vary from company to company, but these are representative 
of first-year commissions on an average policy. Smaller commissions, ranging 
from 1% to 5%, are paid on renewed business as well, but renewal commissions 
are rarely rebated.) 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, many California life insurance agents are willing to rebate as 
much as 75% of their first-year commissions. But finding an agent willing to do 
so is tougher than finding a speak-easy during Prohibition. Commission rebates, 
though legal, are kept secret. You generally have to ask -- or be referred to a 
rebating agent by a savvy insider -- to get one. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Peter Katt, a Michigan-based fee-only insurance salesman, sends 
many of his high-end clients to a cooperative California agent. But he'll give 
you that agent's name and address only when you're ready to fly out to 
California and sign on the dotted line. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, experts estimate that between 15% and 25% of the life insurance 
agents in California offer rebates, but only one -- White -- agreed to be 
identified and quoted in public hearings in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Why all the secrecy?  
</P>
<P>
 Agents who openly rebate commissions suddenly find themselves unable to write 
insurance for many of the biggest companies, such as Prudential, Metropolitan 
Life Insurance and New York Life, regulators say. That's because these and 
other insurers have contractual agreements with the agents that say, 
essentially, that independent insurance agents can write their policies as long 
as they don't get on the companies' nerves. Otherwise, the company can 
terminate the agent. 
</P>
<P>
 The ability to "sever appointments" -- stop the agent from writing insurance 
with your company -- is important for dealing with unscrupulous agents who 
falsify policyholders and claims. But it is also used against law-abiding 
agents who rebate their own commissions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Agents are very concerned about retaliation," says Bill Ahern, deputy 
commissioner for rate regulation with the California Department of Insurance. 
"Based on the Mark White case, they appear to have good cause." White was 
barred from doing business with several big insurers because he openly offers 
rebates. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Why do insurance companies care whether agents rebate? The money, after all, 
comes out of the agent's pocket, not the insurer's. 
</P>
<P>
 The official industry arguments from the American Council of Life Insurance 
boil down to concerns that people will buy the wrong policy just because of a 
rebate, that most rebates will go to people buying big policies, and that there 
is a risk of problems and abuses similar to those that occurred when rebates 
were last common at the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 Many insurers privately acknowledge that these public arguments are bunk. 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, most reputable insurers don't object to the rebates; their agents 
do. After spending three hours in your kitchen hounding you about your life 
insurance needs, the last thing an agent wants to hear is, "Just how much are 
you making on this?" If rebates became commonplace -- and common knowledge -- 
that uncomfortable question will come up more and more often. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, if California agents could advertise the availability of rebates in 
other states, savvy insurance consumers everywhere would be dumping their local 
agents and booking flights to the rebate state. Out-of-state residents can buy 
policies in California -- regardless of their own states' anti-rebating laws -- 
as long as they're in California when they sign the contract. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, agents have kept pressure on companies to pressure agents not to 
rebate. Many companies, which would rather sell insurance than squabble, have 
an unwritten "don't ask, don't tell" policy. Agents can rebate as long as they 
do it quietly enough so competitors don't squawk. 
</P>
<P>
 In the next few months, California Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi will 
decide whether rebating agents should be able to come out of the closet. To do 
that, he'd have to rule that companies cannot sever appointments solely because 
of an agent's rebates. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Garamendi has publicly stated that he favors rebates, supporting 
them would be difficult, given the legal and political firepower insurers have 
marshaled in the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi is encouraging public comment. Consumers may write to Bill Ahern, 
deputy commissioner for rate regulation, California Department of Insurance, 45 
Fremont St., San Francisco, CA 94105.

 After a recent arrival in San Francisco, I discovered I had misplaced my 
return ticket. Having had a similar problem a decade ago, I called the airline 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your seat is confirmed for your return trip to L.A.," the ticket counter 
worker told me. "Just show up a little early with identification, fill out a 
lost-ticket form, and you'll be on your way." 
</P>
<P>
 Just in case, I arrived early and waited while the counter person filled out 
the one-page form.  
</P>
<P>
 "That will be $60 to process this form," she told me. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sixty dollars!?!" I complained. "The (advance) ticket is only $40!" 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sorry, but we have to pay accountants to process these forms," she told 
me. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's totally unreasonable!" I told her. "I'm an accountant, and $60 to 
process a simple form is unconscionable." 
</P>
<P>
 After a longer wait, a supervisor came and explained that "a ticket is just 
like cash."  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a CPA; I know the definition of cash!" I told her. "If my ticket is 
non-refundable, my seat is reserved and the ticket has no liquidity. It's 
nothing like cash!"  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sorry," she told me defiantly. "You'll have to purchase (an unrestricted) 
ticket. . . . That will be $140." 
</P>
<P>
 I wonder how much money airlines make from passengers who misplaced their 
tickets and are at the mercy of the airline runaround.

ON THE MOVE / CAROL SMITH: EXECUTIVE TRAVEL; SAVED BY THE BILL? CELLULAR 
RENTALS PICK UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Business travelers may soon have one less thing to pack: their cellular 
phones. The advent of a new billing system that makes it more cost-effective to 
rent cellular phones is beginning to spur an increase in the rental market by 
making the units cheaper and more convenient. 
</P>
<P>
 Cellular phones have become a staple business tool in the last few years. 
There are now more than 16 million users in the United States, according to 
Mike Houghton, spokesman for the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Assn., a 
Washington-based trade group. In 1993, the industry reached an all-time high of 
$10.9 billion in sales of cellular services, a 39.7% increase over the previous 
year. An estimated 14,000 new customers sign up for cellular services every 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the cellular phone rental market has lagged the owner market and 
currently makes up only a very small percentage of the cellular marketplace, 
said Scott McGregor, president and founder of Telemac Cellular Inc., the 
Danville, Calif.-based company that developed the new billing system. 
</P>
<P>
 Some car rental agencies, such as Hertz Corp., rent cars with cellular phones 
mounted inside. However, the market for portable rented phones, which a 
traveler can put in a briefcase and take anywhere, has been slow to take off. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the phones are mounted in cars or portable, the rental market's 
sluggish growth has been largely the result of limitations in the industry's 
billing system, McGregor said. Until recently, there was no way for a company 
to immediately tell what phone calls a customer had made on a rented phone.  
</P>
<P>
 Rental companies had to charge a flat rate to cover their expenses without 
knowing whether the phone had been used to make local, long-distance or 
international calls. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, companies charged as much as $2 a minute for use of a rental 
phone. They wouldn't know what calls were actually made until a month later, 
when they received their bill from the cellular carrier. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers didn't like the flat rates because they felt they could be picking 
up the tab for other callers who made more expensive calls. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, disputes over rates were so common that rental companies were losing 
as much as 40% of their potential revenue because customers refused to pay 
their bills, McGregor said. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, rental companies didn't like the flat rate system because the 
rates didn't always cover their bills. Consequently, companies went out of 
business rapidly, adding to the impression that rental phones were unreliable, 
McGregor said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Telemac's McGregor, who used to own a cellular phone rental company, 
commissioned his son in 1990, then a senior majoring in computer sciences at 
University of California, Davis, to develop a computer chip that could go into 
each phone and capture all the calling data within the phone itself. 
</P>
<P>
 When the phone is returned to the rental agency, information about where calls 
were made to and for how long is downloaded into the system's main accounting 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 The system prints out an itemized bill on the spot, allowing the rental 
company to charge the customer less per minute and still make a profit, 
McGregor said. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, using itemized billing a customer might pay $1.25 a minute for 
local calls and $1.45 a minute for long-distance calls. Although those charges 
are still higher per minute than what owners pay when they use their own 
phones, renters are not paying the monthly access charge owners pay for 
cellular service.  
</P>
<P>
 Telemac formally launched the product in March. So far, 50 of the systems have 
been shipped to retail outlets that sell phone services, as well as to at least 
one major car rental agency -- Alamo Rent a Car in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla. Telemac 
is currently negotiating with four of the largest rental car agencies about 
installing systems nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, the billing system is used by Bay Area Cellular in Monterey and 
Cellular One in Santa Barbara. Telemac expects to have 55 systems installed in 
more than 15 states by June. 
</P>
<P>
 The change already appears to have had an effect on phone rentals. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely a fast-growing part of the market," Houghton said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although CTIA currently has no statistics on the size of the rented cellular 
phone market, it plans to start tracking it in its next market surveys. 
</P>
<P>
 American Cellular Rentals in Ft. Lauderdale, for example, has seen a 43% 
increase in rentals in the last three months, marketing director Gina Jay said. 
She attributed the increase to the accountability of the new billing system. 
</P>
<P>
 "What this allows us to do is meet the needs of the traveling consumer, 
especially the business traveler who needs substantiation of his bill," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 This way travelers can reconcile their bills to expense statements. 
</P>
<P>
 They know they are paying only for the calls they make, and they know how much 
they are paying for each call, which is especially important if the calls are 
being billed to clients. 
</P>
<P>
 American Cellular Rentals has phones available for rent in hotels, car rental 
agencies, paging offices and at movie production locations throughout Florida, 
she said.

 Cellular phones have become one of the ways rental companies can provide a 
sense of security for business travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Hertz Corp. recently announced free emergency service in its cars 
with in-place cellular phones. 
</P>
<P>
 Following well-publicized violence against renters last year, the industry 
began to take a variety of steps to increase safety. Most have stripped car 
rental fleets of logos, signs and markers.  
</P>
<P>
 Even the bar-coded inventory control tags that used to be on bumpers or in 
rear windows have gone into hiding. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry is looking at ways to use cellular and related technology to add 
safety inside the car. 
</P>
<P>
 Avis Inc. is testing a system on 60 cars in New York using cellular phones 
that link the driver to a service center, which provides help ranging from 
traffic conditions to directions to emergency roadside aid.  
</P>
<P>
 About half those cars have satellite-assisted positioning devices, which allow 
the center and police to locate a car in distress. None of the cars have needed 
those services in a crime situation, Avis said.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; BUNDESBANK LOWERS TWO KEY LENDING RATES HALF A POINT; 
ECONOMY: GERMAN CENTRAL BANK'S MOVE TRIGGERS OTHER CUTS IN EUROPE. ANALYSTS HAD 
EXPECTED A SMALLER REDUCTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Bundesbank cut two key German lending rates by half a percentage point 
Wednesday, setting off a round of interest rate cutting elsewhere in Europe and 
triggering speculation that Germany's all-important strategy of gradual 
monetary easing may soon come to an end. 
</P>
<P>
 Many analysts were surprised by the size of the reductions. Smaller cuts had 
been expected, in line with international central bank efforts to stabilize the 
U.S. dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cut in rates is a help for the U.S. dollar, even without the activities 
of the Federal Reserve," said Norbert Walter, chief economist for Deutsche 
Bank, referring to last week's massive round of central bank intervention to 
support the dollar, led by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the 
Bundesbank. "I am pretty sure that the Americans will follow (with a 
corresponding interest rate increase) on May 17." 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar started at 1.6641 to the mark, rose to 1.6810 during the day and 
closed at 1.6750. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bundesbank cut the German discount rate -- the lowest rate on loans to 
commercial banks -- to 4.5% from 5%, while the Lombard rate, which is the rate 
on emergency loans to banks unable to find money elsewhere, was cut to 6% from 
6.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Gradual reductions in German interest rates are widely seen as essential to 
overall economic recovery in Europe. But after Wednesday's cuts, some 
Bundesbank watchers were saying that Germany's central bankers have taken their 
rate-cutting policy as far as they can, until they have proof that German 
inflation is really under control. 
</P>
<P>
 "Further lowering of the discount rate likely will follow only after solid 
evidence that the Bundesbank's strategy of slowing M3 growth by cutting 
interest rates has worked, and after inflation has declined further," a group 
of economic analysts at Salomon Bros. International Ltd. predicted in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 M3 is a measure of liquidity in a nation's economy and is closely watched by 
German monetary analysts as an early indicator of inflationary pressure. 
Germany's M3 money supply grew substantially faster than expected in the first 
months of this year -- by more than 15% in March, compared to a Bundesbank 
target growth rate of 6%. 
</P>
<P>
 Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer said Wednesday that he hoped the generous 
interest rate reduction would encourage investors to take their money out of 
bank deposits -- a component of M3 -- and put it into long-term paper assets. 
Such assets are not included in the M3 calculation and therefore do not put 
pressure on that particular measurement of the money supply. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today's decision will help make investments in long-term securities more 
attractive," Tietmeyer said, adding that the Bundesbank continues to view money 
supply control as "decisive." 
</P>
<P>
 Tietmeyer said the Bundesbank believes that inflation is indeed under control 
and that the economy in Germany is improving. Inflation in Germany was running 
at 3.1% in April, down from 3.2% in March, and Bundesbank officials have 
predicted it will drop below 3% soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "The outlook for (economic) stability has continued to improve, and the 
deutsche mark is strong," Tietmeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy, Austria, Belgium, Denmark and the Netherlands all reduced key interest 
rates after the Bundesbank's move. The Bank of France reduced rates by cutting 
its key intervention rate, or the floor to French money market rates, to 5.5% 
from 5.6%.

 Members Cool to Development Bank's Fund Drive: Donor nations opened the annual 
meeting of the African Development Bank with demands that fundamental changes 
be made before they contribute more money to the 30-year-old organization. The 
bank, based in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, is asking 76 investor nations and 
organizations to commit themselves to increasing capital by $2.5 billion to 
build a fund of $22.3 billion."We want major commitments before we agree to an 
increase in the share capital," said Jeffrey Shafer, an assistant secretary for 
international affairs at the U.S. Treasury Department. He would not describe 
the reforms being sought, but a report on the bank's operations criticized it 
as too bureaucratic, placing too much emphasis on the size of loans rather than 
quality, and lacking the means to evaluate accurately the risks involved in the 
development projects it finances.

COMPAQ TOP SELLER OF PORTABLE PCS; COMPUTERS: SALES OF $2.04 BILLION AND 13.6% 
WORLD MARKET SHARE PUT HOUSTON-BASED GIANT AHEAD OF PREVIOUS LEADER APPLE.

<P>
 Compaq Computer Corp. overthrew PowerBook maker Apple Computer Inc. as the 
leading seller of portable PCs in 1993, a leading research firm said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Houston-based computer maker's annual sales reached $2.04 billion last 
year, up from $1.19 billion in 1992, Dataquest Inc. said. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm said Compaq owes its rise to a strong marketing effort, focused on 
global distribution and competitive pricing, rather than technological 
innovation. 
</P>
<P>
 Dataquest based its figures on worldwide market share estimates. The figures 
encompass all portable personal computers. The category includes laptops, 
notebooks such as Apple's PowerBook, sub-notebooks, hand-helds and expandable 
organizers, the San Jose-based research firm said. 
</P>
<P>
 Compaq's market share swelled to 13.6% last year from 11% in 1992. Apple sank 
to the No. 3 position, with $1.53 billion in revenue, or 10.2% of world market 
share, from its top rank in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Toshiba Corp. ranks No. 2 behind Compaq, with $1.7 billion in revenue, or 
11.4% of the global market. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last month, Compaq stunned Wall Street with record profit and sales in 
its first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said its goal is to become the world's largest personal computer 
maker in 1996. It currently ranks behind Apple and International Business 
Machines Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 In the field of laptops, or mobile computers, Apple was trailed by Japan's NEC 
Corp. and IBM. 
</P>
<P>
 The top five leading laptop makers together accounted for 53.6% of world 
laptop computer revenue in 1993, a figure reflecting wider consolidation in the 
PC industry, Dataquest said. 
</P>
<P>
 Total worldwide revenue for the mobile computer industry stood at $14.99 
billion, up sharply from $10.86 billion in 1992, it said.

ELECTRIC FORD VAN BRIEFLY CATCHES FIRE AT TESTING SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an incident that became public late Wednesday, a Ford Ecostar electric 
utility van caught fire briefly while being recharged after testing May 2 at 
the Electric Power Research Institute in Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
 The vehicle, based on Ford Motor Co.'s European Escort van, is being tested by 
potential fleet customers around the country.It is powered by sodium-sulfur 
batteries, which must be maintained at 600 degrees Fahrenheit. 
</P>
<P>
 Such batteries have as much as three times the energy-storage capacity of 
conventional electric car batteries, but they have been criticized even by some 
electric car engineers for their potential to cause a fire in an accident. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no injuries in the incident, said Hank Courtright, director of 
EPRI's customer systems division, which is doing research on the practical use 
of the vehicle. Courtright noticed a smell and a small "whiff" of smoke about 
an hour after recharging began. 
</P>
<P>
 "Apparently . . . one of the (battery) cells had cracked," Courtright said 
Wednesday, " . . . and we were told by the manufacturer that a limited lot was 
done using a certain welding technique." 
</P>
<P>
 A Ford statement, issued by EPRI, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ford has determined that these battery cells were built with a different 
production procedure and that no other battery in today's fleet employs cells 
built with the same production process," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Ford, 26 Ecostars have been placed with 11 fleet customers, 
including Southern California Edison Co.

THE NEW NEIGHBORS: CREATING CONNECTIONS OUT OF CHAOS; URBAN PLANNING: A SENSE 
OF COMMUNITY IS BLOSSOMING ALL OVER TOWN AS FORMER STRANGERS DISCOVER THE VALUE 
OF COOPERATION IN PREVAILING OVER RIOTS, FIRES, EARTHQUAKES AND STREET CRIME. 
</P>

<P>
 Attorney Tom Doniger hadn't even started unpacking after moving into his house 
in Windsor Square when a neighbor knocked on the door and gave him a list with 
the name and address of every resident on the block. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lived in lots of other places and I've never known my neighbors before," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently Doniger has come to a new appreciation of the neighborhood where he 
has lived for six years.  
</P>
<P>
 "We look out for each other," he says. "During the riots, we would all meet in 
the street to check on each other. And I was out of town during the Northridge 
earthquake, but my wife grabbed our 2-year-old son, Sam, and ran next door." 
</P>
<P>
 After these disasters, close-knit neighborhoods like Doniger's are on the 
rise, says Bill Christopher, coordinator for the 2 1/2-year-old Plan L.A., an 
umbrella of 17 groups representing 250 neighborhood coalitions. 
</P>
<P>
 "This city has been buffeted by significant events," says Christopher, a 
Beverly Hills architect and urban planner. "In the wake of riots, fires and 
earthquakes, the effort to find a personal sense of community has definitely 
risen." 
</P>
<P>
 "We've always had neighborhood groups," he continues, ticking off examples: 
the Hillside Federation with its concern for fire protection and mountain 
preservation; Westside Federation, opposing the Beverly Hills Freeway; Citizens 
of South Central, defeating the Lancer incinerator. 
</P>
<P>
 But the events of the past two years have kicked such activities into a new 
gear, emphasizing personal connections as well as political action, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The Multi-Cultural Collaborative opened its downtown office in May, 1993. "We 
were one of those groups formed in the aftermath of the civil unrest," says 
co-director Cindy Choi. "And with three co-directors and an administrator, 
we're one of the best-staffed. This is a big effort." 
</P>
<P>
 Working with 12 community-based organizations -- some old and some newly 
formed -- they are working on an ambitious urban agenda that "talks about 
people being first," Choi says. "Whatever happens here must involve community 
input on a substantive level." 
</P>
<P>
 They hope to evaluate how inner-city communities are served by public 
entities, such as City Hall and the police, and to provide alternative models. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they're just getting geared up, she is optimistic: "For a lot of us, 
the riots were a catalyst," she says. "It's amazing how these communities have 
been surviving, though they have virtually been abandoned. I see pockets of 
hope and pockets of extreme resourcefulness." 
</P>
<P>
 "After the riots," says community activist Lois Arkin, "everyone started 
re-evaluating what our priorities are supposed to be in this city." 
</P>
<P>
 In many cases that was on a leadership level, says Christopher. "But it was in 
the wake of the earthquake that people really began to realize their 
interdependence on a grass-roots level." 
</P>
<P>
 The result, he says, is not so much a huge increase in the number of formal 
organizations as a search for more personal connectedness. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Los Angeles Police Department, Mark Kroeker views the same phenomenon 
through a longer lens. As deputy chief in charge of police operations for 
Operation South Bureau, he concentrates on community work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see a tremendous amount of good neighborhood activity today in places where 
it has never happened before," he says. "Neighborhoods are what's happening. 
</P>
<P>
 "You might call it a movement. It's almost like the fitness craze. People are 
discovering the discrete parameters of how neighborhoods are formed and 
discovering how to convert an urban setting into a neighborhood where people 
know each other and take accountability for each other."  
</P>
<P>
 Because each of the LAPD's 18 districts have emphasized community-based 
policing since the riots, the department has an overview of the new activity, 
says Kroeker. He sees an emerging pattern of police-neighborhood teams, each 
with a little element of hometown. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he sees this movement as "fueled by the ongoing fear," Kroeker is not 
willing to lay it all on the riots and earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see a more linear approach -- it started happening way before that -- maybe 
with Proposition 13, then the tremendous patterns of demographic turbulence. I 
think we realize, as we head for the year 2000, that we have to make some 
changes." 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Shaughnessy is a founder of the Neighborhood Councils Movement, which aims 
at bringing decision-making under local control in Los Angeles. An event like 
an earthquake that tumbles neighbors outside in their pajamas can be a 
particularly persuasive catalyst, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But evening strolls, dog-walking and children playing in the streets also 
provide a sort of social control, Shaughnessy says. "Part of what we want to 
know is that most of the people we meet every day are our friends."  
</P>
<P>
 He calls the Los Angeles transformation of recent years a "sea change."  
</P>
<P>
 "There are about 8 million people living in this region who have figured out 
they aren't going to hang out with 8 million people and are beginning to 
suspect the people they should know are the ones who live within walking 
distance," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way to be prepared for the future is to do things in the present 
that increase our connectedness. Maybe it's your block. Or maybe just your 
apartment complex. Many people use the same laundry room and don't know each 
other's first name."  
</P>
<P>
 Connection "is a basic human longing," and that longing is a national 
phenomenon, says Betty Didcoct, director of the Fellowship for Intentional 
Community (FIC), based in Langley, Wash., a national clearinghouse for 
community activities on all levels. "We're having a big surge of correspondence 
and phone calls from people all over the country," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 FIC's first Celebration of Community last summer at Evergreen State College in 
Olympia attracted almost 1,000 participants who came to learn more about 
creating community. 
</P>
<P>
 "We frequently hear from people living in the city who say they are 'looking 
for more connections' in their lives, or who just want to know the people 
living next door," Didcoct says. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a sampling of how Los Angeles neighbors build small communities in the 
big city. Although their experiences are diverse, each had a first step: 
knocking on someone's door: 
</P>
<P>
 * "The tendency in this neighborhood was to come home from work, close the 
door and not even look outside," says Geoffrey Saldiva, founder of the the 
Rampart Rangers/East Hollywood Neighborhood Watch. "I was guilty of that until 
the problem became too bad." 
</P>
<P>
 That was five years ago when he returned from a vacation to find four drug 
dealers working out of his driveway in the neighborhood between Vermont and 
Hoover. 
</P>
<P>
 The police put neighbors in contact with downtown Hollywood groups that had 
developed non-confrontational civilian patrols. The Rampart Rangers learned to 
make their presence felt, starting with citizen patrol groups of 40 or more. 
"The idea was to observe and report crime, not intervene," says Saldiva. 
</P>
<P>
 Says LAPD Officer Webster Wong of the Rampart area: "They've made a 
difference. They've let us become aware of the problems these people are facing 
and helped us to deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
 The group also organized activities for children, planted 60 fruit trees and 
has been able to block some applications for licenses to sell beer and wine in 
the neighborhood. Now they are part of the United Streets of Hollywood and can 
see a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "Walking the streets together you build a sense of camaraderie," says Saldiva. 
"I was surprised to find a lot of people I grew up with still in the 
neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 * "We started out fighting development, project by project. We began to see we 
needed to do something more," says Paul Doebler of the Palms del Rey Planning 
District.  
</P>
<P>
 When Xerox transferred him from New York nine years ago, he and his wife 
bought a house in a pleasant wood-shingled complex. 
</P>
<P>
 But the area, south of Venice, was being steamrolled by developers, including 
three major proposals for malls the size of Westside Pavilion in Doebler's 
neighborhood. "It just got to the breaking point," says Doebler.  
</P>
<P>
 Not only has the group controlled the malls and cleaned up a major crime 
problem, he says, neighbors have developed a sound plan for a livable mix of 
light industry and housing instead of proposed entertainment arcades with pubs 
and theaters.  
</P>
<P>
 "Good lord, we've actually changed the tide," says Doebler. "We've fended off 
all the malls, we talk to the police regularly and we get consulted early in 
the game instead of having to show up or hearings when everything is set. 
</P>
<P>
 "Community is what it's all about," he says. "You know all kinds of people you 
wouldn't know otherwise. It's the difference between civilization and chaos." 
</P>
<P>
 * "We were a neighborhood in which no one knew anyone," says Lois Arkin of the 
two blocks in the mid-Vermont area where her nonprofit Cooperative Resources 
and Services Project (CRSP) is slowly building a community. "We had a mixed-use 
neighborhood with about 500 intergenerational people, some extended families, 
13 ethnic groups and four major languages," she says.  
</P>
<P>
 "What we didn't have was any trust in one another. People had their street 
demeanor on -- that impenetrable wall." 
</P>
<P>
 After the riots, her group -- which has developed food and housing co-ops in 
many areas -- decided to focus on creating a neighborhood that is economically 
and socially healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was basically fear of the street," says Arkin. "Two women who had been 
neighbors for 23 years had never met."  
</P>
<P>
 Small steps such as a neighborhood newsletter and tree-planting have grown to 
three community gardens, a junior recycling co-op and Sunday brunches in the 
middle of the street to slow down traffic on their side street. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our first meeting when we asked what people did and didn't like about the 
neighborhood, we didn't get started -- everybody talked about crime," says 
Arkin. "We could have focused on dealing with crime issues, but decided to 
concentrate on building community and a sense of trust. As people developed 
more street presence, we hoped, crime and the fear of crime would go down." 
</P>
<P>
 Six months later, when they asked the same questions, she says, "Crime was way 
down on the brainstorm list." The LAPD's Mark Kroeker put it another way: 
"There's a factor worse than fear," he said, "and that's loneliness. People are 
realizing they need interconnectedness. They can no longer be urban islands."

THE SPOILS OF ROCK 'N' ROLL; OK, SO CONCERT GARB HAS GONE FROM GRITTY TO 
PRETTY. BUT EARTH TONES? SAY IT ISN'T SO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BOOE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the beginning, it was a humble thing, made of the thinnest cotton and 
printed in somebody's basement from a crude silk screen. 
</P>
<P>
 The front would be emblazoned with a crude approximation of a rock band's 
latest album cover. The back might list an odyssey of tour dates, from Madison 
Square Garden to the Hollywood Bowl. Be it the Eagles, Led Zeppelin, Journey or 
Pink Floyd, if you were going to see a concert, chances were you'd lay down a 
few extra dollars for a souvenir to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
 The underlying ethic was that you are what you listen to. Your shirt was the 
equivalent of a Navy tattoo. (You saw the Dead at Rupp Arena? Hey, I was 
there.) To be truly cool, it had to be good and tattered, looking as if it'd 
been seasoned in a nest of killer bees. 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, these trifling collectibles came to be known as swag. The epithet 
fits, conjuring an image of pirate booty that seems in keeping with the spirit 
of rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
 But where swag was once the calling card of the anti-Establishment, best 
accompanied by ragged jeans, it has evolved into sleek fashion accessories 
rendered with high production values from quality fabrics -- and given price 
tags to match. The unpretentious garb once peddled out of car trunks has gone 
to the boutiques (see related Inside Out item, E4) and, by several estimates, 
is a billion-dollar-a-year industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, rock merchandising was responding to fashion trends instead of 
dictating them," says Tom Donnell, tour manager of Commerce-based Giant 
Merchandising, a wing of Giant Records. "That's starting to change now." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, computer-generated motifs are embroidered, printed, stamped and woven 
onto every form of apparel imaginable. T-shirts may have as little as a simple 
logo or as much as an edge-to-edge print, as in the popular Aerosmith cowhide 
motif.  
</P>
<P>
 Going out for a night of clubbing? Well, slip into your Soul Asylum boxers 
(although to be truly fashionable, you would want to wear them outside your 
pants), then don your Def Leppard tank top, Megadeth T-shirt and Screaming 
Trees sweat pants. And, should the evening take an unexpected turn, don't be 
caught without your U2 condoms, although they might be getting a little old for 
safety's sake. 
</P>
<P>
 Contemporary swag may come in increasingly ambitious forms, but it will always 
be beholden to two fundamental principles. First: "The black T-shirt is the 
utter foundation of rock 'n' roll graphics," says Paul Grushkin, national sales 
manager for Winterland Productions, the San Francisco company that pioneered 
rock merchandising in the early '70s. "And no matter what else you do, you have 
to have cutting-edge, jaw-hanging graphics." 
</P>
<P>
 It's true that 16- to-24-year-old metal heads -- with their insatiable lust 
for gore-dripping, flame-throwing specters -- remain the industry's bread and 
butter. But the encroaching middle-agedness of rock fans across the board has 
created a demand for something that only a few years ago would have been 
unthinkable: earth tones. 
</P>
<P>
 "Earth tones are really hot right now," Donnell says. "You never would have 
seen them a few years ago." And therein may lie the strongest testimony to 
rock's durability: If it can survive mauve, it can survive anything. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The color scheme for the Eagles' Hell Freezes Over tour, which kicks off May 
27 at the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre, is still coming together. Giant 
Merchandising is awaiting final approval of its designs, which Eagles members, 
particularly Don Henley, have personally overseen, Donnell says. Once the 
company gets an OK, its presses will lurch into production, churning out some 
50,000 units of swag in a week. And that's just for starters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wait until after the first several dates of tour before we commit to a 
product line in order to see what trends develop," Donnell says. 
</P>
<P>
 He characterizes the Eagles' reunion venture as the ideal tour from a rock 
merchandising standpoint. "It's much more of a novelty than either the Stones 
or Pink Floyd, because the Eagles haven't toured in 14 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Consolo, an El Segundo writer, has a lot to show for his two decades as 
an Eagles fan, including a drawerful of pristine Ts and a letterman's jacket 
that circulated during the "Hotel California" tour. "I buy them but never wear 
them," he says, noting that he has swag older than some of the kids at the 
taping for the band's recent MTV special. "It was a shock." 
</P>
<P>
 By most accounts, the grandfather of swag is Dell Furano, who co-founded 
Winterland Productions with the late rock promoter Bill Graham. Now president 
of rival company Sony Signatures, he has overseen some of the most lucrative 
merchandising events in rock history, including the 1970s Pink Floyd and 
Grateful Dead tours, as well as the Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen, Madonna 
and U2 tours throughout the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 Swag mania began with the Grateful Dead in 1971, when Furano was managing the 
San Francisco concert hall where the band played a three-night stand. "It 
started as a family thing. The wife of the Dead's drummer had been making the 
T-shirts and selling them in the lobby," he recalls. "She got tired of fooling 
with it and offered to let me take over the merchandising for a royalty. So the 
Deadheads were the spawning ground for the whole merchandising scene." 
</P>
<P>
 Winterland's Grushkin estimates that about 30 million Grateful Dead T-shirts 
are in circulation. The basis for his figure: "'The Dead has 2 million fans and 
each one of them probably has 15 T-shirts apiece, half homemade, half bought 
from merchandisers." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was Furano who struck upon the idea of taking merchandise on the road, a 
practice now as much a part of rock tours as sound checks. Emboldened by hot 
sales, he approached such groups as Jefferson Starship, Santana and Journey. A 
watershed in the history of swag came with the 1981 Rolling Stones tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the birth of modern-day rock merchandising," says Furano, 43, whose 
work uniform still consists of jeans and rock T-shirts. The tour grossed $10 
million on merchandising alone. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also Furano who has shepherded swag's steady march to the upscale. If 
you had told a tie-dyed rocker with a pocketful of roach clips 15 years ago 
that he might someday buy white button-down oxford-cloth shirts embroidered 
with the logo of his favorite group, he or she would have passed it off as a 
bad trip. Work shirts, as seen at Billy Joel and Neil Diamond concerts, are 
also big. 
</P>
<P>
 And Barbra Streisand, who embarked this week on her first tour in 27 years, 
offered the fans at her sellout New Year's concerts in Las Vegas silk Jacquard 
blouses and jackets and limited-edition jewelry, among other items. Merchandise 
sales broke industry records, averaging $40 per concert-goer. 
</P>
<P>
 Although swag sales are based profoundly on impulse, fueled by throbbing 
backbeats and euphoric encores, the average Joe will not plunk down hundreds at 
a concert. With that in mind, Brockum Global Merchandising is developing a 
mail-order catalogue of high-end swag, such as varsity jackets tied to the Pink 
Floyd tour.  
</P>
<P>
 "You're not likely to sell a $125 leather handbag to a Metallica fan, but for 
the Rolling Stones or Pink Floyd, you're looking at people in their 30s or 40s, 
who can afford to buy finer things," says Steve Gerstman, a former Winterland 
vice president who consults for Brockum. "It's a question of the aging baby 
boomer." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the swag of yore is being recycled in what seems a most un-rocklike 
manner -- as Father's Day gifts. Mulberry Neckwear of San Anselmo, Calif., last 
year introduced a line of ties based on '60s and '70s concert posters 
commissioned by promoter Graham. They feature psychedelic graphics, such as 
Jimi Hendrix's famous "flying eyeball" -- bloodshot, with flames shooting out 
of it -- which has been the series' hands-down bestseller. Company president 
Henry Jacobson estimates that 100,000 of the $40 ties have been sold, with a 
new selection on the way for the third Sunday in June. 
</P>

 Swag, of course, isn't just for the fans. Record companies and concert venues 
often commission a private stock of finery ranging from shirts to expensive 
varsity jackets worth hundreds of dollars as tokens of appreciation to band 
members and roadies alike. Road crews, in fact, are notorious for their 
swag-hoarding ways. And for musicians and their minions, swag becomes a virtual 
uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 Donnell explains: "On the road, it's like a contest to see who can get one of 
every item. Roadies also like to trade with the guys working on other shows as 
well. It's a huge part of rock 'n' roll." 
</P>
<P>
 And no matter how much swag one acquires, there's always room for more. "Once 
we coincidentally had dinner in the same restaurant as Janet Jackson's band," 
recalls one rock tour veteran. "They all had these beautiful, floor-length 
leather jackets. It was the first time I experienced swag envy."

SHE SAID / HE SAID: HAPPY 35TH, BARBIE: YOU SURE DON'T LOOK IT 
</P>

 B arbie, that goddess of the doll set, is 35 years old? Without a hint of 
crow's-feet framing her eyes or even the beginning of a bulge on her torso, how 
can this be? We'd like Barbie more if she were available in a mature version 
along with the forever-young original. Time for a Barbie reality-check.  
</P>
<P>
 SHE: Give me a Barbie with a little vintage, and I'll show you a doll that is 
a real role model. The perfect plastic Barbie may provide lots of make-believe 
time, but she's hardly the kind of girl I'd want me or my daughters to be -- 
obnoxiously skinny, every hair in place and packing a wardrobe that puts Ivana 
Trump's to shame. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbie dolls force girls to deal with their big-girl dreams too soon. Give me 
a Barbie baby-doll, an adolescent Barbie, a young adult Barbie and, yes, Barbie 
as a young wife and grandma, and I'll give you a generation of young women who 
are in touch . 
</P>
<P>
 HE: The chance any of that will happen: approximately the same as that of Al 
Gore getting a tattoo. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't think for one minute that Mattel is going to stomp all over one of 
the biggest moneymakers the corporation has ever produced by injecting 
something as horrible as reality into the mix? Maybe Andrea Dworkin would 
dearly love to bulldoze every Barbie in North America into an immense landfill, 
but the way I get it the average doll-age girl would rather have a Barbie, 
fully tricked out in the latest mini-duds, than a certificate good for one 
undergrad year at Bryn Mawr. 
</P>
<P>
 Ready for a little sexist propaganda? I'm willing to bet that Barbie is 
responsible for more cases of low self-image and crash dieting among women than 
all the airbrushed Playboy models since 1959. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: Most women don't bother comparing themselves with the women in Playboy. 
Too declasse. (The tony women in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue are 
another matter.) 
</P>
<P>
 But I'll grant you that Barbie fosters an unrealistic expectation in girls 
that may lead to problems with self-image. The way I see it, Barbie doesn't 
have to work for anything. She pops out of the package looking like a million 
bucks. She should be accompanied by a caveat: Play with at your own risk. Life 
isn't just about looking great. It's also about developing your talents and 
using them to make the world a better place.  
</P>
<P>
 HE: We probably shouldn't beat all the stuffing out of Barbie without trying 
to find something laudable about her. For instance, I'll bet that more than a 
few girls learned quite a bit about clothes from round after round of dressing 
Barbie for one event or another. If guys of my generation relied on a doll to 
teach them how to dress, we'd all be wearing camouflage fatigues to work every 
day (G.I. Joe, remember?). 
</P>
<P>
 But Barbie was versatile. Heck, there was even a Barbie fashion show recently 
at South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa, with live models wearing reproductions of 
Barbie fashions from the '60s (a few of which looked a bit silly on grown-up 
women). 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: There it is -- the hype machine that will keep Barbie alive until she's 
blowing out 1,000 candles, sans wrinkles.  
</P>
<P>
 OK, something good about Barbie: She provides creative play and an opportunity 
for little girls to converse with each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Hey. What about Ken? Is Barbie at the point where she no longer needs a man? 
</P>
<P>
 HE: I just came up with the most horrible mental picture: thousands and 
thousands of otherwise cheerful girls preening away merrily with Barbie and 
then, in a sudden fit of blind rage, grabbing Ken (who's dressed in old boxers 
and a sweat-stained "Beer Drinkers Make Better Lovers" T-shirt) and slicing him 
up with a kitchen knife. Whew! Too awful to think about. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: I remember the days when the whole Barbie thing had to do with getting 
dressed up to attract Ken. Now, at least, I see little girls playing with their 
Barbies and putting them in a context where she comes home from work and 
dresses up to go out -- man or no man. Come to think of it, Barbie is doing 
girls a favor when she helps them express themselves in a way that coincides 
with reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Gosh, I'm sounding awfully serious about this. Maybe it's because my role 
model was Cinderella. Talk about a reality check! 
</P>
<P>
 HE: Well, what next? Corporate raider Barbie? Boardroom shark Barbie? 
Merciless divorce lawyer Barbie? Mindless daytime talk show hostess Barbie? 
Bloodless political lobbyist Barbie? Urban terrorist Barbie? Weaseling 
Hollywood agent Barbie? Sleazy trash novelist Barbie? 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, we could see Astronaut Barbie (pink space suit, $450), 
medical researcher Barbie, Olympic luge champion Barbie and, maybe with a bit 
less makeup, Saint Barbie. 
</P>
<P>
 Next: G.I. Joe gets a set of dress blues.

 For Nancy Reagan, it's the little red suit. For Larry King, it's his trademark 
suspenders. For Cher, black Spandex. Most people have their favorite looks, but 
some cling to styles like security blankets.They get stuck in a fashion rut. 
You can see these fashion time-travelers everywhere: Women prance around in 
miniskirts decades after they should be baring their thighs. Men squeeze 
themselves into suits that are the same size they wore in college, ignoring 
those extra pounds around their middles. And you can still find people wearing 
the same hairstyle they've worn since casting their first vote for President. 
Recognizing that you're the one who's guilty of doing a style to death isn't 
always easy. How to tell if it's time for a change? Orange County style experts 
recently shared these tips for avoiding a fashion time-warp

A SHORTS STORY ABOUT TOP-DRAWER INSPECTOR NO. 122 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY ZEZIMA, THE STAMFORD ADVOCATE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I recently had a brief encounter with a woman who really got into my 
underwear. Needless to say, she was a pretty hot number. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 122, to be exact. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole scandalous affair began one weekday morning when I went to a local 
department store to buy a value pack of Hanes men's briefs, which, as the 
discriminating consumer no doubt knows, are made of "100% cotton preshrunk 
fabric" and are "unconditionally guaranteed." 
</P>
<P>
 In man's never-ending battle against wedgies, this is very important. 
</P>
<P>
 So I bought the underwear and, being rather modest by nature, waited until I 
got home to try it on. 
</P>
<P>
 When I opened the pack, however, I noticed a small piece of paper on which was 
printed the following information: "This garment inspected by 122." 
</P>
<P>
 My first thought was: Why don't I take off my pants before I try on my new 
underwear? 
</P>
<P>
 Then I wondered: Who is Inspector No. 122? 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately I recalled the famous Inspector No. 12, the feisty, grandmotherly, 
no-nonsense woman in the old Hanes television commercials who, like a master 
drill sergeant, would hold up a pair of men's briefs and bark: "They don't say 
Hanes until I say they say Hanes!" 
</P>
<P>
 But that was so long ago I was sure Inspector No. 12 had either retired or 
gone to that big laundry basket in the sky. 
</P>
<P>
 Then I imagined a younger woman -- dark, mysterious, sultry -- running her 
fingers through my briefs and purring: "These are disgusting." 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to learn the true identity of Inspector No. 122, I called Hanes 
at its corporate headquarters in Winston-Salem, N.C. The first thing I found 
out is that Hanes is owned by Sara Lee. I just hope the pastry and panty 
divisions don't get their buns mixed up. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, I spoke with a very nice woman named Sherry Hauber, who is executive 
secretary to both Paul Snyder, vice president and general manager for male 
underwear, and Carol Mabe, vice president and general manager of Hanes Her Way 
panties. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm definitely into drawers, one way or another," Sherry said. 
</P>
<P>
 She then connected me to Mr. Snyder, who promised to go undercover (he said 
it, not me) to track down Inspector No. 122. 
</P>
<P>
 A short time later, I knew her name: Diane Peoples. 
</P>
<P>
 "Was that your underwear I inspected?" she asked when I reached her at the 
Hanes Distribution Center in Davie County, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 "Size 34," I told her. "You did a real nice job." 
</P>
<P>
 This is nothing new for Peoples, a 14-year Hanes veteran who understandably 
takes great pride in her work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I ever said when I was a little girl, 'I want to be an 
underwear inspector when I grow up,' but I do view it as a big responsibility," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 What does Peoples look for during her careful inspections, or "spot checks," 
of men's underwear? 
</P>
<P>
 "Pretty much the same things you would look for, only closer," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I often get out a tape measure to check width, length and the size of the leg 
holes," Peoples said, adding that properly attached waistbands and comfortably 
snug leg holes are what help prevent wedgies. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the bottom line," I said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Please, no cracks," she replied dryly. "I've heard all the underwear jokes." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, she said that her main mission as Inspector No. 122 is to make sure 
everyone is fully covered. 
</P>
<P>
 "I myself appreciate it," said Peoples, who, as you might expect, wears Hanes 
Her Way panties. 
</P>
<P>
 I wouldn't know anything about that, of course, but my wife would. When I told 
her that another woman -- a married woman, no less -- had gone through my 
briefs, my wife shrugged and said: "I hope she had a good time." 
</P>
<P>
 Then she told me to get my dirty underwear off the floor. Talk about getting 
caught with your pants down.

DESIGNER SPOTLIGHT: ROMANCING THE STONES WITH INLAY SETTINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN BOLD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thane DeLeon uses gemstones the way an artist uses paint. 
</P>
<P>
 He puts stones together in unusual color combinations to create rings, 
earrings and pendants that his customers and jewelry store owners consider 
works of art. 
</P>
<P>
 The curvy, irregular shapes of his pieces recall the mountains of Arizona, 
where he lives. The colors -- the iridescent opal, violet tanzanite, chrome 
tourmaline that "looks like the most beautiful emerald you'd ever see" -- are 
inspired by the Southwest terrain. 
</P>
<P>
 DeLeon inlays the colored stones in gold so the surface of his pieces is 
smooth -- but with plenty of curves, swirls and movable parts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want my pieces to look flat," he says. "They're not one piece of 
metal. They move. They're more like little people." 
</P>
<P>
 Some pieces are inspired by Navaho spirits and even have abstract faces. 
Southwest themes such as bear-shaped fetishes and uneven horizons are 
prevalent. 
</P>
<P>
 DeLeon began making jewelry as an apprentice in 1980. That job lasted 1 1/2 
years, during which he was given an unusual amount of freedom to practice all 
aspects of the trade, from gold-smithing to wax-carving. Most work years before 
learning such skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't care what I did," DeLeon says.  
</P>
<P>
 Before long he was on his own, making custom jewelry at his apartment. It 
wasn't until friends encouraged him to visit Santa Fe to see the inlaid jewelry 
being produced by Southwest designers that he began creating his own line. 
</P>
<P>
 "Santa Fe is the mecca of jewelry inlay," he says. "For me, it was a different 
form of design. You can do complex designs within that (technique)." He began 
producing his inlaid pieces (in which the stones are set in channels rather 
than raised prongs) and opened his shop, Thane DeLeon of Scottsdale, in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 DeLeon draws inspiration for his creations from the gemstones themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I go for the beauty of the stone and modify my design to accommodate it," he 
says. He searches out stones on trips to Bangkok, "the mecca of gemstones," as 
well as Australia, his back yard and other sources. 
</P>
<P>
 He uses sugalite, a vivid purple gemstone from Africa, because it is said to 
have positive effects on the wearer. "Sugalite is metaphysical and is a very 
healing stone," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 His favorite gemstone is tourmaline "because it comes in every color." He also 
works with a large palette of gems, including sapphires, blue violet-colored 
tanzanite, opals, lapis, jade, diamonds and coral. His jewelry starts at $250. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like pieces with unusual colors and gemstones that can still function as 
jewelry," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 DeLeon will appear at a showing of his designs Saturday and Sunday at Zia 
Jewelry Co. in San Juan Capistrano. Thane DeLeon, Jewelry Designer 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 33 
</P>
<P>
 Home: Scottsdale, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
 Formal training: Worked as an apprentice at a jewelry studio. 
</P>
<P>
 Where he started: Selling custom jewelry from his apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Where he is now: Owns a jewelry store in Scottsdale; also sells his pieces at 
galleries and jewelry stores across the country, including Zia Jewelry Co. in 
San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 Signature style: Contemporary with a heavy Southwest influence. 
</P>
<P>
 Medium: Primarily gold and precious stones. 
</P>
<P>
 In the future: Hopes to become a nationally recognized jewelry designer and 
"have a line of jewelry that's different from everybody else's." 
</P>
<P>
 Attitude: "I like to think my work is thought-out. It doesn't just sit there. 
It has direction, meaning."

BY DESIGN; THE MORE UNGLAMOROUS, THE BETTER? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE DRAKE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sometimes the best disguise is no disguise -- hence the popularity of 
sunglasses and baseball caps, brim forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "Between those two accessories," says photographer Kathy Hutchins, "you've 
covered up half the face.The hair is hidden, too." 
</P>
<P>
 The third element in this equation is dull, shapeless clothing, all the better 
to hide a star body. Julia Roberts was recently spotted in Century City looking 
like any other mall girl, in a loose brown dress, big cardigan, bare legs and 
flats. 
</P>
<P>
 Think about it, says the Star's Janet Charlton: "Some actresses are so cute 
they don't dare get dolled up in their normal lives. They have to play their 
looks down if they want to go to the supermarket. Otherwise, men will still 
flirt with them, even if they don't know who they are. That's why sweat suits 
are so popular." 
</P>
<P>
 At the airport, if you see a sloppily dressed person walking with a man in a 
suit, "take a better look," photographer Vinnie Zuffante says. "That could be a 
celebrity and a chauffeur." LAURIE DRAKE

WHAT MAKES 'TOMMY' SO GOOD? START WITH THE PLAYERS AND SCORE 
</P>

<P>
 Those attending the cast party for "The Who's Tommy" Tuesday met not one Tommy 
but five -- Steve Isaacs, who plays the Pinball Wizard as an adult and the four 
children who play Tommy as a child. 
</P>
<P>
 The board of directors of the Orange County Performing Arts Center staged the 
post-performance bash at Diva in Costa Mesa after "Tommy" opened its weeklong 
run at the center. About 150 supporters of the Costa Mesa center spent the 
evening eating pasta and mingling with the actors and musicians. There Has to 
Be a Twist 
</P>
<P>
 "Tommy" is the story of Tommy Walker, who withdraws from the world after a 
traumatic childhood experience only to emerge -- a "deaf, dumb and blind kid" 
-- as a reluctant hero: the Pinball Wizard. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the biggest surprise of the evening was seeing two of the children who 
play Tommy wearing dresses -- actresses Kelly Mady and Caitlin Newman share the 
role of traumatized Tommy at age 4. Those who did not over the next two 
weekends. carefully read their programs assumed the character was played by a 
boy. 
</P>
<P>
 Caitlin, 8, only had eyes for Isaacs, the former MTV veejay who plays the 
grown-up Tommy. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's awesome," she said, jumping into his arms. "He's fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Isaacs, who spent much of the night teasing his young co-stars, said he gets 
along with child actors because "I still have kid-ness in me." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm taking them to Disneyland Monday."  
</P>
<P>
 A singer/songwriter, the 24-year-old Isaacs is having as much fun playing 
Tommy as a kid at the Happiest Place on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love Pete Townshend's work. It's a big honor (to play Tommy). It's really 
exhausting but super rewarding," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Isaacs is no stranger to Orange County: His parents live in Laguna Niguel. 
Still, he showed childlike amazement at the Performing Arts Center: "It's one 
of the weirdest buildings I've ever seen in my life. I'm used to a symmetrical 
theater. This is like a 'Star Wars' hangar bay." 
</P>
<P>
 While Isaacs was busy being mobbed by guests, actor William Youmans, who plays 
the wicked Uncle Ernie, sat at a table with other cast members quietly enjoying 
his dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of my character, I don't get a lot of girls at the back stage door 
wanting to meet me," he said. Youmans' character sexually abuses Tommy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to play a character who's very unpopular," he said. "I try to go 
within myself to bring out some pain to show that people who molest children 
are in pain." An Amazing Journey 
</P>
<P>
 As every Who fan knows, "Tommy" began as a best-selling album written by 
Townshend in 1969. The concept album inspired a movie in 1975, but it did not 
become musical theater until 1992 when it premiered at the La Jolla Playhouse 
under the direction of Des McAnuff.  
</P>
<P>
 After becoming a huge hit at the playhouse, "Tommy" opened on Broadway on 
April 22, 1993, and received five Tony Awards, including a best score award for 
Townshend and a best director award for McAnuff. 
</P>
<P>
 Alec Timerman, who plays an ill-fated lover in the play and is understudy for 
the lead, said, " 'Tommy's' going to be one of those landmark musicals. Des 
McAnuff has created a new way of storytelling. It's very visual and sensual." 
</P>
<P>
 After seeing the play's debut in Orange County, where it received a standing 
ovation, party-goers also offered rave reviews. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the play had a real message -- which is (conveyed) in the song in 
the second act ('I'm Free')," said Sheila Sonenshine, a new board member. "And 
the staging and sets were unbelievable. When I see something like that I 
wonder, do they sit around for days trying to think that stuff up?" 
</P>
<P>
 Other guests were: Tom Nielsen, center chairman; Tom Tomlinson, executive 
director and chief operating officer of the center; Buzz and Lois Aldrin, Tony 
Allen, Byron Allumbaugh, Pat Carlyle, E.H. Clark, Keith Dahl, Richard Engel, 
Sandy Fainbarg, Gordon and Rita Fishman, Walter Henry, Carol Hoffman, Janet 
Lind, Paula Lingelbach, Tim and Susan Strader, Tom and Marianne Trollan and Tim 
Weiss.

TIPS FROM ORANGE COUNTY STYLE EXPERTS

 Michael Renzi 
</P>
<P>
 Designer and president of Renzi Custom Gallery in Newport Beach, a custom 
clothier specializing in men's wardrobes, and president of the Custom Tailors 
and Designers Assn. in New York City:  
</P>
<P>
 For Renzi, the first sign that a man is locked into a style is: "He wakes up 
in the morning and has no enthusiasm when he looks in his closet. Everything's 
boring and mundane. Nothing sparkles or sizzles." 
</P>
<P>
 A boring wardrobe is often caused by one's failure to keep on top of trends, 
Renzi says. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a low priority on a man's list. He dresses because he has to," he says. 
"He wears the same outfit year after year. There's no threat or thought 
process. It's the same dark suit, white shirt and eight to 10 ties that are his 
favorites." 
</P>
<P>
 Men who lack fashion know-how can find help in updating their look. Renzi 
Custom Gallery and other menswear stores offer wardrobe consulting, often at no 
cost, in which a consultant surveys a client's closet and helps him revamp his 
wardrobe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly I don't know if we'll ever get men to think a lot about clothes, but 
they still want to get compliments," Renzi says. Wardrobe consultants "can help 
them jump out of bed with a little more pep." Kitty Leslie 
</P>
<P>
 A Laguna Niguel fashion consultant who oversees numerous fashion shows in 
Orange County:  
</P>
<P>
 Playing it safe by returning to the same styles over and over is a common 
affliction, according to Leslie. 
</P>
<P>
 "People will wear -- and I'm as guilty as anybody -- the same color all the 
time. Go into your closet. If everything's navy or beige, you're in a fashion 
rut," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Often the clothes are not only the same color, they're the same design. Some 
women, for instance, cling to "the little boy look." Their closets are filled 
with tailored jackets and other menswear-inspired looks. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie herself confesses to being "stuck in a kind of preppy look. Everything 
was blazers and tailored pants." She tried experimenting with the Western look 
and, after trying out silver conch belts and cowboy boots, found she liked the 
change. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way to change is to take your second most favorite look and try it," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Those unsure which fashion direction to take can find help from a 
knowledgeable salesperson at a favorite clothing store. 
</P>
<P>
 "Put yourself in their hands and say, 'I'm in a rut. I'm wearing nothing but 
beige tailored clothes,' " Leslie suggests. He or she "can say, 'Why not try a 
softer look?' Some of the best advice I've had comes from good salespeople." 
</P>
<P>
 The ideal time to experiment with a new style is when you're in an upbeat 
mood, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "It starts with confidence. You might have a new hairdo you love, so head to 
your favorite department store and try things on," Leslie says. "Don't attempt 
(a change) on a bad day." Jose Eber 
</P>
<P>
 Owner of the Jose Eber Salon in South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa, and celebrity 
stylist:  
</P>
<P>
 Eber knows he's not exactly the poster child for change. He's worn the same 
hairstyle -- a long braid down the back topped with a cowboy hat -- for more 
than 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's my trademark. It's almost like Samson. The day I chop it off I fear I'll 
freak out," he says. "I don't use myself as an example for change." 
</P>
<P>
 Those lucky enough to find a classic hairstyle that can last a decade or 
longer are usually the exception. Most people need to periodically change their 
hairstyles or look dated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some think the hairstyle they wore at a younger age will keep them looking 
their best," Eber says. "But decades go by, and the style becomes aging." 
</P>
<P>
 In the '60s, for example, a lot of women wore bleached blond hair that was 
very stiff from a lot of teasing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ten years later, some women were still wearing the same hairstyle," Eber 
says. "They think, 'That's the way I looked when I looked my best, when I found 
my sweetheart.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Those who have changed to today's softer, natural hairstyles "look better 
today than 20 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid having outdated hair, "know what's going on in the fashion and beauty 
world," Eber says. 
</P>
<P>
 He advises finding a trusted stylist and trying out a new cut or color. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hair grows. Know that it's not permanent. At least give it a chance," he 
says. "Ninety percent of the time, you'll prefer the change." Dianna 
Pfaff-Martin 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach image consultant and owner of California Image Advisors:  
</P>
<P>
 When Pfaff-Martin opens her clients' closets to study their wardrobe, she's 
often sees racks of clothes in similar styles, fabrics and prints. People get 
accustomed to shopping the same stores and buying the same outfits over and 
over, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 To her, it's kind of crazy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over but 
expecting different results," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 People get stuck on certain styles for psychological reasons, Pfaff-Martin 
says. They associate the styles "with a time in their lives when they were 
happy or felt the most beautiful. That's why you'll see a woman wearing a short 
miniskirt who shouldn't be." 
</P>
<P>
 She guides clients out of their fashion time warps by getting them to try on 
new looks. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of hand-holding. It's a matter of leading the client to 
something different," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Women, for instance, tend to favor pink hues and dainty prints. She steers 
them to strong, solid colors for a more sophisticated look. Men often wear 
favorite ties long after they're out of vogue. She encourages them to trade in 
ties with, say, big floral prints for the more updated small geometrics. 
Usually a change will result in compliments, and the client will be convinced. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a very visual society," says Pfaff-Martin, who tells clients that a 
sharp appearance is crucial to their careers. "Those who don't change will 
really be stuck in a rut." KATHRYN BOLD

YOUR CHANCE TO PADDLE A DRAGON 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 About 2,400 years ago in China, poet Qu Yuan protested government practices by 
throwing himself into a river to drown. He was so well-loved by townspeople, 
they raced out in boats to retrieve him. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus began the Chinese dragon boat racing tradition, which has become so 
popular in China, says Richard Lukens, it's second only to the Chinese New 
Year. 
</P>
<P>
 Dragon boat racing has also become a serious competitive sport in Europe, 
England and Vancouver, Canada, says Lukens, who is producing the second annual 
Los Angeles International Dragon Boat Festival, Saturday and Sunday, 10 a.m.-8 
p.m., at Frank G. Bonelli Regional Park in San Dimas.  
</P>
<P>
 About 30 teams of local and international paddlers will race the colorful 
50-foot-long dragon boats on Puddingstone Reservoir. Individual paddlers may 
enter the race at no extra cost (admission: adults $7.95; children 12 and under 
$4.95; under 4 free). 
</P>
<P>
 The festival also includes food, arts and crafts, children's activities and 
entertainment. Exit the I-10 and I-210 freeways at Via Verde. (818) 564-1811.

FAUX PAS REPORT: WHITE SHOES COULD BE BAD NEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It may sound a little boring, but mixing whites appears to be a hot fashion 
trend this spring. Many women who thought they'd never wear a snowy white 
T-shirt with a cream vest are marching around Southern California, randomly 
wearing white shoes. But what they may forget is that all white isn't always 
right. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be seeing a lot of whites and naturals this year, but some women are 
forgetting some basic fashion sense," says Sandy Miller of Twice the Style in 
Costa Mesa. "With the exception of tennis shoes, wearing white shoes is a no-no 
unless your pants are white." 
</P>
<P>
 The old rule that the color of your shoes should never be lighter than your 
hemline holds true today. When wearing a beige or cream pant or skirt, stick 
with a shoe in that color. Bright white shoes with a yellowish white hemline 
are distracting. There's only one who can get away with wearing white shoes 
with anything, and you can check her out on your next visit to Disneyland -- 
Minnie Mouse.

 Beach nerd: Having trouble sleeping? Feeling a little depressed about the 
encroachment of summer on the calendar? Perhaps with some regression therapy, 
you may find that you've blocked out a horrifying party you went to last July. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a Friday afternoon, hot, sticky. You were invited to a summer 
get-together at the boss' house on the beach and decided to go straight from 
work. You got there and found that everyone at the party was dressed in beach 
clothes and cavorting in the sand. 
</P>
<P>
 You were tempted to roll those new $200 dress slacks up and try to fit in, but 
were afraid you'd ruin them and decided to leave them down. To make matters 
worse, you kept your shoes and socks on to prevent getting sand in the cuffs. 
People at work are still talking about you. 
</P>
<P>
 "In that situation, definitely roll up the slacks and pull off the socks and 
shoes," says Mark Schell of Mark Schell Designs for Men in Corona del Mar. "How 
else are you going to have any fun? Roll them up above the knee to keep them in 
place. You're not going to damage a good pair of slacks by doing that. Leaving 
them down could expose them to more sand. Just be careful not to get them wet." 
</P>
<P>
 And keep a pair of Bermudas and a tank top in the trunk so you'll be ready 
when you're invited the next time. If there is a next time.

 Sweat fret: The cat suit continues to be a fashion staple for many women, but 
some have been spotted wearing an unusual combination.  
</P>
<P>
 On occasions when they remove their blazers or sweaters, bulging dress shields 
to soak up perspiration can be seen poking through the armpits. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not very attractive," says Susan Shaw of Dancegear in Newport Beach. 
"And it's not something they should have to do when wearing a black or white 
cat suit." 
</P>
<P>
 Stains on other colors can be more noticeable, such as bright red or blue. 
Possible solution: stick with white or black, slather on the deodorant and 
don't take off the jacket.

 Cutting burlap into tailored suits might seem like some surrealist nightmare. 
But it was more of a dream come true for David and Jody Rodriguez to start 
their namesake label, Rodriguez. The Long Beach duo see burlap as another 
alternative to linen and cotton. Hemp, they say, is not too far behind. The 
full collection, from hats and bags to coats and skirts, include pieces for him 
and her, priced from $32 to $120. Each is fully lined, "so they're really 
comfortable," Jody says. Barfly Chic

 Ever trendy Charles Bukowski -- man, myth and author -- apparently inspires 
more than the occasional contrived wanna-be writer. Peter Jaisel has come out 
with vinyl suit-style jackets the designer calls "Hank" after Chuck's alter 
ego/pen name. "It's something you'd wear to a dive bar," says Jaisel, who adds 
that boot leather is out this year and next as the fabric. Jaisel gets his 
vinyl through PETA (People for Ethical Treatment of Animals). Find a rack full 
of these coats (about $150) at Urban Outfitters in Costa Mesa and other like

 "I wanted a cleaner, modish look that would distinguish us from people who 
ride Harleys," said Jean Paul Hope, who founded Hellracer 59 with his buddy 
Richard Dirk, based on their love for British motorcycles. The San Diego-based 
line features unisex, snug-fitting tops and jackets and, for her, tube dresses 
detailed with racing stripes and logos or the signature crest (right). Part of 
the name is borrowed from the title of a 20-year-old book on bikes; the "59" 
comes from a motorcycle club that dominated the streets of London in the '50s

 Clunky heels might be around a while longer, but don't be surprised to see 
them slimmed way down to stilettos. "They might not sound great now, but when 
it comes to fashion, never say never," quips Julie Logan, West Coast editor for 
Glamour. "Fashion is returning to glamour, and nothing makes a leg look better 
than spiked heels." Before protesting this as some conspiracy by male 
designers, consider this -- it's just part of the cycle for something new. Just 
ask Logan: "Will I wear them? Absolutely." ROSE APODACA JONES

BEHIND THE SCENES / ORANGE COUNTY: A SMILE MAKES A GREAT ACCESSORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Laughter Is Inner Jogging" was the catch phrase for the Wellness Community of 
Orange County's fund-raiser Monday at the Improv in Irvine. But no one chose to 
wear jogging attire . . . thank goodness, although it was OKd on the 
invitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, most of the 270 guests wore business suits or after-6 dresses to the 
fifth annual "Evening at the Improv," a benefit for the organization that 
offers free help to those affected by cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Because one of the goals of the Wellness Community is to improve quality of 
life by developing a positive attitude, a few guests focused on the lighter 
side of fashion. Shira Levy, the development director and outreach coordinator 
for the group, wore a denim jacket hand-painted with pinballs, flappers and 
even a "Tilt" warning. 
</P>

 Adel V. Rakhshani looked more like a house painter than a fine artist in his 
white cap, white shirt and white pants. His work was on display at a private 
reception for the underwriters of the event.

DEPUTIES PATROL CAMPUS AFTER RACIAL BRAWLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Patrol cars circled the Canyon High School campus and a sheriff's helicopter 
hovered overhead Wednesday in the wake of two brawls that erupted near the 
school Tuesday between alleged white supremacists and students of various 
races. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors of more fights were rampant Wednesday morning, causing school officials 
to request the deputies' presence when school adjourned at 12:15 p.m. because 
of a previously scheduled half-day, said Thomas Gibson, school resource deputy 
for the area.  
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies from the Santa Clarita Valley Station 
spent about an hour outside the Canyon Country school, stopping and searching 
numerous cars. Several knives and other weapons were confiscated from at least 
one of car. 
</P>
<P>
 Law officers also converged on the parking lots of two adjacent fast-food 
restaurants several blocks away from the campus, where as many as 80 students 
had gathered because of the rumored fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of those kids were there for that reason," said Deputy John Hudson, a 
member of the station's Career Offenders Burglary Robbery Apprehension (COBRA) 
team, which handles gang-related crimes. "There were rumors of different places 
where this was supposed to happen and that was one of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies dispersed the students without incident from the parking lots at the 
intersection of Soledad Canyon Road and Crossglade Avenue, and no other serious 
problems were reported during the three hours that sheriff's officials 
patrolled the area.  
</P>
<P>
 The weapons seized -- including kitchen knives and a pool ball stuffed in the 
toe of a sock meant to be swung at an opponent -- were described by deputies as 
makeshift items being carried by uneasy students wanting to defend themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 No arrests were made, with sheriff's officials stating they were more 
interested in preventing more violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been stopping cars not to accuse people, but we're saying 'If you're 
thinking of doing anything, stay away, because we know who you are,' " Gibson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students said a fight probably would have occurred Wednesday at one of several 
locations near the school were it not for the officers' presence. But they said 
the deputies' action simply delays the inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good idea, but it's not going to accomplish anything," said Manny 
Gallegos, 17, a junior at Canyon, who claimed to have been attacked by several 
youths Tuesday. "They'll bust the wrong people, because people will start to go 
crazy, but they aren't the ones who started this." 
</P>
<P>
 The tensions were apparently sparked by a fight between two students over the 
weekend, which led to altercations among 20 to 30 youths outside a home and in 
a parking lot during lunchtime Tuesday. No serious injuries were reported, but 
rocks were thrown and several cars were vandalized with crowbars and other 
blunt weapons, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 A group, possibly consisting of skinheads or other types of white 
supremacists, fought with students of various races, including whites, African 
Americans and Latinos. Sheriff's officials said the multiracial group was 
partially made up of members from various gangs, but the tensions are not 
considered gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the alleged attackers were not Canyon High students, school and 
sheriff's officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies were on the lookout for the suspected attackers but none were 
spotted, said Sgt. Lee White, head of the COBRA team. 
</P>
<P>
 "They obviously got the word we're after them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's officials said they will patrol the area surrounding the school 
again today if needed, but a final decision had not been made Wednesday 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon High has avoided serious altercations this year, although students said 
racism among some students is common. Principal Mike Allmandinger said he did 
not anticipate Tuesday's fight, but was not surprised by it. 
</P>
<P>
 "On any school campus with 2,300 students there's going to be a couple of kids 
who don't like one another," he said. "In today's society that means their 
friends don't like them either." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's fights were not the first racially-motivated incidents at Santa 
Clarita Valley schools in recent months.  
</P>
<P>
 In December, a black student at Saugus High School was assaulted by several 
white students shouting racial slurs a day after the victim made a speech about 
ending racial tensions. And Placerita Junior High School in Newhall was one of 
several locations where racist flyers degrading Latinos have been discovered in 
recent months.

A BIG STINK OVER TRASH; LANDLORD SAYS HAULER ILLEGALLY DUMPED GARBAGE IN 
PAYMENT DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A dispute over a $1,200 bill has turned dirty. 
</P>
<P>
 And smelly. 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Markowitz, who bought a bank-repossessed 12-unit building in North Hills 
in February, is accusing a refuse collection firm of dumping a truckload of 
trash on his property last month because he has refused to pay the bill, which 
he claims is owed by the building's previous owner. 
</P>
<P>
 Police submitted the matter to the city attorney's office Wednesday to decide 
whether criminal charges will be filed against Foothill Waste & Reclamation 
Co., Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, dumping a truckload of trash on someone else's property is just 
like tossing a gum wrapper on the street; both are infractions punishable by a 
fine of between $100 and $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The only difference is that with illegal dumping, a judge could also require 
the defendant to pay the cost of removing the trash, and each day that the 
trash remains unmoved could be considered a separate violation. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Officer Darlene McKay, who investigated the case, said the 
dispute should never have become a criminal matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a business dispute," McKay said, sounding like a scolding parent. "They 
should behave like adults." 
</P>
<P>
 Markowitz said he agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is no way to deal with a business dispute," he said. "They were very 
irresponsible." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Foothill Waste did not return repeated calls. However, McKay said 
she spoke with company officials, who she said admitted calling Markowitz about 
the disputed bill but denied knowing anything about the dumping. 
</P>
<P>
 Markowitz did not see the actual dumping, but he said two of his tenants did. 
</P>
<P>
 Miguel Chavez, one of the tenants, said he saw two men back up a red and blue 
truck with the word Foothill painted on the side and dump the trash in the 
parking lot behind the apartments in the 9300 block of Sepulveda Boulevard 
about 8:30 a.m. April 26. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not what I believe I saw, it's what I saw," Chavez said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Markowitz said Foothill Waste called his office three times, threatening to 
dump the trash if the $1,200 bill was not paid. The final warning came four 
days before the trash was dumped. 
</P>
<P>
 Markowitz said the last time Foothill Waste picked up trash at the property 
was in January, before he took possession of the building. He contracted with 
another firm for refuse collection in February. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the waste company to come back here four months later. . . ," Markowitz 
said, not finishing the sentence. "If that's their way of settling a bill, 
that's pretty low -- and illegal." 
</P>
<P>
 Markowitz said he went through the six-foot pile of trash, which after a few 
days was beginning to smell. He said that while picking through the heap -- 
which included chunks of broken cement and empty cans of paint and thinner

to the address listed on the envelopes and spoke to a resident there, who told 
him that Foothill Waste had picked up the trash there that morning about 8.

 Markowitz paid about $800 to have the trash removed over the weekend. He said

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SUN VALLEY; PICKING UP THE PIECES FOR MOVIE MAGIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an obscure Sun Valley recycling yard where the studios go shopping, special 
effects experts pick over the offerings, literally turning scraps into dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 "All water flows to the ocean," owner Bill Slater said philosophically. Slater 
has owned Apex, a recycling business on San Fernando Road, for 40 years. 
Electronic, mechanical and electrical discards turn up in his warehouses or his 
yard, and all of Hollywood comes to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "With four or five trips you can get everything you need," said Jordan Severy, 
a special effects technician with Warner Bros. Severy has been coming to 
Slater's junkyard for 14 years. Parts he has found here have been used in films 
such as "2010," "Ghostbusters" and "Big Trouble in Little China." He has also 
found parts for special effects on the Jackson Victory Tour several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want something that looks impressive, you come here," said Severy, 
holding a piece of computer cable he just found that he plans on using for the 
upcoming production of "Disclosure," based on the Michael Crichton novel. 
</P>
<P>
 There may be other scrap yards to go to, but movie makers here know Slater has 
one of the widest selections and many say he is the best to work with. One 
special effects expert from Hollywood Pictures -- a Disney subsidiary -- 
browsed through Slater's shelves and complained that some other places have 
everything catalogued. Although time-consuming, he said it is much better to 
look through piles of cable, motors, transformers, light bulbs, buttons and 
switches, and let the creative mind pull together the elements to create movie 
props.  
</P>
<P>
 "Usually, if I spend too much time here it gives me headaches," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Slater's association with the entertainment business started in the 1960s when 
he got a visit from the television shows "Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea" and 
"Lost in Space." He realized the potential of the consoles and cable that he 
picked up as scrap, and he developed an eye for picking out which items to save 
for the movie makers. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're after is the look," said Art Meier, a special effects technician 
with Stargate Films, a small Burbank studio that worked on "Highlander II," 
"Star Trek IV" and "Ghostbusters." Using parts from Slater, the company built 
the interior of an Apache helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of the items come to Slater from the defense industry. Army and Navy 
officials with a Lockheed engineer once picked through Slater's supply and 
picked up items they needed, Slater said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a room in one of his two warehouses, Slater displays his rental equipment 
-- panels and control lights that may be used for "seaQuest" one week and a 
different project the next. An entire shelf is made up of the altimeter dials 
and controls from airplanes which can be used to create faux cockpits. 
</P>
<P>
 Cables, especially the color-coded kinds that add realism to a set, are a 
popular item. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get cable here at 25% of what I'd pay for from the distributor," Meier 
said. "There's no list, no catalogue. I just pick up what I need and put it in 
my truck." 
</P>
<P>
 Slater's business -- and his association with the studios -- has grown not 
through advertising and slick publicity, but through his own simple low-key 
business style. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have what somebody wants and you have enough of it, they will find 
you," he said. ED BOND

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; STREET VENDOR PLAN HEARINGS SCHEDULED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER OLDHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials have set public hearing dates for a proposal that would 
encourage street vendors to set up their carts and wares in private plazas and 
courtyards and on the City Hall campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, an amendment to current city code regulating outdoor sales, does 
not encourage vendors on public sidewalks, said John McKenna, director of 
planning. 
</P>
<P>
 Public hearings on the amendment are set June 13 before the Planning 
Commission, and on June 28 before the City Council. City officials also plan to 
meet with the Glendale Chamber of Commerce and business representatives to 
discuss the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, which encourages outdoor vending to draw employees out of their 
offices, is in stark contrast to policies in other San Fernando Valley cities 
where there has been long-running debate about street vending. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank banned pushcart vendors last spring and authorized police to 
confiscate the carts if vendors violated the ban, saying street vendors created 
an image and enforcement problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, the Los Angeles County Health Department confiscated cooking 
equipment and other paraphernalia from illegal street vendors in Panorama City 
and Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale's proposal would require owners of free-standing carts carrying food 
or newspapers to receive permission from private plaza owners to set up their 
wares on that site. 
</P>
<P>
 Vendors would need to apply to the city for a permit to operate within a 
private plaza or on Civic Center property. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some city officials have expressed concern about enforcing the 
amendment, McKenna said private property owners can adequately police and 
maintain carts operating on private plaza sites. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the outdoor vendors should not present serious competition for indoor 
retailers, but rather provide a means to encourage people to spend more time on 
public sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved by the council, the amendment has a one-year time limit to allow 
officials to review the new outdoor sales policy. JENNIFER OLDHAM

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; COMMUTER CONCIERGE PLAN DEVELOPED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A plan to deliver laundry, shoe repair and other services to local offices may 
help keep commuters from using midday errands as an excuse to not take a bus, 
train or car-pool to work. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to reduce traffic and smog levels in Glendale to meet 
requirements of the Clean Air Act, the Glendale Transportation Management Assn. 
has devised a commuter concierge plan. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first phase of the plan, officials will survey the transportation 
group's 20,000 members and Glendale Chamber of Commerce affiliates about 
errands they run during the day that require a car. 
</P>
<P>
 The association will then identify vendors who deliver services that meet the 
respondents' most popular errands and put vendors into a directory. Information 
on these retailers, including prices, will also be available by fax. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan is the first of its kind in Southern California and joins other 
incentives provided by businesses, such as bus pass subsidies and car-pool 
matching services, to get employees out of their cars, said Jeanne Olwin, 
executive director of the Glendale Transportation Management Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 These programs were developed by large businesses in response to mandates from 
the South Coast Air Quality Management District requiring organizations to 
reduce the number of employees who drive to work each day. 
</P>
<P>
 The commuter concierge program -- administered through a grant from the 
California Department of Transportation -- is considered an experimental effort 
by Caltrans officials who hope to expand the plan to other cities, Olwin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chamber of Commerce officials said the grant will let the transportation 
association give commuters a reason to leave their cars and take a bus or 
Metrolink. 
</P>
<P>
 "Southern Californians have depended on their cars for generations -- we hope 
we can demonstrate with this grant that it's not necessary to use our cars 
throughout the day," said Jerry Milner, Glendale chamber vice president.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: 4 SECONDARY SCHOOLS WIN STATE AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Four San Fernando Valley secondary schools were among the 180 winners in the 
1994 California Department of Education's Distinguished Schools Program. 
</P>
<P>
 David Starr Jordan Middle School, John Muir Middle School, and Luther Burbank 
Middle School, all in the Burbank Unified School District, were honored.The 
other winner was Rosemont Middle School in the Glendale Unified School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 Begun in 1985, the Distinguished Schools Program honors outstanding elementary 
and secondary schools in alternate years. 
</P>
<P>
 About 354 secondary schools applied for the 1994 program, and each was visited 
by a county education official.  
</P>
<P>
 Schools were judged on three variables: the ranking of the school's 
application; the ranking of the site visit; and the California Learning 
Assessment System results from 1993 in grades eight and 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the winning schools will be presented with an honorary 
plaque and a California Distinguished School flag in an awards ceremony May 27 
at the Santa Clara Convention Center. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: TOPANGA; LEARN REFORM DIVIDES SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BYRNES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once a nucleus for steadfast parental support and community pride, Topanga 
Elementary School has become instead a focus of controversy. Some parents say 
that the LEARN reform begun last year has fueled frustration, confusion and 
division at the 310-pupil school. 
</P>
<P>
 "LEARN came along and it was too much for everyone -- too much, too soon," 
said Kim Barceloux, who has a fourth-grader at Topanga. "Now that we're into 
it, we have more problems than we ever wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 The LEARN program was implemented at 34 elementary schools in the Los Angeles 
Unified School District last year to give principals, parents and teachers more 
say in how their schools are run.  
</P>
<P>
 But Topanga parents critical of LEARN say the reform program introduced an 
imbroglio of bureaucracy in their school. Once, large unstructured community 
meetings and frequent parent visits to the classrooms and the office were the 
norm. Now, parent Alison O'Fallon said in a letter sent April 21 to the 
school's staff and Leadership Council: "We have meetings to plan meetings."  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if it's a result of LEARN, but in our rush to improve our 
school, we became much more focused on what was negative," said Parent Teacher 
Organization President Marlene Frantz. "We ignored the positive things." 
</P>
<P>
 There has been no response to O'Fallon's letter, and some teachers and the 
school's interim principal insist that the reforms at the school are positive. 
They say any discord is a normal, inevitable growing pain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think anytime you begin a new program, anytime you change the direction of 
the school, you have to work through some difficulties," said Cheryl Mueller, 
the interim principal. "Change is difficult. We don't always get exactly what 
we want." 
</P>
<P>
 The former principal transferred to another school this spring, and the 
Leadership Council is in the process of selecting a new one. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, some parents describe the atmosphere on campus as divisive, 
blaming the bureaucratic structure of LEARN for pitting parents against 
teachers in the struggle to redefine the curriculum.  
</P>
<P>
 A handful of parents say they are thinking of sending their children to 
private schools. Many others lament the changes at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "It tears me apart that I can't say in good conscience what I used to say," 
O'Fallon said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to say that this is the most wonderful school in the world. I can't 
say that anymore." SUSAN BYRNES

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: REED MAKERS WORKING TO A DIFFERENT TUNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM CROGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With cheeks puffed, fingers firmly in place and eyes focused on the notes and 
numbers that filled the white chalkboard in front of them, five members of Rico 
International's top management collectively plunged into a daring version of 
"Mary Had a Little Lamb" on their clarinets. 
</P>
<P>
 It's all part of a new business strategy at this woodwind reed manufacturing 
company in Sun Valley that's based on the premise that if you want better 
music-making reeds, you start by making some music. 
</P>
<P>
 At Rico that idea has taken shape in the form of clarinet lessons for almost 
all its 200 on-site employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We set some strategies last year to refocus our company's efforts to improve 
the overall quality of our reeds," explains Marketing Project Manager George 
Phelps. "One way they're doing that is by taking 180 people here and showing 
them what a reed actually does." 
</P>
<P>
 Phelps, who has been at Rico for two years, is also a professional trumpet 
player. He says he was surprised to learn that many of the production line 
workers didn't know what a reed did or understand the importance its quality 
had to musicians. The company, he says, decided to give everybody six lessons 
to take them through the basics. 
</P>
<P>
 "We taught them how to put a reed in the mouthpiece, how to hold the clarinet 
and how to make a sound come out. I took the clarinet in college so it was like 
a refresher course for me." 
</P>
<P>
 The best part of the experience he says has been to see the change in 
employees as they embarked upon their musical odyssey. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really enjoyed seeing them as they went into the conference room for their 
first lesson," he says. "Some of them looked really nervous but invariably 
those people walked out with the biggest smiles on their faces after they 
discovered they could make a sound on a clarinet." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the worst moments have been listening to them make those few sour 
notes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to do a lot of traveling and over the last month I've come to really 
appreciate those trips." 
</P>
<P>
 One of those first-time clarinet players was Packaging Department Manager 
Maria Guevara, a 17-year Rico veteran. "I really like it. It's really been a 
lot of fun," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Guevara says the experience has inspired her to take clarinet lessons. She 
also believes it's helped the 44 people she supervises on the line. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people didn't think they could do it at first," she says. "But now 
they're really excited and take more care and pride in making the reeds."  
</P>
<P>
 Reeds are made from cane. Rico has cane plantations in France, Argentina and 
California, and, according to company officials, controls about 80% of the 
world's reed market. The company also sells reeds to top wind instrument 
players like Dave Coz, David Sanborn, Kenny G and even has provided special 
Presidential Inauguration reeds to President Clinton, an avid sax player. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Knaub, Rico's manufacturing operations manager, was both a neophyte 
clarinet player and an architect of the lesson strategy. The experience, he 
says, has been both fun and a long-term investment for the company. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe it will pay big dividends down the road for us in terms of employee 
pride and participation in quality control," he said. JIM CROGAN

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS; GROUP VOWS FIGHT OVER UTILITY TAX PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of Agoura Hills residents plans to fight a proposed utility tax as the 
city faces the worst fiscal crisis in its 12-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something that's going to hit our pocketbooks," said Barbara Murphy, 
chairwoman of the loose-knit Citizens Against New Local Taxes. "I'm going to 
oppose this tax until the city makes further expense reductions." 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy and others have recruited dozens of people to testify at public 
hearings Wednesday night and May 25 on the proposed 5% tax on the use of water, 
electricity, gas and telephone service. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax would add $7.50 to bills to households that spend $150 a month on 
utilities. Murphy said based on an informal survey she and several others 
conducted of 20 randomly selected homes, the cost would be more in Agoura 
Hills, where utility bills often are higher. 
</P>
<P>
 According to city figures, the tax would raise $1 million needed to plug a 
projected gap in the budget next fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of state cuts and tax losses, revenues are expected to fall $662,500 
short of the $5.9 million needed to run the city, and another $343,800 short of 
the required insurance and reserve funds in the fiscal year beginning July 1, 
said City Manager Terry Matz. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby cities, including Los Angeles and Calabasas to the east, use utility 
taxes to raise money for services. Westlake Village does not have such a tax, 
but imposes fees for maintaining public landscaped areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Agoura Hills officials have proposed a utility tax before, the idea 
has never reached the public hearing stage. After the hearings, the council may 
consider approving it. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy, who served on the ad hoc Citizen Budget Advisory Committee this year, 
suggested that the city could trim its services -- possibly including the 
Planning Department -- instead of approving a tax. 
</P>
<P>
 "Development has dwindled to a standstill over the past five years," Murphy 
said. "A lot of us on the (committee) didn't know what the planners are doing 
right now." 
</P>
<P>
 But Director of Planning and Community Development Dave Anderson said he and 
his full-time staff of four are as busy as ever with building inspections, code 
enforcement and reviewing ideas for development in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone can't communicate to the city on what they want to build and get 
feedback, there's going to be less likelihood of development occurring," 
Anderson said. "It would be counterproductive to have less staff when we're 
trying to encourage economic development." KURT PITZER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: COUNTY SEEKS BIDS ON BULL CREEK REPAIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM CROGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors announced that bids will be 
accepted starting May 31 on a multimillion-dollar project to repair damage to 
part of the flood control system damaged by the Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The project will repair cracks in the channel floor as well as damage to the 
side slopes at Bull Creek extending from north of San Fernando Mission 
Boulevard to south of Stagg Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "This work is important because Bull Creek is a significant runoff channel 
which diverts water away from the surrounding streets and sends it down to the 
ocean through the countywide flood control system," said Joel Bellman, press 
deputy to Supervisor Ed Edelman. 
</P>
<P>
 Bellman said the county estimates that the project will cost between $2 
million and $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The repair effort will be supervised by the Department of Public Works and 
administered under the Federal and State Disaster Assistance Program. The 
Federal Emergency Management Agency will reimburse the county for a still 
undetermined portion of the costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is definitely one of our biggest repair projects on the flood control 
system resulting from the January quake," public works spokeswoman Donna 
Guyovich said. The affected channel not only handles rainwater but runoff from 
the mountains, and the repairs will significantly reduce the threat of flooding 
to the surrounding area, Guyovich said. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is scheduled to begin in June and take about 75 working days to 
complete, Bellman said. No road closures or special traffic restrictions are 
expected as a result of the project. JIM CROGAN

<P>
 The national champions from the Taft High School Academic Decathlon team are 
being feted again -- this time by the governor. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine students and their coach, Arthur Berchin, are heading to Sacramento 
on May 23 for a daylong series of meetings and events. 
</P>
<P>
 In the morning, the group will be introduced to the Senate and the Assembly. 
Then, after a lunch at Frank Fat's restaurant -- a famous politico's haunt -- 
they are scheduled to meet with Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 The Taft teen-agers earned the school its second first-place title last month 
in Newark, N. J., beating teams from 41 states and the District of Columbia. In 
addition to accumulating the top score in the 10-subject competition, the team 
also claimed more than half of the $30,000 in scholarships awarded to 
individual high scorers. 
</P>
<P>
 In taking the Los Angeles Unified School District title in November and 
claiming the state honors in Stockton in March, the students studied hundreds 
of hours -- working through weekends, late nights and school vacations. 
</P>
<P>
 The students still have one aspiration before they head off to college in the 
fall: They want to meet the President. Last year, they noted, the Taft team 
that won a second-place title was invited to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 "They definitely want to go to see the President," said Judy Combs, the 
executive director of the California Academic Decathlon. 
</P>
<P>
 Competing for Taft were: Daniel Berdichevsky, 17; Chris Huie, 17; Michael 
Michrowski, 17; Sheldon Peregrino, 18; Rebecca Rissman, 17; Andrew Salter, 17; 
Kimberly Shapiro, 16; Stephen haw, 16; and Sage Vaughn, 17. All are seniors 
except Shaw, a junior. 
</P>
<P>
 The group will also be honored next Tuesday by the Woodland Hills Chamber of 
Commerce, which will award each student a $100 savings bond. For more 
information about that 11:30 a.m. luncheon at the Warner Center Marriott, call 
the chamber office at 347-4737. ABIGAIL GOLDMAN

BEILENSON URGES HOUSE PANEL TO ALLOCATE $15 MILLION TO BUY LAND FOR PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Noting that the economic downturn has created buying opportunities, Rep. 
Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) asked a key House panel Wednesday to 
provide at least $15 million next year to purchase land for the Santa Monica 
Mountains National Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson told the Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior and Related 
Agencies that the funds could be used to buy properties along the Backbone 
Trail and in Zuma and Trancas canyons. The subcommittee is the first stop in 
the annual congressional appropriations process. 
</P>
<P>
 If past is prologue, the recreation area will probably receive far less than 
Beilenson requested. President Clinton included $5 million in his budget 
proposal, which may be a more realistic figure amid intense budgetary 
pressures. Clinton had included no funds last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We seldom get as much as we ask for," Beilenson acknowledged moments after 
appearing before the subcommittee's chairman, Rep. Sidney D. Yates (D-Ill.), 
and a table of empty chairs. "We're competing with the rest of the country for 
a small amount." 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson used the same figure recommended by a coalition of 39 environmental 
groups. The park received $4 million last year, considerably less than it had 
received for any fiscal year since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson said the National Park Service would like to acquire 19 properties, 
totaling 500 acres along the Backbone Trail, which are estimated to cost $10 
million. The 43-mile trail traverses the spine of the Santa Monica Mountains 
from Will Rogers State Park to Point Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
 The Park Service has also targeted 20 properties in Zuma and Trancas canyons 
covering 1,300 acres and valued at about $8 million, and about 3,500 acres in 
other areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson once again said that many privately held properties within the 
recreation area are threatened with development and could be lost if not 
acquired soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the same time, however, because of the severity of the economic downturn, 
land prices have declined and many small property owners are eager to sell," he 
added. "Thus, it is likely that each acquisition dollar will go farther than it 
did in earlier years." 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson also made a request for his second pet cause: preservation of the 
endangered African elephant. He asked for $1.2 million to provide assistance to 
African wildlife agencies, organizations and individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 The money would pay for research, conservation and management of the mammoth 
creatures under the African Elephant Conservation Act of 1988. Beilenson said 
this program has been extremely helpful in preserving the species in its native 
habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of African elephants has diminished from 1.5 million a decade ago 
to 400,000.

NO MURDER CHARGES FILED IN BURBANK FATAL SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles County prosecutors have declined to file murder charges against 
two men arrested in connection with the shooting death of an unarmed security 
guard outside a popular nightclub, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Abraham Alvarado, 24, of Pacoima was released Wednesday, two days after he 
learned he was a suspect and turned himself in at the Burbank Police Station, 
said Lt. Larry Cook. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Molina, 21, who had also been arrested on suspicion of murder, remained 
in jail Wednesday for violating the terms of his probation, authorities said. 
Police refused to say why Molina was on probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank police and the district attorney's office said the men were not 
charged with murder because police lacked sufficient evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't rejected the case, we have simply referred it back to the police 
for further investigation," said Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the district 
attorney's office. "The case is still under investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 The men had been arrested in the May 6 shooting of Walter H. Thomas III, 44, a 
security guard at a Stuart Anderson's Black Angus restaurant in downtown 
Burbank. Witnesses told police that Thomas was patrolling the parking lot as 
part of the restaurant's security detail when a man walked up and shot him at 
close range. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman escaped by running up a nearby freeway on-ramp before apparently 
hopping into a waiting car, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook said Alvarado and Molina were among several people who had been thrown 
out of the Black Angus bar before the shooting for fighting with employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Police believe that after the two were ejected, the men returned and shot 
Thomas, Cook said. A coroner's spokesman said Wednesday that Thomas died from a 
single gunshot wound to the groin area.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; MARTIAL ARTS EXPERT PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO 
MURDER CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A martial arts expert pleaded not guilty Wednesday to a charge of murdering a 
female co-worker who was one of the country's top tae kwon do competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Stuart Edward Milburn, 27, faces the death penalty if convicted of strangling 
Veronica Estrada, 29, as she walked along Soledad Canyon Road the night of Dec. 
15.He is in custody without bail at Men's Central Jail in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Milburn has the right to a jury trial within 60 days of Wednesday's 
arraignment, but he will probably waive that privilege so pretrial motions can 
be made by his attorney, Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Foltz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Darryl Mounger, Milburn's attorney, could not be reached Wednesday for 
comment. Pretrial motions will be heard June 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Estrada, who taught 5- to 8-year-olds at Taekwondo USA in Canyon Country, was 
the American Taekwondo Assn.'s top-ranked female competitor in the second-level 
black belt division. Her partially clothed body was discovered hidden in brush 
Dec. 16. Coroner's officials said she died of strangulation, possibly during or 
after a sexual assault. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said they saw Milburn struggling with another person who resembled 
Estrada near the site where her body was later found. However, Mounger has 
argued that there is no physical evidence against his client and that the 
eyewitness accounts are unreliable.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; CITY BACKS RESTRICTIONS ON ALCOHOL SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After more than a year of public review, the City Council has tentatively 
approved a law restricting how and where alcoholic beverages can be sold in 
Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 The law prohibits the sale of alcohol if a business is too close to areas 
described as "sensitive," such as schools, churches, parks and residential 
areas. It also imposes new rules on convenience markets, such as banning the 
sale of alcohol from drive-up windows. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar laws have been adopted in the county and in neighboring Lancaster, and 
some local leaders said Palmdale's alcohol law was overdue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I urge you to adopt the proposed ordinance," Ray Chavira, an Antelope Valley 
resident who serves on the Los Angeles County Commission on Alcoholism, told 
the council Tuesday night. "Now's the time to move. You're going to have lots 
of problems if you don't legislate now." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed law states that the city needs to regulate businesses that sell 
or serve alcohol because they could lead to increased crime problems -- 
including drunk driving -- and have an adverse impact on neighboring sites such 
as parks and schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members approved a first reading of the ordinance Tuesday night in a 
4-0 vote, with Mayor Jim Ledford, who said he had a business conflict, 
abstaining. Ledford said he is negotiating the sale of his interest in a local 
sports bar. 
</P>
<P>
 If the alcohol law is approved during a second vote next month, it will take 
effect 30 days later. It will apply only to alcohol-related businesses that 
seek to open after the law is in place. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new rules, businesses whose primary purpose is to sell alcohol, and 
other outlets that would be too close to schools, churches and other specified 
areas, must obtain a conditional use permit from the city before they can open. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a good start," Councilman David J. Myers said Wednesday. "I 
personally would like to see it be a little tougher. But I think it's important 
to get something on the books." 
</P>
<P>
 Because Lancaster and the county have already enacted such laws, Palmdale 
risked becoming the region's center for alcohol sales if it does not impose its 
own restrictions, Myers said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a year ago, the council instructed its staff to prepare new rules 
for businesses that serve and sell alcohol. The city held a public workshop on 
the issue, and the Planning Commission conducted three public hearings before 
passing a final version of the law on to the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers cautioned that the alcohol sales restrictions were based solely on how 
such businesses affect the city as a whole. "This has to be distinguished from 
any kind of moral statement that alcohol is an evil," he said. "This is simply 
a prudent step to protect the health and safety of Palmdale."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; CITY CONSIDERS NEW SMOKING BAN; SANTA CLARITA: 
PROPOSAL WOULD PROHIBIT LIGHTING UP AT MOST WORKPLACES BUT NOT AT RESTAURANTS 
AND BARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Smoking will be banned at most workplaces but can continue at restaurants and 
bars as long as the establishment's policy is posted for customers, according 
to a newly crafted city ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita City Council members worked out provisions for a new tobacco 
control ordinance Tuesday night and will vote on it at their May 24 session. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed ordinance also bans cigarette vending machines, but allows 
smoking in small businesses operated away from the public and ventilated 
separately from other firms. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed smoking ban is less restrictive than what the council approved in 
December but stubbed out before the law took effect. The earlier version banned 
smoking in all enclosed public areas, except bars that derive only one-fourth 
of their income from food sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't think we have the ability to enforce something that strict," 
said Councilwoman Jo Anne Darcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Ban supporters say people's health is at stake, while opponents say it's a 
question of personal freedoms and that merchants should be able to set their 
own smoking policies.  
</P>
<P>
 Council members have been flooded with data, statistics and arguments from 
advocates on both sides since the issue was raised late last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Some council members said it was hard to sift through conflicting claims, and 
others said they believed the issue was being driven by activists who neither 
live nor work in the Santa Clarita area. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a significant amount of people have lied about this," said Councilman 
Carl Boyer. "I don't think 95% of the people in the valley give a hoot, 
really." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Clyde Smyth called the modified ordinance a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know (about this). I have no idea in the world with the mishmash of 
statistics I have seen," Smyth said. "I haven't done anything to help my 
friends that are bartenders or waitresses, but I think (this ordinance) is 
something I can live with." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor George Pederson opposed the ordinance as written, calling smoking a 
"life-and-death" issue and urging stronger restrictions. He said nonsmoking 
restaurants wouldn't suffer because customers go for good food and service and 
not for their smoking policy. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the ordinance will take effect in mid-July. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita's draft ordinance came one day after the Philip Morris tobacco 
company announced it had enough signatures to create a California ballot 
measure abolishing local smoking bans. 
</P>
<P>
 City leaders were concerned that a stronger ban might trigger costs for Santa 
Clarita businesses, only to then be repealed.

IRVINE CO. MINORITY HOLDING OFFERED FOR SALE; REAL ESTATE: HOWARD P. MARGULEAS 
SEEKS $94 MILLION FOR 5% STAKE. BROKERS SAY SHARES WILL ATTRACT PENSION FUNDS, 
WEALTHY INVESTORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A minority owner in the Irvine Co. has put his shares in the well-known Orange 
County real estate firm up for sale for $94 million as part of a private 
offering that is attracting interest among wealthy investors and major pension 
and trust funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard P. Marguleas, an Irvine Co. director since 1977, wants to sell his 
5.05% stake in the privately held company to meet his other "business 
obligations," according to a confidential stock prospectus distributed to 
select investors and funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Co., which turned a family ranching empire into a sprawling real 
estate giant, is run with an iron hand by billionaire Donald L. Bren, who still 
holds 92% of the company's outstanding shares. This means he elects all board 
directors and controls all aspects of the company's operations and plans. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is known for keeping its finances secret. But the prospectus 
reveals that the Irvine Co.'s assets are worth about $4.1 billion and that it 
has an estimated $1.8 billion in debt. Irvine Co. officials did not review, 
prepare, provide information or confirm the accuracy of the prospectus and its 
numbers.  
</P>
<P>
 At $500,000 a share for Marguleas' stake, ownership of the stock could become 
the ultimate status symbol for affluent Southern California investors. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is as blue chip as you're going to get in the Southern California real 
estate market," said Winston Elton, principal in charge of the real estate 
group with KPMG Peat Marwick, an accounting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not the sort of stock that's going to double or triple (in value) in 
a year," he said. "This is an investment for the long haul -- a piece of the 
rock." 
</P>
<P>
 And it comes at a discount, according to the prospectus. Marguleas, formerly 
chairman of Sun World International, is offering to sell the stock at 19% below 
its estimated value of $617,984 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 But investors would have no voting rights, could not sit in on board meetings 
and, in the short term, would not receive much of a return on their initial 
investment because company pays only a 0.6% dividend. Still, that dividend 
comes to $3,000 a share annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Many wealthy Southern California families and high-profile individuals are 
reportedly interested in the shares as a secure, long-term investment that 
could pay off big-time as development continues, or if the Irvine Co. 
eventually goes public. 
</P>
<P>
 Major county or state pension funds such as the California Public Employees 
Retirement System would also be likely investors, especially if they join 
together to buy shares, several sources said. The Irvine Co. has a total of 
3,722 shares of common stock outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Co. has been the owner and developer of the Irvine Ranch, a vast 
swatch that stretches from the ocean to the mountains along the Riverside 
County line. The company's holdings include two hotels, two golf courses, 
several shopping centers and about 11 million square feet of office and 
industrial space. 
</P>
<P>
 Bren acquired a 35% interest in the Irvine Co. as part of a group that 
purchased it for $337 million from the Irvine family after a wild bidding war 
in 1977.

<P>
 Bren acquired his controlling interest in 1983. Marguleas, as a minority 
shareholder, joined with Bren and other investors in 1977 to purchase the 
company and remained a minority shareholder when Bren purchased controlling 
interest.  
</P>
<P>
 The company's net worth is now estimated at $2.3 billion, up sharply from a 
decade ago. In the late 1980s, after years of litigation by heiress Joan Irvine 
Smith, a judge ruled that, as of 1983, the company's stock value was $1.3 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Bren did not step forward to buy Marguleas' stake or put together an investor 
group to buy the shares. Bren, though, has been in a selling, not buying, mode, 
real estate experts said, pointing to his sale of the company's apartment 
division to the public for nearly $200 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Marguleas is selling his securities through Friend/Danzi Capital Partners, an 
investment banking firm in Irvine. Michael Danzi, the firm's executive 
director, refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 A relatively small brokerage, Friend/Danzi is a division of L.H. Friend, 
Weinress & Frankson Inc., an Irvine investment banking firm with about 40 
employees. The company is expected to allow other local brokers help it sell 
stock to individual investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Some local brokers in town were eagerly anticipating the unique stock deal, 
which some said would go mostly to individual investors and family trust funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's something about being able to say you own a part of the Irvine Co.," 
said Larry Butler, a broker with Cruttenden & Co., an Irvine investment banking 
firm. "There's definitely a certain prestige involved. Not many people can say 
that, and there are some big real estate types around who might not mind 
plunking down $500,000 for a share." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Jeffrey L. Kilpatrick, president of Newport Securities Corp., a Costa 
Mesa brokerage, predicted that most of the shares would be sold to 
institutional investors and other big funds that could hold onto the securities 
long-term. He questioned whether wealthy investors would be eager to buy a 
stake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most investors want to make money. I can't think why anyone would buy shares 
just because it's the Irvine Co.," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Max Hampton, a manager of the Merrill Lynch & Co. brokerage office in Newport 
Beach, said his office had not received any phone calls from interested 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Money managers such as Trust Co. of the West in Los Angeles, with $47.5 
billion in assets under management, also were nonplussed.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is not the type of thing TCW would be interested in," said Alvin R. 
Albe, chief administrative officer with TCW. "I don't think we'd play in 
something like this. You're buying a super minority position in something that 
is very illiquid."

BIOTECH FIRM COUNTING ON GOATS TO BUILD ITS PROTEINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The brave new world of biotechnological engineering moved to the farm this 
month -- via a herd of specially bred goats whose owners say will be capable of 
producing proteins at a tenth of the cost of current methods. 
</P>
<P>
 Genzyme Transgenics Corp., which uses specially produced proteins to make 
prescription drugs and diagnostic products, said last week that it has taken 
possession of a 166-acre farm in western Massachusetts. It said the farm will 
be the first in the United States to be used in the commercial production of 
biotech drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 The special "transgenic" goats have been genetically altered with human genes 
so they can produce human proteins in their milk. The proteins can potentially 
be developed for future treatments for cystic fibrosis, multiple sclerosis, 
cancers and cardiovascular disorders, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 The farm, near the towns of CharltonQ and Spencer, can house as many as 1,000 
goats and will initially employ 10 to 12 people. Only about one-third of the 
goats will be transgenic. The rest will be normal goats placed with the herd 
for breeding and to confuse would-be thieves. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30 transgenic goats in the current herd of 200 goats, imported from New 
Zealand, are insured for $1 million each, the company said. The animals, of the 
Swiss Alpine and Saanen breeds, weigh about 125 pounds and stand 3 feet at the 
shoulder. They will produce milk for seven to 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The goats promise a large cost savings over conventional production methods. A 
Genzyme spokesman said a herd of 125 goats could replace the function of a new 
185,000-square-foot manufacturing plant built at a cost of more than $100 
million by its parent, Genzyme Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The factory in Allston, Mass., requires large, costly bioreactors and cell 
culture machinery to produce and purify the recombinant, or genetically 
engineered, proteins the goats make naturally. 
</P>
<P>
 Normal goats are turned into transgenic goats when genetically engineered 
fragments of DNA are injected into one-cell embryos. The fertilized eggs are 
reintroduced into the mother to produce a transgenic offspring. 
</P>
<P>
 Genzyme Transgenics said it already has produced a protein that is likely to 
be turned into the first transgenic pharmaceutical to move into U.S. human 
clinical trials next year. The protein is human antithrombin III, an 
anti-coagulant used to treat people with a hereditary deficiency of 
antithrombin-III. It said it has had a high success rate producing the protein 
in goat milk.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: FIDELITY REINSTATES ITS HOSTILE BID FOR COSTA MESA'S US 
FACILITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The nation's fifth-largest title insurer said Wednesday that it has 
"reiterated" its $79-million offer to acquire a Costa Mesa insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
 Fidelity National Financial Inc. said that its $15-a-share offer was being 
reinstated after continuing questions about the offer from the target of the 
hostile takeover bid, US Facilities Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, Fidelity continues to seek shareholder votes in an effort to pass a 
resolution at the May 25 annual meeting of US Facilities to put the Costa Mesa 
medical stop-loss, property and casualty insurer up for sale. Fidelity also is 
seeking votes to elect two of its nominees to the board of US Facilities.

PHIL & JIM'S CHAIN GIVES UP ON REORGANIZATION EFFORT; RETAILERS: ELECTRONICS 
DEALER AGREES TO SELL ALL ASSETS. THE NEWS STUNS EX-EMPLOYEES, CUSTOMERS AT 
HEARING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The troubled Phil & Jim's electronics and appliance store chain has agreed to 
sell its remaining assets, ending a three-month bid to reorganize its finances 
under the protection of U.S. Bankruptcy Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement, approved earlier this week by Phil & Jim's three major 
creditors, stunned the dozen or so former employees and customers who were in 
bankruptcy Judge John Wilson's Santa Ana courtroom for a related hearing 
Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The 40-year-old private company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on 
Jan. 13, listing 120,000 creditors, including thousands of customers who had 
purchased extended product warranties. 
</P>
<P>
 Maytag Corp., Whirlpool and General Electric Credit Corp., the retail chain's 
three largest secured creditors, approved the liquidation plan earlier this 
week. The three are owed about $8.7 million. Other creditors, including those 
who purchased warranties, are owed about $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anaheim-based company listed $7.1 million in assets in recent bankruptcy 
filings. Phil & Jim's closed its five remaining stores in January shortly 
before a going-out-of-business sale. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the agreement, Phil & Jim's will abandon its attempted business 
reorganization and start selling its remaining assets by June 7. Wilson told 
creditors that they would likely receive notices of the Chapter 7 liquidation 
within two months. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for Phil & Jim's and the court-appointed creditors committee did not 
appear before Wilson during Wednesday's hearings and did not return telephone 
calls Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear how the agreement between Phil & Jim's and its larger creditors 
will affect an estimated 100 former employees who evidently are owed back wages 
and vacation pay. Employees at Wednesday's hearing also said they were 
concerned about funds the chain supposedly put into their profit-sharing plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess all we can do now is wait," one disgruntled employee said after the 
meeting. The employee, who worked for Phil & Jim's for more than a decade, said 
she's been unable to determine whether she'll recover her portion of the 
company-sponsored profit-sharing plan. Another longtime employee, who also 
asked not to be identified, said she was owed several weeks of back pay and 
vacation compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson told employees that their wage claims ranked high on the priority list 
among creditors.

 Domino's Pizza has moved its western regional office to Santa Ana from Downey. 
</P>
<P>
 "A centralized location in Orange County and favorable leasing arrangements 
were strong factors in our decision to relocate," said John Howard, vice 
president of franchise operations for Domino's. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 employees at the Downey office moved to Santa Ana earlier this month. 
The Domino's western region stretches from San Diego to Seattle and encompasses 
more than 800 outlets.

SHAREHOLDER BANK DISPUTES PSYCHIATRIC CENTER'S 'POISON PILL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES M. GOMEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A New York bank, concerned about the value of its stake in Community 
Psychiatric Centers, wants the company to dump a "poison pill" strategy that 
directors adopted five years ago to discourage unwanted takeover attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 Amalgamated Bank of New York, which owns 2,700 shares of the Laguna 
Hills-based operator of psychiatric hospitals, suggests that the amendment to 
the company's corporate charter was adopted without shareholder approval. 
</P>
<P>
 The provision, called a shareholders rights plan, states that the company has 
the right to acquire two shares of the company stock for the price of one 
whenever an unfriendly takeover is attempted. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank also argues in documents sent to shareholders that poison pill 
strategies generally have proved to have a "negative effect" on the value of 
stock. Besides, the bank asserts, the "company's performance is 
unsatisfactory." It asks shareholders to vote for its proposal to scuttle 
Community Psychiatric's poison pill provision. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same documents, Community Psychiatric urges shareholders to vote down 
the bank's proposal at the company's annual meeting, scheduled for May 19. 
</P>
<P>
 "The board strongly believes that the plan is in the best interests of 
shareholders," the company states. A spokeswoman for Community Psychiatric 
declined to expand on the published statements.

 Historical Reaction: El Pollo Loco, which has its headquarters in Irvine, has 
won applause from historical groups for helping save a landmark building in 
East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The old Federal Bank Building on North Broadway had been scheduled for 
demolition in the late 1980s to make way for a mini-mall.But local community 
groups including the Lincoln Heights Chamber of Commerce helped save the 
building by having it designated as a historic site. 
</P>
<P>
 El Pollo Loco franchisees Juan and Rene Corona, who grew up in the Lincoln 
Heights area, modified the building to make it suitable for a restaurant. But 
the franchisees were able to keep the building's Italian Renaissance 
architecture. 
</P>
<P>
 The Corona family was recognized Wednesday with a Los Angeles Conservancy 
Preservation award.

 Hardware Power: Crown Ace Hardware has moved its neighborhood hardware store 
in Anaheim Hills to a new neighborhood -- the large Anaheim Hills Festival, 
where its neighbors include Target, Mervyn's, Marshalls and Three D Bed and 
Bath. 
</P>
<P>
 Power centers usually don't appeal to hardware store owners, but the Anaheim 
Hills Festival store is proving to be "a great location for us," said Crown Ace 
Hardware President Jeff Schulein."It's equidistant from where we used to be and 
where the Builder's Emporium used to be. It's also larger and it has great 
traffic." 
</P>
<P>
 "Off the top of my head, I can't think of any other hardware stores that are 
in this kind of center," Schulein said. "But in this case, we had a landlord 
who wanted us and we ended up with great visibility."

 Computer City Move: The Computer City store that opened in Garden Grove nearly 
five years ago has been "relocated to an existing, two-story location in Santa 
Ana" near South Coast Plaza, Computer City President Alan Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers who need technical service for products purchased at the Garden 
Grove store are being directed to the chain's Brea store.Bush tied the 
relocation to the fact that "there was tremendous customer overlap between the 
two stores." 
</P>
<P>
 All but two of Computer City's Garden Grove employees have taken jobs at other 
company locations, Bush said, and the chain mailed out 85,000 notices to alert 
customers to the change.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like we're moving out of town," Bush said. "To the contrary, we're 
planning to open our sixth and seventh stores (in Southern California) very 
soon."

 Winners Entertainment Inc.: The provider of video game machines said that a 
West Virginia referendum Tuesday on whether to allow electronic gambling at 
horse racetracks passed by a wide margin. 
</P>
<P>
 In the referendum, 80% of the voters approved the machines, which offer 
electronic versions of keno, blackjack and draw poker. 
</P>
<P>
 Winners Entertainment in San Juan Capistrano has operated video gambling 
machines at the Mountaineer Racetrack & Resort in Hancock County, W.Va., for 
almost four years. But for the past year, it has been fending off efforts to 
have the machines banned from the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The company continued to operate the video gambling machines under a temporary 
court order until voters had a chance to decide the issue.

JUDGE ORDERS LIQUIDATION OF VISION COMMUNICATIONS; COURTS: IRVINE FIRM'S OWNERS 
MUST RETURN THOUSANDS TO INVESTORS, LEAVING LITTLE WITH WHICH TO OPERATE THE 
COMPANY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge has ordered the liquidation of Vision Communications, which 
was selling shares in a Pennsylvania wireless cable system, after an 
investigation by the federal Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Without admitting or denying wrongdoing, William Clemens and Michael Imbesi, 
the owners of Irvine-based Vision Communications, have agreed to desist from 
sales of allegedly illegal securities and from presenting themselves as 
licensed securities dealers, said Judith Starr, assistant chief litigation 
counsel for the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the two men must return $500,000 they removed from the company, 
Starr said, and their personal finances are under further investigation to 
determine whether any additional money should be divided among investors in 
Vision Communications and its Pennsylvania operation, Wilkes-Barre-Scranton 
L.P. 
</P>
<P>
 The latter was ordered liquidated on Tuesday as well, Starr said, by the 
federal district court in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Schiffman, an attorney representing Vision Communications, said a 
settlement was in the best interests of the 300 affected investors. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the settlement, Schiffman said that the two men would return 
$500,000 in fees they collected from the company. He said investors would 
likely be able to recoup all of their investment. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Clemens and Imbesi did not agree with the government's position that 
they were selling unregistered securities but agreed to stop selling shares in 
the Pennsylvania operation and turn the company over to a receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 Vision was negotiating a purchase of license rights to emit television signals 
in the area, Starr said, but construction of an actual system was in its 
infancy. She said the SEC believes that a system could not be built with the 
money left for construction after Clemens and Imbesi had taken out the 
$500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The company did not return telephone calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Starr said about 300 investors, including an undetermined number from Southern 
California, spent an average of $10,000 to $15,000 each on Vision 
Communications' securities. Some of the investors responded to an infomercial 
broadcast in various television markets around the nation, Starr said, which 
then sold the names of respondents to Vision Communications. 
</P>
<P>
 In some instances, Vision sent couriers the same day to pick up checks from 
investors, Starr said, leaving little time for second thoughts.

ENHANCED IMAGING BUYS PPG DIVISION FOR $22 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Enhanced Imaging Technologies Inc. on Wednesday said it has completed a 
$22-million takeover of a biomedical division of a Pittsburgh, Pa., 
conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal with PPG Industries Inc. is expected to boost Enhanced Imaging's 
annual revenue to $175 million, a threefold increase from its current sales of 
$50 million. 
</P>
<P>
 It also makes an international corporation out of Enhanced Imaging, an Irvine 
supplier of medical films, cardiac catheterization lab services and optical 
filters for electronic visual displays. 
</P>
<P>
 PPG's biomedical division has offices, laboratories and equipment in Germany, 
Austria, France, Italy and the United Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
 "This acquisition positions us to become a significant participant in the 
worldwide medical electronics business," chief executive Peter Tong said in a 
prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Enhanced Imaging announced Dec. 22 it had reached a tentative agreement with 
PPG to acquire its biomedical division. That announcement sent the company's 
stock soaring, from $3.37 a share on Dec. 21 to $9.75 a share on Dec. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Enhanced Imaging stock has since fallen. But Tuesday's announcement sent the 
stock sharply up again on heavy volume. Shares closed at $6.50 a share on the 
Nasdaq market on volume of 43,400 shares -- more than six times its three-month 
average -- up $1.25 from Monday's close. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said it is paying for the assets of PPG's biomedical through a 
combination of cash, debt and preferred stock.

MARGULEAS' AGRICULTURAL EMPIRE APPEARS IN TROUBLE; PROFILE: A RATING SERVICE 
SUSPENDS ITS APPROVAL OF SUN WORLD AFTER THREE TOP EXECUTIVES LEAVE THE 
COMPANY, A MAJOR CALIFORNIA FRUIT GROWER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Howard P. Marguleas, the man who is hoping to sell his shares in the Irvine 
Co. for $94 million, had been busily building an agricultural empire with 
aspirations to rival Sunkist or Del Monte. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past two years, his Bakersfield-based Sun World has broadened its reach 
outside of California, with growers in 10 states, Mexico and Chile, and annual 
sales of about $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But Marguleas' empire appears to be troubled. Three key executives have quit 
since 1992 -- the president, a co-founder and, in March, Marguleas himself. He 
left his post as chairman but remains a major owner of the privately held 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people wonder whether Sun World bit off a bit too much," said Mike 
Glynn, editor of The Packer, an agricultural industry newspaper in Kansas City, 
Mo. 
</P>
<P>
 A rating service for agricultural companies, the Red Book, suspended Sun 
World's approval rating recently, pending an investigation. A spokeswoman for 
the Red Book, which is a sister company of The Packer, said the service is 
checking Sun World's references and bill payments after so many leadership 
changes at the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Carl San Maggio, a founder, resigned daily involvement with Sun World in 
December, 1992, though he continues with the company as a partner. Robert 
Igleheart left the president's post at Sun World in May of last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Marguleas, a resident of Rancho Mirage, has formed 19 companies in his 58 
years. Two of these are nonprofit, philanthropic trusts. He currently serves as 
president of 11 companies, mostly agricultural interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Marguleas has served as chairman of the board of the California Chamber of 
Commerce and has been active in Republican circles. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, 1989, he organized a series of parties in Washington surrounding 
the swearing-in of Pete Wilson by President Bush for Wilson's second six-year 
term in the Senate. In 1992, Marguleas served as honorary chairman of the 
reelection campaign for Assemblywoman Tricia Hunter (R-Bonita). 
</P>
<P>
 He owns about $3.4 million worth of agricultural, residential and desert land 
in Riverside, Alameda and Placer counties, according to land records. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, Marguleas sold land in Riverside County to Anthony Vineyards Inc. 
for $614,500, according to county records. 
</P>
<P>
 Marguleas is a prominent name in agriculture. Sun World, under his leadership, 
purchased a rival, Superior Farms, in 1989, making Sun World the top grower of 
table grapes in California. With the purchase, Sun World acquired a huge 
research development facility and a once-patented table grape variety. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking to increase Sun World's market share, he commissioned Israeli 
researchers to develop giant red sweet peppers, winter strawberries and 
tomatoes with a long shelf life. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, he has plant scientists at Israel's Volcani Agricultural Research 
Institute, southeast of Tel Aviv, developing a desert mango -- one that can be 
grown in California instead of imported. 
</P>
<P>
 With the development, Sun World could capture the American mango market. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a race to the market, and getting there first means a lot," Marguleas 
told a Times reporter last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 To heighten its image, Sun World places brand stickers on its patented red 
bell peppers, seedless watermelons and peaches. The company purchased the 
patent on the so-called seedless watermelon -- which actually contains tiny, 
white edible seeds -- and has made the fruit a household commodity in the past 
seven years through intensive marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his agricultural interests, Marguleas serves as president of 
the nonprofit Heart Institute of the Desert Foundation in Rancho Mirage, and as 
president of LSL Biotechnologies Inc. in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Marguleas supported Donald Bren's 1982 bid to become chairman of the Irvine 
Co.'s board because the land development company's image was in trouble. 
Marguleas told a judge that he liked the idea of a local person who would play 
a larger role in company affairs, as opposed to Detroit shopping center magnate 
A. Alfred Taubman, who preceded Bren as chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Max Fisher, a Detroit-based oilman, invited Marguleas to join the investor 
group that bought the company from the Irvine Foundation in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher advised Marguleas to sell his shares to Bren in the winter of 1983, 
Marguleas said during testimony in a court hearing on the value of the company 
prompted by a lawsuit by Joan Irvine Smith. Instead, Marguleas chose to retain 
an ownership position in the company.

WESTERN DIGITAL, RIVAL STOCKS FALL ON 'WAR' REPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shares of computer disk drive maker Western Digital Corp. fell Wednesday along 
with the stocks of other disk driver manufacturers after an analyst predicted 
new price wars in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Western Digital's stock fell $1.50 a share to $13.125 on the New York Stock 
Exchange.The prices of Conner Peripherals Inc., Seagate Technology Corp., 
Quantum Corp. and others also fell after analyst John Rossi of investment bank 
Robertson Stephens & Co. in San Francisco predicted price cuts of 5% to 8% a 
quarter in the coming months. He believes an oversupply of drives may result, 
because many companies are expanding their factories. 
</P>
<P>
 But Robert Blair, spokesman for Irvine-based Western Digital, said the company 
believes its earnings will not suffer dramatically from price cuts over the 
next two quarters. He said the company is comfortable with analysts' 
projections of earnings per share of 63 cents to 73 cents for its fourth 
quarter ending June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still see very good demand," Blair said.  
</P>
<P>
 Rossi's report downgraded ratings of Quantum and Conner but did not review 
Western Digital. In response to Rossi's report, analyst Paul Weinstein at 
investment bank Kidder, Peabody & Co. in New York, issued a report 
contradicting Rossi. He said he expects good sales growth for the coming 
quarters.

MORE PARENTS PACKING UP THE KIDS ON BUSINESS TRIPS; FAMILY: THEY TURN TIME AWAY 
FROM HOME INTO TIME TOGETHER. WHOLE INDUSTRIES HAVE STARTED TO SUPPORT IT.

 Bruce Jenner, the Olympic gold medalist, entrepreneur, sports commentator and 
motivational speaker, has also helped pioneer another image: the road-warrior 
family man. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenner spends about half his time on business trips away from home. His wife, 
Kris, frequently accompanies him and they often take at least one of their 
eight children. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important for them to see what Dad does when he's on the road," he said. 
"It's also good quality time away from the hectic life of a large family." 
</P>
<P>
 Jenner is a high-profile example of a trend that has taken hold among 
professional working couples in the 1990s. A growing number of executives take 
children along on business trips or turn a company function into a long weekend 
of family fun. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, 15% of the roughly 280 million business trips included children, up 
from 12% of the total in 1990, U.S. Travel Data Center statistics show. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more acceptable now and it's increasingly possible," said Janet Tice, 
president of Great Destinations Travel Co. in Durham, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many companies still discourage executives from taking children along 
when they travel for work, whole industries are growing up around the 
presumption that work-and-family travel is here to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 Embassy Suites hotels, for example, has seen a jump in the number of children 
at its facilities during midweek, said Steven Brewster, manager of public 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel chain has opened special child-care facilities for business 
travelers. At the Hotel Lake Buena Vista in Orlando, Fla., the Cool Cats Club 
offers arts and crafts as well as games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Embassy Suites hotel in Philadelphia keeps children busy with a "please 
touch" kiddie museum. 
</P>
<P>
 The same chain's Palm Beach hotel has a "Fat Cat Beach Club" that includes 
arts and crafts, field trips and other supervised activities for children ages 
3 to 15. 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel also offers baby-proofed rooms with outlet covers, rounded edges on 
tables and scald guards for bathtubs, among other features. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started to see that our mostly corporate hotels were all of a sudden full 
of kids, even in midweek," Brewster said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hyatt hotels started to see an increase in children traveling with their 
parents in the late 1980s, said Carrie Reckert, a spokeswoman for the chain. 
</P>
<P>
 So in 1989 the chain inaugurated "Camp Hyatt," which entertains children ages 
3 to 12. In Puerto Rico, children tour a rain forest; in Hawaii, they take hula 
lessons, and in Beaver Creek, Colo., they learn how to pan for gold. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the business trips involving children include an extended weekend, 
Reckert said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, both mothers and fathers are working, so it seems families are forced to 
take shorter but more frequent vacations, which they are combining with 
business trips," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Delta Air Lines also has noticed the trend toward shorter and more frequent 
vacations, said Todd Clay, a spokesman for the airline. The carrier has seen 
more corporations scheduling conventions or company meetings on weekends to 
take advantage of special rates and allow families to go along, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Delta has implemented several all-inclusive packages to make it more 
affordable for executives to take along the family, Clay says. 
</P>
<P>
 Baby-sitting agencies in several cities are geared to helping working adults 
who take along their children. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've seen a continuous, slow growth in the trend," said Judi Merlin, 
president of Atlanta's A Friend of the Family. 
</P>
<P>
 Merlin said her agency, which has been in operation for 10 years, hopes to 
decrease parents' anxiety by offering carefully screened baby-sitters.

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: MEET 'FLABIO,' BEEFY POSTER BOY FOR THE '90S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 FABULOUS FLAB: When the recession walloped the California construction 
industry, heavy-equipment operator Michael Glover of Redondo Beach found 
himself out of work and searching for a new career. 
</P>
<P>
 He has unexpectedly found one in the role of "Flabio," who could be the latest 
male heartthrob. In coming weeks, stores are scheduled to start selling posters 
of Glover -- all 6 feet, 6 inches and 400 pounds of him -- sprawled on his 
stomach on a surf-washed beach, squinting at the camera from under a damp blond 
wig. 
</P>
<P>
 The inspiration, of course, is Fabio, the Italian model whose muscled form and 
flowing blond mane have graced the cover of many a romance novel. 
</P>
<P>
 But Flabio glorifies a different body type, the American male approaching 
middle age with a few (in some cases, more than a few) extra pounds around his 
middle. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric States, 34, of Santa Barbara, created the parody poster. He traces the 
inspiration for Flabio to the day he emerged from the shower and teasingly 
asked his wife to evaluate his physique: "Fabio? . . . Flabio?" The chance 
remark led to plans for a poster. When States put out a casting call, he 
discovered Glover, whom he says has "the perfect body, the perfect face." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon Glover found himself lying on a beach near Santa Barbara, posing for the 
poster that could make his career. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, interest is keen. CNN has already carried a report on Flabio and 
People Magazine is supposed to take photos this week. Plans are under way for a 
1995 Flabio calendar. 
</P>
<P>
 Glover is not bothered at the prospect of his body image pinned to walls coast 
to coast. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of a kick. And when I wear the wig, it doesn't look like me at 
all," said Glover, 37, a South Bay native and the father of two. 
</P>
<P>
 Glover hopes his Flabio role will help him achieve his career goal of becoming 
a character actor. In the meantime, he simply hopes it will assist in paying 
the bills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never been ashamed of being big," Glover said. "That poster, it 
represents the mainstream of America."

 SITE SELECTION: Marymount College has expressed interest in buying Northrop 
Corp.'s old research and design center on Crest Road in Rolling Hills Estates, 
but it may be too late. 
</P>
<P>
 The college has little room to expand its dorms, library and other facilities, 
and has been looking for additional space nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Northrop site may fit the bill, the college has yet to submit a 
formal offer, Marymount President Thomas McFadden said. And it would be at 
least two years before the school could move to a new site, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, another unidentified buyer has made an offer on the property, which 
Northrop is considering. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone else is further along," said Michael L. Condon, vice president at the 
Seeley Co. in Torrance, which is marketing the site for Northrop. "We're 
doggone close."

 BEAUTIFUL DOWNTOWN SAN PEDRO: Jay Leno has the Los Angeles skyline. Johnny 
Carson had the sparkling lights of the San Fernando Valley. David Letterman has 
. . . San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk-show host Letterman began a week of tapings in Los Angeles on Monday, 
broadcasting from a new set in Studio 36 at CBS Television City. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, he sits at a desk in front of a mock-up of the New York skyline, 
with an occasional "blimp" floating by for laughs. Here he sits in front of a 
quaint coastal town, or, as he put it Monday night, "Many of you will recognize 
the port community of San Pedro." 
</P>
<P>
 Then: "Oh my gosh, look! It's the Queen Mary!" And a tiny model of the luxury 
liner proceeds to steam into port, complete with horn and tropical sound 
effects. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Queen Mary is out of mothballs now," Letterman said. "It's no longer a 
museum and hotel. It's running every day between San Pedro and Catalina 
Island." 
</P>
<P>
 (In fact, the Queen Mary remains a museum and hotel permanently berthed in 
Long Beach Harbor.) 
</P>
<P>
 And the depiction of a San Pedro carved by bays and inlets, though charming, 
is not geographically correct. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokespersons for the show could not explain why Letterman chose San Pedro 
instead of, say, El Segundo. QUOTE OF THE WEEK 
</P>
<P>
 "(Many of) our youngsters, somewhere along the line . . . have missed being 
able to discuss anything, any kind of differences, without coming to verbal or 
physical confrontation." 
</P>

MASTA ACE FINDS TWO HITS IN ONE; POP MUSIC: THE RAPPER'S 'BORN TO ROLL' IS A 
REMIXED VERSION OF HIS UNDERGROUND HIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rapper Masta Ace's hit single "Born to Roll" and his "Jeep A . . . N . . . ," 
an underground hit about a year ago, have just a little thing in common. They 
are the same song. Just remixed, retitled and cleaned up. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people still don't realize that," explains the veteran New York 
rapper. "It created some confusion at first." 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly in Houston, where the unreleased "Born to Roll" first caught on 
at the end of last year. Some fans bought the album, "Slaughtahouse," by his 
group, Masta Ace Incorporated, and were irked to find it didn't include "Born 
to Roll." 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people took it back," Masta Ace says. "We didn't add 'Born to Roll' at 
first because we didn't think it was necessary. Nobody had any idea the single 
would take off like it did." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, though, most of the original copies of the album, on Delicious Vinyl/East 
West, have been removed from stores, in favor of a new version with "Born to 
Roll" tacked on as the final track. 
</P>
<P>
 "Born to Roll" was originally just a studio experiment. "We had no plans to 
put it out as a single," Masta Ace says. "I was just doing a remix of 'Jeep,' 
trying different things just for the fun of it. But I came up with something 
that the label thought was good enough to put on the market." 
</P>
<P>
 In creating "Born to Roll," he changed the hooks, made the instrumental track 
more streamlined and bass-heavy, keeping nearly all the lyrics -- but leaving 
out the four-letter words. The new version has a different feel, more playful 
and less ominous, emphasizing the joys of cruising rather than the hazards of 
hanging out in the 'hood. Actually, unless you know the lyrics, you wouldn't 
even associate the two versions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The remix was so striking that the label put it out as the B-side to the 
single "Slaughtahouse" -- the third single from the year-old album. "When 'Born 
to Roll' came out, DJs immediately picked up on it," recalls Mike Ross, 
president and co-owner of Delicious Vinyl Records. "They started playing it 
instead of 'Slaughtahouse.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Changing the title was important too. "With the original title, which includes 
words some people don't like, some stations wouldn't play the single," Ross 
says. "They heard that title and thought it was a gangsta cut. The title was 
fine for underground acceptance but not for radio acceptance. But 'Born to 
Roll' worked for radio. That's not why he did the remix -- it just turned out 
that way." 
</P>
<P>
 A Brooklynite whose real name is Duval Clear, Masta Ace, now in his late 20s, 
turned on to rap when he was in junior high. Even a college education -- 
majoring in marketing at the University of Rhode Island -- didn't cure him of 
his yen for a rap career. By the late '80s, he had become a big name in East 
Coast rap. But a record deal with Cold Chillun Records, when he was known as 
Master Ace, only resulted in one album that made no noise outside the East 
Coast underground. In 1991, he switched to Delicious Vinyl Records. 
</P>
<P>
 "We signed him because he's a very talented rapper who never quite had the 
exposure and the push he needed," Ross says. "We thought he had the tools to 
become more than just a big underground rapper." 
</P>
<P>
 Masta Ace has a dual signature. One part is his slick, smooth-flowing rapping 
style and the other is his tendency to emphasize the positive side of the black 
experience. Like many East Coast rappers, he steers clear of gangsta rap. In 
fact, the sum of the "Slaughtahouse" album is a stinging satire on that 
violent, X-rated, female-bashing genre. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't buy into that whole gangsta thing -- talking about guns and shooting 
people and disrespecting women," Masta Ace says. "Some of that is on my album, 
but it's clearly a parody of gangsta. I'm pointing out how stupid it all is, 
using these characters, MC Negro and the Ignorant MCs. I can appreciate the 
music and the techniques of gangsta rap but not the content." 
</P>
<P>
 He hopes, he says, "to show fans that you can still be a male rapper and be 
popular and not have to play that gangsta-rap game."

TAKING 'MILLION TO JUAN' SHOT; PAUL RODRIGUEZ MAKES A STAR-PACKED FILM WITH 
JUST $500,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEILA COBO-HANLON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All Paul Rodriguez wanted was a little respect. So when he was given a mere 
$500,000 to make his directorial debut, with a movie that conventional wisdom 
said at best should have been a TV film, he turned it around into a nationwide 
theatrical release with a star-studded cast. 
</P>
<P>
 "The budget was so low, it was probably barely enough to cater a Steven Seagal 
movie," said the Chicano actor and comedian, who is probably best known for his 
roles in the series "a.k.a. Pablo" and the feature "Born in East L.A." But it 
was enough to shoot "A Million to Juan," which opens Friday, in less than 30 
days, without permits (no budget for those), behind the union's back and under 
the pouring rain of L.A.'s 1993 flood season. 
</P>
<P>
 The surreal quality of the production mimics the story line of the script, a 
modern-day adaptation of Mark Twain's short story "The Million Pound 
Bank-Note." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez stars as Juan Lopez, a down-and-out immigrant in East L.A. trying to 
make ends meet to provide for his 8-year-old son Alejandro (Jonathan Hernandez) 
and his cousins Jorge (Tony Plana) and Alvaro (Bert Rosario). In between jobs 
-- you guessed it, gardener, cook, dishwasher -- Juan tries in vain to get his 
green card with the help of his Immigration and Naturalization Service case 
worker, Olivia (Polly Draper). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 His luck changes -- or seems to -- one day while he is selling oranges on a 
street corner. A white limo pulls up and a stranger (Edward James Olmos) hands 
him an envelope containing a million-dollar cashier's check made out to Juan, a 
sum that the mysterious stranger says is a loan for one month. The 
other-worldliness of the benefactor, an earthbound angel dressed in white, 
gives the film a hint of Latino mysticism. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan discovers that while the money does open some doors, other things -- like 
love and family -- respond in far more complicated ways. Along the way, the 
viewer is treated to a sweet-natured, family-values-affirming glimpse at a 
community all too rarely portrayed on-screen, with a tongue-in-cheek humor that 
it owes at least in part to its source story. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too silly to be a cliche; it winks at the audience too much," says 
Draper, who as one of the film's two white characters (David Rasche as her 
condescending yuppie boyfriend is the other) plays the INS agent who befriends 
and is eventually, and reluctantly, romantically attracted to Juan. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez, who conceived the story and the characters (the script was written 
by Francisca Matos and husband Robert Grasmere), is the first to admit the 
film's low-key ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing about this movie to be taken too seriously," he says. 
Initially, he adds, "it was an opportunity for me to find out if I could 
direct. If it failed, it could have been a video in Bolivia or somewhere, and 
at the same time, I would have garnered experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Directing is something Rodriguez, 39, has wanted to do for a long time. Known 
mainly as an actor and former host of "The Paul Rodriguez Show" and considered 
one of the premier Latino stand-up comedians, Rodriguez says he is ready to 
step out of the limelight.  
</P>
<P>
 "For the past two years I've been looking for something I can do after my 
youth is gone," he explains. "I don't want to be a 50-year-old working the 
lounge at Vegas with outdated jokes." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez has in fact produced specials for HBO and CBS and is currently 
executive producer of "Loco Slam," a Latino version of "Def Jam" for HBO. His 
crack at directing came in 1992, when Crystal Sky Communications approached 
Olivia Ayala, then senior vice president of Jeff Wald Entertainment (Wald is 
Rodriguez's manager and partner in I Was Framed Productions), and told her 
about a project to adapt 12 Mark Twain short stories using first-time 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
 "They asked me if Paul would be interested, and we decided to pursue it," she 
said. "It was adapted through Paul Rodriguez's eyes: an immigrant trying to 
make it with a child. He made the story come to life." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez thinks having what he calls "the most prominent Latino cast ever 
assembled" (Ruben Blades, Liz Torres and Evelina Fernandez are also featured) 
had something to do with the decision to take the project theatrical rather 
than video. "Once they saw the stars, they saw dollar signs," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was very little money involved in getting them. "These people worked 
for scale. I called upon all my friends and reminded them that every time they 
had asked me to be in one of their functions, parties or quinceaneras I had 
been there and would continue to be there. 
</P>
<P>
 "So," he adds straight-faced, "after this movie is out I'm booked: I'm going 
to host parties, I'll be sweeping floors and I'll be waxing Cheech Marin's 
car." 
</P>
<P>
 Debts to Twain aside, the story is really Rodriguez's. The Mexican-born son of 
migrant farm workers, Rodriguez spent his childhood moving from state to state, 
picking dates, tomatoes, oranges and apples. Because of the family's nomadic 
lifestyle, none of the Rodriguez children graduated from high school (Rodriguez 
later took an equivalency exam). The family was desperately poor but deeply 
religious. In "Million," the character of Mrs. Gonzales (Evelina Fernandez), 
surrounded by candles and icons, is partly a reflection of Rodriguez's mother, 
a devoted Catholic who always lit votive candles in her home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would always say: 'Why are you thanking God, Ma? We don't have nothing,' " 
says Rodriguez. "But at least we were alive. That's in my movie, and that came 
out of my mom's dialogue." The character of the indecisive Juan is modeled 
after one of Rodriguez's uncles who is "a very funny man, illegal, and always 
getting arrested by immigration," says Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether "Million," which is being distributed by Samuel Goldwyn, turns out to 
be "too Latin" for the mainstream doesn't worry Rodriguez. "Do you think they 
cared about me when they made 'Yentl' or 'Poetic Justice'?" he asks. "My movies 
will always be of Hispanic themes."

 Vassily Sinaisky, music director of the Moscow Philharmonic since 1991, will 
conduct all concerts on the tour. 
</P>
<P>
 The Texas-born Cliburn, took a hiatus from playing from 1978 to 1987, and last 
played in Southern California 16 years ago. Here he will perform two piano 
concertos with which he has been long associated -- Tchaikovsky's No. 1 and 
Rachmaninoff's No. 3 -- with the Russian orchestra at all tour stops. These are 
the concertos with which Cliburn won the First International Tchaikovsky 
Competition in Moscow, in 1958, and which he recorded with the Moscow orchestra 
soon after. 
</P>
<P>
 The program for the concerts will also include Cliburn playing the 
"Star-Spangled Banner" followed by his narrating Copland's "A Lincoln 
Portrait." 
</P>
<P>
 The tour cities include San Diego (July 9), Dallas (July 15), Denver (July 
23), Saratoga, N.Y. (July 29), Boston (July 31), New York City (Aug. 2), 
Detroit (Aug. 12) and Atlanta (Aug. 20). Other tour stops will be announced, 
the management said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coincidentally, Cliburn will note his 60th birthday, July 12, the day after 
his Bowl appearance. The Texan first played at the Hollywood Bowl in 1958, soon 
after winning the Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow. The 1994 concert will be 
his 11th performance in Cahuenga Pass. In 1962, Cliburn founded an 
International Piano Competition in Fort Worth; in the 32 years since, that 
competition has become an important event in the world of piano playing. 
</P>
<P>
 Conductor Sinaisky was, at the time of Cliburn's internationally publicized 
gold-medal win in 1958, assistant conductor to Kiril Kondrashin with the Moscow 
Philharmonic. The orchestra played at the finals of the Tchaikovsky 
Competition, and Kondrashin and the ensemble later made a number of recordings 
with the American pianist. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1951, the Moscow Philharmonic has visited the United States 
regularly since then. It last appeared locally at the Orange County Performing 
Arts Center in April, 1992.

TV REVIEW; 'ATLANTIC': GOOD PRIMER, BUT AN INCOMPLETE STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Without providing any startlingly new information, "The Atlantic Records 
Story" humanizes the names that dominate the early rock 'n' roll record books. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmet Ertegun -- a Turkish diplomat's son whose vision of America was embodied 
in its black music -- might have evolved into the quintessential music mogul, 
but at the dawn, he and Herb Abramson and Jerry Wexler were the '50s 
counterparts of today's independent "alternative rock" label visionaries -- 
scrappy hipsters immersed in the music and devoted to documenting a 
subculture's expression. 
</P>
<P>
 In their case, things took an unexpected twist when their records suddenly 
became big hits, helping change the face of American popular music. The 
two-hour program details this de-ghettoizing of black music and offers a good 
primer on the development of soul music. 
</P>
<P>
 It's all presented without a lot of flair -- the show's style reflects little 
of the dynamic spirit of the music it's covering. It's also an uncritical, 
strictly in-house perspective, lacking comment from any outside observers and 
avoiding any sticky issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlantic is regarded as a relatively upright operation, but the charges of 
slow royalty payments to its early artists and the label's '80s descent into 
artistic blandness (only recently reversed) should be part of the story too. 
</P>
<P>
 What energy the show has comes from the bounty of vintage performance footage. 
If you needed any reminders of Atlantic's significance, just drink in this 
parade of irreplaceable artists -- from Ray Charles to Cream, Bobby Darin to 
the Stones, the Drifters to Buffalo Springfield, Aretha Franklin to Led 
Zeppelin, John Coltrane to . . . well, as Ertegun tells it, if he'd had another 
$20,000 in his pocket in '55, he would have had Elvis too. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Atlantic Records Story" airs at 6 and 10 tonight on the A&E Network.

DESIGNING WOMEN; ARCHITECTURE: AN EXHIBIT OF THE WORK OF FEMALE INTERIOR 
DESIGNERS POINTS TO THEIR LONGSTANDING ABSENCE FROM THE FOREFRONT OF THE 
PROFESSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT SHIBUYA BROWN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 32 black steamer trunks, measuring seven feet high -- and eight feet wide 
when the doors are open -- hold the works of a generation of women who, for the 
most part, were denied rightful opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 Packed with the creations of the nation's leading women interior designers, 
these imposing chromed suitcases symbolize the longstanding absence of women 
from U.S. architecture as well as their consequent emergence in the forefront 
of the interior design profession. 
</P>
<P>
 The trunks constitute the current "Women of Design" exhibit, which originated 
at the Cooper Hewitt Museum in New York City and will open to the public Friday 
through Sunday at Sony Entertainment Pictures in Culver City. The exhibit 
showcases the contributions of women to architecture and design, achievements 
that were either overshadowed by those of male designers, or outright 
neglected. 
</P>
<P>
 In a bit of unintended irony, "Women of Design" has been planned to coincide 
with the national convention of the American Institute of Architects, the very 
group of professionals that many women say has been slow in rectifying 
longstanding gender inequities. Indeed, A. Josephine Carmen, a West Hollywood 
architect and designer who designed a trunk with her business partner, Clare 
Igonda, recalled that as recently as 20 years ago, women were not made to feel 
welcome in many schools of architecture nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Professors would say, 'This is very bad of you, you're just taking the place 
of a man,' " Carmen said. " 'You'll go out and get married in a few years, 
anyway.' " 
</P>
<P>
 According to "Women of Design," the book that inspired the exhibit, women by 
1991 constituted only 9% of total AIA membership, and even that amounted to a 
twelvefold increase in membership from 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 It was because they were not taken seriously as future architects that many 
women leaving architecture school were relegated to designing the insides of 
homes and buildings, normally a job left to interior decorators. But whether by 
necessity or choice, once these formally trained women began producing 
interiors, innovation and acceptance followed. Today, interior design is 
recognized as a profession distinct from interior decoration in 19 states. And 
increasingly, men are taking a second look at the challenges of designing 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a long way from being just a decorator and choosing paint color," said 
Beverly Russell, author of "Women of Design," who says that fully half of the 
women profiled in her book -- and who are spotlighted in the exhibit -- are the 
products of architecture and design schools. "The inside of the building is 
where the people actually are." 
</P>
<P>
 The motifs of the various trunks in the exhibit run the gamut from functional 
to stylish to whimsical. Some are personal statements, some are straightforward 
examples of designers' work, and some are philosophical inquiries into the 
nature of design. The idea of enclosing projects in the enormous steamers came 
from the exhibit's chief sponsor, the Michigan-based Steelcase Design 
Partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to give them the opportunity to design the interior of something," 
said Georgia Everse, marketing and communications manager for Steelcase Design, 
"and since it was a traveling show . . . well, the idea of the steamer trunk 
fit."  
</P>
<P>
 Since the exhibit's opening at the Cooper Hewitt Museum, the trunks have also 
been displayed at the National Building Museum in Washington, the Chicago 
Athenaeum and the Cultural Design Center in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, we're still in competition," said Carmen, who added that with 
increased recognition, the issue of architectural opportunities for women may 
become moot in the near future. "I'm going to be fascinated by the next 
generation." 
</P>
<P>
 "Women of Design" is open to the public Friday through Sunday at Sony Pictures 
Entertainment, 10202 W. Washington Blvd., Culver City. Hours are Friday, 7 to 
10 p.m.; Saturday, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.; Sunday, noon to 4 p.m. Admission is free, 
although donations will be accepted for women's and children's programs at the 
Union Rescue Mission.

CANDIDATE THREATENS TO SUE OVER LETTER ALLEGING SHADY BUSINESS DEALINGS; 
POLITICS: GOP RACE FOR 36TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT ESCALATES AS RON FLORANCE 
ACCUSES SUSAN BROOKS OF TRYING TO DECEIVE VOTERS ABOUT HIS PAST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A letter accusing candidate Ron Florance of having a tainted business 
background has escalated a bitter war of words in the Republican primary race 
for the 36th Congressional District held by Marina del Rey Democrat Jane 
Harman. 
</P>
<P>
 Florance, a former Palos Verdes Estates councilman, threatened to sue Rancho 
Palos Verdes Councilwoman Susan Brooks after she mailed the letter to members 
of the South Bay Young Republicans in April. The action led to a heated meeting 
between the Florance camp and Brooks' husband, Jim Brooks, an adviser to her 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are trying to run a deceptive campaign," Allan Hoffenblum, one of 
Florance's campaign consultants, told Jim Brooks at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 A potentially fractured party could result when the winner of the primary 
faces Harman in the November general election, Hoffenblum said. The district is 
split almost evenly between Democrats and Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brooks' campaign argues that Florance's financial background is relevant. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what a primary is all about," Jim Brooks said. "It's a shakedown to 
determine who is the fittest to go against Jane Harman." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent press releases, Brooks charged that Florance, who owned Carriage 
Realty on the Palos Verdes Peninsula from 1982 to 1988, has been named in more 
than 40 lawsuits in the last nine years. 
</P>
<P>
 But Florance said that only one of the lawsuits went to trial, and he 
prevailed. Many of the lawsuits, he said, were claims against Carriage Realty 
after a 1984 state Court of Appeal ruling that held real estate brokers 
responsible for disclosing all facts affecting property sales. 
</P>
<P>
 The court ruling exposed Carriage and other firms to a flood of frivolous 
suits, Florance said, and many claims were thrown out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been named in cases involving divorce, suicide," he said. "It was so 
ludicrous, so crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Brooks campaign has also pointed out that Florance is still entangled 
in litigation involving the Wallace Ranch development, an uncompleted tract of 
85 luxury homes that were to be built in the late 1980s on a 24.1-acre site at 
Armaga Spring and Highridge roads in Rancho Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
 If Florance has to testify in a trial scheduled for October, Brooks said, he 
would be a weak opponent against Harman with the November general election just 
around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
 In the lawsuit, Florance and two partners are seeking at least $900,000 from 
Peninsula Wallace Partners, the company to whom they sold the Wallace Ranch 
development in 1988. Florance said that at the time of the sale, the buyers 
agreed to take responsibility for a disputed contract with Coast Construction 
Co. of Brea. 
</P>
<P>
 Coast, which was to have been the general contractor, was dropped from the 
project in 1988, and sought to recover more than $3 million in damages. 
Peninsula Wallace Partners, which includes developer Ed Miller and the Japanese 
bank Mitsui Fudosan, refused to settle the dispute, and Coast sought to recover 
damages from Florance and his partners. 
</P>
<P>
 Florance and his partners settled with Coast for $900,000 in September, but 
then sued Peninsula Wallace Partners. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue is they knew full well about the controversy over the contract," 
Florance said. "We pointed that out to them. . . . They assumed responsibility 
for the contract." 
</P>
<P>
 Florance said that the Brooks campaign has been relying on "bum research" to 
hang a shady business background on him. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's the shady real estate deal in all of this?" Florance asked. "This is a 
desperate act. It is not right."

TWO ARRESTED FOR SLEEPING IN PALISADES PARK UNDER NEW BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Palisades Park is now closed at night to everyone -- including the transients 
who had previously been allowed to sleep there. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendation to completely close the park was made by Santa Monica 
Police Chief James T. Butts after a nearly monthlong sting operation resulted 
in the arrests of 180 drug dealers and users. About 40% of those arrested were 
transients, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday was the first night of the closure. Since then, two transients who 
refused to leave were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council recently made way for the closure by removing an exemption 
from a law that requires the parks to be closed from midnight to 5 a.m. Under 
the exemption, people who were asleep in a city park were allowed to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 But even though the exemption was removed, enforcement had not been expected 
until the city opens a shelter it plans to build for about 100 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Butts said it makes sense to close the park immediately because the sweep had 
cleared it of drug dealers -- and dealers tend to return when the heat is off. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the council approved a site for the new shelter -- 505 Olympic 
Blvd. -- and waived standard bidding practices to get in operation as soon as 
possible. It will cost $390,000 in start-up costs and $365,000 a year to 
operate the facility, which will offer a program to help homeless people get 
off the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our intention is not just to provide three hots and a cot," said Robert Rudd 
of the Salvation Army, which will run the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Robert T. Holbrook voted against the shelter project, calling it 
too expensive in light of the amounts the city already spends for social 
services. Councilwoman Asha Greenberg abstained. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeless advocates who testified Tuesday were also opposed to the shelter. Ron 
Taylor said the shelter is a bad idea because it will allow the city to take a 
harder line with homeless people who do not use it. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the decision to close Palisades Park, dozens of homeless people 
have relocated to the City Hall area.

TOPICS / THEATER; ACTORS CO-OP HAS A PASSION FOR THE POSITIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Right away, there are some things you should know about the Actors Co-op: It 
is a company composed of Christian actors. It is based at a Hollywood church. 
But it doesn't focus on "Christian" material. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a fact that we are the first and only Christian company that's 
sanctioned under Actors Equity," said Co-op producing director David Schall. 
The group's Christianity is "not something that we hide, or that we're ashamed 
of. It's where we get our sense of peace, focus and direction. There's a 
strength and unity when people of like minds come together." 
</P>
<P>
 But in the same breath, the actor continued: "We don't have a (political) 
agenda, and we don't need to clobber audiences with a message. Our passion is 
to produce high-quality theater that celebrates positive aspects of humanity -- 
and explore themes of sacrifice, redemption, hope and healing." 
</P>
<P>
 In that spirit, the company is undertaking its largest challenge yet, a 
16-member revival of Stephen Sondheim's and James Lapine's 1986 musical, "Into 
the Woods," which opened Friday at the Crossley Theatre on the grounds of the 
Hollywood Presbyterian Church. 
</P>
<P>
 "The piece pulls together a group of fairy tales: 'Cinderella,' 'Jack and the 
Beanstalk,' 'Rapunzel' and 'Little Red Riding Hood,' " explained "Woods" 
director and Actors Co-op artistic director Robin Strand ("Becoming Memories," 
"Gifts of the Magi," "Edith Stein"). "The baker and his wife -- that's a story 
made up by Sondheim -- have to overcome a spell that's been put on them. To do 
that, they need Jack's cow, Little Red Riding Hood's cape, the golden slipper 
of Cinderella . . .  
</P>
<P>
 " 'Into the Woods' is a metaphor for going for adventure," Strand said. "It 
starts with Cinderella's words, 'I wish.' She wants to go to the ball, Jack 
wants the gold, the baker and his wife want a child. At the end of the first 
act, they have attained all these things, but in the second act we find that 
they're not happy -- and they're back into the woods for a deeper, darker 
learning experience. It's finding reality, rather than living happily ever 
after. The story is resolved with a new sense of community and tolerance." 
</P>
<P>
 Not your typical church group theater fare. But then, this is not your typical 
church group. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In five years, the Actors Co-op has built a solid reputation with such 
well-received productions as "The Traveling Lady," "1918," "See How They Run" 
and the recent "Pack of Lies" -- material with little or no religious content. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, they stage annual Christmas shows, and their first two 
productions, "Svoboda" and "A Peculiar People," dealt heavily with Christian 
themes. Now into its second subscription season, "we got to a place," Schall 
said, "where we had to ask, 'Who are we?' 'What is our contract with the 
audience?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Working out of the church, however, which offers the group free rent and 
electricity, means certain limitations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of where we're located, we're very conscious of content and language. 
So, no, you won't see us doing a (David) Mamet play." 
</P>
<P>
 Schall, who is also producing "Woods," is on the church's eight-member Drama 
Committee, which can reject play choices. 
</P>
<P>
 The group also runs Co-op, Too!, an in-house workshop arena for more 
experimental theater. The company's ministry, Heart to Heart, performs at local 
juvenile facilities and convalescent homes. And a new year-round acting academy 
provides classes for junior high and high school-age students. 
</P>
<P>
 The group, now 60 dues-paying members strong, started out with 12 professional 
actors in 1987 "to create a support group -- professionally, emotionally and 
spiritually," said Schall, who had recently relocated from New York. "Since the 
business can be devastating, it was our aim to provide a safe place for actors. 
A few of us knew each other. The point of reference was Hollywood Presbyterian 
Church, which has (for a) long time been a place for industry people who are 
Christians." 
</P>
<P>
 As the group's membership began to grow, the church offered it a 550-seat 
space, but that was too large. Eventually, they found a home in the church's 
Crossley Room, a 120-seat area that was being used for weekly Bible study 
classes. The theater was remodeled, with 95 seats reupholstered and 
reconfigured. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did all the physical labor," Schall said proudly. "And finally, in the 
last couple of years, we've been breaking even -- and making a tiny, tiny 
profit." 
</P>
<P>
 "Into the Woods" plays Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays at 8 p.m. and Sundays 
at 2:30 p.m. through June 19 at the Crossley Theatre, 1760 N. Gower St., 
Hollywood. Parking is free. For ticket information: (213) 964-3586.

COMMUNITY NEWS: BEVERLY HILLS; EX-SCHOOL EMPLOYEE'S SUIT ALLEGES BIAS AND 
HARASSMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A former employee of the Beverly Hills Unified School District has filed a 
lawsuit alleging racial discrimination and harassment by the district and 
sexual harassment by a school board member. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit was filed May 2 in Los Angeles Superior Court, by Janeese M. Bland, a 
former secretarial assistant in the personnel department. She seeks $375,000 in 
lost pay and damages and unspecified punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has denied the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Phillip Harris "categorically denied" Bland's charges. "I've 
always acted in the best interest of the school district and I will continue to 
do so," he said. Harris declined to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
 Bland, an African American, had worked for the district less than six months 
when she was dismissed April 23, 1993. The district said Bland was fired for 
poor job performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Bland alleged her dismissal resulted from her complaints to Supt. Sol Levine 
that her supervisor, personnel director Ray Cutten, subjected her to "racial 
harassment . . . in the form of racial slurs about blacks and Mexican Americans 
in general, and racial comments about specific minority employees who worked 
for the district." 
</P>
<P>
 Bland said Cutten gave her poor performance evaluations and criticized her 
work habits after her complaints to Levine. Cutten finally ordered her to 
resign or face dismissal, the complaint states. 
</P>
<P>
 Levine is out of town and could not be reached for comment. Cutten and Eric 
Bathen, attorney for the school district, did not return telephone calls.  
</P>
<P>
 The district has denied the allegations since they were first raised last year 
in Bland's complaint with the state Department of Fair Employment and Housing. 
</P>
<P>
 The department investigated until January, when Bland asked that the 
investigation be closed because she was filing a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never observed any conduct, nor has it ever been reported to me, that 
the named employees practiced racial discrimination or harassment of those kind 
expressed in the complaint, or of any kind," said board President Lillian 
Raffel. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerning the sexual harassment complaint against Harris, Raffel said he 
would "have to speak for himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Bland said Harris made improper advances toward her last spring after she 
invited him to her apartment to discuss the racial complaints. She contends 
Harris made sexually offensive remarks, attempted to gain sexual favors and 
partially disrobed. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris, a board member since 1991, said he visited Bland but denied sexually 
harassing her. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris' attorney, Mark Terman, said Harris plans to reiterate his request that 
the board pay for his defense. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, when the fair employment and housing complaint was pending, the 
board voted not to pay Harris' legal expenses, despite his contention that he 
was acting in the role of board member when he went to speak to Bland. SUSAN

 A new weekly newspaper began publication this week to take the place of a 
66-year-old community newspaper that ceased publication recently. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beverly Hills News, which printed its first copies Sunday, will focus on 
community news, features and business coverage, said Tom Link, managing partner 
of the venture. 
</P>
<P>
 Link, president of Contract Publishing Inc. and former publisher of the Los 
Angeles Business Journal, declined to name the four owners of the new paper, 
but said all were city residents. He said several other investors may be 
included. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Post employees and columnists were offered jobs with the new paper.

COMMUNITY NEWS: VENICE; AT VIOLENT CORNER, GALANTER TALKS OF PEACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN ELLINGWOOD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seven years after being nearly knifed to death, Councilwoman Ruth Galanter 
visited one of her district's most violent corners Saturday to make a Mother's 
Day appeal for peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Flanked by four women who have lost sons to violence, Galanter cited her own 
attack during remarks before about 50 people gathered at a basketball court in 
the Oakwood section of Venice, a neighborhood rocked by a deadly gang war for 
almost a year. The violence has claimed about 15 lives in and around Venice 
since last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know you've been having a very difficult time. Oakwood has been having a 
very difficult time," Galanter said. "Enough is enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Galanter recalled how her mother traveled from New York to stay with her for 
five months after the May 6, 1987, attack during a burglary in Galanter's 
Venice home. The attacker, a neighbor, was convicted later that year and 
sentenced to 14 years and four months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many mothers have lost children in recent months. . . . They are not having a 
happy Mother's Day," Galanter said. "Our prayers are with you." 
</P>
<P>
 Some in the audience clutched flowers, while others held anti-violence bumper 
stickers. Rosie Lodge, whose grandson was shot dead by suspected gang members 
in Oakwood last fall in what was believed to be a case of mistaken identity, 
said the slaying had changed her family. They "were sad. Then they got angry. 
Now they are afraid," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the sidewalk nearby, a handful of people carried placards protesting the 
alleged police beating of a resident the night before. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Shearwood Fleming, an assistant minister at the Body of Christ church 
and a well-known Oakwood resident, said police struck him and sprayed him in 
the face with pepper spray after ordering him out of the street, where he'd 
been talking to friends. Fleming said he was sprayed in the face after he moved 
to the sidewalk but refused police instructions to put his hands behind his 
head, saying he had done nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was good night, everybody. I couldn't see anything," Fleming said. He said 
he was punched and wrestled to the ground, then sprayed again. "It was 
uncalled-for," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Fleming was booked on suspicion of battery and released on bond. Police said 
Vincent Maddox, 39, also was arrested for interfering with an arrest. A police 
spokesman said he had no information on the alleged beating, but said Fleming 
should file a complaint if he believes officers acted inappropriately. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleming said Tuesday he had not filed a complaint. KEN ELLINGWOOD

 Heidi Frey normally hunts for big donations to help the Venice Community 
Housing Corp. buy property for affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, she and her husband, Robert Greenwald, have made one. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple's $50,000 contribution last Friday is about half of the cash the 
nonprofit corporation will need to buy and renovate a four-unit Oakwood 
building for low-income renters. The total cost of the project is estimated at 
$290,000, most of which will come from loans, said Steve Clare, the 
corporation's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 Frey, a screenwriter, is a member of the corporation's fund-raising committee. 
She and her husband, a director and producer, live in Venice. 
</P>
<P>
 Clare said he hopes the donation will spur others. Donations reduce the need 
for loans and help keep rents low, he said.

CITY HALL ROUNDUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 MALIBU: Christi Hogin, an associate attorney at Richards, Watson & Gershon, 
will leave the Los Angeles-based law firm from which the city has contracted 
services for three years to assume the post of city attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will no longer have the firm conduct the duties of city attorney or 
handle smaller legal matters. Instead, Hogin will become a salaried employee, a 
move expected to save the city about $200,000 annually in legal costs, Mayor 
Jeff Kramer said. 
</P>
<P>
 She will take her post June 6, earning $100,000 a year with a $350 monthly car 
allowance. 
</P>
<P>
 Hogin, 32, was chosen because of her expertise in public law and land-use 
issues and her familiarity with Malibu's ordinances and issues. She is expected 
to guide the city through the adoption of the General Plan, the overall 
blueprint for development expected to be in place by November. 
</P>
<P>
 Hogin served as assistant to former City Atty. Michael Jenkins, who is now a 
partner in Watson, Richards & Gershon. The city will continue to contract 
services from the firm for larger lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no question that with a legal budget our size, we need to look at 
ways to cut costs if we don't want to compromise on the things that we think 
are important," Kramer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The move is aimed at decreasing legal costs that have already exceeded this 
year's $648,000 legal budget by at least $170,000. Lawsuits by trailer park 
owners challenging the city's rent control laws and numerous suits between the 
city and developers have been the most costly.

 BEVERLY HILLS: Joining a growing number of urban communities, Beverly Hills 
will take on a down-home look once a week with an open-air farmers market. 
</P>
<P>
 When Beverly Hills kicks off its Sunday morning market in August, the city 
known more for ritzy Rodeo Drive than fresh rutabagas would be the fifth 
Westside community and the 35th market to be established in Los Angeles County 
through the Southland Farmers' Market Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica, Venice and West Hollywood already have such markets. A market 
will be opened in Westwood on June 2. Malibu is expected to discuss the 
possibility of hosting a Friday afternoon market later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council enthusiastically endorsed the idea Tuesday, agreeing to allow 
25 farmers to sell their produce along the 300 block of North Canon Drive in 
the business district. The council earmarked $46,000 for initial costs. The 
city hopes to break even by the third year.

COVER STORY; FACES OF EXILE; TWO EXHIBITS AT UCLA OFFER GLIMPSES OF L.A.'S 
DIVERSE YET INSULAR IRANIAN COMMUNITY ENGAGING IN PLAY, PRAYER AND POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATHIS CHAZANOV, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like almost everybody else whose roots are not in the deserts and mountains 
and sprawling cities of ancient Persia, Ron Kelley knew little about the 
Iranians of Los Angeles when he set out to portray this large, prosperous, 
fractured and insular group. 
</P>
<P>
 After five years of taking pictures at political demonstrations, nightclubs, 
testimonial dinners, religious services and upscale shopping venues, he found 
himself with mixed feelings about a community that has largely flourished 
despite the travails of exile. 
</P>
<P>
 Although moved by the warmth, passions, hospitality, grief, melancholy and 
sensuality that he saw in their culture, Kelley said he was put off by 
"conspicuous materialism, obsession with status and pretense." 
</P>
<P>
 These attitudes are reflected in more than 100 images that make up the core of 
"Irangeles: Iranians in Los Angeles," one of two upcoming exhibits at UCLA that 
offer a rare look at what is believed to be among the largest concentration of 
Iranians outside their home country. 
</P>
<P>
 "The vast majority are exiles, mostly self-imposed," said Mehdi Bozorgmehr, an 
Iranian-born UCLA sociologist who has been studying the community since 1985. 
"Because of that, they're much more oriented (than other immigrants) to the 
country of origin, like Cubans and their preoccupation with Cuba." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelley's photo exhibit opens Sunday at the Fowler Museum of Cultural History, 
west of Royce Hall, and will run through Nov. 13. The pictures have been 
published as a book by the University of California Press, along with essays by 
several UCLA researchers and interviews conducted by Kelley, who trained as an 
anthropologist. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelley's black-and-white photos document Iranian immigrants at play and prayer 
and practicing political activism in Los Angeles, where educational 
opportunities and good weather served as lures during the 1960s and 1970s. 
Immigration also increased for a time after the political turmoil that led to 
the ouster of Shah Reza Pahlavi in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 The second show, "Labyrinth of Exile," serves as a counterpoint to 
"Irangeles." It comprises the work of young immigrants who came of age in the 
United States and includes haunting multimedia images of women's hands, feet 
and chador-draped faces; passages of poetry silk-screened onto rocks, and other 
works. It is scheduled to run at the Fowler from June 25 to Sept. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Both shows speak to a community that is a mix of largely secular Muslims and 
smaller, more religious ethnic groups -- Jews, Armenian Christians, Bahais, 
Assyrians, Zoroastrians and Kurds. 
</P>
<P>
 Most bypassed the historical immigrant pattern of settling in slums and 
working their way out. Instead, these refugees have thronged to Beverly Hills 
-- where their children make up nearly a fourth of the students in the public 
schools -- Westwood, West Los Angeles and Santa Monica. Glendale, the Palos 
Verdes Peninsula and parts of the western San Fernando Valley also have sizable 
Iranian populations. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of people in Los Angeles County claiming Iranian ancestry totaled 
79,310 in 1990, according to the U.S. Census. Some in the community believe 
their numbers are much higher. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA is an appropriate venue for the exhibits. With several hundred members, 
the Iranian Student Group is one of the largest ethnic organizations on campus. 
Dozens of Iran-born scholars and researchers dot the faculty roster. 
</P>
<P>
 The campus sits at the northern end of Westwood Boulevard, whose southern 
reaches are lined by storefronts festooned with cursive Farsi script and draped 
with flags for the Iranian springtime New Year holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the existence of this commercial center and the prosperity of 
professionals and self-employed business people, there are no high-profile 
organizations that speak for the Iranian immigrants and no cultural center. 
</P>
<P>
 Religion -- or the lack of it -- has made for a splintered reality. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it comes to friendship, social ties, economic and political ties, the 
most important difference is between Muslims and the religious minorities," 
Bozorgmehr said. "These sub-communities are much more cohesive." 
</P>
<P>
 Iranians tend to mix with compatriots of common religious backgrounds, 
although Muslims who fled after the fall of the Shah of Iran in 1979 and the 
establishment of an Islamic republic lack the glue of religion to hold them 
together. Raised in the worldly decades of the Shah's westward-looking regime, 
most of them have little in common with more devout Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they were religious, they would have stayed back home," Bozorgmehr said. 
"The revolution uprooted the secular people, but a very strong sense of 
nationalism is there." 
</P>
<P>
 Culture clash, intergenerational conflict and differences over the role of 
women, together with a drop-off of immigration, are all factors that 
sociologists would expect to lead to a loss of identity among the Iranians. 
</P>
<P>
 But overall, many have yet to dissolve into the great American melting pot. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at the characteristics -- educated, modern, professional -- you'd 
think they'd assimilate, but they haven't," Bozorgmehr said. "It's remarkable 
how ethnic this population is." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The two UCLA shows, arranged so that visitors will be able to stroll between 
the exhibitions, bear that out. 
</P>
<P>
 To make "Irangeles," Kelley spent much of five years getting to know the 
lifestyle of Iranians in exile. 
</P>
<P>
 He photographed so many discos and demonstrations that Iraj Gorgin, a 
Farsi-language TV personality, said that Iranians who live a quieter life may 
be underrepresented. 
</P>
<P>
 Mainstream Iranians are not political activists and do not spend all their 
time in cabarets, Gorgin said. The photo exhibit and the accompanying book are 
"a good big step to introduce Iranians to American society," he said, "but they 
do not tell the complete story." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelley replied that he never meant to catalogue the Iranian community. 
Instead, he said, he used the artistic techniques of "street photography" to 
express his own reactions to what he saw. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more I explored the community, the more I fell in love, the more I came 
to understand the . . . dilemma" of immigrants from a land with a history of 
foreign invasions, political repression and disillusionment, most recently with 
Western culture. "It's about suffering on a profound scale," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelley and co-editor Jonathan Friedlander said they sought to make their 
points through an often startling juxtaposition of images. 
</P>
<P>
 One picture records a march through Westwood of women in modest Muslim 
headdresses, long dresses and pantsuits. One pushes a baby carriage, another 
carries a sign reading "God is the Greatest" and the third hefts a portrait of 
the Ayatollah Khomeini. 
</P>
<P>
 It is matched with a scene from a "Persian Night" Halloween party at a West 
Hollywood disco, where girls in low-cut dresses smirk behind veils as they pose 
with a man in a Khomeini costume, complete with mask and turban. 
</P>
<P>
 "Americans think of Iranians in terms of the Ayatollah, but here's someone, 
who had to flee because of the Ayatollah, making fun of it too," said Steven 
Gold, a Whittier College sociologist who also uses photography in his work. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the artists in the second show, "Labyrinth of Exile," while praising 
the photographs of the displaced older generation, said they felt left out of 
Kelley's photographic record. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was missing from that depiction of Iranian culture in this country," said 
Taraneh Hemami, 34, who mixes old pictures of herself and her family with 
traditional motifs from carpet designs and Iranian architecture. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe we're not as easily recognized," said Hemami, who came to this country 
in 1978. "Maybe we (young people) blend in more." 
</P>
<P>
 Payam Farrahi, 27, who immigrated at the age of 10, said he consciously clings 
to "my awful accent" in order to stay in touch with his Iranian side. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrahi, whose verses are being silk-screened onto granite blocks for the 
show, makes his living as a chef at an Iranian-owned Italian restaurant in 
Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ron (Kelley) has captured a society that was defeated in the revolution and 
moved across the world, but is trying to preserve its illusions, its old ways 
of thinking," he said. "His camera has captured that decadence, and then you 
come into our exhibit. I'm not saying we're not decadent, but we're looking for 
new ways." 
</P>
<P>
 His English-language poem, "Reality," begins: "i am a child/of the thick 
atmosphere/and corrupt altitudes/of the violent paradise/of this mechanical 
century;/which the core of it/is not honour/but murder. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Other artists in the "Labyrinth" show include Ali Reza Dadgar, 32, who 
projects photographs onto aluminum, sheet metal, wood or paper, stapled 
together with nails, screws or bolts, "in a rough, abrupt way, because the 
truth of the process is important and I don't want to fake it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I was living in Iran, I think I would have been way out in left field," 
said Dadgar, who came to the United States in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The work of Shirin Neshat examines women's life in modern Iran, where the 
chador, or body veil, is required, yet women are sent to military service. 
</P>
<P>
 She adorns her photographs of faces, hands and feet with guns and poetry from 
the works of Taherah Saffarzadeh, who called for women to take part in the 
revolution along with their brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was one of those 'Irangeles' people," said Neshat, 37, who lives in New 
York and returns to Iran occasionally to visit her family. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea of just living in memories is tragic," she said. "I can't bear it." 
The Exhibits 
</P>
<P>
 * "Irangeles: Iranians in Los Angeles" will be on display at the Fowler Museum 
of Cultural History, west of Royce Hall on the UCLA campus, from noon to 5 
p.m., Wednesdays through Sundays, from Sunday through Nov. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Labyrinth of Exile" is scheduled for June 25 through Sept. 18, same 
location and hours as "Irangeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Admission is free. Parking is available for $5 at campus Lots 4 and 5.

 If you plan to send your toddler off to preschool this fall, you're running 
out of time to find the right program. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many preschools operate year-round and enroll newcomers throughout 
the year, most of their openings come in September because, by then, the older 
children have moved on to kindergarten. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's important to get your name in now because many popular preschools 
have waiting lists. Bear in mind that some preschools close for the summer, so 
you must visit now to see them in session. 
</P>
<P>
 Preschools vary in their approach to education and activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Some are loosely structured, with daily lessons determined largely by 
students' interests. Others have a more rigid curriculum, with a fixed goal for 
the day's lesson such as learning names of colors or to count to 10. Most 
schools fall somewhere in the middle of these approaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Many preschools run on either a half-day or full-day schedule, and some offer 
the option of having your child attend two or three days a week. If you have a 
choice, your child may be better off starting out as a part-timer to adjust to 
the new experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost varies, too. You may be shocked to learn that half-day programs cost 
about $220 a month while full-day sessions run about $400 per month. The YMCA 
or church organizations sometimes offer less expensive programs. 
</P>
<P>
 To narrow the list of prospects, seek advice from friends, relatives and 
co-workers who have experience selecting a preschool. Try the Yellow Pages, 
too, since many schools list their philosophies and schedules in their ads. 
</P>
<P>
 Do some research by telephone. Call each school's director and ask how long 
the school has been operating, since a new school may still be in the 
experimental stage -- and you may not want your child to be part of its 
experiment. 
</P>
<P>
 Small class size is crucial for preschoolers, so find a program that limits 
each teacher to five to 10 kids. (Under state law, there must be one 
supervising adult for every 12 children.) 
</P>
<P>
 Ask about the school's academic requirement for teachers. Someone can become a 
preschool teacher with as little as two semesters of college courses in early 
childhood education. But some schools also require a bachelor of arts degree in 
addition to at least two semesters of early childhood education. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, have the director list the skills that your child will be taught. Are 
these skills comparable to those of other schools, and are they enough? 
</P>
<P>
 Mention any physical or emotional conditions or special needs that your child 
may have, and ask how the school would accommodate them. 
</P>
<P>
 Then visit the school, but leave your child at home so you can speak candidly 
with teachers and roam freely. 
</P>
<P>
 Is the campus well protected? Are classrooms and playgrounds fenced in, or can 
strangers easily enter? Is the playground equipment safe and practical for your 
child's age? 
</P>
<P>
 Do the buildings look sturdy enough to withstand an earthquake? 
</P>
<P>
 Enter the classroom of every teacher your child may have. Look at the paint 
job, bulletin boards and furniture. Is this a cheerful place? 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the toys, books and other materials. Are there enough for everyone? 
Are they appropriate for your child's age? 
</P>
<P>
 Watch a class in session, noticing the general atmosphere. Are the children 
happy, interested and kept busy? Do they get along with each other and the 
teacher? Does the teacher discipline too lightly or too severely? 
</P>
<P>
 Sexual stereotyping may be a concern. Notice whether there are "boy" 
activities and "girl" activities. Could your daughter, for example, play the 
doctor's or firefighter's role? 
</P>
<P>
 And now the final test: What does your child think? 
</P>
<P>
 Go back to the school with your child to see how he or she uses the classroom 
furnishings, interacts with other children and is treated by the teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Bear in mind that your child will probably be shy when plopped into the new 
setting amid strangers. But you can still get an idea of how he or she would 
eventually fit in.

OUT AND ABOUT / VENICE ART WALK: AN EXHIBITION OF COMMUNITY SPIRIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA V. GODBEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It just wouldn't be spring on the Westside without the Venice Family Clinic's 
annual art walk. 
</P>
<P>
 The event, now in its 15th year, raises funds for the Venice Family Clinic, a 
nonprofit health care organization that serves needy children and adults. It is 
the largest free clinic in the nation, with about 50,000 patients annually. 
</P>
<P>
 The art walk, which will take place this weekend, provides an opportunity to 
visit the studios and homes of more than 50 artists who live in Venice, 
including Charles Arnoldi, Billy Al Bengston, Laddie John Dill, Madelin Coit 
and E.F. Kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 It begins on Friday with "An Evening of Music, Art & Architecture," which will 
include musicians from the Los Angeles Philharmonic and a tour of Leonard and 
Annette Shapiro's contemporary art collection and architecturally award-winning 
home. Reservations are essential. Tickets are $100 each and include a ticket to 
Sunday's events. 
</P>
<P>
 Docent-led tours of artists' studios are offered on Saturday and Sunday from 
11:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tickets are $95. The tour includes lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 Self-guided tours are reserved for noon to 5 p.m. Sunday. Patrons will receive 
a map and may choose which studios they wish to visit. The cost is $45. 
</P>
<P>
 Many artists said they see the event as an opportunity to give back to the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (clinic) is an important institution in the community and it's a 
worthwhile event," said 38-year Venice resident Renee Petropoulous, an artist 
and the designer of this year's commemorative T-shirt.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition to self-guided tours, eight exhibitions will be presented in 
galleries and spaces throughout Venice. Highlights include "Architects Do 
Furniture," a sculpture garden and a photography exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 Chefs from 18 Los Angeles-area restaurants, including 72 Market Street and 
Tatou, will prepare sample dishes available for $4 to $7 at booths along the 
walk. 
</P>
<P>
 A silent auction also will be held. About 300 works by artists such as David 
Hockney, Ed Ruscha, Dennis Hopper and Robbie Conal will be auctioned as well as 
a walk-on part on CBS-TV's "Murphy Brown." 
</P>
<P>
 The central location for activities will be at Westminster School, 1010 Abbot 
Kinney Blvd. Shuttles will run on Sunday between 11 a.m. and 7 p.m. to three 
parking lots: Walgrove, Broadway and Couer D'Alene elementary schools. 
Reservations are suggested for most events. Information: (310) 392-9255.

YMCA: SAVING AN INSTITUTION IN BEVERLY HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a 33-year Beverly Hills resident, with three generations of family use and 
support of the YMCA, it is wrenching to observe the slow, painful destruction 
of this major community resource. When the Y board ousts the very people who 
tried to save the Y, by seeking to change policies resulting in losses of 
$100,000 annually for more than five years, it is clear that the present board 
and management do not recognize or understand the community disfavor into which 
they have led the Y for the past five years.Obviously, they are prepared to 
allow insolvency and shutdown rather than permitting change. 
</P>
<P>
 One would think the last election would have sent the message loud and clear, 
but the recent rejection of future financial support from the city only 
highlights the shroud of secrecy blanketing management of the YMCA and its 
total refusal to provide accountability to the community. 
</P>
<P>
 If this community institution is to be saved, a clean sweep of board and 
management is required. The national YMCA should appoint an interim manager to 
reorganize the Y. A blue ribbon Board of Directors, unsullied by past practices 
and abuses, should be appointed. Only then will the Beverly Hills Family Y 
obtain community financial support necessary for its survival.

PARKS: NATURE VS. ART IN SANTA MONICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The founding fathers and mothers of the city of Santa Monica were the owners 
of vast amounts of unspoiled land, and in their wisdom and generosity, they 
donated unspoiled land to the city so citizens can enjoy the natural beauty of 
this fantastic land they called Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, great minds have decided that nature needs improvemen.How? 
</P>
<P>
 By cluttering our Palisades Park with silly statues; by obstructing the view 
of the horizon with impediments such as a 14-foot statue of a leader of another 
country, and by spending the taxpayers' money on singing chairs or rollers 
which print on sand. 
</P>
<P>
 How sad that these empty minds have no culture or understanding of natural 
beauty. I, for one, am offended by the so-called "works of art." Moreover, I am 
forced to accept this junk as artwork. Sorry, junk is just that: junk!

 TENNIS CHAMPS 
</P>
<P>
 After taking its knocks in football and basketball, University brought home a 
City Section championship trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors defeated Taft, 23-6 1/2, to win the 4-A Division tennis 
championship Tuesday at the Racquet Center in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 University's Jay Jackson won three of his four singles matches and Aapo Aro, a 
transfer student from Finland, suffered his first loss of the season but won 
three other matches. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors dominated the doubles competition winning seven of nine sets. 
University's Jason Barkham and Matt Levin, three-year varsity starters, swept 
their three matches. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were more talented and more experienced," University Coach Tom Anderson 
said. "What makes it even better is we won with style and class. I don't 
remember a championship being won with such a lopsided score. This is the most 
rewarding victory of my career." 
</P>
<P>
 SWIMMING ALONG 
</P>
<P>
 Bruno Diederichs and Lenny Krayzelburg were the outstanding swimmers for Santa 
Monica in the three-day California Community College state meet at Cypress 
College. 
</P>
<P>
 Diederichs swam 4 minutes 37.69 seconds to win the 500-yard freestyle on the 
opening day and swam a school-record 15:54.51 to win the 1,650 freestyle. 
Diederichs also broke his own record of 9:37.84 in the 1,000 and finished 
fourth in the 400 individual medley (4:10.70). 
</P>
<P>
 Krayzelburg, a Fairfax graduate, won the 100 backstroke in a school-record 
50.74. It was also the fastest time in the nation at the community college 
level. He also won the 200 backstroke in a national record 1:47.91. He also 
finished fourth in the 50 freestyle (21.29). 
</P>
<P>
 Krayzelburg was named the meet's most outstanding swimmer. ABOVE BELIEF 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to imagine upperclassmen looking up to a sophomore for inspiration. 
Unless, of course, you're volleyball standout Raoul Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, a sophomore outside hitter, had 28 kills and served 16 points, 
including the game-winner, as University beat Bell, 15-6, 15-12, 15-10, Tuesday 
in the City 4-A finals at University. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's amazing," Bell Coach Mike Mayfield said about Williams, the Western 
League co-most valuable player. "I look at him as a teaching tool for our 
hitters for next year. He has a great jump serve. Face it, he beat us. They 
went to him a million times." 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Strouse had 13 kills and Mark Williams, Raoul's younger brother, had nine 
kills to lead the Warriors' attack. Setter Jamie Strofs had only one unforced 
error. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors (14-1) play Granada Hills (15-1) at 8 p.m. Friday in the 
championship match at Cal State Northridge. The City 4-A final matches Williams 
and Granada Hills' Mike DiSimone, who had 22 kills Tuesday in the victory over 
Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we'll try to stop Mike," University Coach Neal Newman said. 
"He's going to get his attack and we're going to get ours. They are in the same 
position. They have to figure out how to stop us." 
</P>
<P>
 University won City titles in 1975, 1985, 1987 and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors will play without Western League co-MVP Michael Rupp, who left 
the team because of academic reasons. FALLING SHORT 
</P>
<P>
 Palisades fell short in its bid for a second upset. 
</P>
<P>
 Palisades senior middle blocker Gaby Amar had a match-high 25 kills, but the 
defending City 4-A champions were no match for third-seeded Granda Hills, 15-7, 
13-15, 15-8, 15-12, in Tuesday's other semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
 The host Highlanders were led by DiSimone, who had nine kills in the deciding 
game and the match-clinching kill. 
</P>
<P>
 Amar had 10 kills in the final game to keep the Dolphins close. Junior outside 
hitter Dan Von Wetter had 11 kills, including the first nine without an error 
until midway through the third game for Palisades (6-10). 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Pardridge had eight kills and Jeff Lemen added seven for the 10th-seeded 
Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Palisades pulled off an upset of second-seeded Westchester, 6-15, 
16-14, 15-5, and 18-16. The Comets played without all-league junior outside 
hitter Kevin Bergschneider, who has been out because of a broken hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Palisades Coach Howard Enstedt made a lineup change, substituting 6-foot-3 
junior Darin Guthrie into the lineup for 5-11 junior Erin Whalley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made the move because Guthrie's offense is starting to come around," 
Enstedt said. "I switched Whalley with one of our setters on the front line to 
give us more firepower." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dolphins, who have won nine City championships, missed 6-7 James Turner, 
who transferred to Ojai Thacher. 
</P>
<P>
 "He got his scholarship to UCLA and said bye," Enstedt said. "That set us back 
three months." SCOUTING REPORT 
</P>
<P>
 Attention Division I softball coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 In need of a quality infielder? 
</P>
<P>
 Palisades had four infielders make Western League first team and Coach Dave 
Weinstein believes they're future Division I prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best infield I've ever had considering the level of competition," 
said Weinstein, who coached baseball during the mid-1970s. "They have an 
uncanny mechanical ability with the glove." 
</P>
<P>
 Junior first baseman Millie Rodriguez led the team with a .640 batting average 
and four home runs in Coastal Conference play. Sophomore shortstop Mindy Spire 
(.625, four home runs), freshman second baseman Laurel Swigert (.475) and 
sophomore Sabrina Romero (.452) proved to be equally adept with the bat as well 
as the glove. 
</P>
<P>
 The foursome completed 14 double plays. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitcher Meg Reinis (.390) was named to the first team as a designated hitter 
and sophomore catcher Maritza Jaramillo (.425) was selected to the second team. 
Reinis' brother Lee plays baseball for University. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have people come down to see our catcher throw runners out and the infield 
turn double plays," Weinstein said. "Even the varsity baseball team came out to 
watch." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dolphins (11-4 and 8-2 in Coastal Conference play) finished second behind 
Westchester in the Western League. But with all the key players returning, the 
Dolphins should contend for a City 4-A title next season. 
</P>
<P>
 All this team needs is a new coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinstein, who turns 60 in July, is retiring at the end of the school year. 
TOUGH BREAK 
</P>
<P>
 University senior utility infielder Sandy Ginoza suffered a broken right leg 
two weeks ago while sliding into third base during a softball game against 
Manual Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Ginoza suffered a multiple fracture and underwent surgery last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think Sandy will be playing competitive sports again," University 
Coach Patricia Peisner said. "The most painful thing is that she will not be 
able to compete for her Japanese traveling league basketball team." 
</P>
<P>
 Ginoza, who played third base, outfield and pitched, led University to a share 
of the Metro League title. The Warriors hope sophomore pitcher Megan Fahey, who 
missed the season because of tendinitis in her right elbow, will return next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "She suffers from overuse syndrome," Peisner said, noting that Fahey also 
pitches in a youth softball league. "No one saw much of her this year. She 
needs to get on a strength program to handle the grind she has put herself 
through." SEAN WATERS and MIKE LAZARUS

 Madonna reportedly dresses like a man when she wants to go incognito. Woody 
Allen pulls a slouchy hat down over his eyes and wears a trench coat. Forget 
that he's been using this get-up so long it now works like a beacon. But most 
celebrities opt for a varied wardrobe of disguises. 
</P>
<P>
 To find out who wears what, we went straight to the paparazzi, who make their 
living by tracking and shooting stars -- quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we see someone, we have only a matter of seconds, not 20 or 30 but three 
or four, to identify and pursue," says photographer Kathy ("I don't hide in 
bushes") Hutchins of Michelson Photo Agency in the San Fernando Valley. Do a 
double-take and you're too late. 
</P>
<P>
 Celebrities tend to don disguises in the places they feel most vulnerable, 
particularly the airport, says Vinnie Zuffante, a photographer with Star File 
in New York City. Who can blame them for wanting to give pesky fans the slip 
(who doesn't feel like one of the great unwashed after a flight)? Still, here's 
a sampling of looks to look for at the baggage carousel and elsewhere. The 
Disaster of Disguise  
</P>
<P>
 Michael Jackson may be a man of many hats (usually fedoras), but "he's the 
worst at (disguises)," says Janet Charlton, gossip columnist for Star magazine. 
"He has a myriad of ridiculous disguises that mostly draw attention to 
himself," she adds. Indeed, aside from wearing surgical masks of many colors, 
Jackson has been photographed variously as a robot, a nurse and a little old 
man with a beard. And he was spotted this year on a Las Vegas sidewalk posing 
as just-your-average tourist in a head-to-toe shroud of black with Michael 
Milken by his side. Even better, Jackson turned up last month in New York City 
as a fat man -- 50 pounds overweight thanks to body pads -- with orange wig and 
fedora. Brunet Today, Blond Tomorrow  
</P>
<P>
 Donning a wig of an unfamiliar color can be an effective ploy. Shannen Doherty 
once tried wearing a curly blond Farrah Fawcett-type wig to the Viper Club but 
was outed at the door, Charlton says, "because her temperament came through the 
disguise." The actress's usual, and more successful, cover-up amounts to 
combing her own hair down over her face. Add a few friends for cover, the 
photographer says, and "the tiny actress goes to a lot of places without being 
noticed." The One That Got Away  
</P>
<P>
 Zuffante recalls the day Joan Collins, wearing sunglasses and a short blond 
bob, breezed right past the photographer and his colleagues at LAX: "There was 
a car waiting for her, and as she got in she whipped off her wig and said, 
'Here I am, boys!' We all missed the shot." The actress is less discreet when 
departing, Zuffante says. "When Joan Collins leaves town on an airplane, she 
doesn't mind being photographed. She leaves as Alexis (Carrington), you know 
what I mean? But when she gets off the plane she's Joan Collins, and she 
doesn't want her picture taken." Wigged Out  
</P>
<P>
 Paul McCartney in a black Afro and Linda McCartney in a long black wig at a 
George Harrison concert; Elizabeth Taylor in a white Afro at a Prince concert; 
Ann-Margret in a black Afro at a Bette Midler concert; Sharon Stone in a long 
black Cher wig at the airport, and Roseanne Arnold in a wig and Halloween mask 
at a drag bar. The Hotel as Disguise  
</P>
<P>
 Who would think that the quaint Century Wilshire in Westwood, with an interior 
right out of "Barton Fink," is a celeb magnet? No one. That's the idea, says 
manager Ken Gee, who would add only that the favored disguise of men and women 
is . . . a wig. Clever Counter-Disguises  
</P>
<P>
 When Taylor and Larry Fortensky honeymooned at Malcolm Forbes' Moroccan 
hideaway, native dress -- the djellaba -- proved a perfect disguise. Thus 
outfitted, the newlyweds eluded journalists for an entire week as they tooled 
around in a Mercedes limousine, says Francine Alfieri-Brandt, who helped her 
husband, photographer Peter Brandt, pursue the couple. "When you wrap yourself 
up in a veil and a djellaba, which is like a caftan, you can't tell who's under 
there," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Desperate times called for desperate measures, so the journalists resorted to 
using counter-disguises. On went the djellabas and veils, and 45 minutes later, 
at a Bedouin marketplace outside Tangier, they found Taylor and Fortensky -- 
but not in disguise. "The honeymooners didn't need it," says Alfieri-Brandt, 
"because none of the Bedouins recognized them. We finally got a picture, but 
only because we were the ones in disguise." Sibling Rivalry  
</P>
<P>
 Arriving for the ill-fated "Jackson Family Honors" event in Las Vegas, LaToya 
Jackson sneaked into the MGM Grand Hotel in a shroud-like get-up not unlike the 
one Michael has worn. Me and My Shadow  
</P>
<P>
 Stars aren't shy on camera, but they seem to recoil in hotel lobbies. They 
often use their personal assistants as cover when signing in or checking for 
phone messages, says Karron Hinson, chief concierge at the Peninsula Hotel in 
Beverly Hills. Here's the drill: "The assistants come up to the desk and speak 
on the star's behalf. So at first you recognize the name, but not the face, and 
then you see the famous individual standing right behind the assistant. Once we 
see the star, we say, 'By all means, yes, here are your messages.' " Down and 
Out in Beverly Hills  
</P>
<P>
 In a car culture, Rent a Wreck offers the ultimate disguise. That's where 
Michael Jackson leased an old pickup -- just the thing to complete his "little 
old man" ensemble, Alfieri-Brandt says. "Old cars are big disguises," she says, 
"because they fit into the landscape. Steve Martin used to drive around in an 
old Honda Accord. . . . I think he still does." Glamour Break  
</P>
<P>
 For some actresses, forgoing makeup is a disguise in itself. Add 
non-prescription glasses and . . . voila! . . . a sex symbol is no more. 
Actress Christina Applegate may wear wire rims, no makeup, baggy clothes and a 
ponytail to keep fans at bay. And photographer Zuffante reports that Linda 
Evans, in glasses and babushka at LAX, managed to deflect the paparazzi when 
she yelled: "Come on guys, I'm not dressed for this. Get Sammy Davis -- he's 
behind us!"

CITY HALL NEWS / DUARTE; UTILITY TAX GETS PRELIMINARY OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD WINTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Over the objections of numerous residents, the City Council gave preliminary 
approval Tuesday to a 4% utility tax. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 3 to 2 to direct staff to draw up a budget for the fiscal 
year beginning July 1 that includes the new tax on water, electricity, gas, 
telephone and cable bills. Council members who voted for the tax said they had 
no choice given the city's budget crunch. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Duarte Taxpayers Group vowed to recall any council member who 
approved a final budget for the 1994-95 fiscal year that includes the tax. 
Council members are expected to give final approval in June. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're going to hear from the people," said Richard Kee, one of about 100 
residents, most of whom oppose the tax, who attended the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll follow Covina's lead and go the route of recall against anyone who 
votes for this tax," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Councilman John R. Fasana, who along with Mayor Margaret E. Finlay and 
Councilwoman Ginny Joyce voted for the tax, said the city's $1.5-million budget 
shortfall offered no other options. 
</P>
<P>
 He said part of that shortfall could be made up by $719,000 in cuts and 
$194,000 in fee increases, but reductions in services would become eliminations 
unless a utility tax were implemented. The tax would generate $641,000 
annually. Figures on how much the tax would cost the average household were 
unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
 Dissenting Councilmen James D. Kirchner and Phillip R. Reyes said they were 
concerned about the impact on local businesses already suffering from the 
recession. Kirchner's two attempts to cut the tax and use more city reserves 
both failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the more than 20 residents who spoke on the tax blamed poor city 
management for a lack of belt-tightening and called for the resignation of City 
Manager Jesse H. Duff.

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LONG BEACH; GROCERIES-FOR-GUNS PROGRAM SCALED BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A groceries-for-guns exchange program that sponsors hoped would remove more 
than 400 firearms from city homes this month has been scaled back, apparently 
because of a lack of participation from businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally slated to take place at churches throughout Long Beach during the 
weekends this month, the exchange will be only at the Gospel Memorial Church, 
1480 Atlantic Ave., from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The first 50 people who turn in a gun to uniformed police reserve officers 
will receive a $100 Ralph's grocery certificate. Nobody will be asked where the 
guns came from, and certificates will be limited to one per family, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsors of the exchange, which include the city and a coalition of local 
churches and community groups, had tried to get $40,000 in certificates. 
Ralph's is the only business participating. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had hoped that various companies would take a greater interest in this," 
said Tom Poe, spokesman for Mayor Ernie Kell. Kell introduced the "Goods for 
Guns" trade in early April. 
</P>
<P>
 Poe said some supermarket officials told him they were concerned about 
appearing to favor one program over another. "They didn't want to pick and 
choose," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar programs throughout the country in recent months exchanged guns for 
concert tickets in Los Angeles, toys in New York and carwashes and Mighty Ducks 
hockey tickets in Orange County. JOHN POPE

WESTSIDE WATCH: JUAN VALDEZ LOOK-ALIKE CONTEST GETS A ROASTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Should Beverly Hills wake up and smell the coffee? 
</P>
<P>
 To partake in the World Cup hoopla, the city has decided to hold festivities 
for each of the countries participating in next month's international soccer 
championship at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 But some wonder if the city couldn't have picked a better way than a Juan 
Valdez look-alike contest to honor Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, the image of the fictitious Colombian coffee grower, dressed in a serape 
and sombrero, marks millions of cans of 100% Colombian coffee and is 
recognizable from Yuban coffee TV commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 But to some, Valdez represents Colombia no more than Colonel Sanders does the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why not honor Nobel Prize-winner (author) Gabriel Garcia Marquez?" asked 
Guillermo Hernandez, director of UCLA's Chicano Studies Research Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one likes to be represented by a commercial figure. It shows a lack of 
respect by Beverly Hills to their Colombian guests," Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
 But representatives of the Beverly Hills Visitors Bureau, which came up with 
the idea for the contest, deny that they are being insensitive. They said they 
were merely looking for corporate tie-ins and hoped that using Valdez might 
inspire Yuban to get involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yuban (coffee) came immediately to mind because of the commercials with Juan 
Valdez in Colombia. We thought that was a warm and happy association -- 
Colombia has lots of bad connotations," visitors bureau Manager Dan Howard 
said.

 COUNCILMAN BLADES?: This column suggested a couple months ago that the 
esoteric pro-business, pro-environment platform of Panamanian salsa star and 
presidential candidate Ruben Blades sounded just right for left-of-center Santa 
Monica, where he lived in a condo until several months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 His political party, Papa Egoro, an Indian term meaning Mother Earth, defied 
ideological labels. It called for liberal social programs and a better 
distribution of wealth but also advocated stronger businesses and private 
investment. All that plus pleas for ecological sensitivity thrown in for good 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Well (not meaning to say we told you so), Blades finished third in Sunday's 
elections. As if that weren't bad enough, the victor's political party was once 
controlled by former dictator Manuel Noriega, who was deposed by U.S. troops in 
1989 and is serving a 40-year drug trafficking sentence in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 If only Blades were a U.S. citizen. He could have brought his campaign back 
here, where three Santa Monica City Council seats are up for election in 
November.

 DAVE ON L.A.: David Letterman's visit this week to Los Angeles, where he is 
taping his "Late Show" at Television City near Hollywood, seems to have a 
decidedly Westside spin. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Monday night's opener. It included a video travelogue of Dave and 
bandleader Paul Schaffer. There were Dave and Paul at the La Brea Tar Pits 
(with Dave "swallowing" a bucket of the famed muck). Dave and Paul cruising in 
convertibles on Hollywood Boulevard (Paul with a carload of babes; Dave with a 
pack of fat guys) and Dave and Paul rearranging the Hollywood sign (it read 
"Davewood" when they were through). 
</P>
<P>
 Not to mention his top 10 reasons for doing the show from L.A., which included 
(No. 2): "Wanted to be first to get speeding ticket on newly reopened Santa 
Monica Freeway." 
</P>
<P>
 So, come on, Dave, what can you say about Culver City?

CITY HALL NEWS / ALTADENA; 59 VOTES GIVE DUDLEY A COUNCIL SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD WINTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a hotly contested race for Altadena Town Council, former Councilwoman 
Camille Dudley easily overcame Jonathan Vos Post, who had been expelled from 
the panel in February. 
</P>
<P>
 In the election Saturday, in which six of eight seats up for grabs were not 
contested, residents showed little enthusiasm for the ballot box. Only 361 
votes were cast, although Altadena has more than 24,000 voters. 
</P>
<P>
 The council for the unincorporated hillside community is an informal advisory 
body to the County Board of Supervisors. Its 14 members and seven alternates 
are elected from districts based on U.S. Census tracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Most votes were cast in Tract 4602, where the controversial candidacy of Vos 
Post highlighted the race. Aside from Dudley, other candidates were retiree 
Francis Crunk, former Forest Service engineer Gus Edmondson and bookkeeper 
Stacy Manning. Dudley garnered 59 votes, followed by Manning with 31. Vos Post 
received eight votes for the two-year term. Manning will serve as the 
alternate. 
</P>
<P>
 Dudley, a Los Angeles building and safety employee, said she wants to improve 
the relationship between council members who became divided over Vos Post's 
expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
 At a March council meeting, Vos Post was arrested for refusing to stop a 
speech in which he accused the advisory board and former members of corruption 
and fraud. The district attorney's office, however, did not file charges 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Vos Post had become an alternate after losing to Craig Hall last year. He was 
suspended in October for alleging election fraud and removed from office by a 
divided council in February for violating the terms of his suspension, which 
prohibited him from associating with the board for six months. 
</P>
<P>
 The other competitive race, in Tract 4603, resulted in Tom Cartwright 
outscoring Millie Lee, 70 votes to 23. Lee will be the alternate for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tract 4613, where two seats were up for grabs, James Iamurriwon the 
two-year term, while runner-up Tom Jerman got a one-year term. 
</P>
<P>
 An additional four residents were elected in the uncontested races: Gregory 
Norden, Jacqueline Fennessy, Labarbara Madison and Ronald Spivak.

 Mayor Edward C. Pizzorno has a pet peeve. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he's been getting calls from residents who are fed up with dog owners 
who don't clean up after their pets on walks.Pizzorno used last week's council 
meeting to berate scofflaws who fail to abide by the city's doggy-dumping laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people are really inconsiderate," Pizzorno said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials plan to warn residents in next month's city newsletter that owners 
who don't clean up after their dogs in public streets, sidewalks and parks can 
be cited and fined. Penalties generally range from $25 to $100, according to 
Southeast Animal Control officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to make people aware that it's not acceptable behavior," city 
Planning Director Paul Deibel said. "It can be a health problem. Not only is 
this common courtesy, but it's backed up by the force of law." PSYCHE PASCUAL

CITY HALL JOURNAL: SOUTH GATE; CITY OFFICES MAY AGAIN BE OPEN 5 DAYS A WEEK 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The doors of City Hall may once again open on Fridays if a proposal is 
approved by employees and the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 As in several other Southeast cities, South Gate government offices have been 
closed on Fridays during the past year in an effort to reduce employee commutes 
and meet Air Quality Management District standards. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Henry C. Gonzalez, making good on a campaign promise, has 
proposed opening City Hall five days a week to make services more accessible to 
the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "People get paid on Fridays and they come to City Hall to do business," 
Gonzalez said. "They can't do it and have to take a day off the following week. 
City Hall is there to give service. . . . You can make everybody happy without 
making the transition too hectic." 
</P>
<P>
 The city has yet to complete talks with employee unions on the change and it 
is unclear what the new hours of operation would be. However, any change would 
probably require departments to stagger workers' schedules, reducing the number 
of employees available at certain hours, said Osie Harrell, president of the 
100-member Municipal Employees Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're waiting to see what the (city's) proposals are," he said. MARY HELEN

<TEXT>
<P>
 The city has rejected a claim made by a former city worker who said he was 
forced out of his job after helping an employee union organize a political 
action committee to campaign against incumbent council members.  
</P>
<P>
 City Council members rejected a claim filed April 6 by former maintenance 
worker Carlos Porras.Porras, who left his job in November, sought $1.75 
million. He said top officials made demeaning comments and harassed him. He now 
works with a private, nonprofit environmental organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Porras, who joined the public works department in 1976, was a director of the 
Santa Fe Springs City Employees Assn., which represents city workers. The 
association opposed two incumbents, Ronald S. Kernes and Al Fuentes, in last 
month's City Council election. Kernes won another term, but Fuentes lost his 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Steven N. Skolnik said Porras, 46, was disciplined for reasons 
unrelated to his position on the union board. Skolnik said Porras lost a day's 
pay on one occasion, and then was demoted as a result of his performance on the 
job. Skolnik would not elaborate. PSYCHE PASCUAL

NEW MAYOR'S DEBUT SPOILED BY RICHARD'S TIRADE OVER TICKETS; PASADENA: THE 
COUNCILMAN THREATENS TO SUE AFTER HIS COLLEAGUES DECIDE TO RAFFLE 75 WORLD CUP 
SEATS THAT WOULD USUALLY BE ALLOTTED TO HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Several Pasadena City Council members had high hopes for improved relations 
with their volatile colleague, Isaac Richard. After all, the mayor's post on 
the council was passing from Richard's archenemy, Rick Cole, to Kathryn Nack, 
who pledged a no-nonsense reign. 
</P>
<P>
 But those hopes were dashed Monday during Nack's first meeting as mayor, when 
Richard unleashed a tirade and the council voted to raffle the 75 World Cup 
tickets that would usually be allotted to the councilman to pass on to his 
constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you think I'm going to roll over and see you thieving SOBs take my tickets 
. . . you're wrong," said Richard, who left in anger before the 5-1 vote on the 
ticket issue. He later pledged to sue the council over the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard's conduct during the meeting caused Nack to ask a sergeant-at-arms to 
sit by him. The official at one point warned Richard that he faced ejection 
from the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman William M. Paparian, who cast the lone vote against the raffle, 
said he was disappointed at the meeting's fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
 "My hope was with a new Administration we could begin to move forward in a 
positive way," Paparian said. "But (the ticket) issue is going to get in the 
way." 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's vote was an extension of the council's decision last June to censure 
Richard after he cursed a roomful of city officials. The censure stripped the 
councilman of such privileges as the opportunity to distribute tickets at face 
value for many Rose Bowl events. 
</P>
<P>
 The other council members, for example, will each be able to distribute 75 
tickets for World Cup games, which begin in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Chris Holden, who made the motion to raffle Richard's tickets, said 
his colleague's outburst at Monday's meeting was reminiscent of the disruptive 
actions that led to the censure. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kind of antics he's been involved in over the last several years have 
really done harm," said Holden, who last year obtained a restraining order that 
prevents Richard from approaching him outside of council meetings. Holden 
secured the order after alleging that Richard threatened him following earlier 
disputes over tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Paparian said he voted against the raffle for procedural reasons. The council 
censured Richard last June 8 for one year. The sanctions are due to expire 
before the first World Cup game is played at the Rose Bowl on June 18. 
</P>
<P>
 The raffle is expected to be held about June 1, and Richard would be allowed 
to distribute any tickets not sold, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently anticipating the action, Richard was clearly upset during the early 
stages of Monday's meeting. He began arguing about the tickets with Councilman 
William Crowfoot as the rest of the members tried to conduct unrelated 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was very angry with me about this issue," Crowfoot said of the exchange 
with Richard, an African American. "He repeatedly kept calling me a racist." 
</P>
<P>
 Nack told the two to keep quiet several times, but Richard continued to argue 
with Crowfoot. Finally, the mayor summoned the meeting's sergeant-at-arms, 
Pasadena Police Sgt. Gary Capuano, who sat behind Richard as a silent warning. 
</P>
<P>
 But Richard erupted a short time later when the council began discussing a 
plan to distribute 1,742 World Cup tickets to out-of-town entrepreneurs and 
others to attract new businesses to Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Capuano then walked to the podium and read a statement warning Richard that it 
is a misdemeanor to disrupt the council meeting and that he faced ejection. 
</P>
<P>
 While Capuano read the warning, a defiant Richard taunted him, "Take your 
time. I know you're not educated."

WHEN DEMAND FOR GOOD GRADES LEADS TO ABUSE; EDUCATION: TEACHERS WORRY THAT MANY 
ASIAN AMERICAN PARENTS USE HARSH DISCIPLINE TO FORCE THEIR CHILDREN TO BE 
SUCCESSFUL, STUDY FINDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Harsh parental discipline and stress are key concerns among educators in San 
Gabriel Valley school districts with large numbers of Asian American students, 
according to a first-ever study compiled by the Chinese American Education 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 President Marina Tse, who canvassed educators from the Rowland, Hacienda La 
Puente, Bassett and Walnut Valley school districts, said the results are 
astonishing. 
</P>
<P>
 The educators in the survey, which was released this week, said they are 
worried that Asian American parents place high expectations on their children, 
mete out severe discipline at home and pressure schools to promote youngsters a 
year or two above their age even when the students clearly need greater 
emotional and social development. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you get an A, it's not good enough. Then the parents say, 'Why didn't you 
get an A-plus?' " said San-pao Li, a professor of Asian studies at Cal State 
Long Beach. Li was one of several guest speakers at an educational conference 
Tuesday in Hacienda Heights geared to addressing the needs of Chinese American 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 The conference at the Hsi Lai Buddhist Temple, which addressed topics in the 
survey, drew almost 200 participants from the four districts. The session was 
an effort to help educators cross the cultural bridges they might encounter 
with Asian American students through workshops on parental expectations, school 
problems, and the philosophy, culture and religion that guide Chinese life. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the San Gabriel Valley, educators are wrestling with how to best 
reach and teach increasing numbers of students from various Asian cultures. 
Students often arrive in public schools unable to speak English, uncomfortable 
speaking up in class and struggling to get the good grades that will win 
parental approval in cultures where filial duty is of paramount importance. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa McIntyre, the district nurse at Walnut Valley Unified School District, 
said many Chinese American students complain about chronic stomach problems and 
headaches, which she believes are caused by stress. 
</P>
<P>
 American education can also be puzzling to Chinese American parents, who tend 
to prefer a linear, structured learning environment at a time when American 
education is moving toward a more free-form approach that emphasizes critical 
thinking and cooperative learning, said Sharon S. Robison, superintendent of 
Rowland Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Nahmias, principal of Grazide Elementary School in Hacienda Heights, said 
Chinese American parents often ask him what level of corporal punishment is 
appropriate.  
</P>
<P>
 "It puts American educators in an awkward situation," Nahmias said. "What do 
we condone?" 
</P>
<P>
 Loretta Huang, who teaches adult education in the Alhambra school district, 
said that corporal punishment is very common in Chinese culture and that 
parents often use belts or sticks to discipline children. She said some parents 
also burn their children with cigarette butts, although that is more rare. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, Chinese American parents are shocked to learn that they are under 
investigation for child abuse.

 "They keep asking me, 'Why is the social worker interfering?' " Tse said. "I 
tell them that the school has a responsibility to protect the child, and they 
tell me, 'Protecting the child, that's my job.' The parents don't understand." 
</P>
<P>
 Many students, especially newer immigrants, never tell school officials that 
their parents beat them for bringing home bad grades. But Tse says that youths 
who have been here longer have grown savvy to the American attitude toward 
hitting children and will blackmail parents by threatening to report them under 
child abuse laws if the parents do not allow them to get their way. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheating and doing whatever it takes to get top grades are other concerns 
cited by educators. 
</P>
<P>
 "At conferences, parents always want to know how their child can get an 
A-plus," said Linda Hsieh, a teacher at Rowland High School. "I have students 
coming in with a B-minus on a test saying: 'Can I take it again? I need two 
more points. B isn't good enough. Can I do extra credit?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Huang says a student once stole a test out of a teacher's locker and 
distributed it to two classes, thinking he would be considered a hero. When the 
school transferred the boy to another campus, his parents complained that their 
son didn't do anything wrong and that the punishment was too severe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm ashamed to say that cheating is very prevalent at many schools in Asian 
countries because the competition is so stiff," Huang told the conference.

TWO TEACHERS PUSH CHARTER SCHOOL PLAN; EDUCATION: ORGANIZERS SAY PROPOSAL FOR 
CAMPUS IN DOWNTOWN LONG BEACH WOULD CUT ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND BOOST TEST 
SCORES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Two teachers are leading an effort to create the first independent charter 
school in Long Beach, which they said would save administrative costs while 
boosting test scores. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed Constellation Community Middle School would enroll about 120 
students, all of whom would enter as sixth-graders and remain in the school 
through eighth grade. At the end of three years, the school would enroll 
another class of sixth-graders. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers Jim Norris and Mary Ruffner, who teach at Benjamin Franklin Middle 
School, have gathered signatures on petitions and have asked the Long Beach 
Unified School District to approve their proposal to set up the school in 
downtown Long Beach.  
</P>
<P>
 The teachers hope that the ethnic makeup of the students attending the school 
will reflect the population of the downtown area, which is primarily Latino, 
Cambodian and African American. Facilities at St. Luke's Episcopal Church at 
Seventh Street and Atlantic Avenue have been listed as a tentative site for the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 Many district officials said they favor the proposal, calling it an innovative 
idea that deserves to be tried. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the union that represents non-teaching employees, however, said 
they fear that a charter school could cost some employees their jobs.  
</P>
<P>
 The board is scheduled to consider the proposal at its meeting Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The charter school would receive $432,000 under the same formula as other 
schools in the district. The staff would consist of four teachers and two 
bilingual aides. A seven-member council of teachers, parents and community 
representatives would oversee the school, which would open in the fall of 1995 
if approved, Norris said. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers said they hope that teachers would design their own curriculum and 
arrange their own support services, freeing up money to buy computers and other 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to look at where our priorities are and where we can get the most 
educational bang for our buck," Norris said. "All of the money (would be) 
focused right into the classroom." 
</P>
<P>
 An official of the California School Employees Assn., which represents such 
support personnel as secretaries, custodians and instructional aides, 
questioned whether the school could function with such a small staff. 
</P>
<P>
 School organizers "are underestimating the difficulties they are going to 
encounter without all of the administrative, maintenance and clerical support 
they would get from the district," said Richard Sharp, labor relations 
representative for the organization. Sharp said he plans to meet with Norris to 
discuss the union's concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools Supt. Carl A. Cohn said he favors the charter proposal. He pointed out 
that the school board is encouraging innovative approaches that might help 
boost student achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The administration of the school district will not be an obstacle to this 
going through," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 School board member Ed Eveland initially said he was concerned that the small 
staff would be granted too much administrative independence, but withdrew his 
opposition after meeting with Norris. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt," Eveland said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the board approves the plan, the proposal would be forwarded to the State 
Board of Education. If the plan is rejected, the organizers could appeal to the 
County Office of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1992 law allows charter schools to have virtual freedom from local and state 
school regulations. About 50 charter schools are operating in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Two charter-school proposals were rejected last August in Compton by Stanley 
G. Oswalt, then acting administrator, who said that the plans for an elementary 
school and middle school were incomplete and that the schools might be too 
costly.

GUNS, SUICIDE FOCUS OF FORUM IN BELL GARDENS; YOUTHS: STUDENTS IN JUNIOR AND 
SENIOR HIGH SCHOOLS EXPLORE THE ROOTS OF VIOLENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The subject was "Kids Killing Kids," and scores of junior and senior high 
school students from Bell Gardens sat motionless, listening as one of their own 
talked about the temptation of a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it's weird because I'm in my house and my parents pressure me a lot 
about my grades and that's when you start to think about suicide," said a 
seventh-grade student from Suva Intermediate School. "We have a gun in the 
house. My dad keeps it for protection and he taught me how to use it. 
Sometimes, I get it from my mom's room and I'm thinking of what I'm going to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 Within minutes, a second girl, an eighth-grader, approached the microphone. 
"I've thought about suicide too . . . ." That was all she could utter before 
she choked on her words and ran out of Ross Auditorium to the privacy of the 
bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 About 150 students attended a recent open microphone forum hosted by the city 
and its police department, at which they were encouraged to talk about violence 
in their community and discuss alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials expected talk of gangs and guns but the forum focused equally on 
other adolescent conflicts. Emotions ran so high that several students were 
whisked away for immediate crisis counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 The students had been assigned to watch a television special also titled "Kids 
Killing Kids," which dealt with teen suicide, gang violence and the dangers of 
guns, even if used in self-defense or to impress others. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of the forum was to help students realize they are not alone and 
to help city officials better understand the needs of the community's youth, 
event organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are the ones who have to go out on the street and get the people who are 
bleeding and dying and we don't have the answers either," said Police Chief 
Andy Romero, adding that Bell Gardens officers responded to gunshot calls more 
than once each day in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of times we adults discuss these issues of kids and violence, but we 
don't live it every day with them on campus so this may give us a better idea 
of what to do to help them in this battle," said Assistant City Manager Karen 
Nobrega. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially shy, students slowly came forward, prompted by Bell Gardens High 
resource officer Gilbert Gamboa. One described how a classmate threatened her 
with a gun, another described conflicts with her parents and her life as a 
runaway, a third told of being dumped by her boyfriend and of her subsequent 
suicide attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials helped students come up with nonviolent solutions to some of 
their problems and urged them to seek outside help. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't let a negative response from your parents block you," advised City 
Manager Charles Gomez. "Go to your teacher or to the police . . . A lot of 
times the parent is the problem. Keep that in mind, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Gamboa said about 600 of 3,200 Bell Gardens High School students have 
approached him with various conflicts during the past year. They report seeing 
weapons on campus, conflicts with their parents and in their relationships, and 
talk about drugs, gangs and suicide, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes they may think it's really drastic but we say 'It may not be as bad 
as you think,' " Gamboa said. "We have resources and we'll help you." 
</P>
<P>
 Bell Gardens High seniors Karen Ray and Christy Defries say they have sought 
Gamboa's advice many times.

FEELING SPACEY?; CLASS PONDERS PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF ROCKET TRAVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENEE TAWA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prof. Harvey Wichman's psychology class starts off easy -- a little bit on 
orbital mechanics, a quick look at solid rocket boosters. 
</P>
<P>
 And then the Claremont McKenna College students plunge into the nitty-gritty, 
pondering "space blues" and "space motion sickness" as part of a passenger 
rocket project for McDonnell Douglas Aerospace in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Claremont and 20 other campuses nationwide are part of McDonnell Douglas' 
University Alliance Program, a project that promotes space-science education 
for undergraduate liberal arts students. As part of the project, students are 
proposing design and licensing plans for the developing Delta Clipper, a 
reusable rocket that would propel 14 passengers into orbit for four days. 
</P>
<P>
 Not a bad assignment for a psychology class at Claremont, a small liberal arts 
college where students are more likely to study Sigmund Freud than Neil 
Armstrong. But Wichman, an experimental psychologist, hates drawing academic 
lines in the sand -- science students in their labs over here, psychology 
students with their rats over there. In his Claremont office, where a poster of 
the Wright brothers' plane adorns the wall, Wichman pounded his feet in mock 
frustration when asked how a psychology class got involved in a space flight 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bright people look at (the passenger rocket) and say, 'Gee, how much pressure 
would be in there?' They figure it out; it doesn't take high school algebra to 
figure that out!" said Wichman, 62, his voice rising, his hands slicing the air 
for emphasis. 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy to imagine the silver-haired professor as a wide-eyed 17-year-old in 
Milwaukee, where he piloted his first airplane, a 1939 50-horsepower J-3 Piper 
Cub. After that, Wichman fell hopelessly in love with flight; later, he became 
a flight instructor and former NASA Summer Faculty Fellow at the Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory. Wichman also worked as a psychological consultant for aerospace 
companies, designing everything from cockpit control panels to space stations. 
</P>
<P>
 He says his students are quick studies in "Psychology 102, Practicum in 
Aerospace Human Factors," which they take for psychology credit. Although the 
class involves some science, students learn mostly about the psychological 
aspects of space flight. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a liberal arts college!" exclaimed Wichman, who speaks in staccato, 
emphatic sentences. "We're supposed to be teaching students about everything! 
They should know something about science! They're going to be leaders of our 
nation!" 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, McDonnell Douglas managers asked him to work as a consultant on 
the Delta Clipper project, studying the psychological aspects of passenger 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, at Wichman's suggestion, McDonnell Douglas agreed to involve his 
classes as part of the University Alliance Project. The Claremont students' 
expenses -- about $3,000 a year for materials, travel and off-campus meals -- 
are paid by the James Irvine Foundation, a philanthropic organization in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Students work directly with McDonnell Douglas engineers, visiting the 
Huntington Beach office about twice a month. In March, Wichman and two student 
team leaders met in Albuquerque with McDonnell Douglas and federal officials to 
discuss the possibility of developing a civilian space port in New Mexico on 
government land. 
</P>
<P>
 The McDonnell Douglas team is developing an experimental single-stage reusable 
rocket under a two-year, $58-million grant from the federal Ballistic Missile 
Defense Organization. As a separate company project, McDonnell Douglas' goal is 
to develop the Delta Clipper by 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 The lightweight, inexpensive Clipper would take off vertically, orbit the 
earth and land in one stage without the unwieldy fuel tanks or booster rockets 
that characterize space shuttle flights. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Wichman's first semester class of nine students put together a model 
passenger compartment for the Clipper; they lacked real spare rocket parts, so 
they improvised with GI Joes in space suits and parts from a toy Corvette. They 
also wrote a report on Clipper flight operations. Among the considerations: 
regular meal schedules to cope with "space blues," a run-down, flu-like feeling 
experienced after eating in orbit. 
</P>
<P>
 The students also considered the dynamics of space flight among 14 people, 
particularly interaction among passengers of different ethnicities and 
cultures. They suggested that passengers write and exchange brief 
autobiographies before the flight. 
</P>
<P>
 William A. Gaubatz, director of the Delta Clipper Programs, called the 
students' work very professional. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of the concepts they came up with in terms of the public's flying was 
beyond just the specifics of flight times involved or seating arrangements," he 
said. "They also went into the potential makeup and diversity of passengers. . 
. . What they're doing is really so new that they are actually breaking the 
ground for new concepts and ideas that are going to be put into practice." 
</P>
<P>
 Wichman's second semester class of 12 students prepared a report on proposed 
federal licensing issues for passenger flights into space. This year's class of 
six students is continuing work on issues involved in licensing. As part of the 
Clipper project, they also are designing a passenger compartment for suborbital 
flights, such as rocket trips from continent to continent in 40 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the six students in the second semester of this year's limited 
enrollment class is eager to see the Clipper soar -- and they all hope to be on 
board someday, with stories for their children or grandchildren about how they 
had a hand in the rocket's birth. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'd be real neat to see it someday come into existence because then you 
could go, 'I was a part of that,' " said Will Dorsey, 20, a government and 
psychology major.

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; LOSSES AT QUEEN MARY ARE LESS THAN EXPECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN POPE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Queen Mary lost nearly $950,000 during the first three months of 1994, 
bringing the debt of the ship's management group to about $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials of RMS Foundation Inc., which runs the ship, said the loss was 
about 30% less than expected in a period when attendance at tourist attractions 
is usually at its lowest.The ship historically generates about 80% of its 
profits during the summer, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 The head of the group, Joseph F. Prevratil, said Tuesday that he has secured a 
letter of credit that will allow RMS to borrow the money it needs to pay most 
of the $3 million owed to creditors and to sustain the ship's operations until 
the profitable summer months. 
</P>
<P>
 Prevratil said he would not discuss details of the loan until next week. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, the foundation lost $4.2 million but showed a profit of $33,420 in 
December. Officials attributed much of the 1993 loss to start-up costs. 
</P>
<P>
 RMS spent $3 million to reopen and refurbish the city landmark after the 
former operators, the Walt Disney Co., left in 1992. RMS, a nonprofit 
management group, took over the ship in February, 1993, and began full tourism 
and hotel operations in June. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a rough first year," Prevratil said. "But we're anticipating a 
surplus by the end of the summer season." 
</P>
<P>
 The Queen Mary employs 550 people and will add 200 this summer. In the last 
three months, about 68,000 people visited the attraction, bringing in about 
$3.4 million in revenue. RMS paid $63,500 in bed taxes and about $20,000 in 
rent to the city during the period. 
</P>
<P>
 The 340-room hotel has a 35% occupancy rate, Prevratil said. It needs a 50% 
occupancy rate to break even. JOHN POPE

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state-appointed administrator running the Compton School District came 
under fire this week for recent appointments of new top administrators in the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrator J. Jerome Harris promoted Acting Supt.Harold Cebrun to 
superintendent. He also named George J. McKenna III, Inglewood school 
superintendent, as deputy superintendent of instruction, and Bonnie James, 
director of design and construction at Los Angeles Unified School District, as 
deputy superintendent of fiscal services, business operations and personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Cebrun, who came to the district in July, 1991, as an area superintendent and 
became acting superintendent in December, 1992, will be paid $105,000 under a 
one-year contract. McKenna and James, who signed four-year contracts, will earn 
$103,000 a year each.  
</P>
<P>
 Some critics said Harris was spending too much money for administrators in the 
financially strapped district; others expressed concern that all the new 
administrators are African American. 
</P>
<P>
 "Monies are not being directed where they are needed, in the classrooms," 
Margie Garrett, president of the Compton Education Assn., said this week at a 
school board meeting. "We are confused, upset and disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Amen Rahh echoed her concerns. "We now have six superintendents," 
he said. "Not one of them has anything to do with the children." 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Gorgonio Sanchez criticized the lack of Latino administrators. 
"It's very disappointing," Sanchez said. "We need Latinos in top positions." 
About 60% of the district's students are Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris did not respond at the meeting. But previously he had defended his 
choices, saying "an exceptional leadership team is needed" to turn around the 
beleaguered district.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CERRITOS; SCHOOL FISCAL ADVISERS MAY STAY, STATE RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State school officials have rejected the ABC School District's appeal of a 
county Office of Education decision to send a team of fiscal advisers into the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Keegan, an assistant state superintendent for school business 
services, said ABC officials failed to convince the state that the district had 
resolved its financial problems.ABC officials said they may take their battle 
against the county to court. 
</P>
<P>
 The county sent in fiscal advisers last month, after an analysis of the 
district's $69-million spending plan showed that ABC will have a budget deficit 
of $2.8 million in the next fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 The advisers, who have the authority to overrule the district's spending 
decisions, last month rescinded the ABC board's approval of a teachers' 
contract that includes a 1% salary bonus and reduced class sizes.

<P>
 The ABC Unified school board is scheduled Tuesday to consider testing a 
uniform dress code at five elementary schools in Cerritos and Artesia beginning 
in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents at the five schools overwhelmingly favor a uniform dress code on 
campus, a recent survey found. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 75% of the 1,379 parents who responded to a survey that was sent 
home in March said they favored the proposal to have the students wear uniforms 
in shades of gray, navy or plaid, school officials said. The survey was sent 
home with students at Burbank, Kennedy and Niemes elementary schools in 
Artesia, and Carver and Nixon elementary schools in Cerritos.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SAN PEDRO; PANEL FAILS TO RULE ON FIRING OF GARDENER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A key panel of the Los Angeles City Council has agreed that a city gardener 
improperly used public time and equipment to do private work at a home in San 
Pedro but could not decide whether his firing by the Recreation and Parks 
Department should be upheld. 
</P>
<P>
 The split decision by a joint committee of the council means the fate of 
Camilo Mandac, a six-year city employee, will be left to the full council at 
its meeting Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Last September, the department fired Mandac after concluding that he used city 
equipment, with two day laborers, to work on a private residence where he has 
been the gardener for 10 years. The department also found that Mandac used a 
city truck to buy gloves at a store and drop off his daughter at school. Both 
of those charges were brought to the department's attention by a call to a city 
"whistle-blower" hot line. 
</P>
<P>
 But after reviewing the case, the Recreation and Parks Commission decided last 
month that the discipline was excessive. It overturned Mandac's firing and 
ordered the department to give him $18,150 in back pay, which led Councilwoman 
Rita Walters to insist that the council review the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The review began Tuesday when recreation officials stood by their firing of 
Mandac. "Reinstating Mr. Mandac and paying him over $18,000 is a mockery of the 
whistle-blower program," Harold Fujita, a senior personnel analyst for the 
recreation department, told the council committees. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mandac and his attorney, Diane Marchant, denied the city's accusations, 
insisting that the gardener did not do private work on city time. And, they 
said, his immediate supervisors never made an issue of his other alleged 
indiscretions before his firing. 
</P>
<P>
 After a lengthy discussion, only Councilwoman Walters agreed to support 
Mandac's dismissal. GREG KRIKORIAN

TOPICS / BUSINESS; PARSONS GROUP PICKED TO HEAD AIRPORT PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of companies led by Pasadena-based Parsons Corp. has been selected to 
oversee a $200-million expansion of the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Parsons' largest subsidiary, Ralph M. Parsons Co., part of a joint venture 
called BGP Airport Associates, will oversee design, engineering and 
construction by 1998 of a 465,000-square-foot terminal with parking lots and 
access roads. 
</P>
<P>
 A commission that oversees the airport for Pasadena, Glendale and Burbank last 
week approved the Parsons venture. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport officials said contract negotiations will determine whether the 
Parsons venture may also oversee a second phase that by 2010 will see the 
building expand to 670,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 When the first expansion is complete, it will allow the airport to handle 5.4 
million passengers, a 17% increase from this year, said Victor Gill, an airport 
spokesman. In 2010 the airport is expected to handle 10 million passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport officials said the project will create several thousand jobs 
throughout the county. A date for groundbreaking has not been set. 
</P>
<P>
 Parsons beat out joint ventures Sverdrup/McCormick and Greiner-Genaler 
Associates for the deal, which could be worth as much as $20 million in 
management fees, according to officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The process was a "highly competitive" one that "reflects the time," said Ron 
Wildermuth of Parsons. "Our unparalleled track record in aviation management 
and our proximity to the site allowed us to beat the competition." 
</P>
<P>
 Parsons has handled the management of expansions of Dulles International 
Airport, Washington National and Orange County's John Wayne Airport, among 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 The competition was not without controversy. At least one airport commissioner 
questioned Parsons officials about their control of the Los Angeles Metro Red 
Line subway project. A report by the county's transit agency blamed Parsons and 
a Metro Red Line contractor for thin subway walls that resulted in questions 
over the safety of the tunnels. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport commissioners voted 9 to 0 for the Parsons venture last Monday.

TOPICS / CRIME; EL MONTE FELONY RATE RANKS LOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 El Monte ranked among the best among large cities nationwide that had low 
numbers of serious crimes last year, according to recent FBI statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Gabriel Valley city of 106,209 ranked 15th for low crime figures among 
187 U.S. cities with populations of more than 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, El Monte tallied 6,201 felony crimes, including murder, rape, 
robbery, assault, burglary, theft, auto theft and arson. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena, with a population of 131,591, ranked 52nd with 9,735 reported 
felonies. Pomona, with a population of 131,723, ranked 59th with 10,585.  
</P>
<P>
 The tally of raw numbers for the nation's largest cities is compiled from 
statistics reported by local law enforcement agencies, said FBI spokesman John 
Hoos. Because the figures are not adjusted for crimes per population, they are 
not an accurate ranking of safe cities, he said.

CITY LAUNCHES FULL-COURT PRESS AT PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The well-maintained basketball courts at Liberty Park, where nets are changed 
regularly and the playing surface is smoother than most tennis courts, are 
drawing too many serious basketball players from out of town, the Cerritos City 
Council has decided. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 3 to 2 last week to divide the courts by installing benches 
along mid-court lines. The benches would permit only half-court games and, city 
officials hope, reclaim the four courts at 19211 Studebaker Road for city 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Paul W. Bowlen said he voted to install the benches "so your average Joe 
who just wants to shoot some hoops has some access too." 
</P>
<P>
 As many as 200 players often gather at the courts on spring and summer 
evenings, park manager Ernest Vital said, and the wait for a game can stretch 
to three hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials also said they were concerned about the potential for violence. 
Basketball rims were removed for two weeks after a March 2 shooting incident at 
the park. Officials said one player fired shots at another player in a parking 
lot after an argument on the basketball court. Neither was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 The benches, which will cost $2,500, are scheduled to be installed within a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Grace Hu and Bruce W. Barrows voted against the proposal. Hu 
said she prefers installing a fence around the courts and requiring players to 
produce identification showing that they live in Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrows, who has coached youth basketball in the city since 1978, said he 
would like to preserve Liberty Park as a training ground for local players. 
</P>
<P>
 Artesia High School graduates Charles and Ed O'Bannon, now stars at UCLA, were 
once regulars at the park, along with USC alumnus Duane Cooper, now with the 
Phoenix Suns. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the half-dozen players assembled on the courts Friday evening were Ed 
Miller of Glendale and Rod Tolosa of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd stay in Long Beach if I knew it was safe enough," said Tolosa, 23. 
"People come here to play ball; there's no gangbangers here." 
</P>
<P>
 When told of the city's plans, the 24-year-old Miller said, "Oh man, that's 
sad." GREG MILLER

TOPICS / RELIGION; DISAPPEARING RETREAT; JESUIT HIDEAWAY ON MONROVIA NURSERY 
LAND WILL CLOSE AUG. 28. ENCROACHING DEVELOPMENT AND A BUILDING IN DISREPAIR 
LED TO DECISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 For almost 50 years, the Manresa Jesuit Retreat House was a place for everyone 
from recovering alcoholics to those seeking to escape the daily pressure cooker 
of life in L.A. for a weekend of meditation and prayer. But escalating 
maintenance bills and the possibility of a new housing development have cost 
the San Gabriel Valley one of its last slices of serenity. 
</P>
<P>
 The retreat house, on about six acres of the 600-acre Monrovia Nursery in the 
foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains near Azusa, has been put up for sale and 
will close Aug. 28, said the Rev. Gerald Robinson, the retreat's executive 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're pretty upset about it," said Ruben Quezada, director of plant 
operations at the retreat, who has worked there 15 years. Quezada is among 20 
employees who will lose their jobs when Manresa closes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like losing your home," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jesuits who run Manresa have decided to look for a new location and 
rebuild rather than spend the hundreds of thousands of dollars needed to repair 
the 62-year-old house's plumbing and lighting fixtures, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason for the move was that the nursery and a developer have been 
discussing building housing on the nursery property -- a move some priests 
believe would ruin the retreat's tranquil atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokespeople from Monrovia Nursery and Lewis Homes said they have considered 
building houses on the property since the late 1980s. The nursery has not 
decided to sell any of the land, although the prime real estate could command a 
price well into the millions of dollars, marketing director Rodger Duer said.

 Tate Tuckman knows all about computer graphic programs -- how to double-click 
the mouse, select items from a pull-down menu at the top of the screen and 
erase a mistake with one tap of the escape key. 
</P>
<P>
 Not bad for a 4-year-old whose hand hardly spans the mouse and whose nose hits 
the rim of the keyboard. 
</P>
<P>
 "She can't even read yet," said her mother, Dory O'Toole. "I'm completely in 
awe of what kids can do. I'm not that computer-literate." 
</P>
<P>
 And that's why O'Toole was among several hundred Manhattan Beach parents who 
brought their children to the school district's Family Technology Night at Mira 
Costa High School last week. The program was a cooperative effort among the 
Manhattan Beach Unified School District, software maker Microsoft, Compaq 
Computers and CompUSA. 
</P>
<P>
 A multimedia presentation served as an introduction to Microsoft's educational 
software, but the real draws were the hands-on demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Brent Skeens Willy, 5, was too engrossed in a downhill ski simulation to talk. 
"We came to find what programs are best for him, and what's educational," said 
his mother, Betsy. "Anything to get him away from those Mighty Morphin Power 
Rangers." 
</P>
<P>
 Most adults hung back, but children rushed up to the computers, often tapping 
the keyboard and mouse simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is all very intuitive for kids," said Jeff Olander, a Microsoft 
representative. "They'll just pick it up and start playing with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Marlene Ramirez shook her head as she leaned over her two children, peering at 
the computer screen. "This is wonderful," she said. "You feel like you want to 
catch up with your kids." SAMANTHA DUNN

POLITICAL NOTEBOOK: DILLS GETS AN ALLY IN SENATE RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EMILY ADAMS and TED JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Longtime state Sen. Ralph C. Dills (D-Gardena), who is facing a strong 
challenge in the June 7 primary, is enjoying the support of Senate President 
Pro Tem Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward) in a race that touches on a 50-year-old issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockyer has criticized Torrance Councilman George Nakano, a Japanese American 
who spent four years in a relocation camp during World War II, for challenging 
Dills in the Democratic primary in the 28th Senate District, which includes 
Long Beach and Compton. Dills, 84, has long been personally and politically 
allied with Japanese Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything I have heard is that council member Nakano is a very fine person," 
Lockyer said. But he noted that Dills was vilified by colleagues in 1943 when 
he was a state assemblyman for opposing Japanese internment camps. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's something wrong about terminating" Dills' career when it is "about to 
end anyway because of term limits by someone who is from the (Japanese 
American) community," Lockyer said. "People's memories should not be so short." 
</P>
<P>
 Nakano called Lockyer's comment "a very condescending remark." 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone took a strong stand for women's rights, does that mean a woman 
shouldn't be able to run against them?" Nakano said. 
</P>

 FIRST NAME, PLEASE: Two unrelated lawyers who have the same last name, Polsky, 
are heading to court Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble began when Trudy Polsky, a real estate lawyer and Long Beach City 
College trustee, stopped by her favorite donut shop one morning last month. 
There, in the store window, was a big sign reading "Polsky . . . Municipal 
Court Judge."  
</P>
<P>
 The problem was, she wasn't running for office. Alexander Polsky, a Long Beach 
resident taking his first crack at elected office, was the Polsky on the sign. 
Trudy Polsky, fearing her good name was being used to someone else's advantage, 
asked an employee to take the sign out of the window. Alexander Polsky heard 
about his sign being removed and reportedly became upset. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander Polsky said he would add his first name to the signs, but didn't do 
it fast enough to satisfy Trudy Polsky. She, on the other hand, continued to 
annoy him by asking merchants to remove the signs. 
</P>
<P>
 She filed suit in Long Beach Superior Court last month, asking that a judge 
order Alexander Polsky to include his first name prominently on all signs.

 ARCADIA: A gunman robbed Fidelity Federal Bank at 1400 S. Baldwin Ave. at 2:30 
p.m. Friday, police said. The man forced tellers to give him more than $1,000, 
then fled through the lobby. No injuries were reported and no arrests have been 
made, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 BALDWIN PARK: A man found shot to death over the weekend in an industrial area 
of Baldwin Park was identified Monday, Sheriff's Department deputies said. 
Anthony Herrera, 29, died from several gunshot wounds to his upper body, 
deputies said. Herrera was shot just before 7 p.m. Sunday in the 4200 block of 
North Park Avenue. A man was reportedly seen leaving the scene in a pickup 
truck, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 EL MONTE: Officers arrested two men after they attempted to rob a shoe store 
May 4 and then fled to an occupied apartment to hide from police. Hugo 
Gonzales, 26, of San Gabriel and Jose Mario Martinez, 20, of El Monte were 
caught after they tried to rob the Payless Shoe Store at 11865 Valley Blvd. 
about 4:15 p.m., police said. During the robbery, a store employee tripped the 
alarm. As police cars drove in front of the shoe store, the men ran out the 
front door and into an apartment complex in the 11800 block of Lansdale Street, 
police said. They reportedly forced entry into one of the units and confronted 
a man and a woman in the apartment. While the man struggled with the two, the 
woman called the police, and the two were arrested a short time later. No 
injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
 PASADENA: A 22-year-old man was shot in the face Sunday in the 1900 block of 
Summit Avenue about 9 a.m., police said. His name was not released. The man was 
hospitalized in critical condition. No arrests have been made and the shooting 
is under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 SAN DIMAS: Two men were arrested and more than two pounds of high-grade "China 
white" heroin were seized in a raid on a San Dimas home last Thursday, agents 
from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration reported. Thomas Riley, 58, of 
San Dimas and Eldon Han, 43, of Honolulu were booked for investigation of 
processing and distributing cocaine, agents said. Riley was arrested after he 
allegedly sold 350 grams of heroin to undercover agents in an Ontario hotel 
parking lot. The rest of the substance, which had an estimated street value of 
$1 million, was found at his San Dimas home, where Han was arrested, agents 
said. The arrests capped a two-year investigation into what DEA officials 
allege is a large network that smuggles heroin from Southeast Asia to points in 
the United States. The investigation was carried out by agents from the DEA, 
the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department, the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department and the Inland Regional Narcotics Enforcement Task Force, 
agents said. Riley and Han were being held without bail at the downtown federal 
detention center pending a preliminary hearing May 19. 
</P>
<P>
 SAN MARINO: The investigation into the case of a dismembered body found in the 
back yard of a home in the 1900 block of Lorain Road is continuing, deputies 
reported Monday. A trisected skeleton wrapped in plastic was unearthed last 
Thursday afternoon by workers digging a hole for a new pool. The remains have 
not been identified by the county coroner's office, deputies said. Detectives 
have speculated that the remains may be related to a missing persons report 
filed with the San Marino Police Department in 1985. The report was filed by a 
former resident of the house, Ruth (DiDi) Sohus, after her adopted son 
Jonathan, and his wife, Linda, disappeared on their way to Europe. A search of 
the yard has revealed no further human remains.

SCHOOLS; SAN MARINO LETS STUDENTS SKIP TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Concerned that the new California Learning Assessment (CLAS) test may violate 
an education code that prohibits questions about students' personal beliefs, 
the San Marino Board of Education offered parents the option of excusing their 
children from the exam. 
</P>
<P>
 The offer drew a strong response.Of the 228 eighth-grade students scheduled to 
take the math portion of the test Friday, more than half, 135, were exempted, 
Supt. Thomas Godley said. Three more students were exempted from Tuesday's 
language portion of the test. 
</P>
<P>
 The board reviewed the test at a closed session May 4 and determined that some 
questions may violate Section 60650 of the state Education Code, which bars 
tests from examining students' personal or religious beliefs, or family life. 
</P>
<P>
 The tests have been controversial statewide, with many parents and districts 
expressing concerns about essay-format questions that ask students to express 
their thoughts or feelings or to relate writings to their own experiences. A 
Los Angeles County Superior Court judge ruled Tuesday that the test did not 
violate the education code. 
</P>
<P>
 After the meeting, the board issued a letter to parents stating that children 
could be excused from the exam. Godley said that although students cannot be 
required to take any standardized exam, it is unusual for a school to offer an 
exemption. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Graham, a parent who organized an informational meeting last week, 
praised the decision: "We believe after viewing this test that the educational 
code was being violated, as were our rights as parents."

 CLAREMONT: John Ball, science department chair of the Webb Schools, college 
preparatory high schools, received an $8,500 grant to design an interactive 
museum exhibit on the motion of dinosaurs. The computer-based exhibit will be

 RAGING WATERS 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach Wilson High boys' swim team remained undefeated in league 
competition for the 22nd consecutive year in the Moore League finals Friday at 
Belmont Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins, who finished 5-0 in league, won the team title with 369 points, 
followed by Long Beach Poly and Lakewood with 349 and 175, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson will return to Belmont Plaza this afternoon and begin its quest to beat 
defending champion Crescenta Valley for the Southern Section Division II title. 
Preliminaries begin at 5 p.m. The finals are scheduled for 7 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Westberg won the 100-yard freestyle (48.02 seconds), 100 backstroke 
(56.89) and swam a leg on Wilson's 200 freestyle relay team of Pat Cochran, 
Keith Feldman and Matt Armato, which won in 1 minute 30.41 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Armato and Cochran, who won the 50 freestyle in 22.03, also joined Damon Baggs 
and Sean McEachern on the Bruins' victorious 200 medley relay (1:42.43). 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy Bastain, Carrie Rowe, Kristie Barth and Lauren Westberg broke a 13-year 
Moore League record by nearly seven seconds in winning the 400-yard freestyle 
in 3:42.99 as the Wilson girls swam away from Poly, 375-296, for the team title 
Thursday. BIG FOUR 
</P>
<P>
 St. Joseph High doesn't figure to have another player such as Lisa Fernandez 
for some time. The 1989 graduate went on to UCLA, where she became a four-time 
All-American and three-time Honda-Broderick Award winner. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jesters, though, haven't been short on pitching this season with a 
four-player rotation of Villanova-bound Kristin Bailey (6-3) and juniors 
Adrianna Paz (4-0), Carla Workman (3-0) and Shana Rizzo (2-1). 
</P>
<P>
 The four have combined for seven shutouts and 0.40 earned-run average. Rizzo 
and Workman have each pitched a no-hitter. Senior first baseman Monique Jimenez 
leads the team in batting with a .400 average and has nine runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Joseph (14-5, 7-2), the defending Del Rey League champion, has clinched 
its 12th berth in postseason play and entered the week tied for first with 
Bishop Amat in the league standings. MATTER OF TIME 
</P>
<P>
 Karl Williams of Richmond, Va., holds the age 15 national record of 37.9 for 
the 300-meter hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
 But freshman Kenyon Rambo of Long Beach Poly isn't far behind the 1974 
standard, running 38.07 at the Moore League finals Saturday at Veterans 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Statistically, Rambo, who ran 38.09 at the Mt. San Antonio College Relays in 
April, has already surpassed the mark. Rambo's fully automatic time is 
intrinsically superior to Williams' hand time which converts to a 38.14 
electronic mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Rambo, who also won the 110-meter hurdles in 14.44 at the Moore League meet, 
will get another shot at the record Friday in the Southern Section Division I 
preliminaries at Veterans Stadium. LUCKY IN LAS VEGAS 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach State baseball team moved into a tie for first place in the Big 
West Conference in the loss column with a three-game sweep at Nevada Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach (35-14, 13-5 in the Big West) had 58 hits, including 15 home runs, 
and 47 runs against the Rebels. The 49ers had 26 hits and six home runs in a 
19-8 victory Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirk Pierce had three home runs and reached based 13 times in 16 plate 
appearances in the series. The junior catcher drove in seven runs and also 
scored eight runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach is tied with Cal State Fullerton (15-5) and Nevada (13-5) with a 
three-game Big West series against Pacific remaining Friday, Saturday and 
Sunday at Blair Field. GOLF AND STUFF 
</P>
<P>
 Jin Park, 14, became the youngest player to win the Long Beach Match Play 
championship in the tournament's 70-year history Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The freshman at Sunny Hills High in Fullerton won the 36-hole event at 
Skylinks golf course over Mike Davis of Yorba Linda with a par on the final 
hole. Park and Davis, 25, earned berths in the amateur field for the Long Beach 
Open. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Yanagisawa became the first Moore League individual titlist from Long 
Beach Poly High in 18 years on May 4 at El Dorado Park. Yanagisawa finished 
with a three-day total of 221. Mike Hasselman of Millikan and David Cameron of 
Long Beach Wilson tied for second, two strokes back. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Martin of St. John Bosco won the Del Rey League title at Hansen Dam and 
Han Lee of Cerritos was the winner in the San Gabriel Valley League at Los 
Serranos course. TOURNAMENT TIME

EDUCATION: JUSTIFYING STATE ASSESSMENT TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Several months ago, prior to the release of last year's results, our school 
district protested to the state about the validity of California Learning 
Assessment System (CLAS) tests and how reliable they were in assessing the 
effectiveness of any school's educational program. As a matter of fact, we were 
concerned about every aspect of this test. 
</P>
<P>
 Now my personal concern is the misinformation being given to parents regarding 
who is responsible. The governor and the state Legislature have mandated this 
test. If we refuse to give it, we are violating a state-directed mandate and 
risk a loss of revenue. To bring a lawsuit against the state would be spending 
taxpayers' dollars on a meaningless suit, and would be nothing more than tax 
dollars being used for one public agency against another. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor and the state Legislature have the final authority on the 
continuation of the CLAS test. I urge parents to direct their opinions to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't it about time for Gov. Wilson and other elected officials to take a 
stand and justify the purpose and expenditures being used for this purpose?

FOR TEENS; KID SUCCESS; HOW DO YOU GET TO CARNEGIE HALL? DUARTE HIGH SENIOR 
KNOWS THE WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Duarte High School senior Ann Choe hadn't heard from Michael Nuss, her former 
choir director, since eighth grade. Then came the call in September: Nuss 
invited her to audition for the 1994 National Youth Honor Choir. 
</P>
<P>
 She passed the test and on April 24 sang with 300 choir students at the 
National Youth Choral Festival at Carnegie Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really honored," Choe said, "considering (the competition) was from all 
over the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 Choe had sung in a choir that was directed by Nuss and sponsored by the 
Western division of the American Choral Directors Assn., which included youths 
from California, Nevada, Utah and Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for this year, eighth grade was the only time she had been able to fit 
a choir class into her schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 During her first three years of high school, academics and other interests 
took priority. Choe's accomplishments include: class vice president all four 
years at Duarte; advanced placement classes; a cheerleader for two years, and 
now a member of the Ancient Order of the Falcons, a school honor society for 
community service. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ann has a beautiful voice and she's also a hard worker. To be a singer, you 
need to be both," said Janice Burgoyne, Choe's current choir teacher.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've always liked singing," said Choe, who also sings in her church's youth 
choir. She first performed in a children's group when she was 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Her first love, however, is art. Choe wants to be a professional artist and 
hopes to study art at UCLA in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The trip to Carnegie Hall took more than practice. Choe said the excursion 
cost about $2,000 for her and her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Duarte High's booster club sponsors a bingo night and has a program to share 
proceeds with campus clubs in exchange for volunteer work. In an unusual move, 
it agreed to let Choe earn money toward the expenses of her trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been working since December, every Saturday," she said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CLAREMONT; UNWELCOME TATTOO STUDIO RELOCATES OUTSIDE THE CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A tattoo studio, which prompted the City Council to pass a four-month 
moratorium on tattooing within city limits when the business moved to a 
shopping center a block from City Hall, has moved out of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Since May 1, Claremont Tattoo has been operating out of a shop in Rancho 
Cucamonga, at 8036 Archibald Ave., said co-owner Leah Pierce.Although Pierce is 
appealing her case to the council and the Planning Department, she is unsure 
whether she will take the city to court. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials passed the moratorium March 22 after the tattoo studio moved 
into The Village, a shopping district near City Hall. A city staff report 
presented to the council cited worries about needle disposal and the spread of 
the AIDS virus as the main reasons for the ban.

 Families laid flowers Sunday on the steps of Pasadena City Hall and musicians 
played classical music during a two-hour Mother's Day Vigil sponsored by the 
Coalition for a Non-Violent City. 
</P>
<P>
 The event, which attracted nearly 100 people, commemorated the Oct. 31 slaying 
of three Pasadena teen-agers, gunned down on a sidewalk as they walked home 
from a Halloween party.Five alleged Pasadena gang members face trial for the 
killings June 13 in Los Angeles Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the shootings, the coalition has continued its work for gun control 
legislation and for programs to counter violence. A month ago, the group opened 
an office at 118 S. Oak Knoll Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, more than 400 people have signed up to provide volunteer youth 
services, said coalition spokesman Louis Fleming. A Father's Day march, a youth 
employment program and an Oct. 1 daylong conference dealing with the roots of 
violence also are planned by the group.

<P>
 Eight months after he was shot and killed, more than $56,000 has been raised 
in memory of attorney Adam Scott, son of Pasadena City College President Jack 
Scott. 
</P>
<P>
 Donations for the memorial fund at the USC Law Center have come primarily from 
individuals, said Karen Lash, assistant dean.The money will fund 10-week summer 
fellowships for students to work on issues that were important to Scott, such 
as homelessness, AIDS, the environment and gun control. 
</P>
<P>
 Lash said donations are still being sought to reach a goal of $80,000, which 
would provide a $4,000 annual fellowship. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott was slain Oct. 23 in Los Angeles when Ethan DuBrow, a friend of Scott's, 
allegedly displayed a new shotgun. DuBrow faces trial June 16 in Los Angeles 
Superior Court on involuntary manslaughter charges.

<P>
 The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department has assigned a motorcycle patrol 
to the Palos Verdes Peninsula for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Andrew Parrott of the Lomita sheriff's station patrols in Rancho Palos 
Verdes, Rolling Hills and Rolling Hills Estates during the day Monday through 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Palos Verdes Estates has its own Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic Sgt. Thomas Thomas said although accident rates on the peninsula have 
decreased for three years, the cities requested a motorcycle patrol to cut down 
on response time. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's an accident, the road's basically shut down until it's cleaned up, 
and if (the officer is) in a regular car, he's stuck in traffic like everybody 
else," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 The patrol will continue for at least a year, he said. SUSAN WOODWARD

COVER STORY; CRIME BY THE NUMBERS; AS DOWNEY CASE SHOWS, CREDIT FRAUD IS A 
PERVASIVE PROBLEM

<P>
 Each time, the news came as a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 One woman received a note from a department store thanking her for buying $600 
worth of cosmetics she knew nothing about. Another discovered $3,200 in charges 
for jewelry she had never seen. A third learned that someone used an automated 
teller machine to withdraw $1,000 from her credit account. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say one person, Debra LaGrone of Downey, carried out each 
transaction. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court documents, LaGrone allegedly stole credit card numbers and 
other personal information while working at various mortgage companies, then 
purchased thousands of dollars worth of goods in the names of people she had 
never met. 
</P>
<P>
 When Downey investigators searched LaGrone's townhouse in January, they found 
credit cards with other people's names and account numbers, jewelry that had 
been fraudulently purchased, and a spiral notebook filled with names, home 
addresses and credit information of people who had recently refinanced their 
homes. Authorities identified at least 15 individuals across Southern 
California as victims, in addition to numerous small merchants, department 
stores, credit card companies and banks that suffered thousands of dollars in 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
 LaGrone, 39, who has held a variety of jobs in the loan business in the last 
20 years, faces 16 felony charges, including commercial burglary and receiving 
stolen property. She is in jail in lieu of $55,000 bail and awaits a June 9 
pretrial hearing in Norwalk Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 LaGrone has pleaded not guilty and contends that a friend who was recently 
convicted of a similar crime left the questionable credit cards at LaGrone's 
house and gave her some of the merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators say the case is a brazen example of what they call the crime of 
the '90s -- credit card fraud perpetrated by individuals and organized rings 
who rip off an estimated $1 billion a year in goods and cash nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Thieves have been known to steal credit information from mailboxes and garbage 
bins, during home burglaries or after purse-snatchings. But authorities are 
increasingly concerned about insiders -- bank tellers, real estate agents, 
automobile salespeople, loan processors and others -- who have access to 
confidential information that can open doors to lines of credit and bank 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 People with credit cards rarely lose huge sums of money when their cards are 
used to make unauthorized purchases. Their liability is limited to $50 per 
card. But it often takes months to purge their credit reports -- a process some 
have called a bureaucratic nightmare. Even worse, some victims say, is the 
anguish of knowing that someone has tapped into their personal lives and has 
access to their Social Security numbers, home addresses, dates of birth and 
other family history.  
</P>
<P>
 "I feel violated," said Orange resident Debbie Gallegos, an alleged victim of 
LaGrone. "Someone (has) assumed your identity. That's what is terrifying. You 
don't know who's doing it or why." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, LaGrone allegedly obtained Gallegos' credit card account numbers, a 
secret password on one account and new credit cards. Authorities say that 
LaGrone made $1,000 in withdrawals on Gallegos' account at an automated teller 
machine in Downey and received $2,500 in cash advances that were charged to 
Gallegos' account at various Sears stores, court documents show. 
</P>
<P>
 Downey investigators suspect that LaGrone gained access to Gallegos' credit 
information while working at a Newport Beach mortgage company last summer. 
Gallegos refinanced her home through the company early last year. When company 
officials checked recently, they found that information was missing from 
Gallegos' file, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 LaGrone is accused of obtaining confidential information on numerous other 
people from files at companies in Los Angeles and Orange counties. She 
allegedly contacted credit card companies, reported cards missing and then 
requested replacements as well as address changes, according to court records.  
</P>
<P>
 Posing as the cardholders, LaGrone allegedly applied for loans and obtained 
cash advances in other people's names, made cash withdrawals and ordered 
merchandise through department stores, jewelry boutiques and clothing 
catalogues, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In one instance, one of the victims had nearly the same name, Dorothy LaGrone. 
Over a several-month period last year, Debra LaGrone allegedly used Dorothy 
LaGrone's name and credit history to obtain a $2,500 loan and purchase 
thousands of dollars in goods, including $9,300 in jewelry from a Costa Mesa 
store, court records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Even an attorney hired to represent Debra LaGrone early in the case was 
apparently caught in the web, police say. LaGrone allegedly used someone else's 
credit card number to pay $1,000 to attorney John McDonald, court records show. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, authorities documented more than $50,000 worth of purchases, many of 
them allegedly delivered to Debra LaGrone's Downey residence and to her 
mother's former home in Bellflower. Her mother, Kathleen Montgomery, said no 
goods were delivered to the Bellflower home. 
</P>
<P>
 Downey fraud detectives, who spent 2 1/2 months on the case, say the actual 
amount of purchases and number of victims may never be known. "I think we 
uncovered the tip of the iceberg," said Sgt. Greg Griffin, who led the Downey 
police investigation. "There were so many credit card numbers in (LaGrone's) 
day planners that we didn't have time to check them all." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's fraud detectives began an investigation last July after a security 
officer from the Broadway department store in Cerritos complained that someone 
had made several unauthorized purchases on a customer's credit card. Downey 
detectives later began their own investigation after receiving a fraud 
complaint from a credit card company. 
</P>
<P>
 LaGrone was arrested Oct. 4 and released on bail two days later. She was 
arrested again Jan. 14 after police searched her Downey residence. She told 
police that the goods found in her house had been given to her or sold to her 
by a friend who had also worked at some of the same mortgage companies. LaGrone 
also said that credit cards in other people's names and account information had 
been left behind by the friend. LaGrone said the friend was having mail in 
other people's names delivered to the Downey address. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the friend, who was recently convicted of fraudulently using 
a bank card in an unrelated case in Orange County, is not a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 LaGrone's attorney, Charles Mullis, scoffed at police contentions that LaGrone 
masterminded a clever scheme. He said authorities have no proof that LaGrone 
was the person who purchased fraudulent goods over the phone through companies 
such as the Home Shopping Network, which sell merchandise on television. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Debra LaGrone is such a sophisticated criminal, why was she dumb enough to 
have all the stuff mailed to her address?" Mullis asked. "Police assume it was 
Debra LaGrone because the merchandise was shipped to her house, but it's not an 
open-shut case." 
</P>
<P>
 LaGrone's daughter, Sheri, said her mother, a 1972 graduate of Lynwood High 
School, would not jeopardize a career of more than 20 years in the loan 
business in which she rose from a secretary to loan processor jobs earning more 
than $40,000 a year.  
</P>
<P>
 Sheri LaGrone, 18, also was arrested but was not charged. She said she 
frequently turned away goods delivered to the condominium in other people's 
names. She insisted, however that her mother, who is divorced, is innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know my mom wouldn't do this," she said. "I'm watching my mother go through 
this trouble for something she didn't do. It seems like the police can send her 
to jail, innocent or not innocent." 
</P>
<P>
 Police say they have identified Debra LaGrone in surveillance photographs at 
an automated teller machine in Downey withdrawing funds on the credit account 
of one of the alleged fraud victims, Debbie Gallegos. LaGrone told police the 
card belonged to the friend, who had asked LaGrone to withdraw money. 
</P>
<P>
 Two eyewitnesses also have identified LaGrone in court as the person who 
purchased jewelry and applied for a loan using other people's credit or 
identification, court records show. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Downey investigators found a credit report in LaGrone's townhouse 
belonging to a client of one company where she had worked. LaGrone told police 
she had taken the file home to work on it, records indicate. Details of the 
search and the victims' accounts are documented in a stack of police reports 
nearly an inch thick. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer advocates say cardholders have good reason to be concerned about 
whether their credit information is secure. Many companies don't do an adequate 
job of screening employees who have access to personal information about 
customers, critics say. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of LaGrone's previous employers, for example, said they were unaware that 
she had been convicted in 1988 on charges of check forgery and sentenced to 60 
days in jail and three years' probation. They said they would not have hired 
her had they known of the conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics also say there are so many credit cards in use that offenders can go 
undetected for months or years. 
</P>
<P>
 Credit card companies say they have tightened security during the last decade. 
They use computers to detect unusual spending activity on clients' accounts, 
such as numerous expensive purchases in a short period. Citibank, the nation's 
largest issuer of Visa and MasterCard credit cards, contacts customers in such 
cases to confirm that the charges are authentic, spokeswoman Susan Weeks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some credit card companies place clients' pictures on cards and use 
three-dimensional images to make alterations more difficult. But critics say 
those safeguards have limited value because so many credit purchases are now 
made over the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators also say that as the technology to fight the problem improves, 
so will the crooks' ingenuity. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "If we come up with the most foolproof system to beat credit card fraud, 
somebody is going to find a way to beat the system," said Sgt. John Garcia of 
the Los Angeles County sheriff's forgery and fraud detail. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say the credit card industry also contributes to the problem by 
mailing out pre-approved credit applications that can be stolen from mailboxes 
and garbage bins. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still get calls from consumers saying they are getting unsolicited credit 
cards in the mail," said Gail Hillebrand, an attorney with the nonprofit 
Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer Reports magazine. "It's a continuing 
complaint." 
</P>
<P>
 Victims such as Debbie Gallegos and Dorothy LaGrone, meanwhile, are stuck 
trying to clear up their credit problems and say it will take years for the 
psychological wounds to heal. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorothy LaGrone has canceled several of her cards and said she doubts whether 
she will order new ones. Gallegos has spent months notifying credit card 
companies of fraudulent charges on her credit accounts, placing a hold on eight 
of her cards at one point to guard against fraudulent spending sprees. She says 
she is more cautious than ever about giving out personal information. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people ask for my Social Security number now, it sends shivers down my 
spine," Gallegos said. "I really think twice about how it can be passed along 
down the road." Protecting Against Credit Card Fraud 
</P>
<P>
 * Never give out your credit card number over the phone unless you are calling 
a company you know to be reputable. 
</P>
<P>
 * Do not write your card number on postcards or envelopes as part of a deal to 
get prizes or gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep copies of your receipts when making a purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 * Shred receipts before throwing them away. 
</P>
<P>
 * Destroy old credit cards once they have expired, preferably by cutting them 
in half. Make sure the card number is illegible. 
</P>
<P>
 * Do not leave your credit card in hotel rooms or exposed on restaurant tables 
for long periods. The account number can be copied.  
</P>
<P>
 * Notify your credit card company if you don't receive your billing statement 
on time. Open statements promptly and make sure all the charges are yours. 
Immediately report any unauthorized charges.

POLITICAL SHIFT COST OVROM HER JOB; TEMPLE CITY: A NEWLY ELECTED COUNCILMAN 
SAYS THE FORMER CITY MANAGER'S SPENDING PATTERN DID NOT FIT THE CITY COUNCIL'S 
EMERGING FISCAL CONSERVATISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD WINTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Temple City Council's decision to oust City Manager Denise Ovrom was 
prompted by recent election victories of fiscal conservatives, according a 
council member. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the council considered this shift a mandate to curb spending and 
find a like-minded administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 Ovrom, 43, agreed to leave her post after a closed-door meeting May 3. Her 
four-year tenure saw redevelopment around Las Tunas Drive, assessment fee hikes 
for lighting and parks and an uproar over a proposed utility tax that 
ultimately was rejected by residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Considering the large voter turnout, I believe there's a mandate for 
reversing City Hall's tax-and-spend attitude. We just wanted to make certain we 
have a like-minded city manager," said newly elected Councilman Kenneth G. 
Gillanders. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to oust Ovrom came less than a month after the April 12 city 
election, in which incumbents Bobbie McGowan and Mary Manning, both Ovrom 
supporters, lost to two candidates favoring tighter spending and opposed to any 
utility tax or existing assessment fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillanders, Planning Commissioner Charles Sounder and incumbent Cathe Wilson 
were elected on pledges to cut spending before increasing taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The council authorized a $70,000 buyout of Ovrom's contract, according to City 
Atty. Charles Martin, who was appointed interim city manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Announcing the decision, Mayor Harry Budds said the new council desired a 
change of direction. He declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Most council members, said Gillanders, believed the public was not willing to 
accept more taxes and increased spending, while Ovrom saw that as the only way 
to promote growth in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like many in the new crop of city managers, (Ovrom) was educated in the same 
school of tax-and-spend government . . . that's why so many city managers are 
changing nowadays," said Gillanders, who served on the council from 1978 to 
1990 and campaigned for fiscal conservatism and increased reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 Ovrom did not return telephone calls. She is the sixth city administrator to 
be ousted from a San Gabriel Valley city in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Councilwoman Manning said she was not surprised by the council action. 
Ovrom "did so much for this community in her time," said Manning. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning also said she finds it strange that candidates who promised fiscal 
conservatism would spend $70,000 to buy out the city manager's contract that 
expires in June, 1995, hire an interim administrator at $2,500 per month and 
initiate an expensive search for a replacement.  
</P>
<P>
 Martin said the city will begin a search for a replacement immediately. He 
will fill the temporary role of interim administrator for four months at an 
additional salary of $2,500 a month. Ovrom earned $86,000 a year plus benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the San Gabriel Valley, Ovrom joins these administrators ousted in the 
last year: Arcadia's Donald Duckworth, Baldwin Park's Donald Penman, Bradbury's 
Aurora (Dolly) Vollaire, Covina's John R. Thomson and Sierra Madre's James E. 
McRea.

PASADENA CONSIDERS ITS RESPONSE TO FINDING OF GENDER BIAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK HOLGUIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Faced with a consultant's report that City Atty. Victor Kaleta discriminated 
against female staffers, the Pasadena City Council has hired a private lawyer 
to determine what action to take. 
</P>
<P>
 The council conferred with Pasadena lawyer Carolyn Carlburg in a confidential 
session Monday, but no action is expected until next week at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials declined to provide details of the meeting. And most declined 
to comment on possible responses to the report on Kaleta. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole purpose of this inquiry is to give a fair and impartial review of 
the situation," Councilman Rick Cole said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Isaac Richard, a strong critic of Kaleta, said in an interview 
that the city attorney should be placed on administrative leave pending a 
council decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting legal advice from a city attorney who's being investigated for 
civil rights violations. This is a logistical problem," Richard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaleta declined to comment on the allegations against him or to say whether he 
had retained a lawyer. "I don't want to try this in the newspaper," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an April 14 confidential report obtained by The Times, work-conflict 
consultant Rebecca Rojas said female lawyers in the civil branch of the city 
attorney's office have suffered discrimination in nearly every area of 
employment -- promotions, salaries, bonuses and fringe benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the damage, according to Rojas, stemmed from a 1992 reorganization of 
the nine-lawyer civil division. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the reorganization, Assistant City Atty. Ann Higgenbotham was second in 
command of the office. But in 1992, Kaleta removed Higgenbotham from 
supervisory duty and gave five male lawyers the same title and equal standing, 
Rojas said. 
</P>
<P>
 The reorganization left only three deputy city attorneys -- all women -- in 
the civil division. Rojas found that Kaleta did not advise deputy city 
attorneys Carolyn Williams, Ann Rider and Julia Weston of the opportunity for 
promotion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Female attorneys had been discriminated against because they had not been 
informed of the possibility of promotion and excluded from consideration for 
promotion," Rojas wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Rider declined to comment, and Higgenbotham, Williams and Weston could not be 
reached. 
</P>
<P>
 Rojas also found disparities between men and women in salary, merit pay and 
fringe benefits. Male attorneys with less tenure in the office have a higher 
average salary than female attorneys with more tenure, her report said. The 
report did not provide specific salary figures. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also found that male attorneys who received a "superior" rating on 
recent annual performances were awarded more merit pay than female lawyers with 
the same rating. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, car allowances have been given to male attorneys but never to 
female attorneys in the civil division, Rojas said. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation of Kaleta was triggered by a December memo written by an 
unidentified staff member, who complained of disparate treatment of women.

SECURITY PLAN FOR WORLD CUP OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Pasadena City Council approved a security plan Monday that calls for World 
Cup USA 1994 to pay the city as much as $4.6 million to provide security during 
a monthlong span of eight games at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, the city would use some of the money to contract with the Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department and the California Highway Patrol for 
additional staffing during the games, which begin June 18 and conclude with the 
championship game July 17.

RETIRED NURSE PAYING PRICE AS VICTIM IN FRAUD SCHEME 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dorothy LaGrone said she first noticed something irregular last July. 
</P>
<P>
 The 74-year-old retired nurse, who has lived at her Anaheim residence for 26 
years, received a card from the post office confirming an address change. A few 
months later, she discovered that someone had changed the home address on her 
file with TRW, a national credit reporting agency. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of unauthorized purchases also began showing up on Dorothy LaGrone's 
credit card accounts, including $600 in cosmetics at Nordstrom Department Store 
in Costa Mesa, for which she received a thank-you note. Items also were 
purchased at Broadway and Robinsons-May department stores and a Victoria's 
Secret lingerie store, receipts show. In addition, Norwest Financial California 
finance company in Downey issued a $2,500 loan in Dorothy LaGrone's name, court 
records show. LaGrone also learned that someone had applied for a $10,000 loan 
in her name at a Household Finance Corp. office in Cerritos. A loan officer 
became suspicious, however, and never issued the check. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say Debra LaGrone, 39, of Downey, made all of the changes and 
fraudulent purchases. In fact, authorities say, Debra LaGrone virtually assumed 
Dorothy LaGrone's identity. 
</P>
<P>
 The change-of-address form listed Debra LaGrone's address in Downey as the new 
location for Dorothy LaGrone. The changed address with TRW was the former 
Bellflower residence of Debra LaGrone's mother, Kathleen Montgomery, according 
to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities believe that Debra LaGrone obtained Dorothy LaGrone's credit 
information from a credit bureau when she was working at a mortgage company in 
Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody knows what a hassle this has been," said Dorothy LaGrone, who suffered 
a mild heart attack recently. "I've paid my bills all these years and then to 
have someone do this to me doesn't feel good." 
</P>
<P>
 Dorothy LaGrone has notified several credit card companies about the 
unauthorized charges, and has called credit bureaus in an effort to clear her 
credit record. But new bills kept arriving at her home through March, she said.

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: NEAR MUSTY ANTIQUES, SDT IS A BREATH OF AROMATIC AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The aroma of roasting exotic coffee, intermingled with the wafting smells of 
freshly baked muffins and breads, make going to the Sundried Tomato Cafe in 
Whittier a pleasurable experience. Plus, it's next to King Richard's antique 
mall. 
</P>
<P>
 After strolling amid the mall's displays, many of which offer old, 
musty-smelling books, the scents of the cafe are truly a breath of refreshing, 
aromatic air.  
</P>
<P>
 Opened a year ago, the SDT Cafe is a collaboration of manager Rob Quest and 
chef Mark Jacobi. Jacobi began his career at age 15, when he was working as a 
chef's aide (a.k.a. dishwasher) at a summer camp and the cook suddenly quit. 
Young Jacobi got the job. 
</P>
<P>
 For breakfast, the SDT offers eggs with a choice of bacon, chorizo or 
linguica, a Portuguese sausage heavy on garlic ($4.50). The breakfast menu also 
includes baked goods -- orange-glazed cinnamon rolls with pine nuts or lemon 
poppy seed muffins ($1.50 each), for instance, and various hot and iced coffee 
drinks. On Sundays, an omelet is stuffed with poached salmon and topped with a 
dill cream sauce ($6.95). 
</P>
<P>
 At lunchtime a chicken breast sandwich with Brie cheese melted on a roll 
slathered with a sun-dried-tomato-enriched pesto is accompanied by 
rosemary-flecked roasted potatoes ($5.95). The vegetarian sandwich ($5.95) 
features red bell pepper, avocado, capers and Asiago, the Italian cow's milk 
cheese with a rich, nutty flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel hair pasta ($6.95) comes with sun-dried tomatoes and a rich 
Gorgonzola-Chardonnay cream sauce. The ziti ($5.95) -- long, thin tubes of 
macaroni mixed with Roma tomatoes, garlic, capers, fresh basil and olive oil -- 
is a lighter pasta dish by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sundried Tomato Cafe is at 12301 Whittier Blvd., Whittier. (310) 907-8061. 
Open Monday through Friday 6:30 a.m. to 4 p.m., Saturday and Sunday 7:30 a.m. 
to 5 p.m.

ISSUE: RAIL CROSSINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The Metro Blue Line, which runs from Long Beach through Compton to downtown 
Los Angeles, has been plagued with accidents caused by drivers who try to beat 
the train across the tracks. What can be done? 
</P>
<P>
 * Linda Meadow 
</P>
<P>
 System safety manager, Metropolitan Transportation Authority "The two major 
causes of accidents on the Blue Line are motorists going around the gates and 
motorists making left turns around the train. In rail- 
</P>
<P>
 crossing safety, there are four things that work. You need to educate people 
about the line. You need to enforce the law. You need to get the crossings 
engineered properly, and you need to have good legislation so when you enforce 
something, it hurts. These are things that have worked for hundreds of years. 
</P>
<P>
 We are looking at some new technology applications. One of them is photo 
enforcement." 
</P>
<P>
 * Robert J. New 
</P>
<P>
 Metro Rail coordinator, Los Angeles County Fire Department "I think there are 
two main issues for enhancing safety. The first method is public education, 
perhaps through flyers, beginning with youngsters at school, programs about 
safety and crossings. I would also suggest partnerships with private industry 
such as supermarket chains, perhaps the people who manufacture bags in the 
markets, so it brings it to the attention of the public. 
</P>
<P>
 The other method would be physical restraint, to increase the rail-crossing 
protection from the single barrier in each direction to what is sometimes 
referred to as the quad barrier, where a gate comes down." 
</P>
<P>
 * Guadalupe Reynoso 
</P>
<P>
 Compton resident who lives near the Blue Line "I live 75 feet from the 
railroad, and I see the train from 4 o'clock in the morning until 11 at night. 
We're most concerned about safety. We should educate the people. But the 
railroad's been in operation for two years, and the people, they don't care too 
much for their safety. The Blue Line can only urge and suggest they should not 
cross when the barriers are down. 
</P>
<P>
 We've had so much literature about safety. We all know the dangers when you're 
trying to beat the train. This train goes up to 60 to 70 miles an hour. I'm an 
old man; age makes you aware." 
</P>
<P>
 * Evan Anderson Braude 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach councilman and Metropolitan Transportation Authority director "I've 
been real concerned about the safety issues. A number of proposals have come 
forward to try to make the Blue Line safer. One was to build fencing to keep 
people from running back and forth. That can be costly. We should have some 
sort of change in the kind of barriers there. Staff is now looking at about two 
or three different types of barriers: the traditional barrier, where an arm 
comes down and covers the one-way direction of traffic you're coming from, but 
it only covers half the street. What we're talking about now is having one arm 
that extends across the entire street."
