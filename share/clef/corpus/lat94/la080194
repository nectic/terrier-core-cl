 WILD THINGS: "The Lion King" has renewed interest in real-life wild things at 
Orange County's zoos and petting pens, where more than 800 animals reside. . . 
. None of them are the shaggy-maned big cats that star in the movie, but an 
orphaned mountain lion cub that arrived a month ago has become the hottest 
ticket at the Orange County Zoo in Irvine Regional Park. More than 860 people 
entered the name-the-cub contest that ended Sunday. The most popular name, 
because of the movie, has been Simba, said director Forrest de Spain."But we'll 
be encouraging unique names when the final decision is made in a few days." 
</P>
<P>
 HOME ON THE RANGE: Until 10 years ago the county was home to the bigger lions 
-- and lots of them. African lions and tigers were among 300 animals roaming 
the hills at Lion Country Safari, a 100-acre reserve that closed in 1984. . . . 
At its peak, it was hosting 2 million visitors annually who observed wildlife 
from inside their vehicles. But attendance dropped and the park owner decided 
the land near Irvine Meadows Amphitheater would yield more profit as a 
water-themed attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 SLOW DOWN: Knott's Berry Farm is probably better known for jam and Camp 
Snoopy. But long before the comic strip pooch arrived at the Buena Park farm, 
there was a tortoise named Herbie (as in the "Love Bug" movie). At 72, 
hard-shelled Herbie dominates the barnyard and should live another 25 years -- 
giving him a lot of seniority among the park's 360 animals. But "the exotic 
animal show is still the biggest draw," said park spokesman Bob Ochsner. 
</P>
<P>
 MONKEY TOWN: The Santa Ana Zoo is the county's biggest, with 300 creatures, 
and home to the world's largest rodent species, the Capybara. It grows up to 
120 pounds -- not your garden variety rat -- and "they're not the most 
beautiful animals in the world, but they're excellent swimmers," said Zoo 
Director Ron Grazier. South American species, including 50 primates, are the 
zoo's specialty, and 25,000 to 30,000 people visit monthly., Added Grazier: "It 
is definitely our busy season now."

 DINER JINX: The hilltop view from the Simi Valley dinner house now known as 
Tony Roma's may be the best in town. But restaurants there have repeatedly 
closed. . . . "First it was Josephina's, then it was The In-Between, then it 
was something else, and then the Sagebrush Cantina," Mayor Greg Stratton 
recalled. The problem was that the restaurant -- although adjacent to a freeway 
-- was on a hard-to-find side street. . . . Tony Roma's overcame that obstacle, 
then suddenly closed in January. "We felt that finally someone had broken the 
jinx," Stratton said. "And then we have an earthquake to mess it up." 
</P>
<P>
 SOUR NOTE: The Ventura County Symphony may be better than ever, but also 
poorer (B1). . . . At age 33, the orchestra faces an $80,000 deficit, a 
fourfold increase in three years. "This is the worst year we've had. It is a 
crisis," Executive Director Karine Beesley said. . . . Others say the problems 
are inevitable growing pains from a two-year improvement in artistic standards 
and musical variety. 
</P>
<P>
 STAR SHOT: High-flying Phoenix Suns forward Cedric Ceballos got his start at 
Ventura College. Today, repaying that debt, he will kick off ticket sales to 
charity events Aug. 26 and 27. . . . "Cedric didn't have the grades, so he came 
here and improved tremendously academically and as a person," Ventura College 
Coach Phil Matthews said. "He thought what better way to pay it back." . . . 
About $40,000 raised by a dinner, auction, clinic and alumni game will be split 
by the college basketball program and the Boys and Girls Club of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 CAT CAPER: Shady slipped into Port Hueneme City Hall like a thief in the 
night, and -- just like that -- stole the hearts of a whole bureaucracy (B1). . 
. . Seven years later, the tailless black cat makes herself at home on City 
Manager Richard Velthoen's arm as he chats on the phone. And Shady has never 
missed a council meeting. . . . "I was not fond of cats before, but Shady 
turned me around," Velthoen said.

OVERBILLING BY LAWYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maura Dolan's July 16 article on lawyers overbilling hit right on the mark. 
Unfortunately she didn't really address the main problem, that of the everyday 
working stiff who either instigates a lawsuit or is dragged into one. My wife 
and I were sued by her former partner; she countersued. That was in 1991. Over 
the next two years, the attorneys we had retained managed to run up a fee bill 
of $70,000 without having taken a deposition. 
</P>
<P>
 When we questioned, them the answer was always, "You're not a lawyer, let us 
do our work." Remember, with a billing attorney, as long as the clock is 
running time is not of the essence. When we left them after a fee dispute and 
lack of action and results on their part, we chose to go to binding arbitration 
through the auspices of the County Bar Assn. fee disputes service. Again, 
client beware. We were charged 5% of the disputed amount as the fee; the 
attorneys paid nothing. Once at your hearing, you will be faced with anywhere 
from one to three attorneys who will conduct "a hearing" to listen to your 
complaint. This is a good old boys club, and you have as much chance here as in 
a kangaroo court. 
</P>
<P>
 My advice to the average person is to take your complaint to court. If you 
have a major fee dispute, ask for a jury because you will more likely receive a 
fair judgment from 12 individuals like you than from any combination of 
lawyers. Take it from one who has been there! 
</P>

 I read with interest your article describing the alleged overcharging on bills 
by attorneys. While the subject is likely of little interest to non-lawyers 
(unless they happen to require the services of a lawyer), it is disappointing 
to learn that the legal profession appears to be the latest group to fall into 
the trenches long inhabited by other white-collar criminals.  
</P>
<P>
 Any person who steals from another, be it $1 or $1 billion, should be 
immediately and severely punished. The larger problem that this represents for 
society, a general lack of accountability for one's actions, can now be found 
in all walks of American life. It seems that no matter what the obvious crime, 
we feel that we can talk our way out of it or take advantage of a legal system 
that is well-equipped to coddle the criminal, but unable to mete out swift and 
just punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 As a member of the State Bar in California and Pennsylvania, I find it 
appalling that any attorney would charge his client for food under any 
circumstances.  
</P>
<P>
 My advice in regard to hiring legal counsel is to remember that attorneys have 
a duty to inform the client that all legal fees are negotiable. I believe that 
99.9% of our attorneys have very high ethical standards. Whether the client is 
a sophisticated consumer of legal services or not, he or she should attempt to 
locate the most talented lawyer with the highest ethical standards.

JORDAN'S KING HUSSEIN

<P>
 Re "Jordan Deal Could Go a Long Way," editorial, July 26: 
</P>
<P>
 Once again we are faced with a Middle East irony. Who would have thought that 
King Hussein and Yasser Arafat, the only two Arab leaders of prominence who 
sided with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and stood up against the United 
States during the Gulf War, would be the same leaders invited to the White 
House to sign peace agreements with Israel? 
</P>
<P>
 In the Arab world you earn respect by not capitulating to the West, no matter 
how righteous the cause may seem to the world at the time, but by standing tall 
and true to your causes. The strength that these two leaders gained over the 
years by dedicating their lives to their people's causes have allowed them to 
make peace with their enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 Your editorial seems to suggest that Syrian President Hafez Assad is 
"hang(ing) out there all alone" by his intransigence. What do you expect him to 
do, give up the Golan Heights to get invited to the Rose Garden? The Arab 
people are not looking for short-term gains nor are they seeking the wealth and 
technology of the West in terms that will compromise their place in history. 
Lasting peace only comes by mutual respect and honor.

 My entire adult life has been afflicted with three needless tragic conflicts: 
the United States-Soviet Union, Arabs-Israel and India-Pakistan. The first is 
finally defused. Is it too much to hope that "religious" Jews, Muslims and 
Hindus will demonstrate the sanity and decency shown by "secular" Americans and 
Russians?

ALWAYS LET A THOUSAND SCIENTIFIC FLOWERS BLOOM; WHY A PLURALISTIC FUNDING MODEL 
WORKS FAR BETTER THAN ANY CENTRALIZED ONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 American world dominance in science since World War II is no accident. It was 
fostered by generous support for basic research by numerous federal agencies. 
If a scientist with a good idea found one door closed, there was usually 
another agency willing to listen. A major player, particularly during the Cold 
War, was the Defense Department. Its Office of Naval Research and the Defense 
Advanced Research Projects Agency (now called ARPA) quietly supported 
farsighted fundamental research that went well beyond the military's central 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
 ARPA-backed research into computer networking during the 1960s, for example, 
led to today's Internet system. The Defense Department backed top research in 
materials, mathematics, oceanography, acoustics, lasers and optics, to name a 
few fields. This role has ebbed somewhat in recent years in favor of the 
National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health and NASA. But this 
pluralistic competitive model of multiple sources of funds, though sometimes 
inefficient, has obviously worked far better than the centralized science of 
the former Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 MURTHA VS. BROWN: We review this history to give context to the current feud 
between two influential Democratic congressmen, John P. Murtha of Pennsylvania 
and George E. Brown Jr. of Colton, Calif. Murtha, powerful chairman of the 
House Appropriations subcommittee on defense, recently ordered a 50% cut in the 
defense academic research appropriation of $1.8-billion. That sent Chicken 
Littles from MIT to UCLA scurrying up to Capitol Hill. By last week, however, 
the Senate Appropriations Committee had restored all but $79 million of the 
$900-million cut. The final figure will be set by a House-Senate conference, 
where Murtha is likely to get a few ounces of flesh, perhaps about $200 million 
in cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 What is going on? Murtha has said scientists must also take their lumps as 
defense spending dwindles, and that the money is needed to bolster military 
readiness. But others in Washington suggest more complex motives. Some say he 
is trying to force the department to cut certain expensive weapons programs, 
others that he is angry over allegations of fraud in science and misuse of 
"overhead" money paid to universities for research. 
</P>
<P>
 EARMARKING VS. MERIT: But it probably also has something to do with the bitter 
dispute between Murtha and Brown over earmarking of research money by Congress. 
Until about 1980, such funds were allocated almost entirely on the basis of 
merit, by the individual agencies. Then it dawned on Congress that science 
funding is pork, and powerful members started to bypass the agencies and fund 
local institutions directly. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, last year Congress earmarked $281 million of defense research money and 
-- surprise, surprise -- more than half if it went to Pennsylvania. Most of 
that -- surprise again -- to Johnstown, Pa., Murtha's hometown ($40 million 
from the Navy, for example, to the National Center for Excellence in 
Metalworking). Brown, chairman of the Committee on Science, Space and 
Technology, opposes earmarking and has threatened to subpoena Defense records 
to learn the full extent of Murtha's logrolling. 
</P>
<P>
 In all this, some might say Defense should get out of science and leave it to 
the NSF. But top academic leaders like President Thomas E. Everhart of Caltech, 
which gets 15% of its research budget from Defense, say that agency is far 
better equipped to focus on certain physics and engineering research. "They can 
take rifle shots better," he says. The Navy still has a fundamental interest in 
oceanography and is a major backer of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography 
in La Jolla. And the President's science and technology policy, due out next 
week, is expected to rely considerably on Defense expertise. 
</P>
<P>
 Much can be improved in the way research dollars are spent and overseen, given 
recent reports of scientific fraud. But good research depends on stable, 
long-term sources of support. The system has served well and should not be 
subjected to the kind of sudden shocks proposed by Murtha, whatever the motive.

colleges and universities for 1994 fiscal year:

WHY THE PRICE IS RIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is not often that a leader stands up and says, at the right time and in the 
right place, exactly the right thing. But when that does happen, it is vital 
that the moment not be lost.Such is the case with the keynote address this week 
in Indianapolis at the National Urban League convention. 
</P>
<P>
 The occasion was the inaugural speech of the 85-year-old group's new 
president, and the audience consisted of black professionals and other 
delegates of accomplishment who are the organization's rank and file. The 
speaker laid his thoughts on the line: Black separatism would be a regression 
and blaming white racism for all the woes that beset the black community is a 
formula for failure. 
</P>
<P>
 Said the new president: "Many whites of good will have accompanied us on our 
long journey for racial, social and economic justice. None has matched the 
Jewish community as long-distance runners in the civil-rights movement. Just as 
we denounce misleading media stereotypes of African Americans, it is morally 
repugnant as well to impugn an entire people, especially longstanding allies, 
like Jews, because of the unconscionable behavior of some of them." 
</P>
<P>
 What a difference in perspective from the recent convention of the NAACP, 
which felt compelled to invite as a speaker Louis Farrakhan, who is given to 
periodic anti-Semitic and racist diatribes. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Urban League president with the entirely different message is Hugh 
Price, until recently a Rockefeller Foundation senior official. His presidency 
has begun on a most auspicious note.

DEMISE OF THE LEFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I completely agree with Alexander Cockburn's Column Left, "Where's the Left's 
Reply to Limbaugh?" (July 14). The answer seems obvious enough: There is no 
left left.The many years of reactionary bleating about the so-called liberal 
press (who could they possibly mean?), the abject surrender of all our 
democratic principles in the mad stampede to cash in on Reagan's "feast now, 
let your children pay for it," the current Administration's masquerade as 
representatives of the Democrat Party -- all these have, as Cockburn points 
out, put Rush Limbaugh in the position of merely offering mean gossip about the 
White House, ignoring substantive issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there really no energized radical spokesman who can counteract these 
poisonous appeals to the prejudices of the public and tell it like it is: that 
we are dangerously close to becoming an oligarchy, a country run by the wealthy 
elite Establishment for the wealthy white Establishment.

TRANSPORTATION STRIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Day 3 of the infamous bus strike (July 27). My day in Koreatown started at 
5:30 a.m. with a 25-minute walk to the nearest operating bus line. For a 60ish 
disabled person with limited mobility, this was literally a pain in the rear 
end. After a 45-minute wait, the bus came, and we were all jammed together like 
sardines. An amateur "dip" tried to steal my wallet as he alighted from the 
overcrowded bus, but I managed to thwart him. After a two-hour combination of 
shank's mare, MTA bus, Red Line and DASH bus, I finally arrived at my Little 
Tokyo office at 7:30. It is normally a 40-minute ride on the MTA. The work day 
had just begun, and already I was exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
 As a member of a union myself, I am supposed to support the striking 
mechanics. But isn't it strange, I haven't the least bit of sympathy for this 
greedy bunch, who are paid more than I am. 
</P>

 Early last Monday morning I needed to go to the hospital. I then learned that 
MTA workers were on strike. I couldn't afford the $30 cab fare. I turned on the 
radio for some sort of information -- stations that might give commuters 
emergency information as to alternate means of getting to their jobs . . . or 
hospitals. Nothing -- as usual on the talk shows -- nothing but drivel. And 
nothing, as well, from the print media. My God, you ride a bus here in 
openhearted L.A. and you are of low class indeed -- that's all too apparent. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, I had to get to the hospital, so I stuck out the thumb. Watch them whiz 
by! Until a red light. "There's a transit strike, I need to get to the 
hospital!" I yelled to the idling 'mobiles. Giving me the finger would have 
been a better response than what those people gave me: total indifference. 
</P>
<P>
 But, along came Jose. He pulled over, and since there were four other people 
at the bus stop desperate to get to their jobs, although they stood separate 
from me, he took them along too. Their work places were en route to his 
destination, but he went out of his way to get me to the hospital. We all 
offered him gas money, but he refused. Why? Well, I'd have to say, Jose 
understood, that's why, unlike the media and those who whiz by without a look 
to the "small people." 
</P>
<P>
 Returning, I wasn't as successful. "Joses" are hard to come by. I finally had 
to surrender to the attitude, "you're on your own," and use my very last nickel 
for a cab.

PETROLEUM INDUSTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Times provided a valuable public service in publishing a special section 
on "The Next Los Angeles" and an editorial urging all Angelenos to get on with 
the task of "reinventing our future" (July 17). 
</P>
<P>
 One aspect of the editorial, however, perpetuated a popular misconception that 
if allowed to go unchallenged could retard the resurgence of the Los Angeles 
economy.I'm referring to the notion that more mature industries, such as 
petroleum, are merely part of "our exuberant economic adolescence" -- that they 
cannot be driving forces in recovery and growth. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as the petroleum industry is concerned, nothing could be further from 
the truth. A recent study shows that the refining sector of the industry here 
is the "most sophisticated in the world," and that it "ranks along with other 
Southern California high-tech industries as superlative in its field." 
</P>
<P>
 The study bases its claim on the fact that the petroleum industry has invested 
more than $1.5 billion in the Los Angeles Basin in the last four years, and is 
now spending an additional $2.6 billion of its stockholders' money on new 
plants and equipment to manufacture cleaner-burning reformulated gasolines. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, these kinds of investments, made in difficult times for the 
petroleum industry, demonstrate faith in the future of Los Angeles as well as 
in the innovative new technologies and processes developed by the industry 
itself.

 Let's get this straight: The health plan should not pay for abortions, the 
welfare plan should not pay for extra children, but we can afford to build more 
jails. Interesting.

HEAVY THOUGHTS ON IMAGE AND REALITY; HEALTH: MEXICAN FOOD, CHINESE FOOD, 
POPCORN -- AND NOW GOOBERS? 
</P>

 It took health experts to find out what I've been saying for years. It's not 
how much you weigh, but how you get around weighing that much that counts. 
</P>
<P>
 One report cited our President as a good example. While he won't give Fabio a 
run for his money, he does run an 8.5-minute mile and maintains an amazingly 
low cholesterol level. All this despite being so, well, substantial. That's 
what I've always liked about Bill. He's the only person besides me who 
exercises on a regular basis and is still chubby. It's been scientifically 
supported that Bill and I are just fine the way we are, although I still think 
he's fudging when he says he weighs 210. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, these so-called experts are giving movie popcorn a bad rap. 
They even published a list of other theater goodies and their real-food 
equivalents. For example, a box of Goobers is comparable in fat content to an 
entire Mexican dinner. Who cares? I want my Goobers! 
</P>
<P>
 With no scientific training or tax dollars, I've made some discoveries of my 
own. For one, men have no concept of how much women really weigh. And why 
should they? Their frame of reference is the statistics of those brain surgeons 
and electrical engineers-in-training who pose in men's magazines ("Tawnee: 
5'11", 44DD-26-36, 105 lbs.") Puhleeze! Those silicone jobs alone must weigh in 
at 25 pounds apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 Our pathetic commercialized society is to blame for our pursuit of unrealistic 
body images. You know things have really gone too far when a man is given carte 
blanche for his obligatory last meal and orders a diet cola.

U.S. AID RESPONSE -- WHAT TOOK SO LONG?; RWANDA: CRISIS WAS FORECAST LAST FALL, 
YET WE WERE CAUGHT SO SHORT, WE HAD TO RAID OTHER COUNTRIES' ASSISTANCE 
PROGRAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD M. WALDEN, Richard M. Walden is president of Operation USA, a Los 
Angeles-based international disaster relief and development agency. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The most disturbing document to circulate in Washington since the Rwanda 
crisis began in April is the July 13 situation report from the Agency for 
International Development's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 The report purports to outline in detail a generous and immediate U.S. 
government response to what is now the world's most critical humanitarian 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Claiming $69 million in aid between April and July, the government expected 
kudos. What it is getting privately, however, are expressions of exasperation 
by U.N. and private relief agencies as well as from other African countries 
whose vitally needed emergency food allotments have been diverted to the Rwanda 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 Very little new money and hardly any new commodities are being brought to bear 
on a disaster whose grim statistics now include 1 1/2 million refugees at the 
Zaire-Rwanda border, 400,000 refugees at the Tanzania-Rwanda border, tens of 
thousands more fleeing Rwanda to Burundi and an estimated 2 1/2 million 
displaced inside Rwanda, a country whose pre-war population was 9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 A favorite bureaucratic tactic when responding to a disaster overseas is to 
rob Peter to pay Paul. A claimed $40-million worth of U.S. food aid for 
Rwandans was diverted from such places in need as Mozambique, Somalia, Ethiopia 
and Sudan. The World Food Program will have to replace these commodities, but 
shipping lanes are long and delays of many months are sure to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also the matter of AID's disaster assessment and response team taking 
two months to get fully operational in the region. Yet the Rwanda tragedy was 
foreseen last September, when Burundi's first Hutu president was assassinated, 
along with several members of his cabinet, and a 50,000- to 100,000-person 
massacre ensued. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees warned that 600,000 
people were fleeing into neighboring Rwanda.  
</P>
<P>
 While the United Nations was trying to prepare for such an eventuality, the 
United States was proclaiming that Burundi was a clear-cut case of something 
well outside America's national interest. Since the United States provides more 
than 30% of the U.N. refugee agency's budget, there was a limit to the advance 
planning the agency was capable of implementing. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the worst has happened. Burundi's mirror image -- Rwanda -- blew sky high 
on April 6 when the presidents of Rwanda and Burundi -- both of them Hutu -- 
were assassinated. What followed was most likely a pre-planned massacre of up 
to 500,000 Tutsis by Hutu military and militias. Where was AID's (or any other 
government agency's, for that matter) early warning system? Why did 
coordinating a U.S. response take more than three months? Why is it so paltry? 
</P>
<P>
 The outcry from the humanitarian agencies is plaintive this time because the 
news stories convey little hope. So there has been a pathetic private response 
to appeals by relief agencies for money and materiel, and the many agencies 
wishing to respond have been made even more dependent on U.S. government 
support than they normally are after a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 It is indeed ironic that the Federal Emergency Management Administration, our 
quick-response agency for domestic disasters, now has a "can-do" reputation 
under the strong leadership of James Lee Witt and the confidence of his 
longtime patron, Bill Clinton, while the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance 
is slowly but surely losing stature as America's humanitarian face abroad. 
Partly this is due to money (there is little available, always too little for 
Africa), politics (spheres of influence, aversion to foreign aid) and cynicism 
("What, again?").  
</P>
<P>
 But mostly it involves a need to break out of bureaucratic molds and put 
victims first rather than last in the aid equation. AID, in this 
ever-so-important instance, has not done that.

QUIET CARLTON JOINS THE HALL OF FAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Steve Carlton and Phil Rizzuto entered baseball's Hall of Fame on Sunday 
completely in character -- Carlton displaying little emotion until the end of 
his short speech and Rizzuto bringing down the house with a rambling half-hour 
soliloquy. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlton, stung by a magazine article this year that portrayed him as 
anti-Semitic, had a chance to break the silence that marked half his 24-year 
career and tell the baseball world what he really believes. He chose instead to 
reveal little of himself. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an altogether appropriate setting to honor one of baseball's great 
recluses. The makeshift podium from which Carlton spoke was set on a lawn on 
the outskirts of this quaint village, the deserted Catskill Mountain foothills 
in the background. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlton, 49, lives on a 400-acre spread in the Colorado Rockies. In one of his 
few personal recollections, he spoke of a White House visit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember we were in the White House after we won the World Series in 1980," 
Carlton said. "The next day there was a picture in the papers and I was listed 
as an unnamed Secret Service man." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlton, who struck out 4,136, second only to Nolan Ryan, is the only pitcher 
to win four Cy Young awards. He won 329 games, second among left-handers only 
to Warren Spahn. He credited catcher Tim McCarver, who was in the audience. "He 
forced me to pitch inside," Carlton said. "He'd set up behind the hitters and 
the only thing I could see was the umpire. I was one of the most focused 
pitchers to ever play the game and Timmy remembered everything about 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlton said the trade that sent him from a pennant contender, the St. Louis 
Cardinals, to the woeful Philadelphia Phillies in 1972 was one of the keys to 
his success. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trade was a blessing in disguise," said Carlton, who won 27 games that 
year on a team that won only 59. "It gave me a chance to put my ideas in 
focus." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlton was followed by Leo Durocher's former wife, actress Laraine Day, and 
their son, Chris, in the most riveting part of the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 The feisty Durocher, whose teams won 2,008 games, seventh on the all-time 
list, died in 1991 at 86. He once said he didn't want to go in the Hall of Fame 
after he died. If there was bitterness when he said that, it was forgotten 
Sunday when his son accepted the plaque. 
</P>
<P>
 "His last years were spent hoping he would get a call from the Hall of Fame," 
Chris Durocher said, sobbing and barely audible at times. "At first, I thought 
what a shame it was that he could not have lived to receive it himself. But now 
I know, as I stand here, that my father stands with us here today. I guess he 
got time off for good behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't take a hoarse Rizzuto long to change the somber mood. The 1950 MVP, 
who played on nine American League pennant winners in 13 seasons, was in top 
form. 
</P>
<P>
 Midway through, the former New York Yankee shortstop, and the team's current 
broadcaster, broke up the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people are understanding this speech, raise your hands," said Rizzuto, who 
will turn 77 in September. "My family knows me. They're raising their hands." 
</P>
<P>
 As he was rambling toward the end, Rizzuto told the 34 Hall of Famers on the 
dais they could leave if they wanted to. Johnny Bench and Yogi Berra, Rizzuto's 
former teammate, took the cue and walked off. 
</P>
<P>
 Wendell Smith, a writer for the Chicago American and Chicago Sun-Times, 
received the J.G. Taylor Spink Award for his service to baseball. Smith, the 
first black member of the Baseball Writers Assn. of America, helped Jackie 
Robinson break baseball's racial barrier in 1946 and wrote the first biography 
of the Brooklyn Dodger star. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Met broadcaster Bob Murphy received the Ford Frick Award for his more 
than 40 years as a broadcaster. Murphy is known for his "happy recap" after 
each Met victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been such a joy ride for me," he said.

QUIETLY, TRADERS WENT BEARISH ON WALL STREET; NEW YORK: FINANCIAL INDUSTRY'S 
BIRTHPLACE IS A VICTIM OF OBSOLESCENCE AND DECENTRALIZATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The windows of the proud prewar skyscrapers are black, their lobbies dead as 
tombs, their "For Sale" and "Will Divide" signs yellow and cracked with age. 
When another bank or brokerage moves out, it takes the landlord three or four 
years to find a new tenant. 
</P>
<P>
 This is Wall Street today. Quietly, almost while no one was looking, it became 
more adjective than noun, more of a state of mind than a place. 
</P>
<P>
 There are still "Wall Street analysts" and "Wall Street profits," but no Wall 
Street, at least not as it used to be known. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street, the industry, has fled its birthplace, as Hollywood did. Now Wall 
Street is in mid-town Manhattan and New Jersey and Los Angeles, in suburban 
office parks and home offices. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wall Street the neighborhood -- the street itself and its immediate 
environs, an area covering a quarter-square mile in the core of lower Manhattan 
-- is going one way: down. 
</P>
<P>
 It has fallen victim to the age and obsolescence of its buildings; 
decentralization and downsizing in the financial services industry; the lure of 
other business districts with newer buildings, easier commutes, better food. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past year alone, plans for a new stock exchange building in the heart 
of the financial district collapsed for lack of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 And 40 Wall, one of the tallest buildings in the world, sold for $69 million 
less than it did four years earlier. Never in the history of commercial real 
estate had anything so big lost so much value so fast. 
</P>
<P>
 A third of the district's office space is vacant. A tower at 55 Broad has been 
empty since its chief tenant, Drexel Burnham Lambert, went ignominiously out of 
business. "Entire Building for Lease" is stenciled on the glass facade. A 
doorman stands morosely in the dim lobby, the Maytag repairman of Manhattan 
real estate. 
</P>
<P>
 A Conway's discount store in the base of 43 Broad St. advertises a sale on 
women's shorts. Above the front door, a bas-relief of an eagle with an anchor 
in its talons hints at grander days. 
</P>
<P>
 Fewer people attend Trinity Church's weekday services, fewer people eat lunch 
on the steps of Federal Hall. You don't have to wait as long for a restaurant 
table or a haircut or a cab. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the 1987 stock market crash, lower Manhattan has lost a fifth of its 
work force -- 100,000 jobs. Most probably aren't coming back. 
</P>
<P>
 "In '92, people still thought it was a cyclical downturn," says Elliott Schlar 
of Columbia University, a planning expert. "It's becoming clear it's more than 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 The computer, the fax and their ilk have reduced the need for a dense, 
high-rise office district. At the same time, the financial services industry 
has become more competitive; even as profits increase, firms employ fewer 
workers and use less space. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry has also spread out. Fewer than a third of the firms in the 
Securities Industry Assn. are even in Manhattan. Big mutual funds such as 
Fidelity and Vanguard are in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. And many clerical 
jobs once done on Wall Street can now be performed elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trend is toward an ever broader definition of Wall Street," says Charles 
Shapiro of the real estate firm Austrian Roth, "one that might be found on the 
information highway." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if they stay in New York, businesses want big, open, rectangular floors 
so they can rearrange their offices as needed; they want high ceilings, so they 
can raise floors to accommodate computers and wiring; they want extra 
electrical capacity, efficient air-conditioning and fast elevators. 
</P>
<P>
 But most Wall Street buildings went up before 1940 and were designed with 
smaller floors so workers would be close to the best source of light and air -- 
the window. Many have irregularly shaped floors (a legacy of the district's 
curving old streets), lots of columns, antiquated wiring and slow elevators. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years ago, businesses settled for anything with four walls. But now 
Manhattan is awash in vacant office space -- 50 million square feet, roughly as 
much as was built in the '80s. Those new towers, says Schlar, "sucked the life 
out of Wall Street." 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill Lynch and Shearson Lehman moved to the World Financial Center, on 
downtown's booming waterfront. Kidder Peabody, Paine Webber and Bear Stearns 
decamped to mid-town. 
</P>
<P>
 Mid-town is downtown's real competition; Pennsylvania Station and Grand 
Central Terminal offer access to the suburbs. Downtown has lots of subway lines 
to Brooklyn and Queens, but strap-hanging secretaries and clerks don't sign 
long-term leases. 
</P>
<P>
 Mid-town also has half a dozen of the world's best French restaurants; 
downtown had Delmonico's, before it went out of business last year after a 
century-and-a-half at 36 Beaver St. 
</P>
<P>
 Rents in downtown's older buildings are so low that half of them make no 
money; about three dozen are bankrupt or in foreclosure. After operating costs 
and taxes, there's often not enough to pay the mortgage, let alone make the 
renovations needed to attract prime office tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 If these buildings are no longer viable as offices, there are three options: 
Convert 'em. Mothball 'em. Raze 'em. 
</P>
<P>
 The real estate firm Jones Lang Wootten says Wall Street's next big need could 
be "demolition and site clearance." 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time in 400 years," predicts Columbia's Schlar, "we're going to 
take buildings away from downtown instead of putting them up." 
</P>
<P>
 That would create more open space and parking -- make Wall Street more like a 
suburban office park -- and allow an owner to rebuild when the market comes 
back. But demolition is very costly in cramped downtown, and in many cases 
zoning would preclude rebuilding anything as large as the original structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversion? Turning office towers into apartment houses sounds good, but how 
many people want to live on shadowy, narrow streets with no schools, parks or 
markets? 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves mothballing, but you must still pay taxes and renovate your old 
building when the market improves. By then, it's even older. 
</P>
<P>
 More probable is a gradual cycle of decline, in which the city lowers tax 
assessments and landlords lower rents, opening the area to fledgling 
businesses, nonprofit institutions and government. It won't be the old Wall 
Street, but at least it won't be a parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in decline, Wall Street has a great sense of place. It still is part of 
the nation's second-largest business district, still home of its principal 
stock exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 This is where New York began -- the street takes its name from a barrier built 
by Dutch settlers in 1653. And where America began, where George Washington 
took the oath of office in 1789, where the money was raised to dig the canals, 
lay the rails, make the guns. 
</P>
<P>
 At the top of Wall sits Trinity Church, whose dark spire was the tallest 
structure in the city until 1896. Even if some of the church's usurpers pass 
from the scene, says the Rev. Charles Cesaretti, life will go on. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sit at the crossroads of Broadway and Wall; there's no intersection like 
it in the world," he said. "Corporations come and go, but this location won't. 
The question is: What will this generation make of it?"

HOT JOBS: WATCH SELLER: PUTTING RIGHT FACE ON HANDS-ON BUSINESS

 When shopping at Tourneau, a Swiss watch store at South Coast Plaza, customers 
are faced with an array of timepieces ranging in price from $80 to $1 million. 
That's why sales clerk Max Sotodeh thinks the most important part of his job is 
educating the customer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sell more than 10 brands and there are many styles. It's overwhelming for 
a lot of people, since a fine watch is a very personal item and most people 
like to put a lot of time into their decision," Sotodeh said. "I try not to 
rush them. They might need to visit the store several times before making a 
decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Sotodeh prefers a low-key approach based on gaining the customer's confidence. 
"Watches are actually quite interesting and people like hearing about the 
workmanship and history behind the companies, since we sell some of the best 
watches available," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When helping customers make a selection, Sotodeh first tries to find out a 
little about their lifestyle or the lifestyle of the person for whom they are 
buying the watch. "Then we discuss a price range and I am able to help them 
narrow their selection based on price and style," Sotodeh said. 
</P>
<P>
 During a typical day, Sotodeh assists 10 to 15 customers. "I spend the whole 
day explaining and educating and most days go by very quickly. Holidays are 
always extremely busy in a store like this. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone trying to work into a good retail sales position needs a lot of 
patience and the ability to keep learning. It takes hard work sometimes, but 
it's important to make the customer feel like you are always willing to help." 
OCCUPATION: Retail clerk

<P>
 * What's involved: Assisting customers in selecting and purchasing 
merchandise; handling sales transactions and, in some cases, arranging

GOYA FOODS REACHING PAST ITS TRADITIONAL BORDERS; GROCERIES: THE NEW JERSEY 
COMPANY IS MARKETING TO LATINOS IN THE WEST AND NON-LATINOS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Among the boxes of rice and beans at the Goya Foods Inc. warehouse are stacks 
of devotional candles. It's one product the company has a surplus of these days 
-- and that's a good sign, says Robert Unanue, vice president of operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I noticed when the economy was bad we were selling a lot of devotional 
candles," Unanue said during a recent tour of the warehouse at the company's 
headquarters here. "I guess people were praying more." 
</P>
<P>
 With the economy improving, so are sales of most of Goya's 800-plus products, 
ranging from rice and beans to the lesser-known delicacy of octopus in hot 
sauce. The company expects 1994 U.S. sales to be about $520 million, about 10% 
above last year. 
</P>
<P>
 From its traditional market catering to people from Spain, Puerto Rico and 
other Caribbean nations, Goya is reaching out to non-Latino markets and also to 
Latino areas populated by Central and South Americans, such as the Southwest 
and Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a huge market in the Los Angeles area that is untapped," said Luisa 
Donis, a spokesman for Hispanic Business magazine. "You don't find Goya items 
here much." 
</P>
<P>
 But Donis said Goya's market-by-market strategy has worked well in the past, 
as it went from a tiny operation catering to local bodegas to a worldwide 
company that controls 80% of the Latino food business in the Northeast and 75% 
in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 DRI-McGraw-Hill, a consulting firm, projects that the United States' Latino 
population will grow 41% this decade compared with a 5% increase for all other 
ethnic groups. The firm says Latinos will become the nation's dominant minority 
by 2015. 
</P>
<P>
 Goya's president, Joseph Unanue, said his company is reaching out to 
non-Latinos with frozen foods, including pound cake, bread pudding, corn bread 
and meat pies, and a new line of packaged meals such as paella mix, which 
includes rice and a can of shellfish. 
</P>
<P>
 Goya is also stepping up advertising to non-Latinos, placing coupons and 
recipes in newspapers and running ads on television and in magazines such as 
Weight Watchers. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is also touting healthful aspects of many of its products. Beans, 
for example, are high in fiber, low in fat, and rich in protein and vitamins 
and contain no cholesterol, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 Reaching out to Mexicans and people of other nationalities means some label 
changes because of the diversity of the Spanish language, Joseph Unanue said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beans are called frijoles by Cubans and habichuelas by Puerto Ricans. Orange 
juice is jugo de china to Latinos in the Northeast and jugo de naranja to those 
in the Miami area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hispanics have different names for fruits, different names for vegetables, 
different names for lots of products," Joseph Unanue said. "It poses a problem 
in labeling. People don't realize that it's really what they're used to, except 
it's called a different name." 
</P>
<P>
 He said it will definitely take a while for Goya to become as familiar in 
California and the Southwest as it is on the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 But the company has always preferred to move like the tortoise rather than the 
hare in entering new markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The company was founded in 1936 by Joseph Unanue's parents, Don Prudencio 
Unanue and Dona Carolina Casal, who missed the foods of their native Spain and 
Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
 Unanue & Sons Inc. operated out of a warehouse in lower Manhattan, selling 
olives, olive oil and imported canned sardines in the New York-New Jersey area. 
</P>
<P>
 The company eventually moved to Brooklyn and, in 1962, became Goya Foods after 
it obtained the rights to take the name of the Moroccan canned sardines it 
distributed. 
</P>
<P>
 In need of more space, Goya moved to Secaucus in 1974 and now has U.S. 
production and distribution centers in West Deptford; Chicago; Miami; Tampa, 
Fla.; Webster, Mass., and Houston. Abroad, Goya has centers in Bayamon, Puerto 
Rico; Seville, Spain, and Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 While Joseph Unanue heads up the U.S. operations, his brother Francisco is in 
charge of the company's business abroad. Six other family members work for 
Goya. 
</P>
<P>
 Goya employs more than 1,800 workers worldwide, who come in handy when it's 
time to test new products in the company's test kitchens. Robert Unanue, Joseph 
Unanue's nephew, said employees sometimes offer family recipes. Goya's bread 
pudding is based on Joseph Unanue's wife's recipe. 
</P>
<P>
 Hispanic Business magazine says new products such as the bread pudding have 
helped Goya's sales grow 166% between 1982 and 1992. Goya was the largest 
Latino-owned company for 1992, but was beaten out slightly last year by Burt on 
Broadway, an auto sales and service company based in Englewood, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the stacks of devotional candles sitting in the Secaucus warehouse are 
any indication, Goya may retake the title this year.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; RAGING FOR DOLLARS: ROLLINS GRINDS ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORRAINE ALI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "You don't know a damn thing about me," Henry Rollins said in a recent 
magazine interview -- the words printed across a photo of his intense face. 
</P>
<P>
 He may be right. It's hard to figure out someone who contradicts himself at 
every turn. 
</P>
<P>
 As former singer for Los Angeles punk groundbreakers Black Flag, enterprising 
spoken-word artist and leader of the Rollins Band, he has turned himself into a 
tortured, larger-than-life embodiment of pure anger. 
</P>
<P>
 After a decade and a half of raging, he now fits quite nicely into the more 
turbulent end of mainstream rock, and his profile is suddenly high -- guest 
veejay on MTV, Details magazine cover boy, a chatty visitor with Jay Leno on 
the "Tonight Show." He'll play Woodstock '94, sharing the stage with acts that 
are the antithesis of what he started out to be. 
</P>
<P>
 The question all that raises is whether Rollins has become a parody of himself 
-- an angry shell that spouts on about his alienation but acclimates quite 
nicely to being pop culture's figurehead of male rage. 
</P>
<P>
 Or does he still really feel it? 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday at the Grand Olympic Auditorium, Rollins wailed for a solid hour 
about loneliness and failed greatness, his neck seeming to become as big as his 
head with each scream. The barefoot, shirtless and heavily tattooed Rollins 
stayed in a crouch for most songs, flexing his muscles and occasionally making 
a face as if he were lifting extremely heavy barbells. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rollins Band's three musicians played big, fat metal with a scattered jazz 
and funk edge. It was thick and claustrophobic and inescapable, and song 
structures seemed to collapse under its onslaught. 
</P>
<P>
 Through it all, it was hard to sense any variations in Rollins' bulldozing 
anger, let alone any other emotions. Rather than climb higher or drop to a 
different depth, he emanated grating, surface frustration -- and the mainly 
male, mainly shirtless audience ate it up. 
</P>
<P>
 When Rollins led Black Flag, which has influenced half of today's grinding 
rock bands, there were more dynamics to his menace. It's not that he doesn't 
believe in his screams anymore -- they just seem more convoluted, no longer 
providing a straight line into his soul. 
</P>
<P>
 His forceful, provocative remarks between songs proved almost more interesting 
than the songs. He boomed about the dark abyss of loneliness, and zeroed in on 
such targets as strip bars: "If you have to go into one of them, first, you are 
afraid of women, and second, you hate them." 
</P>
<P>
 That was just before some guys pulled the shirt off a woman near the front of 
the surging crowd. It shouldn't surprise Rollins that an audience attracted 
primarily by his testosterone-powered anger would be oblivious to the fine 
points of his message. Rollins needs to use some of his formidable power to 
dismantle an image that has become a cage. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Saturday: Second-billed Helmet has recently traded in its precision 
pile-driving for the crushing, anesthetized feel of such bands as Alice in 
Chains. The New York band still sounds good, but has lost some of its defining 
identity.

O.C. POP MUSIC REVIEW; A MOVABLE FEAST OF TALENT, ROCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bands in flaming headdress, bands led by wrathful wild men who stomped on 
instruments or smashed stage decorations, midway attractions involving 
demonstrations of bile drinking -- those were some of the interesting sights at 
Irvine Meadows back when Lollapalooza used to stop there. 
</P>
<P>
 But the famous attitude-rock extravaganza has skipped Irvine since its second 
run in 1992, electing to find more spacious digs elsewhere for its Southern 
California dates. In its place Saturday came H.O.R.D.E., a traveling festival 
where all the bands did was play. But boy, could they play. All four main-stage 
headliners -- the Allman Brothers Band, Blues Traveler, Big Head Todd and the 
Monsters, and Sheryl Crow -- turned in satisfying sets that dispensed with the 
attitude and laid on the talent. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the celebrated Lollapalooza, the eight-hour H.O.R.D.E. (for Horizons of 
Rock Developing Everywhere) was a relaxed and relatively low-profile event, 
played to a half-capacity crowd of about 7,000 or 8,000 that looked more 
interested in tie-dye and handicrafts than body piercing. 
</P>
<P>
 Launched in 1982 by Blues Traveler, a band from New York City, the annual 
H.O.R.D.E. festival (which never reached the West Coast until Saturday's show) 
has featured bands that like to stretch out and jam -- hence the appeal to the 
Deadhead set. 
</P>
<P>
 A little more than 20 years ago, the band occupying the most advanced horizon 
of jam-oriented rock was the Allman Brothers Band. A lot of things change with 
time. Two members of the Allmans' classic early '70s lineup are long dead, the 
four surviving band members have been through two breakups and regroupings, and 
three new players now are on the scene. But not everything changes: the Allman 
Brothers still occupy the most advanced horizon of jam-oriented rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Their nearly 2 1/2-hour performance wasn't quite perfection, but it was still 
magnificent. What was exhilarating was the sheer band-ness of the Allmans' 
approach, the perfect interlocking of cooperative parts, providing a framework 
in which individuals could step forward and shine. Some people think that rock 
'n' roll corrodes the fabric of our society, and maybe in some cases they are 
right. But a band like the Allmans is a living metaphor for the freedom amid 
cooperation that we want society to have. 
</P>
<P>
 Three drummers and a tremendously effective bassist, Allen Woody, set up a 
churning, tidal motion, underscoring that the band's fundamental purpose is to 
journey, to take itself and its audience somewhere. Gregg Allman's gusting 
organ tones accented and thickened the sound. It was left to two phenomenal 
guitarists, Dickey Betts and Warren Haynes, to decide where to navigate on this 
wave of possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 They went to some magical places. Betts, who left the band temporarily a year 
ago to enter an alcohol rehab program, is back in fine shape with playing both 
liquid and fiery. Haynes complemented him with a harsher-toned rasp from his 
Les Paul. The set's first great peak came as they conversed during 
"Southbound." 
</P>
<P>
 First they finished phrases for each other, like only the closest of friends 
and relations can. Then, simultaneously, each played his own uninterrupted 
discourse, moving in different directions, yet never clashing: two free and 
independent equals. Finally came a joyful merging as they locked in harmony. It 
was early in the show, but around them, the band played with the relish and 
heat that most bands reserve for their closing kick. 
</P>
<P>
 (They probably could have done it even without Don Johnson, the "Miami Vice" 
star who used to hang with and even wrote a few songs for the Allman Brothers 
during the late 1970s. Betts summoned Johnson to sing on the choruses of 
"Southbound," which the singer-turned-actor accomplished on-key and with 
respectable bluesiness.) 
</P>
<P>
 After that peak, the band settled into a quieter stretch. Allman showed his 
crusty, still-considerable soulfulness as he sang the new ballad "Soulshine," 
which epitomizes the theme of troubles-endured that runs through the band's 
latest album, "Where It All Begins." Betts registered a warm lead vocal on 
another good '90s-vintage song, "Seven Turns." 
</P>
<P>
 A 10-minute "Jessica" was so grand that Betts and Haynes kept searching for 
new improvisations, as if they didn't want to let the song go. At 23 minutes, 
"In Memory of Elizabeth Reed" went a bit too far, although it was fine until 
the six-minute drum break kicked in. One could always kick back and watch the 
old-fashioned liquid light show play out on a screen behind the band. It was a 
good one, a collage of colored amoebic gobs and swirls of cosmic imagery. 
</P>
<P>
 The encore, "Whipping Post," was extraordinary for its headlong momentum, and 
for the way Betts and Haynes finally broke that momentum for a concluding 
guitar sojourn that seemed to be a long commentary on mortality -- appropriate 
in a song whose baleful refrain goes "I've been tied to the whipping post, 
sometimes I feel like I'm dying." 
</P>
<P>
 No sooner had Allman left off singing about a miserable death than the 
guitarists were slowing their pace and soaring, pointing to a heavenly vista 
with chirping-bird effects not unlike those Duane Allman used to evoke peaceful 
release at the end of the original "Layla," by Derek and the Dominoes. 
</P>
<P>
 After this glimpse of the sublime hereafter, they plunged back to earth, and 
the whole band tolled with funereal finality in a closing crescendo. At least 
that's the imagery I got out of it; someone else might paint a different 
picture. What each listener imagined is purely subjective; the main point is 
that the players had the skillful means to probe with their music, and the 
passion to let it transport them, pulling several thousand people along for the 
ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Blues Traveler also had the probing, adventurous spirit. A rhythm-oriented, 
gleefully energetic guitarist, a nimble bassist and a drummer who combined 
power with a good sense of tonal coloration provided the backdrop for some 
wide-ranging excursions. John Popper manned the foreground (and this tall, 
rotund John Belushi look-alike can occupy a lot of foreground) with reedy, 
chance-taking vocals and prolific harmonica playing. 
</P>
<P>
 Popper doesn't have the most trenchant or melodious voice, but it is pliant 
and distinctive, and he was adept at suiting it to the roles he writes for 
himself. He sounded convincingly wounded during an elegiac, as-yet unreleased 
song from the next Blues Traveler album, which is due next month. 
</P>
<P>
 (The band showed great -- and justified -- confidence by opening with that 
song, unfamiliar and melancholy as it was, before a crowd presumably eager to 
boogie. There was boogie enough to come.) 
</P>
<P>
 Popper's comic instincts came through during "Go Outside & Drive," a slacker's 
epic that wryly portrays a character overcome by inertia (the long, undulating 
rendition included a well-placed snippet of Beck's slacker-anthem, "Loser"). 
Later, the quest for new expressive means would find Popper tweeting like a 
bird and doing a rapper's human-beatbox routine. 
</P>
<P>
 The show moved between energized, lighthearted excursions and ballad laments 
over lost love ("Alone") or career frustrations ("Hope," which will be the 
first single from the upcoming album). Overall, Blues Traveler projected a 
youthful optimism, an ability to shake off setbacks and to go chasing after the 
new possibilities suggested by its bright, excursionary music. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of that brightness came from Popper's harmonica playing. Instead of 
repeating the raspy blasts and low-down moans that most blues-based harmonica 
players draw upon, he would send forth flurries of sprightly, whistling, 
high-pitched notes. Sometimes his harmonica sounded like an Irish penny 
whistle, and it had a similar effect: instant merriment. 
</P>
<P>
 Popper qualified as the day's eccentric. A buccaneer's sword hung from his 
left hip while he performed; at one point he drew it with a flourish and 
punctured an errant beach ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Big Head Todd and the Monsters were considerably better in their 70-minute 
H.O.R.D.E. set than they had been in a much longer headlining show at the Coach 
House in March. The trio's leader, Todd Park Mohr, cut down on his soloing, 
which tends toward routine, Hendrix-style wailing and is the weakest facet of 
his diverse game. Instead, he concentrated on putting over good, frequently 
wistful but still-muscular heartland rock songs, delivering them in a sturdy, 
husky voice like Bob Seger's. 
</P>
<P>
 A more lyrical guitar accent would help (why not add a fourth member to 
provide it?). Mohr also needs to find a way to break through a reserved bearing 
and make his songs come to life more vividly. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheryl Crow played a short but winning set. Downplaying the Rickie Lee Jones 
street-hipster mannerisms that often come through on her successful debut 
album, she seemed to be striving more for the warmth and direct quality of a 
Bonnie Raitt. Crow might have been the "singer-songwriter" entry on a bill of 
hard-driving instrumental groups, but she and a strong backing band managed to 
play some sinewy rock 'n' roll along with more inward songs about characters 
running from troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Crow sang backups for Big Head Todd on "It's Alright" and joining the Allman 
Brothers for a duet vocal on "Midnight Rider." Popper also got into the 
interaction, lending his harmonica to the Allmans' "One Way Out" and jamming on 
the festival's second stage with April's Motel Room, a band from Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival had six new or unsigned bands on its under card, playing during 
breaks in the main stage action. Cycomotogoat was the most promising, and the 
least congruous with the rest of the day's acts. The trio from Hoboken, N.J. 
played heavy, distortion-laden rock akin to Soundgarden's. But front man Crugie 
Riccio's varied voicings -- both as a singer and a guitarist -- made this more 
than the same old grunge. 
</P>
<P>
 April's Motel Room offered a Vedder-like lead singer but a 
less-than-persuasive grunge-lite attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Ugly Americans, from Austin, were a winner, a splendid party band that played 
funk-accented Southern rock, a sort of Skynyrd-goes-to-N'awlins sound. Not 
content to play to folks lolling on their backs in the California sun, the 
band's likable singer jumped off the stage and started helping people to their 
feet. The music took care of the rest as Ugly Americans touched off a rousing 
dance party. 
</P>
<P>
 The Screamin' Cheetah Wheelies, from Nashville, played a more routine form of 
sons-of-Skynyrd Southern rock. Jambay, a foursome from Seattle that originally 
formed in San Diego, played a spirited set of angular, tempo-changing funk on 
the main stage that recalled Phish, a H.O.R.D.E. alumni band. The melodies were 
thin, however. The 2 P.C., from Los Angeles, showed ability but the band needs 
more woodshedding to conquer stiffness as it strives to put across a 
soul-blues-rock merger harking back to Hendrix and Blind Faith. 
</P>
<P>
 At some stops, H.O.R.D.E. organizers have instituted a third stage for 
featured players to conduct workshops, but none took place at Irvine Meadows.

 Mick On-Line: Mick Jagger hit the information superhighway before going on the 
road. The Rolling Stones' lead singer tapped into the Prodigy service on 
Friday, answering questions about the Stones' 43-city U.S. tour, which opens 
today in Washington, and offering some listening tips. Jagger said fans should 
listen up for "Waiting on a Friend," which will be a hot number in concert. But 
forget "Stray Cat Blues." He said it's sounding "dreadful" in practice. As for 
the hits that top his list, Jagger said the group's most important songs are 
"Satisfaction" and "Honky Tonk Woman," because they were the biggest hits, not 
necessarily the best.

 A Sad Note: Pianist Van Cliburn interrupted his 17-city tour with the Moscow 
Philharmonic after his mother suffered a stroke. Rildia Cliburn, 97, had a 
stroke Thursday at her home in Westover Hills, Tex. Cliburn canceled his Friday 
concert in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., and it was uncertain when his tour would 
resume. His next scheduled performance is Tuesday at the Metropolitan Opera 
House in New York City. Cliburn's mother was his piano teacher until he entered 
the Juilliard School at age 17. She taught him several of the major works with 
which he is identified, including Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1. The 
pianist's current tour has been marked by dizzy spells and program changes. 
Since his July 11 appearance at the Hollywood Bowl, Cliburn has continued not 
to play the announced Rachmaninoff Concerto No. 3 at all tour stops, playing 
only the also-announced Tchaikovsky's Concerto No. 1. TELEVISION

 A 'Big Joke': Tom Arnold, a guest on CNN's "Larry King Live" last week, was 
asked by King to respond to NBC's plans for an unauthorized TV movie bio called 
"Tom and Roseanne: A Hollywood Marriage." "I'm surprised they would waste their 
time with something like that," said Arnold. "How are they going to 
sensationalize my life? Someone told me they are looking for Rosie O'Donnell to 
play Rosie and Jim Belushi to play me. Now, wouldn't that be a step down for 
Jim Belushi? He's a bigger star than I am. They aren't going to find anybody to 
play us. . . . When someone told me about . . . (the TV movie), I thought it 
was a big joke."

WEEKEND REVIEWS / MUSIC; FISCHER LEADS STYLISH RIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Genuine stylishness in musical performances grows more obsolescent with the 
passing seasons -- conductorial expertise apparently having joined the 
endangered species list. When stylishness appears, then, as it did on the final 
program by the touring Budapest Festival Orchestra at Hollywood Bowl, flares 
should be raised. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivan Fischer, co-founder and principal conductor of the ensemble, led this 
agenda (given Friday and Saturday nights), titled "From Budapest to Vienna," 
and offering music by Johann Strauss Jr., Bartok, Lehar, Kodaly, Brahms and 
Berlioz. In all that he surveyed, Fischer seemed master of this territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite somewhat less than immaculate performances from the orchestra on 
Friday, the music-making gave consistent pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
 One had forgotten just how wondrous "An der schonen blauen Donau" ("On the 
Beautiful Blue Danube") can be, when taken at tempos that breathe as well as 
sweep. There were also myriad joys in four of Strauss Jr.'s treasurable polkas 
-- "Eljen a Magyar," "Vergnugungszug," "Im Krapfenwaldl" (with all the 
birdcalls) and "Unter Donner und Blitz" -- all of which were appreciated loudly 
by 14,227 Bowl-goers on Friday -- the crowd on Saturday was counted at 
capacity: 17,797. 
</P>
<P>
 One had not forgotten the deep charms of both the "Fledermaus" Overture and 
Berlioz's Hungarian March from "La Damnation de Faust." Fischer brought fresh 
life to them, and the Bowl Fireworks Department lit up the skies colorfully 
during the latter, to enthusiastic cheering. 
</P>
<P>
 The appearance of American soprano June Anderson was disappointing only in 
that she offered merely five items total. 
</P>
<P>
 But these she sang handsomely, though warming up completely only by the final 
"Vilja-Lied" from "Die lustige Witwe." Otherwise, these were pleasant, usually 
effortless run-throughs of excerpts from "Der Zarewitsch," "Zigeunerliebe" and 
"Paganini," plus the "Fledermaus" Czardas. In all of them, Fischer & Co. proved 
sensitive and intrepid collaborators.

COUNTERPUNCH: TIP TO L.A. TV: MAYBE CRIME DOESN'T PAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA BLISS OSBORN, Barbara Bliss Osborn is on the journalism faculty at 
Cal State Northridge and is on the Steering Committee of Fairness & Accuracy in 
Reporting/L.A. (FAIR/L.A.). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 TV columnist Howard Rosenberg expressed the frustration of many when he 
complained about "violent crime-and-misery stories" on the nightly news("3 Days 
of the Newscasts, or Can Emmys Be Revoked?," Calendar, June 10). L.A. viewers 
might be interested in knowing that a growing number of TV stations around the 
country are laying to rest "bodybag journalism." Unfortunately, L.A. stations 
have yet to make similar funeral arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 WCCO, the No. 1 station in the Minneapolis market, initiated the nationwide 
trend. A year ago, it launched a series of town meetings during which it 
discovered that violence was consistently at the top of the list of viewer 
complaints. It may be hard for L.A. station execs to believe, but viewers in 
Minneapolis really didn't want blood and guts anymore. In fact, viewers wanted 
stories that reflected their community. They wanted to hear about schools, 
events, local businesses. Imagine, viewers even wanted stories about how local 
government does its job! 
</P>
<P>
 The most significant change, Minneapolis Star-Tribune TV critic Noel Holston 
told me recently, is not so much in WCCO's toned-down crime coverage (since the 
station never favored splatter fests), but in that, by de-emphasizing crime, 
the station was able to find time for new community-oriented stories. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent study, media watchdog group Fairness & Accuracy in Reporting/L.A. 
evaluated our own local newscasts. FAIR found what anyone who watches local 
news knows to expect -- overkill. With an occasional exception, all seven L.A. 
newscasts open with a volley of the latest violent crimes. Depending on the 
station, anywhere from 25% to 50% of all news time is devoted to shootings, 
robberies and other mayhem. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, crime in Los Angeles is a serious problem. It's a shame it's not 
getting the serious coverage that would put it in an understandable context. 
Instead, the nightly pandemonium that passes for news exacerbates public fear, 
encourages people to seek drastic remedies and hurts our local economy by 
convincing tourists and businesses to stay away. 
</P>
<P>
 FAIR challenged Los Angeles' news outlets to follow the lead of their fellow 
news directors and rethink the time they devote to crime and how they cover it. 
By breaking away from the pack, any station in Los Angeles could distinguish 
itself and build a competitive advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 The change wouldn't even require a sense of public responsibility. It makes 
good business sense. There are an awful lot of Angelenos who turn on the local 
news, watch the first gore-filled five minutes and turn it off because they 
can't watch anymore. That's not helping any station's ratings. Since the 
change, WCCO's ratings have remained steady. In fact, their 18-to-49-year-old 
audience, the demographic stations most want to reach, is up. 
</P>
<P>
 Plus, the change made a fabulous promotional hook. I'd be tickled pink to see 
stations trumpeting their sensitive as opposed to sensational news coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the FAIR/L.A. study, KABC, the station with the least crime 
coverage of any of the network half-hour newscasts, was also the winner of the 
May sweeps. Maybe that's an early indicator of shifting public taste. Could it 
be that crime no longer pays -- at least when it comes to ratings? 
</P>
<P>
 Privately, producers and news directors at L.A. stations have told me they 
agree with FAIR's conclusions. They blame management and their colleagues in 
the field for a knee-jerk and intransigent notion of what's news and how it 
should be reported.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile in Minneapolis, WCCO news director John Culliton says he feels more 
comfortable with what he's doing than he has in years. He sleeps better. L.A. 
news directors could be sleeping better too, and so would a lot of us. Maybe 
even Howard Rosenberg.

COUNTERPUNCH: AN OUT-OF-SYNC 'HEARTBEATS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHERYL LAYNE FARRELL, Cheryl Layne Farrell is a professional in the banking 
industry. She supports causes and organizations that promote racial harmony and 
social responsibility. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I read with great interest Laurie Winer's review "Housewife's Laments Make for 
a Lamentable 'Heartbeats,' " (Calendar, July 19). I attended the musical's 
preview and, like your reviewer, did not fully embrace the show -- but for 
different reasons. "Heartbeats" fills a void as it creates a void. We need more 
musical theater in Southern California; however, the last thing we need is 
social insensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
 My original purpose for attending the show was to support two worthy causes: 
First, it was advertised as being part of the World Cup Soccer cultural events. 
Secondly, it marked the hopeful financial turnaround of the Pasadena Playhouse. 
(A spokesman for thetheater thanked the audience for its financial support 
before the curtain opened.) I wanted to like this show, but my sense of 
political correctness was not left at the coat-check counter. 
</P>
<P>
 The central character Annie, played by Amanda McBroom, unveils her midlife 
crisis in this production. Annie's husband, Steve, played by George Ball, belts 
out a song titled "Hurt Somebody Blues." Here is a song, sung in blues fashion, 
that seems reminiscent of recent race-related beatings. Steve sings about being 
so angry with life's irritants that he feels like hurting somebody! By singing 
the blues, a musical style attributed to black origins, Steve seems to equate 
his rage to the African American experience. Consequently, he trivializes the 
Angst of those who gave birth to the blues. 
</P>
<P>
 Annie is a novelist-librarian and housewife who believes her dreams have 
escaped her. She is passive in her anger toward her husband with whom she has 
little meaningful communication. After a spontaneous 40th birthday drink at a 
bar, she gives a young bartender a ride home. As she contemplates what she is 
doing, she wonders if her husband will greet her at the door with an ax. Now 
this may have been funny when the play was originally written, but it becomes a 
bit chilling in light of recent headlines. 
</P>
<P>
 The tackiness does not end here. In another song, there is a reference to a 
"Chinese fire drill" as several of the characters scramble around the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 The fast-paced dynamic of social change these days makes jokes about racial 
stereotypes, violence and domestic troubles appear dated and tasteless. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Annie's midlife crisis appears to get resolved because they run out 
of songs. I really did want to like this production. The redeeming qualities 
were the voice of William Falk and comedic timing of Sharon McNight. 
"Heartbeats" has its heart in the right place -- it just needs some minor 
surgery to unclog its arteries.

COUNTERPUNCH: REVIEWER'S VIEWS TOO LOFTY FOR REALITY

various plays at the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego, and is the recipient of

 Scott Collins quite simply gives himself away as an avant-garde traditionalist 
when he states that the All-U-Can-Eat Players production of Jean Genet's "The 
Balcony" should have been "carried to a wild and totally illogical extreme. . . 
." ("A Watchable Show From 'The Balcony,' " Calendar, July 22). That is how 
this play is often performed, with the accompanying criticism that the play is 
illogical and hard to follow. This is a disservice to Genet, who wrote a dense 
play, but not an illogical one. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the great theatrical traps, and one that Collins appears to have fallen 
into, is the baffling and recurring error to consider it very hip to present 
challenging plays in a way that baffles the audience, not for any purpose that 
the playwright aspired to, but simply for the notoriety of presenting something 
unfathomable. Instead of letting the play, however absurd or complex, tell its 
story, companies have felt compelled to throw the truth to the wind and garnish 
these plays with all sorts of extraneous and unnecessary baggage, effectively 
alienating their audience and defeating the playwright's main goal: to tell the 
story. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a school of thought, predominantly among theater critics, that 
avant-garde theater should only be understood by it, and that if a theater 
company presents these plays in a way that is understandable to the general 
public, there is something wrong. I call this theatrical elitism at its worst. 
</P>
<P>
 To say that our production needs to be more illogical defies the very powerful 
truth at work in this play. Deadly serious power games and people hiding behind 
their illusions, especially during times of crisis, is as timely as tomorrow's 
Los Angeles Times. Our adaptation and production of Genet's masterpiece focused 
on the reality that Genet offers, clearly and concisely, with the gloriously 
heightened language, imagery and humor that is inherent in the script. If that 
is, as Collins states, "bland (and) slightly campy," then he hasn't been paying 
attention, either to Genet's writing or to the world outside, which 
frighteningly mirrors Genet's nightmare of a world crumbling, and the sometimes 
pathetic, sometimes comic ways people hide from that nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 Genet stated, in his own criticism of some of the "wild and illogical" 
productions of "The Balcony," that "everything should be treated with the 
utmost delicacy. Now, instead of making the play noble, it was vulgarized. . . 
." In other words, to do this play in the manner that Collins feels necessary, 
we should have veered away (as many others have) from the world that the 
playwright created. 
</P>
<P>
 In closing, let me quote Genet once more, in his notes on the 1960 version of 
"The Balcony," on the subject of taking his characters and his words too far 
from the real world: " . . . rocketed up into an abstract sky and then stuck 
there, discomfited and deflated, to figure in deformed constellations. 
Disembodied, they become untouchable. How can we approach them, love, live 
them, if they are dispatched so far away?"

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; BASIA: AN UPBEAT MIX OF '90S TUNES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 She's a tricky one, Basia. In the guise of a spectacularly overproduced pop 
goddess, she manages to sneak in some of the most musically fascinating sounds 
of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 The Polish-English singer's Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre performance on Friday 
showcased her characteristic mixture of pop melodies, Latin rhythms and jazz 
harmonies.  
</P>
<P>
 If there was a problem with Basia's presentation, it was a tendency, despite 
years of living in England, to swallow her consonants, often making it 
difficult to follow her words and experience the complete impact of the songs. 
</P>
<P>
 For many of the tunes, it wasn't a huge loss. The material written by Basia 
and musical partner Danny White was almost unrelentingly upbeat, filled with 
phrases such as "I know there's a lesson in every fall" and "I'm yearning no 
more, 'cause I found my home in you." Only occasionally did one or the other 
produce lyrics with richer messages. 
</P>
<P>
 The music, at least in the better numbers, was brightened by more enigmatic 
impulses. The new "Yearning" is an unusually provocative piece whose 
harmonically arching melody lifts it well beyond the typical pop realm. Basia's 
live rendering was superbly done, profuse with multiple vocal densities firmly 
driven by her rich, dark contralto tones.  
</P>
<P>
 Her new album's title track, "The Sweetest Illusion," had an infectious swing 
bristling with jazz articulations, a first class illustration of how to create 
musically attractive, commercially viable pop music. Equally appealing, with a 
slightly different slant, was "An Olive Tree," a melding of Sergio Mendes with 
Lambert, Hendricks & Ross.  
</P>
<P>
 Far less interesting were the dance-oriented tunes -- recycled ABBA sounds 
apparently calculatedly aimed at their target audience, and creatively well 
beneath the high quality of Basia and White's other works. DON HECKMAN

JOHNSTON, FROM THE HEARTLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE APPLEFORD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's a subversive, alluring quality to the music of Freedy Johnston. His 
songs offer simple, perfect folk-rock melodies, but with lyrics of such 
melancholy that they hang in the air long after all the prettiness has faded. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday at McCabe's, that sound was linked with heartland folk rock, 
mid-'60s lounge pop and big city rock 'n' roll, all embracing Johnston's 
messages on the pain of memory and an otherwise imperfect world. On Saturday, 
the Kansas native sang of selling the family farm to feed his band, of various 
romantic disasters, and of a husband insisting on saying a final goodby to the 
wife he has murdered. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnston adopted a look of wincing earnestness during such moments, but was 
otherwise an amiable host, winking and joking between numbers. He led a quartet 
that moved smoothly from country-rock flourishes to a sparse, even psychedelic 
version of the old Glen Campbell hit "Wichita Lineman." 
</P>
<P>
 For Johnston's "Down in Love," former Bangle Susanna Hoffs joined him for a 
tender duet in a vaguely country vein, and then returned during the encore for 
"To Sir With Love." It was a fine, uplifting finish that had Johnston just as 
comfortable and effective on pop's lighter side, in spite of the trouble he's 
seen. 
</P>
<P>
 * Johnston performs tonight at the Troubadour, 9081 Santa Monica Blvd., West 
Hollywood, 8 p.m. (310) 276-6168. STEVE APPLEFORD

MUSIC REVIEW; CHAMBER CONCERT ENDS UP CLOSING STRAWBERRY CREEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Recent summers have seen a curtailing in the activities of the once-robust 
Strawberry Creek Music Festival in Malibu, but a visit to its home at 
Pepperdine University Saturday night showed that at least some things are still 
in order. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival continues to boast a strong list of faculty and guest artists; 
its student roster, though no longer of orchestral proportions, contains 27 
names.And the chamber music concert in Smothers Theatre, given by faculty and 
guests, proved engaging, committed and well rehearsed. 
</P>
<P>
 Soprano Carla Perez, who doubles as executive director of the festival, opened 
with three Rachmaninoff songs, "O Cease Thy Singing," "The Little Island" and 
"Spring Waters," straightforwardly sung in her ample and rich voice with 
sensitive accompaniment by pianist Val Underwood and, in the Kreisler 
arrangement of the first song, violinist Eugene Gratovitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Underwood joined flutist Gary Woodward for an easygoing and fluid account of 
Prokofiev's Sonata in D. 
</P>
<P>
 A purposeful and heated interpretation of Brahms' Clarinet Quintet wound up 
the program, with clarinetist Gary Gray an expressive collaborator rather than 
soloist with the string quartet of Miwako Watanabe, Gratovitch, Veronica Salas 
and Rick Naill. The reading could seem overstated at times, pushed toward 
melodrama, but this was by way of a positive decision, not from lack of taste 
or technique. 
</P>
<P>
 All was not well, however. At intermission, president Simon Gamer abruptly 
announced the cancellation of this Saturday's festival-closing concert, 
"because of financial difficulties," while guaranteeing the return of 
Strawberry Creek next year. A benefit for the festival, a recital by soprano 
Jeannine Altmeyer, is scheduled at Occidental College, Aug. 20. TIMOTHY MANGAN

TV REVIEW; CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF 'SINGING DETECTIVE' WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The black and shrouded set behind host Melvyn Bragg and his guest, television 
author Dennis Potter, looks like a TV studio after a long day's use. 
</P>
<P>
 When "An Interview With Dennis Potter" was taped weeks before the writer's 
death in early June from pancreatic and liver cancer, it was done with Potter's 
courageous willingness to sit before hot studio lights and summarize his life 
in 65 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Every moment with Bragg -- and Potter fills nearly every moment with effusive 
talk -- quashes the notion of the coward Potter insists he has always been. 
</P>
<P>
 This auto-memorial, produced by Britain's Channel 4, is itself a kind of 
Potter drama: The diseased or dying man, the flood of childhood memories, the 
bursts of passion, the sudden glimpses of mortality, the insistent holding on 
to life. The man who wrote one of TV's few masterpieces, "The Singing 
Detective," ends up, through Bragg, "writing" this penultimate work, which 
might be called "The Singing Television Writer." 
</P>
<P>
 Potter drinks and smokes his way through the talk (briefly interrupted by his 
need to take swigs of pain-killing morphine), celebrating the fact of the 
"now-ness" of life and that he can enjoy every second as if it were his last. 
He even suggests that if he had the time and means, he would kill 
publisher/tycoon Rupert Murdoch, whom he blames for much of the decay in 
English journalism and politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Potter dreads the thought of being young and English and hungry to get into TV 
today; projects without a commercial hook don't stand a chance, he says, 
sounding a lot like American dramatists confronting the U.S. television 
machine. 
</P>
<P>
 The underlying drama of watching this interview is realizing that Potter was 
racing to finish two TV dramas -- his 39th and 40th -- before his death. Able 
to write 10 pages a day by rising at 5 a.m. (early enough before his heavy 
doses of morphine took effect), Potter managed to complete both "Karaoke" (for 
the BBC) and the virtual reality and cryogenic-themed "Cold Lazarus" (for 
Channel 4). 
</P>
<P>
 "Lazarus," about a man of Potter's era thawed out 400 years in the future, may 
be his ultimate cheating of death. Nothing for this great TV ironist and 
visionary could be sweeter. 
</P>
<P>
 * "An Interview With Dennis Potter" airs 9 tonight on KCET Channel 28 (before 
the 10:15 p.m. broadcast of Potter's "Pennies From Heaven").

STREET SMART: IRVINE SAYS IT WILL DO THE RIGHT THING ON MAIN STREET ROADWORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Back before Irvine decided it needed a few palm trees down the middle of Main 
Street, there was a right-turn lane (or at least a shoulder wide enough to 
serve as one) from eastbound Main onto southbound MacArthur Boulevard. This was 
great for people trying to get to the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, though, there's a right-turn arrow, and there is no turn lane. If the 
driver in front plans to go through, the rest of us who want to turn right have 
to wait. 
</P>
<P>
 Since there are three lanes (plus a left-turn lane), couldn't the right one be 
designated a right-turn-only lane? Is this the plan once all the other 
construction is finished? 
</P>
<P>
 Also, as Main heads west under the Costa Mesa Freeway overpass, the right lane 
sort of disappears without much advance warning. This should be marked better. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 When construction is completed in mid-August, eastbound Main Street at 
MacArthur Boulevard will have one left-turn lane, three through lanes and one 
right-turn lane, said Barry Greenstein, senior transportation engineer for 
Irvine. It is less certain when road striping will be painted and more signs 
erected to alert motorists to the "disappearing" right lane on westbound Main, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Contractors doing the roadwork were supposed to add striping and signs warning 
of the lane drop, but have yet to do it, Greenstein said. The work should be 
done before the construction project is finished, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 In Anaheim at the Riverside Freeway westbound off-ramp at Euclid Street, one 
lane must turn left only and the other lane turn right only. There is much more 
left-bound traffic than right-bound, and, with the short green light, it 
usually takes two or three light cycles to make a left turn. 
</P>
<P>
 I suggest they allow left turns from both lanes, as is done in the same 
situation at Harbor Boulevard. All that would be required would be a new turn 
direction sign. 
</P>
<P>

</P>

</P>
<P>
 There appears to be more traffic waiting to turn left because the right-lane 
traffic can empty faster than the left by turning right on the red light, said 
Rose Orem, a spokeswoman for Caltrans. If both left and right turns were 
allowed from the right lane, just one driver wanting to turn left from the 
right lane could stop the flow of traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 This blockage in turn would create a long line for the right lane, Orem said. 
That potential delay is the reason Caltrans won't change the lane configuration 
of this off-ramp. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans' traffic engineers did do a field investigation of the off-ramp and 
discovered the only delay in the left lane was due to slow-moving drivers, Orem 
said. To remedy the problem, Caltrans increased the time for the green light. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Why don't they put a left-turn-only signal at the intersection of southbound 
Avenida de la Carlotta and the entrance to the San Diego Freeway? I have 
witnessed several near-accidents with people trying to enter the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 E. Leonard 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 County traffic experts do plan to install left-turn signals at that 
intersection, said Ignacio Ochoa, county traffic engineer. But the change won't 
happen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of a massive plan to improve the El Toro Road corridor, work will 
begin in the spring of 1996 to widen the Avenida de la Carlotta and Paseo de 
Valencia intersection, including the on- and off-ramps to Interstate 5, Ochoa 
said. The plans call for not one, but two left-turn lanes to access the 
freeway, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ochoa said the accident history at the intersection does reveal a number of 
accidents in the past 10 years, but the minority of them have been related to 
left turns. Therefore, there is no rush to install left-turn signals, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "The number of accidents did not raise a red flag," Ochoa said. "It is not an 
area where the accidents are so numerous that we need to do interim 
improvements."  
</P>

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: PLATFORM; 'OUR 
SYSTEM OF PUNISHMENT DOESN'T WORK' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The caning of an American teen-ager in Singapore and a recent case in the 
Washington State where a judge, after consulting with tribal elders, sentenced 
two native Americans to a term of banishment has focused attention on the 
question of alternatives to prison. We sought the personal opinions of Southern 
Californians who are knowledgeable about the criminal justice system.  
</P>
<P>
 GILBERT GEIS 
</P>
<P>
 Professor emeritus, Department of Criminology, Law and Society, UC Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 It seems to me absolutely unarguable that what we're doing in the United 
States has not worked very effectively. We have the toughest penal policy in 
the world barring, possibly, South Africa. We've now managed to exceed the 
(former) Soviet Union and we're probably ahead of China and we have certainly 
one of the highest crime rates in the world. That's not saying that one causes 
the other; but certainly you can say what we're doing has not been marvelously 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
 It means that somebody ought to sit down and try to think of other things that 
might be more effective. It is absolutely essential to convince people who 
violate the law that it is not the sort of thing that one ought to do. And I 
don't think you can convince them by isolating them from the mainstream social 
system. You've got to convince them there's a place for them. You've got to 
shame them in a manner in which they do not feel that they're thrown out from 
"ordinary" and "decent" people but are themselves fundamentally decent and 
though they've strayed. LARRY ROTHSTEIN 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy probation officer, Specialized Gang Supervision Unit, Los Angeles 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 We have special "probation schools" where we can work with kids, both in their 
education and in their behavior and dress. I also strongly believe in community 
service -- particularly anti-graffiti programs where for several days kids are 
reminded of the consequences of their activities. It also aids the community in 
cleaning up. Since we have this variety of things that can be recommended, we 
have a lot of alternative sentencing even in the existing system. JOHN WATSON 
</P>
<P>
 Judge, Orange County Superior Court 
</P>
<P>
 I was a prosecutor for 20 years before I was a judge and for many years I was 
convinced we were not approaching sentencing as intelligently as we could have. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the things that really frustrated me was the attitude that this is the 
finest system of criminal justice ever devised by the mind of man. I began to 
look into it. It was surprising how innovative and intelligent many of these 
other approaches were -- and very surprising to find out the amount of 
international cooperation among other countries that the United States does not 
take part in. I think it's the height of elitism for us to say there's no point 
in studying what the French or the Bulgarians or the Namibians are doing. JOHN 
D. CONLEY 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant District Attorney, Orange County 
</P>
<P>
 When I began as a prosecutor 22 years ago, the concept of rehabilitation was 
very strong in the system; in fact, it was written into the system. And we 
bought into the concept of rehabilitation in terms of mentally disordered sex 
offenders -- we allowed them to go state hospitals instead of prison. We 
allowed people into drug programs in lieu of custody, and so on. It was 
apparent after a period of time that that failed, that the successes were few 
and far between. The determinate sentencing law in 1977 changed from 
rehabilitation to punishment as the goal, rehabilitation never having been 
achieved. I think most of us prosecutors and professionals in law enforcement 
are somewhat skeptical about the ability to rehabilitate adults, though 
juveniles are an entirely different situation. JOSE MEDINA 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney in Torrance, specializing in criminal defense and family law 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not so sure about some of alternatives like the (proposal to) paddle 
graffiti (vandals). Should government have a right to do that? I believe in 
alternative punishment but one has to be careful just what is fashioned. Even 
while the judge has discretion he should not have discretion to do some things, 
for example, like they did in Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
 The good thing about the system here in the United States is that things can 
be checked. As you recall, a while back a (defendant) was convicted of rape and 
(was sentenced) to chemical castration. That was found to be too cruel and 
unusual. It was just more than will withstand constitutional scrutiny. GEORGE 
T. FELKENES 
</P>
<P>
 Chairman of the Program in Politics and Policy, Claremont Graduate School 
</P>
<P>
 I think the public is totally bewildered by the fact that literally hundreds 
of thousands of crimes a year go unpunished. It would seem to me that they're 
willing to accept a more Draconian form of punishment -- some type of alternate 
punishment that was swift (and) sure. I think they're just disenchanted with 
the punishment(s) we've got now and they're willing to look for alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is what the alternates will be. The punishment (ought to) 
contribute something to the welfare of the person and society. But locking a 
person up doesn't contribute a lot to the welfare of society.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: CONVERSATION WITH 
JEANETTA JOHNSON; WORKING TOUGH STREETS, 'TREAT EVERYONE WITH RESPECT' 
TELEPHONE SERVICE TECHNICIANS ARE AMONG THE RANKS OF WORKERS WHO VENTURE INTO 
HIGH-CRIME NEIGHBORHOODS EACH DAY ON THEIR JOBS. TRIN YARBOROUGH TALKED WITH 
JEANETTA JOHNSON, A TECHNICIAN WHO IS ALSO A MEMBER OF A SPECIAL PACIFIC BELL 
COMMUNITY RELATIONS TEAM THAT TRAINS OTHER PHONE COMPANY EMPLOYEES TO AVOID 
TENSE SITUATIONS. SINCE THE TEAM'S INCEPTION IN 1992, THE ANNUAL NUMBER OF 
VIOLENT INCIDENTS INVOLVING PAC BELL WORKERS HAS DROPPED FROM 32 TO TWO SO FAR 
THIS YEAR.  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Question: What are some of the things the community relations team does? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: We go into the rougher neighborhoods and meet with grass-roots 
organizations. Most of the people in these neighborhoods are good hard-working 
people, just doing their best to survive like everyone else. We want people to 
know we are phone company employees, not police. We demonstrate phone equipment 
at schools and block parties and are part of a group that gives out decorated 
trees at Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What problems have you encountered? 
</P>
<P>
 A: We've stepped over dead bodies. We've hooked up phones in drug houses. And 
we see a lot of poverty: big holes in the floor with rats coming up, kids who 
haven't had a bath in weeks and have no food in the house, older people lying 
in filth with no one to care for them. I've had guns and knives pulled on me, 
had mentally disturbed people confront me. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes people just want a sounding board, so they yell and scream and I sit 
and take it. They talk to me about something that has nothing to do with phones 
-- like they can't find a job or their son is on drugs and they don't know what 
to do. Sometimes I'm able to put them in touch with a solution. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How has all this affected you? 
</P>
<P>
 A: When I first started working in high-crime neighborhoods, it was scary. For 
three years, if a person was anything other than what I thought they should be, 
I wouldn't shake their hand or look at them. But something happened that made 
me see that people are people, and I realized it was time to make changes in 
myself. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What happened? 
</P>
<P>
 A: One day I went into a fast-food place, ordered lunch and realized I didn't 
have any money with me. I was real embarrassed and was going to leave. Then 
this real bummy-looking guy over in a corner, a raggedy guy in his '30s, 
African American like I am, said: "Don't worry, I'll pay." Well, I was 
wondering what he really wanted from me, but he insisted. It stayed on my mind 
because I knew that money was probably all he had. I did see him again and paid 
him back. He was soft-spoken, with an amazing intellect. He changed me. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Have you changed in other ways? 
</P>
<P>
 A: You come to truly appreciate what you have. Once I really wanted this pair 
of glasses with special trim and couldn't afford them. Then I went to a house 
where a lady could hardly see and couldn't afford any glasses at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What else do you teach other employees? 
</P>
<P>
 A: We teach about the different gang colors: Once the company gave out some 
folders in a school, and the kids had to leave them there because they were the 
color of a rival gang. We teach them never to stand in front of a door when 
they knock as someone inside could shoot through it. Those kinds of things. 
</P>
<P>
 We also teach them to treat everyone with respect. Always let people see your 
eyes. Always say hello and talk to people in a courteous, respectful way. When 
you go in someone's house, act as if it's your house, and no matter what you 
see, do your best work. And never go out on your job with an attitude.

OJAI VALLEY TRAIL: CREATING A NON-CAR COMMUTER ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 'The big difference about the Ojai Valley Trail is that it addresses both 
transportation and recreation; it's a real multiple use trail that accommodates 
anything non motorized:bicycles, pedestrians, skateboards, wheelchairs, 
rollerblades, and horses. It's become a national model. We're looking at it as 
the first leg of a commuter route from Ojai to Ventura, which makes the 
extension eligible for state transportation money. Air quality in Ventura 
County is not up to federal standards, so we have to get rid of cars. The 
problem is people commuting to work when they have less than five miles to go. 
We're setting up a multimodal system for the county so you can ride the first 
five miles on your bicycle and then you can hop on mass transit.' 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ron Blakemore, Regional Trail & Pathways Program, County of Ventura 
</P>
<P>
 The Ojai Valley Trail runs along an abandoned railroad right-of-way 9.5 miles 
from Foster Park. It's 20 feet wide, with 10 feet paved and 10 more feet of 
wood chip and dirt for horses, separated by a rail fence. It provides a safe 
alternate route to Highway 33. The County of Ventura completed the trail in 
1989 and the trail pays for itself from underground utility leases. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the Ventura County Transportation Commission is working on acquisition of 
37 1/2 miles of rail corridor to develop a new trail geared toward commuter 
use. This includes the 5.8-mile Ventura River Trail, which will connect the 
Ojai Valley Trail to the Omer Rains Trail along the beach. By looking at the 
trail as a commuter route, new sources of funding have been secured for 
alleviating traffic congestion and improving air quality. The trail will cost 
about $750,000 per mile to acquire and develop, but it's expected to generate 
revenue by increasing tourism to downtown Ventura.

through 1992 and plans to return next year. She currently lives in Hawaii.

<TEXT>
<P>
 My habit on Sunday mornings is to spend a couple of hours reading The Times at 
the local coffee place. On this particular Sunday, I sat down at a table next 
to an ordinary-looking man. When he looked up, I smiled and nodded, and began 
to flip through the paper. 
</P>
<P>
 He continued to look at me. When I looked up again, he asked, "What 
nationality are you?" I gave my standard reply, "I'm American." 
</P>
<P>
 He tried again, "I mean, what ethnicity are you?" Well, ethnically, I'm 
Chinese. But because I have been pegged in the past for being all sorts of 
things, I asked him to guess. "Chinese or Taiwanese," he said. I told him he 
was right, even though he didn't seem to understand that Taiwanese are Chinese 
ethnics who live in Taiwan. He said that I didn't look "overtly Chinese," but 
because I was reading the Sunday Times and had a book with me, he deduced it. 
"The Chinese tend to be sharp and educated," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
 A Chinese-American friend of mine likes stereotypes such as this, which he 
sees as basically positive. I must admit that these images have benefited me, 
too. Once, a cop let me go after stopping me for speeding. He asked where I was 
going in such a hurry. I said that I was going to a research meeting at my 
professor's house. Apparently, a plausible excuse. I am convinced that, no 
matter what I do, I will never be seen as a troublemaker. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are times when a little agitation is necessary, and when one is an 
Asian woman the effect is a little difficult to achieve. For example, my 
sister, also a short Asian woman, and I were given a hotel room in Washington, 
D.C., next to a room full of partying teen-agers. Unable to sleep at all, we 
called the front desk several times throughout the night to no discernible 
improvement. When we complained in the morning, the manager called us "ladies" 
in a patronizing tone and told us in exaggeratedly slow speech -- as if we 
could not speak English -- that no refunds could be made. My sister and I were 
infuriated to the point of screaming at him until he relented, apologized for 
the inconvenience and refunded our money. Just in time too, as the people 
waiting in line began to leave, unaccustomed to seeing diminutive Asian women 
in hysterics. 
</P>
<P>
 And once, I was at a psychiatry case conference where a psychiatric resident 
was analyzing a tense interaction between an Asian teacher and a Latino parent. 
He suspected that as a neat, organized Asian, the teacher could not tolerate 
the chaotic lifestyle that typified the Latino. Well, I am a disorganized Asian 
who knows many compulsively neat Latinos, so I suggested that the conflict may 
have a bit more to do with personality than cultural differences. 
</P>
<P>
 My sport of choice, basketball, also seems to contradict a stereotype. When I 
confess my enthusiasm for slam dunks and three-pointers, I usually get a 
slightly startled response and a remark like, "Oh, you play basketball?" I then 
feel a vague sense of guilt for not living up to the feminine ideal that seems 
to personify the Asian woman. The next time I'm asked what I do for exercise, I 
should say "light jogging or tennis, because my constitution is quite delicate 
and cannot withstand heavy physical exertion." 
</P>
<P>
 Lest you think that I deliberately contrived a personality to counter the 
Asian stereotype, I should also note that I studied classical piano, am quite 
computer literate, and once majored in engineering -- all of which seem to be 
associated with being Asian. 
</P>
<P>
 But I would happily give up the "positive" aspects of the stereotype in order 
to be liberated from the negative. It is not uncommon these days to see a new 
and burgeoning category in the personal ads: "White male seeking Asian female." 
Whenever I see this, I wonder what it is these men are seeking. Is it what 
playwright David Henry Huang calls the "butterfly" persona -- an exotic, 
submissive woman who caters to her man's every whim? Is it what a white male 
friend of mine, who dates mostly Chinese American women, believes -- that Asian 
women just "put up with more crap" on the average? This is the kind of 
mentality that says, while white women have been ruined by the feminist 
movement, Asian women remain unspoiled, willing to overlook the occasional 
sexual indiscretion and sexist remark. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, when I was walking on the beach in Santa Monica, a man walking past said 
"Hi" in an insistent tone. I ignored him and continued walking. Having passed 
me, he doubled back and shouted "Hi!" his face about a foot from mine. I 
continued walking and he left me alone, muttering to himself "Chinita," a 
derogatory Spanish term for Chinese female. 
</P>
<P>
 I had the choice of telling him off, which would have spoiled my nice walk, or 
ignoring him, which made me feel somewhat helpless. I wish I didn't have to 
choose at all.

 TOM SELLECK 
</P>
<P>
 Actor and national spokesman, along with former Texas Rep. Barbara Jordan, for 
the Character Counts Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We've been arguing for 30-some years in this country about whose values are 
correct and we haven't even gotten to the really tough part , which is how to 
instill these values in our young people without getting heavy-handed about it. 
We're still at the stage of granting permission that it's OK to talk about 
(ethics and values). 
</P>
<P>
 You know, adults talk differently if they think a kid is listening. What 
they've got to realize is that kids are listening all the time. Double 
standards don't fly. Kids see through that. You have to face the fact that who 
you are is more important than what you are; and how and why you do something 
is as important as what you do. 
</P>
<P>
 I've got a 26-year-old son and a 5-year-old daughter. I was very fortunate to 
have been raised by parents who weren't of the "Do as I say, not as I do" 
school. Having learned that lesson from my parents I learned it even more 
through my kids. When you talk about ethics, you can't preach to somebody else, 
"I'm perfect, (but) you better work on yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 Getting involved in the Character Counts Coalition also seemed a natural 
progression of my concern for ethics in journalism. It's always a little 
assaultive when you see your civil rights change when you become a "public 
figure." 
</P>
<P>
 What attracted me to the Coalition was that the people and groups supporting 
it were so diverse. Barbara Jordan was going to be the national spokesperson 
and they wanted me also. Now, Barbara's a hero of mine and I'm pretty sure she 
and I don't always vote alike. And the board has people like (former Reagan 
Education Secretary) Bill Bennett and (Head of the Children's Defense Fund) 
Marian Wright Edelman. Those aren't just bumper stickers, they're real people. 
But whatever "bumper sticker" value they carry shows diversity and it shows 
consensus. That's the only effective way to approach the whole character issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The thing I always add when I talk to kids or anyone else about the 
intimidating subject of ethics is that I fail to reach my standards every day. 
And if I did reach my standards then they may not have been set high enough. 
We're talking about setting goals for the kind of person we strive to be. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a grass-roots thing. Character is going to be taught one individual to 
another, hopefully by parents to their children; but if not a parent then a 
teacher or a coach or a mentor of some kind. We can't have a lost generation of 
kids or else we'll have a lost generation of adults.

VALLEY CHRONICLE: PATRONS HUNGRY FOR DELI TO REOPEN AFTER WEEKLONG FACE LIFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUE REILLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As of today, it will be business as usual. 
</P>
<P>
 The patrons of Solley's Restaurant & Delicatessen will find the local landmark 
reopened in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The deli has been undergoing a $500,000, weeklong face lift, and many of its 
regular customers were not amused. 
</P>
<P>
 People climbed across the wooden barriers to demand to know what was 
happening. 
</P>
<P>
 They squeezed by workmen, went inside, saw the naked interior, shook their 
heads and left in high dudgeon. 
</P>
<P>
 Others hunted down the owner to demand to know when the renovation nonsense 
would be over. 
</P>
<P>
 One irate customer called to find out how much longer he was going to have to 
eat his wife's cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people are famous for being in the movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people are famous for being famous. 
</P>
<P>
 Sol Zide is famous for owning a couple of Valley delicatessens that have 
become institutions to the patrons who have turned both the Woodland Hills and 
Sherman Oaks locations into something of a neighborhood social club. 
</P>
<P>
 Zide says he has been recognized by Valley patrons on trips to Hawaii, the 
Caribbean, Tahiti and Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember going to Cabo San Lucas with my wife, Helen, and seeing one of the 
fishermen in a Solley's T-shirt. That was pretty weird," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Zide says he's been told that Wayne Gretzky's picture is in the Hockey Hall of 
Fame wearing a Solley's T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Marlon Brando often heads for the Sherman Oaks Solley's on Van Nuys Boulevard 
just south of the Ventura Freeway where he might be seated near O.J. Simpson's 
attorney Robert Shapiro. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbra Streisand used to go to the Woodland Hills deli on Ventura Boulevard 
near Topanga Canyon until she got into a snit over not getting preferential 
treatment, according to Zide. Christian Slater and Heather Locklear don't make 
a fuss about having to wait, the owner says. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a group of businessmen, known as the Bad Boys Breakfast Club, that has 
had breakfast at the Woodland Hills deli every day for so many years they made 
up a plaque to reserve their special table between 7 and 8 a.m. daily. 
</P>
<P>
 A second-generation deli man whose brother and sisters also have been in the 
business, Zide can't think of anything else he would rather have done with his 
life, except maybe spend more time motorcycling or deep-sea fishing. But nobody 
is going to feel sorry for a guy whose office is the place where he would hang 
out if he didn't already own it. 
</P>
<P>
 "My restaurants are like having an extended family. Most of the people who 
work for me have been here 20 and 30 years. My general manager, Brad Chamian, 
started out 18 years ago as a bus boy when he was a Calabasas High School 
student. He worked his way up from deli manager to assistant manager to store 
manager and now runs both places," Zide says. 
</P>
<P>
 He says customers who have been coming regularly for 10 or 20 years now bring 
in their children and grandchildren. Sometimes, he says, people who have moved 
away come back on a sort of pilgrimage. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of his employees have married other employees and even if they move away 
they send pictures of their children, according to Zide, who admits it's a 
feel-good deal he fell into. 
</P>
<P>
 He smiles when he talks about his deli-operating father making the long drive 
to the Valley in the early '70s, taking a look at the space Zide had chosen to 
build his deli, and saying just two words: "Too big." 
</P>
<P>
 As it happens, it wasn't. In fact, Zide's been doing nothing but growing ever 
since he opened the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 At one time he was considered the Deli King of the San Fernando Valley and had 
four delis going. It was too much like work, he says, so he sold two and kept 
the Sherman Oaks and original Woodland Hills spots. 
</P>
<P>
 Zide says he is always trying to update the menus. If the latest food fad is 
egg whites with papaya and chili sauce, he will offer it. 
</P>
<P>
 He recently started offering tours of the bakery at the Sherman Oaks location. 
"People can't get over the fact that we make all our own bakery products 
there," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 They also can't get over the idea he would close the Woodland Hills location 
for a whole week just to modernize it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We opened this location in 1973 with about 5,000 square feet and have grown 
to about 8,000. It was time to update things, give it a new look and bring in 
some new equipment. We did all the remodeling in just a week," says Zide. 
</P>
<P>
 His customers will be happy if he never does that again. Nino Again Greeting 
the Rich and Famous 
</P>
<P>
 If the customers at Solley's felt displaced during a weeklong make-over, 
consider the Angst of the Polo Lounge's rich and famous. 
</P>
<P>
 The place-to-be-seen eatery in the Beverly Hills Hotel has been getting its 
face lifted for the past several years. 
</P>
<P>
 No more Neil McCarthy salad. 
</P>
<P>
 No more table hopping and schmoozing. 
</P>
<P>
 No more Nino to put people in their proper position of power. 
</P>
<P>
 Sad, but true. 
</P>
<P>
 If you know Nino Osti, you are probably in the entertainment business. 
</P>
<P>
 If Nino Osti knows you, you are probably a big shot. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than 20 years Nino drove from his comfortable, but modest, home in 
the Valley to the Beverly Hills Hotel where he was the maitre d' of the Polo 
Lounge. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Cher and Madonna, people needed only to use his first name. 
</P>
<P>
 His power was described in the travel industry's Gold Book in an article 
titled, "Who's Who in Beverly Hills": 
</P>
<P>
 "In a town where one's seating position often determines someone's importance, 
Polo Lounge maitre d' Nino is the barometer of success." 
</P>
<P>
 Nino had as much star power as many of the high-profile people he seated, and 
his demeanor was likened to a Swiss bank president, a duke from Palermo or a 
four-star general. 
</P>
<P>
 His defining characteristic was, however, his genuine courtesy. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is why there is much hand shaking and kissing from patrons frequenting 
the Beverly Hilton Hotel's Trader Vic's restaurant. Hotel owner Merv Griffin 
recently established Nino as the maitre d' in that illustrious watering hole. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the Beverly Hills Hotel closed for renovation, I spent a lot of time 
listening to people who wanted to back me in new restaurants, but I kept hoping 
the Beverly Hills Hotel would reopen. I spent more than 20 years there," Nino 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 After he, and everyone else in town, got to thinking that maybe the Beverly 
Hills Hotel was a never ending work-in-progress, Griffin called Nino at his new 
home in the Santa Clarita Valley and made an offer he couldn't refuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was anxious to get back to work. I missed the people I used to see every 
day at the Polo Lounge," says Nino. "I like seeing them all again, at Trader 
Vic's which is, like the Polo Lounge, a place with a lot of 
entertainment-industry history." 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin has taken to sitting at the bar when Nino is working so Griffin can 
watch the response of the delighted guests when they spot Nino. 
</P>
<P>
 "He seems to be happy that people are glad to see me," says Nino, "and so am 
I." Help Wanted at Canoga to Strike Up the Band 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to getting the new agriculture/environmental magnet started at 
Canoga Park High School this summer, Principal Larry Higgins has another 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 He's had to face the music and admit that unless he finds a leader for the 
school orchestra there is not going to be anyone to strike up the band. 
</P>
<P>
 "Listen, this is a real problem. We had a great band leader and USC stole him. 
I've been looking all over for a new one. Please put it in the paper that if 
anyone has experience and is interested to call me." 
</P>
<P>
 The call, if it comes, will be music to his ears. Overheard 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish the O. J. Simpson trial was a soap opera so it would be on every day."

By DARIA MUSE, Daria Muse will be a senior this fall at Franklin High School in 
Highland Park. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During my elementary and middle-school years, I was a well-behaved, friendly 
student at school and a tough, hard-nosed "bad girl" in my neighborhood. This 
contrast in behavior was a survival tool, for I lived in a part of 
South-Central Los Angeles where "goody-goodies" aren't tolerated, and I 
attended school in Northridge, where trouble-makers aren't tolerated. 
</P>
<P>
 Beckford Ave. Elementary School was in the heart of a middle-class suburbia, 
and I, coming from what has been described as the "urban jungle," was bused 
there every day for six years. That it was a privilege for kids like us to be 
bused to a good school like Beckford was drummed into our heads by our teachers 
and principal so as to induce us, "the bus kids," into behaving like the young 
ladies and gentlemen they wanted us to be, instead of the uncontrollable 
delinquents they thought we were. 
</P>
<P>
 In a roundabout way, I was told from the first day of school that if I wanted 
to continue my privileged attendance in the hallowed classrooms of Beckford, I 
would have to conform and adapt to their standards. I guess I began to believe 
all that they said because slowly I began to conform. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of wearing the tight jeans and T-shirt which were the style in 
South-Central at the time, I wore schoolgirl dresses like those of my female 
classmates. I even changed my language. When asking a question, instead of 
saying, "Boy! Gimme those scissors before I knock you up you head!" in school, 
I asked, "Excuse me, would you please hand me the scissors?" When giving a 
compliment in school I'd say, "You look very nice today." instead of "Girl, who 
do you think you are, dressin' so fine, Miss Thang." 
</P>
<P>
 This conformation of my appearance and speech won me the acceptance of my 
proper classmates at Beckford Elementary School, but after getting out of the 
school bus and stepping onto the sidewalks of South-Central, my appearance quit 
being an asset and became a dangerous liability. 
</P>
<P>
 One day, when I got off the school bus, a group of tough girls who looked as 
though they were part of a gang approached me, looked at my pink and white lace 
dress, and accused me of trying to "look white." They surrounded me and 
demanded a response that would prove to them that I still loyal to my black 
heritage. I screamed, "Lay off me, girl, or I'll bust you in the eyes so bad 
that you'll need a telescope just to see!" The girls walked away without 
causing any more trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 From then on, two personalities emerged. I began living a double life. At 
school I was prim and proper in appearance and in speech, but during the drive 
on the school bus from Northridge to South-Central, my other personality 
emerged. Once I got off the bus I put a black jacket over my dress, I hardened 
my face, and roughened my speech to show everyone who looked my way that I was 
not a girl to be messed with. I led this double life throughout my six years of 
elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that I am older and can look back at that time objectively, I don't regret 
displaying contrasting behavior in the two different environments. It was for 
my survival. Daria, the hard-nosed bad girl, survived in the urban jungle and 
Daria, the well-behaved student, survived in the suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
 As a teen-ager in high school I still display different personalities: I act 
one way in school, which is different from the way I act with my parents, which 
is different from the way I act with my friends, which is different from the 
way I act in religious services. But don't we all? We all put on character 
masks for our different roles in life. All people are guilty of acting 
differently at work than at play and differently with co-workers than with the 
boss. There's nothing wrong with having different personalities to fit 
different situations; the trick is knowing the real you from the characters.

By Patricia A. Konley talked with David Diaz, an environmental planner. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A major sticking point in the Metropolitan Transit Authority strike is the use 
of outside workers for some jobs now done by union employees. It raises the 
issue of how to balance saving middle-class jobs with the need by government 
and private concerns to cut costs.  
</P>
<P>
 Patricia A. Konley talked with David Diaz, an environmental planner who helped 
prepare a 1992 report on the effects of privatization in the Los Angeles County 
Health Department for SEIU Local 660. He strongly favors preserving jobs.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I studied the privatization program of the Los Angeles County Health 
Department, five years of contracts from 1987 to 1991, and came to the 
conclusion that the county wasn't actually saving money. 
</P>
<P>
 When you add in all the administrative costs -- monitoring, problems with the 
contract, project resolution -- you see that the county didn't actually save 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though they didn't want to admit it, 75% of all the evaluations of 
private contractors that were given to us by the County of Los Angeles Health 
Department showed that the private contractors did not meet the minimum 
standard of acceptable performance. So, not only were they not saving money, 
but they weren't getting the work done. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, a couple of times some major multinational vendors let their insurance 
policies lapse in county hospitals. That meant if an employee or patron 
slipped, county taxpayers were on the hook. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing we weren't able look at was the low-wage structure of the private 
contractors. And the time sheets showed no medical benefits. So John Q 
Contractor is paying $6 an hour. If an employee or family member is injured and 
has to go to the county hospital, and stays there for 10 days, the county pays. 
(The county was) the medical safety net for all these (contract) workers 
because there was no health insurance. And that wasn't even factored in the 
study. 
</P>
<P>
 I think we really need to look at Canada, Europe and Japan. There's a 
fundamental standard of living in those countries that the entire social fabric 
comes to expect. The best example is the generous European vacation and (paid) 
family-leave policies. In our society, such programs wouldn't have a chance of 
passing through the state Legislature or Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want a Malaysian, Indonesian, Thai or Chinese wage structure, that's 
the society you're going to deliver to your doorstep. You can't have a 
Third-World wage structure and pretend this is going to be a First-World 
society. 
</P>
<P>
 The racism and xenophobia against immigrants is because the white middle class 
and their children are is beginning to understand that they are as vulnerable 
as low-income workers to the stress of living on lower incomes, and they don't 
like it. 
</P>
<P>
 Our society has to make a fundamental choice of how we want to live. We're in 
the advanced age of technology and we're still scrambling to feed ourselves, 
trying to make sure we have health care and having these absurd three-day 
vacations where people drive like maniacs because they don't have enough free 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 We really need to take a new look and address the question, "Is this economy 
geared for gaining more and more for personal wealth, or are we here as a 
collective society to make life more enjoyable for all of us?" Otherwise, you 
pay with fear, with crime, with a crumbling infrastructure and a failed school 
system.

PERSPECTIVE ON IMMIGRATION; CLEARING UP THE MYTHS AND MISPERCEPTIONS; ILLEGAL 
IMMIGRANTS ARE A SERIOUS CALIFORNIA PROBLEM THAT NEEDS ADDRESSING, BUT NOT WITH 
NATIONAL 'REFORMS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL FIX and JEFFREY S. PASSEL, Michael Fix and Jeffrey S. Passel are 
senior analysts at the Urban Institute in Washington and co-authors of its new 
study, Immigrants and Immigration: Setting the Record Straight. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Over the past two years, immigration has been transformed into a wedge issue, 
one that, like crime, race and abortion, taps into popular passions and defines 
essential political values. This transformation has moved the debate beyond the 
Beltway and the elites that once dominated it to a far larger political and 
public audience. But the opinions of these larger audiences are being shaped by 
impressions, emotions and flawed studies and not by hard facts. As a result, 
reforms are being proposed that address perceptions rather than reality. 
</P>
<P>
 What are some of the basic facts that should guide our thinking and policy on 
this issue? 
</P>
<P>
 The policy context. Immigration policy needs to be viewed not as one but three 
separate policies: the admission of legal immigrants on family- and 
work-related grounds; humanitarian admissions, principally refugees and 
asylees, and the control of illegal immigration through border and workplace 
enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 The distinction is important because the focus on our failure to control 
illegal immigration has led many to view immigration as a whole in a negative 
light. As a result, the strengths of our legal and humanitarian admissions 
policies have been obscured and the standards we should use to evaluate them 
have been lost. 
</P>
<P>
 The immigrant population. We need to be clear about the characteristics of 
current immigration flows. The most commonly noted is their scale: More 
immigrants entered the United States in the 1980s (10 million) than during any 
decade in our history. Less frequently noticed is that the share of the 
population that is foreign-born (8%) is one-half what it was at the turn of the 
century (15%). 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to their scale, what is striking about current flows is their 
concentration and pace: A mere six states are home to 75% of all immigrants; 
93% live in urban areas. In terms of pace, almost half of the immigrant 
population was not here 10 years ago. The apparent failure of many immigrants 
to integrate rapidly -- to speak English well, for example -- has more to do 
with their recent arrival than their abilities or separatist inclinations. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to popular belief, most immigrants are here with the nation's express 
consent. Of the 19.7 million foreign-born counted by the 1990 Census, more than 
half were legal permanent residents, one-third were naturalized citizens and 
roughly 13% were here illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 Illegal immigration. The nature and scale of illegal immigration are broadly 
misunderstood. The flow is, for the most part, circular, with most leaving soon 
after arrival. Thus, the most useful measure is the number of illegal 
immigrants who enter and stay, or about 200,000 to 300,000 per year, not the 
1.5 million apprehensions of illegal immigrants that take place along the 
southern border. Thus, in an annual immigration flow of 1.1 million, illegal 
immigrants represent about one-quarter, not the 75% that public opinion polls 
report that many Americans believe. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than half of the country's illegal immigrants cross the southern border 
clandestinely; most enter legally and overstay their visas and most 
(two-thirds) are not Mexican. 
</P>
<P>
 That said, almost half of the nation's 3.5 million illegal immigrants live in 
California, one-quarter of them in Los Angeles County. This means that 
California's immigrants are more likely to be poor and illegal than is the case 
for the country as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigrant "quality." A perception that the new immigrants, who are 
preponderantly from poor Latin American and Asian countries, are less educated 
than their European predecessors has led to complaints about the declining 
quality of recent immigrants and to calls for reduced immigration. How accurate 
are these perceptions, and does a policy shift toward restriction make sense? 
</P>
<P>
 The key here is to distinguish among immigrants on the basis of whether they 
enter as legal immigrants, refugees or illegals. Legal immigrants generally 
have high education levels and are substantially more likely to have a college 
degree than native-born Americans. But the education levels of refugees and 
illegal immigrants fall below those of natives. 
</P>
<P>
 Another measure of "quality" that is often used is income. The average incomes 
of both legal immigrant and refugee households that entered the United States 
before 1980 are higher than those of natives. The poverty rate for these groups 
is no higher than for natives. As for legal immigrants and refugees arriving 
after 1980, a larger share is poor (23% versus 12% for natives). 
</P>
<P>
 It is frequently claimed that immigrants are more likely to be on welfare than 
are natives. In an absolute sense, this is true: The census indicates that 4.7% 
of immigrants are on welfare, versus 4.2% of natives. But welfare use among 
immigrants is highly concentrated among two vulnerable populations: refugees, 
who usually arrive without family or job networks and require immediate 
assistance, and the elderly, who receive SSI because they have not worked here 
long enough to qualify for Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
 Working-age immigrants are substantially less likely to use welfare than are 
natives (3.7% versus 3.2%), and recently arrived working-age immigrants are 
even less likely to use welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Welfare use among illegal immigrants is so low as to be undetectable, 
primarily because they are barred from virtually all benefit programs. 
</P>
<P>
 What do these facts mean for policy? First, fix only what is broken. Legal 
immigrants appear to be doing well. Illegal immigration needs to be stopped not 
just at the border, but also by addressing the problem of visa overstayers. 
And, while California's immigration troubles are important to the nation, they 
are unique and should not dictate the nation's policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, because welfare use among immigrants is concentrated among two 
vulnerable, legally admitted populations, curbing immigrant access to public 
benefits may yield lower savings than many admit and will have a negligible 
impact on illegal immigration. The Legal Majority

NATIONAL HEALTH CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 According to a study conducted by the economic research firm DRI/McGraw-Hill, 
the typical American household may have to forfeit $461 worth of annual medical 
services under President Clinton's proposed health care scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the same as nine visits to the doctor! 
</P>
<P>
 For some people who just don't get sick very much, this may not be a big deal. 
But to thousands of elderly Americans who are getting more susceptible to 
illness and injury every day, this loss of medical services could be 
devastating. 
</P>
<P>
 And since I'm sure elderly Americans will be asked to bear a huge portion of 
the cost of this plan -- just as we had to with Clinton's recent tax increase 
on Social Security benefits -- it doesn't make sense that we should also have 
to suffer the most. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, I think this plan is bad for all Americans, not just the elderly. 
No one should have to face sub-quality rationed health care. America, despite 
its very real problems, is still the envy of the world when it comes to quality 
medical care. No one is denied lifesaving emergency treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 But if President Clinton's plan passes and the government limits how much the 
nation can spend on health care, our medical quality is going to plummet along 
with our access to care. Just look at the experience of the former Eastern bloc 
nations.

ARCADIA WINS LEGION AREA 6 PLAYOFFS, 7-5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Westlake-Royal players joked that it would have been nice if right-hander Maki 
Kramer could have pitched two complete games in the Area 6 American Legion 
playoffs Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for Westlake-Royal, the rules stopped Kramer before his arm or 
the Arcadia hitters did. 
</P>
<P>
 Arcadia beat Westlake-Royal, 7-5, in the Area 6 championship game at UCLA's 
Jackie Robinson Stadium, but only after Kramer beat Arcadia, 10-5, earlier 
Sunday to send the double-elimination playoffs to a final game. 
</P>
<P>
 Kramer hadn't pitched in two weeks because of a minor knife wound he suffered 
apprehending a shoplifter at K mart, where he works part-time. After winning 
the first game Sunday, he started the second game and pitched three scoreless 
innings. American Legion rules limit pitchers at 12 innings during any 
three-day period. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were joking about it," Kramer said. "I feel like I could have gone another 
whole game, if I'd been allowed." 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Singleton, who pitched seven innings Friday, relieved Kramer and kept 
Westlake-Royal in the game until the critical seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Arcadia cleanup hitter Pete Paciorek was at the plate with the score tied, 
3-3, and the bases loaded with two outs. Paciorek, the Southern Section 
Division IV Most Valuable Player last spring at San Marino High, hit a 2-2 
pitch up the middle for a two-run single. 
</P>
<P>
 "I gave him everything I had up there and he rocked it," Singleton said. "I 
did all I could." 
</P>
<P>
 Justin Stewart drove in another run and Arcadia (34-8) added one more in the 
bottom of the eighth, taking a 7-3 lead. Westlake-Royal (29-7-1) scored two 
runs in the top of the ninth, but Arcadia's Jason Cly retired pinch-hitter Jay 
Kenny with a runner at first for the final out. 
</P>
<P>
 Kramer threw 146 pitches in his 12 innings, giving up four earned runs, eight 
hits and three walks. He struck out nine.

ROBIN CONWAY: STAR POWER; HOLLYWOOD SUPER HOSTESS SUSIE BOLLMAN FIELD BRINGS 
FUND-RAISING CLOUT TO O.C. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Imagine welcoming guests into your home with Robert Redford at your side. Or 
having Barbra Streisand sing in your back yard. Or cracking up over Billy 
Crystal as he schmoozes with Raquel Welch, Richard Dreyfuss, Ted Danson and 
Magic Johnson -- in your living room.  
</P>
<P>
 Sound like a society maven's dream? Not to Susie Bollman Field. She's been 
there, done that. 
</P>
<P>
 As the wife of movie producer Ted ("Three Men and a Baby") Field (of the 
Marshall Field family), Susie regularly helped stage star-studded benefits at 
the couple's Greenacres mansion in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Their parties were always at the top of society columns. And they snagged big 
bucks. One dinner they underwrote for the Pediatric AIDS Foundation raised 
$900,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, three little girls and one divorce later, the former Newport Beach 
resident is back in town, ready to work her fund-raising magic in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 22, Susie will chair the annual "Fund " black-tie benefit for Western 
Medical Center in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, she has her reasons. "Western Medical Center's trauma unit is the 
beneficiary," Susie, 32, said on a recent day in her Harbor Ridge home. "It's 
an extraordinary trauma center, one of only three regional centers in Orange 
County." 
</P>
<P>
 And her husband-to-be, Gary Levine, 34, a radiologist, is on the staff there. 
"I want to be involved where Gary's involved," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Susie wasn't looking to settle down in Orange County when she returned here 
one year ago to be near her mother, who was ill at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 But a visit to Blockbuster Video in Newport Beach changed everything. There 
she was, on a Sunday afternoon, arms loaded with movies for her girls, 
Brittany, Candice and Chelsea, and this gorgeous guy approaches her, asks her 
what she's doing with all of those cartoons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him I didn't want to make a decision for my daughters, so I was 
gathering up everything I could get my hands on," she says in her satin-soft 
voice. 
</P>
<P>
 He had a medical book in his hand. "I asked him why he had that and he told me 
he was a doctor." Yeah, right. "You're not old enough to be a doctor," she told 
him. "I was a little rude to him because I wasn't sure about the doctor thing, 
to tell you the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 He convinced her. She gave him her telephone number. 
</P>
<P>
 They plan to elope at the end of the year, or the beginning of next year. 
"We've both been married, so we want it to be low-key," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple made their local social debut a week ago when they attended the 
gala that followed the opening of "The Phantom of the Opera" at the Orange 
County Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Susie threw $10,000 into the underwriting pool for the stylish event 
and showed up in a buff-tone Scaasi and stately jewels, her signature long 
blond tresses trailing down her back. "I love 'Phantom,' " she says. "I'll see 
it anywhere, anytime." 
</P>
<P>
 Ask her about those Tinseltown years with Field and she's all smiles. "It was 
fabulous. We still have a great friendship," she says. "He's a great man whom I 
respect a lot, a wonderful father. 
</P>
<P>
 "We grew in separate directions. It was no one big thing. We ended as friends, 
never even went to court." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Susie will continue to do what she loves most -- hang out with her 
daughters and Levine ("He's so smart; he keeps our relationship interesting"), 
visit the East Coast ("I adore New York") skin-dive around the world ("Next 
month we go to Fiji") and help mastermind events to benefit local charities. 
</P>
<P>
 She's hoping to have several of her star pals at the West-Med event, "The 
Wild, Wild West." 
</P>
<P>
 "We've invited 10 big names, but I can't name them, because they haven't 
confirmed," she says. "But MGM Studios is doing a lot for us, letting us borrow 
the sets from the 'Wild Bill Hickock' movie." 
</P>
<P>
 Guests will be encouraged to wear formal Western attire to the affair. And 
Susie, who is given to wearing the ultra-modern tailored lines of the country's 
top designers, will probably show up looking like Grace Kelly in "High Noon." 
</P>
<P>
 No suede and swaying fringe for her. "I want to wear one of those lovely 
dresses that have bustles," she says. "They were very ladylike, old-fashioned. 
I'll probably go to a costume shop, pick one out and have a tailor copy it. 
Gary and I can't wait. It's going to be a fabulous party."

JACK SMITH: LIFE IN THE OLD DAYS WAS A GOOD LIFE INDEED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Periodically, for years, I have received a document from an anonymous writer 
listing the many inventions and social changes that have altered the lives of 
those of us born before 1941, or whatever arbitrary date is chosen. 
</P>
<P>
 I have recently received a similar list from Jerry Zucker on the occasion of 
the 50th anniversary of his graduation from University High School. He thinks 
this might interest me because I am about to celebrate the 60th anniversary of 
my graduation from Belmont High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Since most of us would have been born before 1917, that adds about a 
quarter-century to the years lived by those born before 1941. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the list of phenomena that have occurred since 1941 is stupendous. Those 
born before 1941, the anonymous author says, were born before television, 
before penicillin, before polio shots, frozen foods, Xerox, plastic, contact 
lenses and the Pill. 
</P>
<P>
 They were born before ballpoint pens, before pantyhose, dishwashers, clothes 
dryers, drip-dry clothes and electric blankets. 
</P>
<P>
 The document is especially concerned with moral changes or, more accurately, 
with what its author evidently regards as moral degeneration. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the document says that before 1941, we got married and then lived 
together, commenting, "How quaint can you be?" Also, it says, "In our time, 
closets were for clothes, not for coming out of." 
</P>
<P>
 It goes on: "We were before househusbands, gay rights, computer dating, dual 
careers and computer marriages. We were before day-care centers, group therapy 
and nursing homes. We never heard of FM radio, tape decks, electric 
typewriters, artificial hearts, word processors, yogurt and guys wearing 
earrings. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us, time-sharing meant togetherness, not computers or condominiums; a 
chip meant a piece of wood, hardware meant hardware, and software wasn't even a 
word. The term 'making out' referred to how you did on your exam. Pizzas, 
McDonald's and instant coffee were unheard of. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hit the scene when there were 5- and 10-cent stores where you bought 
things for 5 and 10 cents. For one nickel you could ride a streetcar, make a 
phone call, buy a Pepsi or enough stamps to mail a letter and two postcards. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could buy a new Chevy coupe for $600 -- but who could afford one? A pity, 
too, because gas was only 11 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our day cigarette smoking was fashionable, grass was mowed, Coke was a 
cold drink and pot was something you cooked in. Rock music was a grandma's 
lullaby and aids were helpers in the principal's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were certainly not before the difference between the sexes was discovered, 
but we were surely before the sex change; we made do with what we had. And we 
were the last generation that was so dumb as to think you needed a husband to 
have a baby."  
</P>
<P>
 I don't think we were that sexually unsophisticated. I'm sure my classmates 
and I thought of ourselves as attractive to the opposite sex and no doubt 
daydreamed about going "all the way." But as far as I know, none of us did. I'm 
sure there were girls who got pregnant, but if so they dropped quietly out of 
school and nobody was the wiser. 
</P>
<P>
 That I never went "all the way" is a confession I would never have dreamed of 
making at the time. One had his reputation to uphold. I don't know whether my 
lack of experience could be blamed on my own timidity or the reluctance of the 
girls I went out with. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm sure there were girls in those days with the sexual curiosity and daring 
to have made a man out of me, so I can blame my failure only on myself. 
Certainly there were girls we considered "fast," but I found them too 
intimidating to date; or perhaps it was that they found me too "slow." In any 
case, I never hooked up with one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were compensations. Classmate Milton Most, now a judge, writes to 
me: "I surprise myself at how strong my attachment to Belmont is and it seems 
to grow stronger the older I get. I often think of the outstanding teachers at 
Belmont in the '30s and what a high quality education they gave us. 
</P>
<P>
 "A couple of years ago, about 15 of us took our old high school English 
teacher, Ruth Guild, to lunch on her 100th birthday. She got up, made a speech 
and could address us by name. . . . It was a wonderful picture. Our 
100-year-old English teacher surrounded by her 70-year-old students." 
</P>
<P>
 One thing I promise. If any of my girlfriends show up at the reunion, I'm 
going to apologize for my failure to lead them down the primrose path. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it's too late now to make amends.

 A man buys a gross of baby orchid plants and is about to transplant them when 
an emergency requires that he leave town quickly for the weekend. 
Panic-stricken because the plants will die, he calls a friend who suggests that 
the plants will retain required moisture if he encloses each in a condom. 
</P>
<P>
 The man races to the drugstore, buys a gross of condoms and encloses each 
plant. To his horror, he finds that he is one condom short, but he doesn't have 
time to buy another. Sure enough, when he returns on Monday, the one plant has 
died. 
</P>
<P>
 Furious, he returns to the drugstore and screams at the manager: "I bought a 
gross of condoms Friday and you shorted me one."

 "Good heavens," replies the druggist. "I'm sorry I spoiled your whole 
weekend."

40, a pale woman with dark circles under her eyes. "I'm grateful that he's 
alive, but he's in terrible pain. I don't know how we're going to go on." 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Ben, 43, a construction worker, was part of the team rebuilding 
a freeway after the Loma Prieta earthquake. Somehow, a huge piling fell from a 
crane and landed on him, crushing his right leg and foot, smashing several 
vertebrae in his back and causing internal injuries. After months in the 
hospital and five surgeries, Ben moved back home. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy, with the help of nurses and physical therapists, took over his care. 
</P>
<P>
 For the next 1 1/2 years, their lives, as well as the life of their teen-age 
daughter, were put on hold while all energies were focused on Ben's recovery. 
He has made remarkable progress, and he's learning to walk again. 
</P>
<P>
 But he will never be able to have an erection without first giving himself an 
injection of a drug. 
</P>
<P>
 "The spontaneity has disappeared from our sex life," Kathy explains, "and 
that's killing both of us, although Ben refuses to talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, in the last few months, it seems that their marriage, which had always 
been strong and happy, is on the verge of collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ben says things I know he doesn't mean, and we've been fighting constantly. 
I'm so worn out, but I can't sleep, and I just burst into tears over nothing," 
Kathy says. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben is similarly upset, although it's harder for him to talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm scared to death that Kathy is going to leave me," he finally admits. "We 
had such a good marriage, but now I can't even make love to my wife unless I 
give myself a shot. What woman would put up with that for long?" Maybe she 
should leave him, he says, half to himself. "I'll be a burden to her all her 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 "Ben and Kathy are both suffering from depression, a common reaction to a 
crisis," says Robert W. Harelson, a marriage and family therapist in Lafayette, 
Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether a partner has had a heart attack, a debilitating disease or, like 
Ben, a serious accident, there are common reactions and responses from which 
others can learn." 
</P>
<P>
 With all their energies focused simply on surviving, many people in crisis 
bury their emotions and operate on automatic pilot. Because recovery from 
trauma can take a long time, couples must find ways to maintain hope in the 
face of daily frustrations. The absence of hope, doctors say, can not only lead 
to depression, it can delay the healing process. 
</P>
<P>
 If your family has endured a crisis, keep these points in mind: 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't ignore the needs of the healthy while you're attending to the needs of 
the ill. Kathy is actually more shut down emotionally than Ben. She has 
switched her role from wife and lover to caregiver and nurse. It's time to 
reconnect with her friends and family as well as the activities that bring her 
joy. 
</P>
<P>
 * There's no reason to go through this crisis alone. What's more, denying your 
own needs won't help your loved one get better any faster. Don't hesitate to 
seek professional counseling for young children or adolescents who need help in 
sorting through their feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Set aside time to reminisce about the good times: the first time you met, 
your honeymoon, the births of your children. Music often helps rekindle happy 
memories, so play a tape you both enjoy. If possible, visit places where good 
experiences occurred -- a favorite restaurant, a theater or a park. If 
traveling is impossible, bring in dishes from a favorite restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 * Get in touch with residual emotional pain. This exercise can help: First, 
find a quiet place. On a sheet of paper, each of you should complete the 
following sentences: 
</P>
<P>
 The most painful part of the experience for me was. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 What I need most and was unable to get was. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Discuss what you've written and begin to sort through those feelings.

RSVP / INTO THE NIGHT: NO MASKING THAT OL' HYPERACTIVE APPEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL HIGGINS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Scene: Thursday's premiere of New Line Cinema's "The Mask" at the Motion 
Picture Academy. A high-energy party followed in the lobby of a nearby defunct 
S&L. (The setting was chosen because a bank plays a major part in the film.) 
Star Jim Carrey called the special effects-packed movie an ode to Looney Toons 
cartoonist Tex Avery. Director Charles Russell said: "Think of it as a romantic 
comedy that's a little hyperactive." 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: Carrey, Russell; co-stars Cameron Diaz, Peter Riegert and Peter 
Greene, and screenwriter Mike Werb; among the 1,100 guests were Jon Lovitz, Ray 
Liotta, Marlee Matlin, Jason Priestly, Stephen Baldwin, Al Teller, Mayor 
Richard Riordan, David Permut, Cheech Marin, Renny Harlin, Faith Ford and New 
Line execs Bob Shaye, Mitch Goldman and Chris Pula. 
</P>
<P>
 Who Stole the Show: Max, the co-starring Jack Russell terrier who sat in the 
audience wearing a bow tie. He barked politely when the stars were introduced. 
It's a rare actor who's so generous with his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buzz: Is there anyone on Earth -- from studio execs to Uzbeki tribal 
herdsmen -- who doesn't think this will be a hit? "I'm just glad everybody 
likes it," Carrey said. "There are a few die-hards out there still looking for 
good literature, but that's not what this movie is about." 
</P>
<P>
 The Locale: The audience arrived at the party wired by the film's energy. They 
were greeted by the blasting, eight-piece Royale Crowne swing band, half a 
dozen lavish buffets from Rococo and costumed bartenders serving drinks through 
the tellers' windows. Co-star Ben Stein surveyed the heaving mass of glamour 
and said: "Of all the sororities and fraternities in America, Hollywood is the 
best -- and this is the rush party." 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Logic: The film is hot so everyone wants to be associated with it. 
This accounted for a massive outpouring of flacks and their clients. "There are 
more publicists than people here tonight," said PR-adept Howard Bragman. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: "It's like those old Hollywood movies," said Carrey about the film. "A 
little singing, a little dancing; you got your gangsters, you got your sex, you 
got your violence -- everything the kids love." 
</P>
<P>
 Also Quoted: Jennifer Tilly on the film's elastic, chameleon-like hero: "I 
used to live with someone like that. By day he was normal, but at night his 
eyes would pop out and he'd turn green." 
</P>
<P>
 Overheard: "I'm thinking of going on talk shows as the only woman in America 
who didn't like 'Forrest Gump,' " a magazine editor said.

DANCE REVIEW; A LITTLE BIT OF EVERYTHING AT 'DANCE KALEIDOSCOPE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Dance Kaleidoscope '94" said goodby to Cal State Los Angeles on Saturday with 
an eight-part program dominated by small successes. This annual showcase of 
Southland achievement resumes next weekend at the John Anson Ford Amphitheatre 
in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The two warmest, sweetest pieces on the bill used nostalgic vocal music as 
accompaniment. Rose Polsky's duet, "Sing," anchored vibrant, swirling, 
large-scale movement with sharply etched gestural details. Polsky herself made 
those details seem clues to thoughts and feelings that arose as she danced. But 
it was Carolyn Hall who made the mercurial choreography appear an utterly 
spontaneous self-portrait. 
</P>
<P>
 Set to antique Russian jazz, Betzi Roe's "Dry Roses" gave six women from 
California Ballet a lush, classy showcase. Indeed, the individuality of the 
dancers proved no less invigorating than Roe's bold movement juxtapositions: a 
Plisetskaya-style backbend leap followed by a saucy torso wiggle, for instance. 
Unfortunately, no personal stories emerged from all the artful interplay and, 
like so many Kaleido-choreographies this year, the piece inconclusively doubled 
back on itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Ka-Ron Lehman and Viji Prakash chose potent subjects for women's pieces, but 
ended up relying on flamboyant technical display. Painful memories of child 
abuse in group therapy underpinned Lehman's trio "Exposing the Wound: The 
Beginning of Healing," and Melissa Stockton, in particular, sustained a 
volatile emotionalism while punching out Lehman's showpiece steps. But the 
unyielding emphasis on virtuosity soon seemed more an exploitation of pain than 
an expression of it. Jessica Vallot and Carmen Chavez remained faultless. 
</P>
<P>
 Prakash's quartet "Nava-Rasa" ("The Nine Moods") used the conventionalized 
gestures and facial motions of the South Indian classical idiom Bharata Natyam 
to convey fear, wonder, anger and other primal feelings. However, the 
misidentified members of her Shakti Dance Company couldn't always make these 
emotional statements as distinctive or compelling as the splashy rhythmic 
footwork embellishing the piece. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Mizerany's "Tethered" and Russell Scott's "Lest I Forget" each defined 
emotional dependency through gymnastics -- and both had unsatisfying endings. 
Mizerany's remarkable strength and versatility as a partner kept his duet with 
Madeline Soglin full of movement surprises right up to its odd conclusion. In 
contrast, Scott and Stanley Conte alternated lifting duties in their initially 
striking sculptural partnership, but the result looked increasingly dogged and 
ultimately directionless. 
</P>
<P>
 Dancing excerpts from Jose Limon's 1971 "Dances for Isadora," former Limon 
company member Bambi Anderson looked more persuasive in breezy lyricism than in 
epic tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Completing the program: Ferne Ackerman's dynamic "Perseverance" for Pacific 
Dance Ensemble, previously reviewed in these pages. 
</P>
<P>

Blvd. E., Hollywood, Saturday, 10 a.m.; Program E, Saturday, 8 p.m. $15, (213)

SCREENING ROOM: 'PATHS' WINDS THROUGH FOUR SHORT TALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 EZTV will present at the RESOLUTION Gallery, 6518 Hollywood Blvd., on 
Wednesday at 8 p.m. "PATHS Paved and Unpaved," a 72-minute program of four 
shorts, two made by directors trained in film school and two by self-taught 
filmmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeremy Haft, who directed "Late for Lunch" with Jonathan Wilson from a script 
by Jonathan Schwartz, and Umberto Autore, who directed "Bob and Arlene" from a 
script by Mickey Finn, are recent film school graduates. Their work is 
considerably more cinematic than "Un Incontro" (An Encounter), written and 
directed by Silvanus Slaughter, and "Don't Call Me," written and directed by 
Paul Bojack. Both Slaughter and Bojack have been playwrights. 
</P>
<P>
 "Late for Lunch," a fine effort in all aspects, is a deft vignette chronicling 
an increasingly rotten day in the life of a young Manhattan freight-elevator 
operator (well-played by Johnny Van Arnam). 
</P>
<P>
 "Bob and Arlene" is a sweet and funny account of how the wistful Arlene (Theda 
Reale) goes about seducing her big, beefy plumber (Kevin Blackton, a sly 
comedian). 
</P>
<P>
 "Un Incontro" is a rather tedious tale of games of sex and power between a man 
(Eric Kohner) and a woman (Honey Lauren) in a Century City office, while "Don't 
Call Me" finds a young man's self-deception in his pursuit of a woman taking a 
curious turn; there's not much shape to this episode, but there's a striking 
portrayal by Natalie Brunt of a no-nonsense, self-respecting prostitute. (213) 
466-6232. 
</P>
<P>
 The UCLA Film Archive's ongoing "John Ford's Century" at the Melnitz Theater 
this week provides a rare opportunity to see all three films in Ford's fabled 
Cavalry Trilogy -- "Fort Apache" (1948), "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon" (1949) and 
"Rio Grande" (1950). 
</P>
<P>
 Based upon stories by James Warner Bellah, all of them are masterful, enduring 
achievements, classic Westerns filmed in Ford's beloved Monument Valley. They 
have superbly staged battle sequences, an endearing swatch of rowdy Irish humor 
and sentimentality, and eloquently express Ford's enduring concern with gallant 
behavior and human dignity. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford views the men of the U.S. cavalry with proud affection but with respect 
for their perennial Native American adversaries as well. In this regard "Fort 
Apache" (Sunday at 7 p.m.) has for contemporary audiences by far the most 
impact, for it is the film among the three that projects a truly tragic vision 
of the plight and fate of Native Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of his rare unsympathetic roles, Henry Fonda is chillingly effective as 
the snobbish, newly appointed commander of a fort in Arizona Territory, where 
in a display of foolish, arrogant and naked racism he provokes a needless 
battle between his men and a native tribe. Disagreeing with him mightily -- but 
hopelessly outranked -- is John Wayne's decent, sensible Capt. Kirby York. 
</P>
<P>
 York reappears in "Rio Grande" (screening after "Fort Apache") as an older, 
tougher man but with his sense of humor intact. Lt. Col. York, now a commander 
himself, is in short order, first confronted with the son (Claude Jarman Jr.) 
he never knew, who has by a stroke of fate ended up in York's regiment, and 
shortly thereafter by his long-estranged wife (Maureen O'Hara), hellbent upon 
taking her son home before he becomes caught up in the hard yet seductive life 
of the cavalry. With O'Hara, as fiery as her red hair, Ford found the perfect 
foil for Wayne, and "Rio Grande" is above all a domestic drama resolved through 
a confrontation with the Apaches. 
</P>
<P>
 It has always been difficult to understand why Wayne had to wait for his "True 
Grit" Oscar to be fully acknowledged as a great screen actor, which started 
becoming evident 30 years earlier with Ford's "Stagecoach." 
</P>
<P>
 As splendid as he is in all three films of the trilogy, the elegiac "She Wore 
a Yellow Ribbon" (Thursday at 7:30 p.m.) provides him with one of the finest, 
richest roles of his career, playing a man 15 to 20 years older than his actual 
age as Capt. Nathan Brittles, an officer on the verge of reluctant retirement 
but determined to complete one final mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne's Brittles is ever strong and tough but also endearingly mellow and 
reflective. Like Clint Eastwood, Wayne on the screen is such a larger-than-life 
icon that we never notice that he's giving a performance, which is what acting 
is all about. (310) 206-FILM.

 Gunmen shot dead at least five people in violence linked to a controversial TV 
drama implicating Zulu nationalists in a campaign of violence against rivals, 
police and human rights officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The killings coincided with the television broadcast Saturday night of "The 
Line," which depicted the effects of political violence on black train 
commuters and blames Zulu nationalists for attacking trains. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the killings occurred in three incidents in the black township of

MTA STRIKE TALKS TO CONTINUE, BOTH SIDES SAY; TRANSIT: THORNY ISSUES IMPEDE 
SETTLEMENT. ONLY 44 BUSES ROLL SUNDAY, AND AN EERIE CALM SETTLES OVER DOWNTOWN 
SHOPPING DISTRICT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As the Los Angeles transit strike left weekend shoppers and leisure travelers 
stranded, negotiations in the weeklong strike continued with both sides 
agreeing to talk until they could hammer out a settlement on some "very, very 
difficult issues." 
</P>
<P>
 But with no agreement reached as of Sunday evening, the walkout was poised to 
enter its second week today.  
</P>
<P>
 On the first weekend of the strike -- the first strikee since 1982 -- only 44 
buses rolled Sunday, and limited rail service was available on the Red Line 
subway and Blue Line trolley. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA's board of directors is set to meet this afternoon on the status of 
negotiations. "We just have to see where we go from there," said MTA spokesman 
Jim Smart. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very very optimistic," said Supervisor Ed Edelman. "They're making 
progress. Hopefully they're going to reach some kind of understanding that will 
come back to the board for our perusal."  
</P>
<P>
 Tens of thousands of people who rely on the transit system to attend church, 
shop, visit friends -- and go to work -- spent part of their day lamenting 
inadequate public transportation in the nation's second-biggest city. Many 
remained stuck at home, but others tried to find friends and neighbors to take 
them where they needed to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Still others tried walking, even as they bewailed having to depend on public 
transportation in the world's most sprawling metropolis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Old people like me who can't drive are really suffering," said Suk-Jom Lee, 
who couldn't get to church Sunday because of the strike. He is an elder at 
Young Nak Presbyterian Church at the edge of Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope both sides will think of us and settle as soon as possible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Downtown, an eerie calm pervaded the Broadway shopping district, normally 
teeming with weekend shoppers hunting for bargains amid loud music from store 
radios. 
</P>
<P>
 Metropolitan Transportation Authority spokeswoman Andrea Greene said Broadway 
shoppers were very much on the MTA'S mind when it chose to operate its four 
busiest lines -- 21 Wilshire, 45 Broadway, 204 Vermont and 30/31 East 1st 
Street and Pico Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "The majority of the riders on the weekend are less affluent patrons who live 
in southeast Los Angeles and rely on MTA to do their weekly shopping in the 
Downtown corridor," Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, somber merchants blamed the strike for keeping customers away. 
</P>
<P>
 "The strike really killed business," complained saleswoman Gloria Ramirez at 
Moda Express, estimating that sales were down 75%. 
</P>
<P>
 One children's store tried fighting back by slashing prices: white baptismal 
dresses with lace-edged ruffles were marked down from $35 and $39 to $14.99. 
That didn't seem to help. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's terrible. Bad. There aren't enough people," said store worker Efrain 
Luna, gazing at the half-empty sidewalks. Luna himself normally takes the bus 
to his $40-a-day job; now he has to drive and pay $5 to park.  
</P>
<P>
 Even the usually bustling Grand Central Market was tame. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no customers," said George Yuan, who sells an array of foodstuffs 
inside the market. In his six years at the market, he says, he has never seen 
anything like it. 
</P>
<P>
 The outlook for transit patrons should be better today.  
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-six lines will operate with 400 buses on "normal frequency," Greene 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 That may be peanuts compared to MTA's normal weekday run of 1,900 buses on 200 
routes. Still, it is a tenfold improvement over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Though exact figures are unavailable, MTA estimates that between 300,000 to 
450,000 people ride MTA buses and trains on weekdays.  
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's negotiations resumed at 3 p.m. at an undisclosed location after union 
and management representatives had talked until nearly 12:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I can say is that both sides are committed to talking, but we have some 
very, very difficult issues to face today," Smart said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Wood, secretary-treasurer of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor 
AFL-CIO, which is participating in the talks, declined to divulge details of 
the meetings, nor how the marathon sessions were going. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Bujosa, president of the Amalgamated Transit Union, could not be 
reached. The main stumbling blocks have been MTA's demand to contract out work, 
and a two-tiered salary system for mechanics created by reducing some of the 
existing classifications. 
</P>
<P>
 The transit strike began last Monday when the mechanics, who earn an average 
of $44,000 a year plus $18,000 in benefits, walked off their jobs and the MTA's 
4,400 drivers and 600 clerks honored their picket lines. The average driver 
earns $50,000 a year, and $18,000 in benefits. The average salary for clerks 
was unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
 To provide minimal service, the MTA is using management personnel to put 400 
buses -- more than half of them rented -- into service today. 
</P>
<P>
 Every day that the system is on strike, MTA saves $550,000.

NO LONGER A HOT IDEA; ALCOHOL: DRINKING BEER AT THE BEACH USED TO BE A SOUTHERN 
CALIFORNIA TRADITION, ALTHOUGH AN ILLEGAL ONE. BUT NOW THE LAWS ARE BEING 
STRICTLY ENFORCED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Surrounded by sand, slathered in sunscreen and holding the coldest of beers in 
your hot hand, you are sprawled out and gulping down the California Dream. 
</P>
<P>
 Until an ominous shadow blocks your sun, pours out your beer and hands you a 
$50 ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 If Los Angeles beaches are known nationwide as the place to catch West Coast 
rays and a summer beer buzz, law enforcement officials are going out of their 
way to change half of that image. 
</P>
<P>
 It is illegal to drink on any public beaches or at city and county parks in 
Greater Los Angeles, and -- unlike the openness of a decade or two ago -- 
officers no longer let a little tan-time imbibing slide. 
</P>
<P>
 At Malibu beaches, lifeguards patrol on four-wheelers and pickups, and employ 
Gargantuan binoculars that can help them spot a beer can literally a mile away. 
</P>
<P>
 And when they do, it is often the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department they 
call.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have zero tolerance," said Sheriff's Sgt. Marty Dailey. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies will write about 45 citations -- typically costing $50 apiece -- at 
Malibu-area beaches on an average weekend day, and hundreds more on a big 
holiday. For every person cited, four or five others are warned, have their 
alcohol taken away, and are sometimes booted off the beach, Dailey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the majority of those interviewed at beaches and parks recently were 
in favor of the longstanding alcohol ban, others called it overzealous law 
enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting at a Chatsworth park, sipping noontime Budweisers, a couple who 
identified themselves only as John and Ellen said they and other responsible 
drinkers are needlessly punished for the irresponsibility of a few. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not talking about getting plastered," Ellen said. "Leave people alone." 
</P>
<P>
 But enforcers say a blanket ban became essential because for years all too 
many beach- and park-goers were indeed getting plastered. 
</P>
<P>
 "People would come to the beach, drink all day, and by afternoon become pretty 
nasty," Dailey said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ordinances banning alcohol at parks and beaches are nothing new. Most were 
initiated as early as the 1950s, said Malibu lifeguard Lt. Steve Wood. But many 
Southlanders -- and tourists -- are not aware of the laws, he said. Others 
knowingly violate them because it used to be a rarely punished offense. 
</P>
<P>
 By the mid-1970s, though, alcohol-related drownings, assaults and car 
accidents had become a serious problem, and agencies began cracking down. 
</P>
<P>
 Police, park rangers and lifeguards now patrol Southland hot spots regularly, 
searching for the telltale glint of a beer bottle.  
</P>
<P>
 Officers eye open coolers and ask to look in closed ones. (They must ask -- 
and you can say no -- unless they have probable cause to believe a violation 
has occurred, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.) They have even 
taken to sniffing at cups to distinguish apple juice from beer. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people attempt to camouflage their alcohol in coffee thermoses or foam 
cups, or by sucking on alcohol-soaked fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a small cottage industry. . . . They have a small cellophane wrapper 
that says 'Pepsi' on it and you wrap it around your beer can," said Department 
of Beach and Harbors spokesman Ken Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Keen-eyed officers can spot the fakes, and the punishment can range from a 
slap on the wrist to jail time. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, those ignorant of the no-alcohol law will lose their contraband and 
may be asked to leave the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Those caught trying to hide their drinking will probably receive a citation of 
about $50 and a court date. Arrests are possible for those with prior 
violations or involved in a disturbance. 
</P>
<P>
 If the penalties seem harsh, officials say the payoffs have been worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 No comprehensive statistics exist, but officials consistently say that 
alcohol-related problems have decreased considerably from the freewheeling 
times of 15 or 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's less fights, less traffic accidents, less injuries," said Chief John 
Zrofsky of the Los Angeles County Park Police. 
</P>
<P>
 The job is far from complete, however. Alcohol remains "probably our biggest 
problem" at parks, Zrofsky said. "It takes up a major portion of my officers' 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 For those dead-set on drinking at a park, group permits are available. They 
are not easily obtained, however. Among other things, the group must hire at 
least one security guard and purchase a minimum of $1 million in liability 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although the no-drinking laws certainly leave some with a bad taste in their 
mouths, it is not only law enforcement types who believe such regulation is a 
good idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors waiting for clouds to burn off at Zuma Beach one recent afternoon 
overwhelmingly supported the ban, saying an alcohol-and-ocean-water mix is 
especially dangerous because of the potential for drownings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't belong on the beach," said Gabriel Gagnon of North Hollywood. 
"I've been to beaches where they allow alcohol, and it isn't worth it."

4 GIRLS RECOVERING IN HOSPITAL AFTER BEING HIT BY CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG SMITH and ANTONIO OLIVIO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 Four hospitalized little girls were recovering rapidly Sunday, the day after 
they were injured in a freak accident when a car left with its motor running 
was put in motion by a toddler. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital officials say they foresee no permanent damage to any of the five 
children, ages 6 to 10, run over by a 1984 Thunderbird in the driveway of a 
four-unit apartment building in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Childrens Hospital and UCLA Medical Center upgraded the condition 
of the three most seriously injured from critical to fair on Sunday, and two 
girls were expected to be released today. 
</P>
<P>
 A fourth girl's condition had been upgraded from serious to fair Saturday. A 
boy who suffered minor injuries after being struck by the car was released 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Marcos Antonio Garcia, the father of the 2-year-old boy who shifted 
the car's gear lever from park to drive, said he had asked his wife, Estela 
Lopez, to warm up the vehicle. After she did so and went back inside for her 
purse, Garcia said, young Osvaldo opened the driver's door, got in and locked 
the doors before setting the car in motion. 
</P>
<P>
 The car moved toward the porch, hitting the couch where the children were 
sitting. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, eight months pregnant, ran out to the street screaming for help. 
</P>
<P>
 At the woman's cries and the shrieks of the trapped and injured children, a 
number of neighbors rushed up. Worried that the children's arms would be caught 
in the moving machinery, they lifted the car and propped it on a car jack and a 
wood plank. 
</P>
<P>
 One rescuer, Juan Torres, said they then pulled the children to safety and 
waited for paramedics to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia said he wasn't able to unlock the car until after the neighbors had 
arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they did not expect to charge Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives of the five children -- three siblings and two cousins -- gathered 
at the two hospitals Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's traumatized," said Maria Pena, an aunt of 9-year-old Valeria Fernandez. 
"The first thing that came out of her was, 'I thought I was going to die.' She 
was telling me how awful it was to have the tire on her chest, not able to 
breathe." 
</P>
<P>
 Pena said Valeria was bruised and swollen and thought she was going to lose 
her arm. 
</P>
<P>
 "She asked my sister, 'Do I still have any arm? I can't feel it.' " A 
spokesman for Childrens Hospital said Valeria had a broken right arm and a 
broken collarbone. The other victim there, Janet Rodriguez, 10, was still being 
checked to determine whether her right ankle was broken. The conditions of both 
were upgraded to fair Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 At UCLA Medical Center, the condition of Leslie Vega, 5, who was treated for a 
"crush injury" to the chest, was raised from serious to fair Sunday morning. 
Guadalupe Rodriguez, 9, Janet's younger sister, had multiple scrapes and a 
large cut on her left leg. She remained in fair condition at UCLA.

CONTRACT TALKS PUT L.A. SCHOOLS AT A CROSSROADS; LABOR: NEGOTIATIONS WITH 
TEACHERS BEGIN TUESDAY. PRESSURE TO RESTORE LAST YEAR'S PAY CUT IS HEIGHTENED 
BY THE NEED FOR FACULTY BACKING ON KEY REFORMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On Tuesday, when a dozen leaders of the Los Angeles Unified School District 
and its teachers union take seats around a conference table and begin intense 
labor talks, far more than salaries will be at stake. 
</P>
<P>
 The negotiations will be closely watched by leaders and parents communitywide 
who say that the giant district's credibility, its reform movement and perhaps 
even its existence also are on the line. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the district continues the feuding and infighting at the expense of 
improving the quality of education and at the expense of our children," said 
John Mack, president of the Los Angeles Urban League, "then many of us are 
going to be inclined to take another look at alternatives that we opposed in 
the past. . . . If it's business as usual, they all may find themselves losing 
some allies." 
</P>
<P>
 The contract talks -- in which teachers are seeking restoration of a stinging 
10% salary cut imposed last year -- come at a crucial time in the history of 
the 640,000-student district. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last two years, the district fought off a breakup movement pushed by 
politicians and parents fed up with what they saw as a system failing because 
of its unmanageable size and unresponsive bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fall, the state's education establishment spearheaded an expensive 
ballot battle to defeat a voucher initiative that it saw as harmful to the 
state's public schools. The initiative, which would have provided public tax 
dollars for private school tuition, was soundly rejected. But polls showed that 
voucher proponents had tapped into public frustration with school quality. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the district embarked on a broadly supported reform movement 
that depends on collaboration among administrators, teachers and parents. 
</P>
<P>
 The reform plan, LEARN -- Los Angeles Educational Alliance for Restructuring 
Now -- is in place at 87 campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 70% of the teachers at a given school must agree to participate 
before the program can begin there. LEARN supporters fear that teachers will be 
unwilling to accept that added responsibility if the union is in the middle of 
contentious contract talks, let alone a strike. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "This is their watershed moment," Genethia Hayes, director of an inner-city 
education program for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and a LEARN 
adviser, said of the district and the union. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are they going to be able to set aside their differences? This is what they 
are asking us to do with LEARN," Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Roos, president of LEARN, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe that reform would necessarily collapse" if contract talks do, 
Roos said, but "this is a time to show there is collaboration at leadership 
levels . . . any work action is a shock wave we can ill afford." 
</P>
<P>
 A return of the divisiveness that led to a strike in 1989 and bitter, 
protracted negotiations, would probably cause irreparable damage to employee 
morale and public confidence, school board members and community leaders say. 
</P>
<P>
 "With each progressive conflict that occurs in the district, the patience 
level of the larger community is less and less," said school board President 
Mark Slavkin. "There is a sense in the community that the district already has 
enough problems. They want to see us act like adults, get this done with and 
move forward without hurting kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Supt. Sid Thompson: "If we get into some kind of protracted problem 
related to negotiations, we all will lose -- the employees, the kids, their 
education, the system. What does matter is public perception. And we have to 
show we are a viable organization." 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides want to deliver an offer to teachers by the time school starts in 
September, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, observers say, a quick and peaceful resolution would be a 
powerful signal that the district and its combative teachers union could find a 
way to get along despite oppressive economic conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 United Teachers-Los Angeles President Helen Bernstein, while agreeing that 
there is tremendous community pressure to cooperate, said her first allegiance 
is to her more than 32,000 union members. 
</P>
<P>
 "What has happened to us is so wrong, there is no choice but to make it 
better," Bernstein said, adding that she is not intimidated by the 
make-or-break scenarios. "It is our American right to strike. If we choose to 
strike, it will be because we are desperate." 
</P>
<P>
 No other teachers union in the nation has been socked with such a paycheck 
blow, according to the American Federation of Teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 The reductions were part of unprecedented district budget cuts that slashed 
about $1.2 billion over five years and led to increased class sizes and 
layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, Los Angeles teachers have become an example of how bad it can get. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hear a lot of teacher union presidents around the country saying to their 
membership: 'It could be worse, we could be L.A.,' " said Adam Urbanski, 
president of the Rochester Teachers Assn. and a nationally respected leader of 
unionism and school reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein said she will walk into negotiations Tuesday with a thick list of 
suggestions for eking out money to restore some pay cuts. This year, she said, 
the union hired its own auditors to comb the $4.2-billion budget for possible 
savings. 
</P>
<P>
 While acknowledging that the union has not identified enough funds to make up 
the full 10% , she criticized the district for not being more aggressive in 
trying to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson said some pay cuts will be restored but he cannot yet say how much. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While the district's preliminary budget approved in June did not include 
salary restoration, board members said their top priority is to find the money. 
</P>
<P>
 The salary debate comes after a record 1,307 teachers left the district in 
1993, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's ability to hire top college graduates or even instructors who 
hold valid teaching credentials has been damaged, Thompson said; the lower pay 
scale combined with the difficult challenges of teaching needy, urban children 
does not put the district in a competitive situation. 
</P>
<P>
 But parents and community leaders have their own priorities for improvements 
in the nation's second-largest school district. Many parents have pegged their 
hopes for reform on LEARN and do not want to see it jeopardized. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are telling us to reach 'consensus' and work in 'collaboration,' " said 
Kathleen Dixon, a parent activist from San Pedro. "Well, now it's time for them 
to set an example."

STREET SMART / HENRY CHU: DESPITE BUDGET CRISIS, MTA FUNDS NEW JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY CHU 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Over the past year, the cash-strapped Metropolitan Transportation Authority 
has eliminated more than 500 jobs and handed pink slips to scores of employees 
in an effort to erase a $300-million deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 So how is it that the MTA's new $2.9-billion budget holds the promise of 120 
more full-time positions than it had last year? 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the Byzantine world of budgeting in an agency that needs 13 people 
just to balance its books. 
</P>
<P>
 For the new fiscal year that began July 1, MTA has allocated money for 8,935 
full-time employees, down from the 9,207 permanent jobs it set money aside for 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But as of early May, only 8,815 of those slots were actually filled -- which 
leaves room for 120 additional employees to meet the goal of 8,935 approved in 
the budget this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of these new positions fall in offices whose employees command the 
highest average salaries in the mammoth transit agency. Some managers have 
already begun screening candidates, ending a hiring freeze imposed last 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 The recruitment drive continued even as the authority was in the grip of a 
transit strike. The agency has also hiked bus fares for the first time in six 
years, scaled back service on some lines and planned further reductions in its 
operating staff in order to avoid bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's just say this is very creative budgeting," one critic said of the 
possibility of swelling the MTA's overall work force during the coming year. 
"Do you ever get the feeling that David Letterman should have a segment called 
Stupid Budget Tricks?" 
</P>
<P>
 MTA budget director Larry Schlegel acknowledged that filling the 8,935 
full-time positions authorized in the budget would increase the current 
permanent work force by 120. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, nearly every department within the MTA can hire new people, up to 
328 in all, because the agency's operations unit -- which includes most of the 
workers who went on strike -- has been ordered to trim its staff by 208 
members. That still allows for a net gain of 120 employees agencywide. 
</P>
<P>
 The operations unit is the only unit that must cut its worker rolls in the new 
fiscal year -- a fact that frosts Goldy Norton, a spokesman for the bus and 
train operators union. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last I heard it was operations that brought in money, not management," Norton 
said. "I am not aware of management people bringing in any revenue. All they do 
is cost revenue." 
</P>
<P>
 Norton accused the MTA of playing "a shell game," saying the agency is trying 
to make the public believe it is cutting back on personnel when it actually 
plans to beef up its ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA officials defend the new staffing figures, noting that more than 100 
employees have been laid off in recent months and a greater number of vacant 
positions eliminated altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Chief Executive Officer L. A. (Kim) Kimball said that of the 328 
positions now open, half are for transit police officers, who have recently 
taken over security of the Blue Line from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department. And many of the remaining jobs are clerical or lower-wage 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics point out that these openings occur in administrative, managerial 
or planning units -- departments staffed mainly by white-collar professionals 
whose average salaries tend to be higher. 
</P>
<P>
 The new budgets for these units, compared to their actual expenses last year, 
have all gone up. The operations budget has decreased. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you see is a shift away from operations to almost everything else," said 
one MTA official who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 One department, representing MTA board officials, has been allotted $8.5 
million -- more than double what it spent last year. The executive office has 
also been given more money, enough for 18 new full-time employees -- a 50% 
staffing increase. 
</P>
<P>
 On average, employees in those two units have pay-and-benefit packages of 
$77,333, according to MTA statistics from last December. By contrast, the 
operations unit's average package stands at $63,489. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina, an MTA board member, recently 
recommended a 25% cut in the funds assigned to the board. But her motion died 
without a second. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to look at trimming administrative . . . costs where possible, 
instead of services," Molina said. "My motion was designed to do that. 
Unfortunately, the votes weren't there to support it." 
</P>
<P>
 President Michael Bujosa of the Amalgamated Transit Union, one of the three 
that have been locked in contentious negotiations with the MTA, said it was 
difficult to explain to his members why the professional units were in line for 
staff and budget increases while 80 of his mechanics and servicers received 
pink slips last month. . 
</P>
<P>
 "They're keeping the people who watch the people doing the work, but they're 
laying off the people who actually do the work," Bujosa said. "It doesn't make 
sense."

4 GIRLS RECOVERING AFTER CAR RAN OVER THEM; ACCIDENT: NO PERMANENT DAMAGE 
FORESEEN FOR FIVE CHILDREN HURT IN FREAK INCIDENT. FATHER SAYS VEHICLE WAS NOT 
LEFT UNATTENDED WITH HIS SON INSIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Four girls who were injured in a freak accident Saturday when a car left with 
its motor running was put in drive by a toddler were improving rapidly Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital officials said they now foresee no permanent damage to any of the 
five children, all under 10, who were run over by a 1984 Thunderbird in the 
driveway of a four-unit apartment in North Hollywood as they sat beside the 
porch. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Childrens Hospital and UCLA Medical Center upgraded the condition 
of the three most seriously injured victims -- all girls -- from critical to 
fair Sunday, and two of them were expected to be released today. 
</P>
<P>
 A fourth girl was upgraded from serious to fair Saturday. A boy hit by the car 
was released Sunday with minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the father of the 2-year-old boy who shifted the gear lever from 
park to drive said his son was not left unattended in the car as reported 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcos Antonio Garcia said his wife, Estela Lopez, left the car unoccupied 
when she went back into the apartment to get her purse. The boy opened the 
driver's door himself, got in and engaged the power door-locks before setting 
the car in motion, Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
 The car moved forward, striking the children in the driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, eight months pregnant, ran into the street screaming for help. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors in the densely populated block of Agnes Avenue rushed at the sound 
of the woman's cries and the shrieks of the trapped and injured children, and, 
in a dramatic rescue, lifted the front end of the car off the ground with the 
engine still running, to pull the children to safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives of the five children -- three siblings and two cousins -- gathered 
at the two hospitals Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's traumatized," said Maria Pena of her 9-year-old niece Valeria 
Fernandez. "The first thing that came out of her was, 'I thought I was going to 
die.' 
</P>
<P>
 "She was telling me how awful it was to have the tire on her chest, not able 
to breathe," Pena said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pena said Valeria was bruised and swollen, and that the child also thought she 
was going to lose her arm. 
</P>
<P>
 "She asked my sister, 'Do I still have any arm? I can't feel it.' " A 
spokesman for Childrens Hospital said Valeria had a broken right arm and a 
broken collar bone, and that the other patient, Janet Rodriguez, 10, was still 
being examined to determine whether her right ankle was broken. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez and Rodriguez were released from the intensive care unit at 
Childrens Hospital on Sunday. Rodriguez, who suffered a bruised heart in the 
accident, was upgraded to good condition, said Kathleen Stevenson, a nursing 
supervisor. Fernandez' condition was upgraded to fair, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gregg Bruschaber, a clinical social worker, said at a news conference that 
doctors told him the girls' condition was "better than fair." The initial 
diagnosis of critical was based on the nature of the accident and early 
indications of head trauma, but that it was later determined that their 
injuries were not life-threatening, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other family members at Childrens Hospital declined to speak to reporters, 
Bruschaber said. 
</P>
<P>
 At UCLA Medical Center, Guadalupe Rodriguez, 9, and Leslie Vega, 5, were also 
reported in fair condition. Vega, who was treated for a "crush injury" to the 
chest, was upgraded from serious to fair Sunday morning. Guadalupe, Janet's 
younger sister, had multiple abrasions and a large laceration on her left leg. 
She remained in fair condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before driving a van full of the victims' relatives to UCLA Sunday 
afternoon, Garcia recalled the previous day's incident. He said he had asked 
his wife to warm up the car, which was parked head-in in the driveway next to 
the bungalow-style apartment. After Lopez returned to the house, Garcia said, 
his son, Osvaldo, opened the driver's side door and got in. 
</P>
<P>
 The five children were gathered near the stoop of the apartment next to 
Garcia's unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia said he ran when he heard the screams, but could not open the door, and 
then went to find a set of keys. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time he got the door open, he said, about 15 neighbors had arrived. 
Worried that the children under the car would get their arms crushed in the 
moving machinery, they lifted the car by hand and propped it on a car jack and 
a wood plank. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the rescuers, Juan Torres, said they moved the children to the side and 
then waited for paramedics to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they did not expect to charge Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
 That angered Pena, the guardian of Valeria, who said she had brought the girl 
from her home in Pacoima for a visit Saturday.

 But neighbors who helped rescue the children said they blamed no one and 
sympathized with Lopez.

THE BOYS OF SUMMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For more than 45 years, Boy Scouts from throughout the nation have been making 
their way up the mountain to Camp Whitsett, located some 200 miles northeast of 
the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The camp -- with its tall pine trees and cool, stream-fed lake -- sits high 
above the desert floor in Sequoia National Forest. Operated by the Western Los 
Angeles County Boy Scout Council, it attracts more than 2,000 boys each summer. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, 16 youths from Troop 246 in West Hills traveled up the mountain for 
a week they will never forget. Boy Scout camp takes on a different flavor than 
most summer youth camps as boys learn such skills as how to turn their shirts 
into life jackets and how to raise and lower the American flag. 
</P>
<P>
 The rugged terrain and beauty of the Sequoias offer an ideal setting for a 
Scout to learn about environmental science or wilderness survival. 
</P>
<P>
 For most of the West Hills Scouts, the week is filled with hard work as they 
try to earn as many merit badges as possible, getting up early in the morning 
and working on reports until late at night. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is also a chance just to have some fun. A high point of the week is 
a trip down the Kern River in a two-person kayak, which winds and twists its 
way toward the community of Kernville. 
</P>
<P>
 For the 16 boys who made their way up the mountain, it was a rewarding week. 
Collectively, they earned more than 50 merit badges and rank advancement. 
</P>
<P>
 It also was a time that they will never forget -- even 12-year-old Garrett 
Shorr, who was overheard the first day saying, "This is just like school with 
all the writing I have to do." After the kayak trip down the river, Garrett is 
ready for another year at Boy Scout camp.

WOMAN DIES IN ACCIDENT ON FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Acton woman died Sunday when her husband apparently lost control of their 
car and it rolled down a steep embankment off the Antelope Valley Freeway, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred about 11:15 a.m. on the north side of the freeway, said 
Officer Frank Lewis of the California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim's husband and her two children were airlifted to Antelope Valley 
Hospital Medical Center in Lancaster, Lewis said. Their identities were not 
released. 
</P>
<P>
 A nursing supervisor at the hospital said she expected the children's father 
to be treated and released from the hospital Sunday, but said she could not 
provide information on the children's condition. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash is under investigation, Lewis said.

FIRED TEACHER FACES TRIAL OVER ALLEGED ATTACKS ON 3 WOMEN; COURTS: SCHOOL 
DIDN'T KNOW OF PREVIOUS INVESTIGATION OF THE SUSPECT WHILE HE WAS WITH THE 
SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When Edward Keith Culhane applied for a teaching job at a local elementary 
school, he was portrayed as a decorated Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department 
deputy who retired in 1991 because of a work-related injury. 
</P>
<P>
 But unknown to his potential employer, Culhane was also under investigation 
for allegedly raping a 17-year-old girl, as well as other incidents of sexual 
misconduct allegedly occurring between 1989 and 1991, sheriff's officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Department policy kept them from disclosing the information to 
Saugus Union School District officials, who hired him in 1993 to teach 
fifth-grade students. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Culhane, 35, is charged with sexually assaulting a female teacher in a 
classroom at Santa Clarita Elementary School during his first semester. He 
denies that charge, as well as several others pending against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's officials say they are not at fault but were trapped in a Catch-22. 
They say they could not reveal unsubstantiated allegations against Culhane, and 
because of department regulations they could not complete an internal 
investigation of him after he resigned, said Sgt. Larry Lincoln, a department 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were allegations of alleged sexual misconduct, but not enough to 
substantiate a criminal investigation, so the Sheriff's Department initiated an 
administrative investigation," Lincoln said. "As a result of our findings, 
then-Deputy Culhane decided to resign in lieu of any department discipline." 
</P>
<P>
 Lack of evidence -- primarily, the alleged victim was reluctant to testify -- 
kept sheriff's officials from seeking criminal charges, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the allegations involving the teacher came to light, the 17-year-old 
victim, and a 19-year-old woman also claiming to have been sexually assaulted 
by Culhane, came forward. 
</P>
<P>
 After a preliminary hearing in Newhall Municipal Court, Culhane was ordered 
last week to stand trial on charges that he attacked all three women. 
</P>
<P>
 His attorney, Kenneth Schreiber, said the Sheriff's Department investigated 
previous complaints, but no criminal charges were ever filed. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the district attorney's office is resurrecting the charges in the hope 
that the more accusations against Culhane, the more likely a jury will convict 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason they didn't prosecute him (before) was they didn't have enough 
evidence," Schreiber said. "They don't have enough evidence now." 
</P>
<P>
 Culhane, described as mild-mannered, befriended the three women before the 
alleged assaults, according to sheriff's investigators who testified at the 
preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers testified that in 1990 Culhane offered to help the 17-year-old victim 
with an English paper after he pulled her car over in Lennox. Culhane then had 
breakfast with her about a week later and committed the alleged assault about a 
week after that, according to the officers' testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Another woman, then 19, claims Culhane fondled and kissed her while she was 
baby-sitting at his home in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The teacher testified at last week's hearing that Culhane removed some of her 
clothing and fondled her last November when she went to his classroom after 
school to get a map. 
</P>
<P>
 Culhane was a deputy from January, 1982, until August, 1991, retiring because 
of an on-duty auto accident, according to Schreiber and other officials. 
Sheriff's officials acknowledge a retirement settlement was paid to Culhane 
because of the injury, but they dispute claims that is the only reason he 
retired. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Culhane's former co-workers at the Sheriff's Department said they had 
suspicions about his behavior, but none wanted their names used. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't put your finger on it, but it's one of those feelings you have," 
said one deputy who worked with Culhane at the Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff's 
Station. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the complaints against Culhane when he was with the Sheriff's 
Department were less serious allegations than rape, said Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Robert Foltz, who is prosecuting Culhane. But the complaints were never 
resolved because of Culhane's retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a lot of them where he was coming on to people, trying to make 
dates with them, but it never got to physical contact," Foltz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Every complaint filed against a deputy goes into his personnel file, according 
to sheriff's officials. But the department will not release information about 
complaints unless they have been investigated and the deputy has been 
disciplined as a result. 
</P>
<P>
 "Typically all we ever tell anyone is so-and-so worked here at such and such a 
time, and he resigned for personal reasons with the rank of deputy or 
whatever," said Jeff Hauptman, director of personnel administration for the 
Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 An employer or other interested party can also obtain information if the 
deputy has signed a release permitting it, Hauptman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Culhane was hired to teach at Santa Clarita Elementary School in part because 
school officials heard about commendations Culhane had received from the 
Sheriff's Department and Pepperdine University, where he was a student teacher, 
said Troy Bramlett, superintendent of the Saugus Union School District. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Bramlett said, the district knew none of the suspicions of improper 
conduct while Culhane was a sheriff's deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing was questionable about Culhane's retirement because the auto accident 
certified Culhane's claim that he left because he was injured, Bramlett added. 
</P>
<P>
 "There wasn't anything that would raise a red flag," Bramlett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Culhane was fired by the district on July 1, Bramlett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if he is found innocent, Bramlett said, the district is not obligated to 
reinstate him because Culhane does not have tenure.

50,000 ATTEND FESTIVAL FOR GANG PREVENTION; POLICE: JEOPARDY FIESTA BRINGS 
COMMUNITY GROUPS TOGETHER TO HELP RAISE AN EXPECTED $90,000 FOR LAPD PROGRAM. 
</P>

 As the sounds of ranchero music filled the air, more than 50,000 people 
crowded into Hansen Dam Sports Center on Sunday to attend a fund-raising 
festival for Jeopardy, the Los Angeles Police Department's gang-prevention 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 The third annual event was expected to raise $90,000 for the 8-year-old 
program. On hand for the daylong fiesta were Los Angeles City Councilman 
Richard Alarcon and a slew of Latin entertainers, including the band Industria 
del Amor and singer Ricardo Adjona. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is Jeopardy's main fund-raising event. It's a cooperative effort that 
brings different community groups together," said Capt. Gus Drulias of LAPD's 
Foothill Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Booths offered Mexican food and literature from Latino community service 
groups including the Northeast Valley Health Corp., whose representatives 
passed out condoms and pamphlets about HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 While some youngsters came to hear favorite bands play, other youths and their 
families showed up to learn about Jeopardy. Eleven-year-old Jose Lopez said he 
wants to learn more about the program and would be interested in joining. 
</P>
<P>
 Created eight years ago, Jeopardy is a gang prevention and intervention 
program that targets at-risk youths, their parents and communities. Jeopardy's 
youngsters take lessons in boxing, ice hockey, ice skating, modern dance or 
drama as an alternative to joining gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We check with the schools to see if the kids have been slacking off," said 
Jeopardy volunteer Elaine Hernandez, explaining how the program works with all 
facets of the community -- including families, schools, police and other local 
organizations -- to keep youngsters out of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Serving cold drinks at the fair, 16-year-old Cruz Perez, a four-year 
participant in Jeopardy's ice hockey program, said he thinks the anti-gang 
project is effective. "It keeps me off the streets," Cruz said. 
</P>
<P>
 To keep the festivities under control, no alcohol was served and more than 50 
police officers, including an anti-gang unit, patrolled the grounds on foot, 
bicycle and horseback. The only problem officers said they ran into was a lost 
child. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is for family," said Yolanda Chavez, Cruz's mother and a longtime 
Jeopardy volunteer. "This is a chance to get the community together."

WOES OF A REAL ESTATE EMPIRE; BALDWIN CO. KEEPS SOLID STANCE IN FACE OF 
SKEPTICISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The tuxedoed Baldwin brothers were all smiles as they strolled through the 
ballroom of the Four Seasons hotel in Newport Beach, listening to the fizz of 
champagne, the rustle of sequined socialites and the glowing accolades of their 
peers in the real estate industry. 
</P>
<P>
 During the $2,700-a-table charity dinner held last spring to honor longtime 
Orange County home builders Alfred E. and James P. Baldwin, Auxiliary Bishop 
Michael Driscoll of the Diocese of Orange blessed the brothers and their 
ventures -- a blessing that seemed already bestowed, given the $155-million 
junk bond deal that Baldwin Co. had completed 10 months earlier and the 
$60-million credit line it had arranged with General Electric Capital Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Befitting the glitzy occasion, the bishop was followed by a king, as 
home-building giant William Lyon mounted the podium at the May 18 dinner to 
praise the Baldwins for their fiscal acumen. 
</P>
<P>
 In a humorous aside, Lyon called the Baldwins' bond deal "the great train 
robbery of 1993." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, that remark now reflects critics' skeptical view of the company. 
Former executives allege that bondholders were misled, and some investors are 
nervous about the firm's financial condition. Since collecting the bond money a 
year ago, Baldwin Co. has seen its management team collapse, much to the dismay 
of those investors who bought the company's IOUs partly because of their faith 
in that team. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also has left a trail of unpaid and unhappy subcontractors and has 
angered hundreds of Anaheim Hills homeowners by failing to build a 
long-promised community park. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Baldwin Co. is scheduled to make the second of its semi-annual bond 
interest payments, and company President Al Baldwin says the $8.5-million check 
will be in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
 The company must pay about $17 million each year in bond interest -- a big 
chunk of its annual cash flow. In public documents, the company reports it had 
earnings of $28.5 million before interest in 1993, down from $38.2 million the 
previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first quarter of 1994, the company reported a $4-million profit, down 
13% from $4.6 million a year earlier, and said that the cost of stepping up 
construction activities on its various projects caused it to end the quarter 
with $14.8 million "negative operating cash flow." 
</P>
<P>
 With more than 75% of the proceeds from last year's bond sale gone to pay off 
old debts, the company has little left for ongoing operations. At the end of 
the first quarter it also had used up $41.5 million of its $60-million credit 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Baldwin said the company's financial situation is solid and maintains that 
suggestions to the contrary are coming from embittered former employees and 
people who don't understand corporate cash management techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our earnings are up and our sales are up," he said, pointing out that the 
company's revenue from home sales jumped 35% to $63 million for the first six 
months of this year. One indication of how tight money is at Baldwin Co., 
however, is the number of subcontractors who are filing liens against Baldwin 
projects and lawsuits against the company, alleging that they are not being 
paid. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past month, almost $1 million worth of claims have been filed in Orange 
County Superior Court against Baldwin Co. and its various subsidiaries. Other 
claims for non-payment have been filed in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Baldwin shrugs off suggestions that the spate of non-payment suits is an 
indication of financial trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "People look at the Baldwins as having deep pockets, (with) all this money 
from our bond offering, and some of them think we should pay them for work they 
haven't done," he said. "But the bond money was used to develop lots and pay 
off debt, and now that we're going through a major gearing up and starting a 
lot of homes, we've had to manage our cash." 
</P>
<P>
 In an example of just how tightly managed that cash has been, Baldwin 
representatives pleaded with Anaheim officials in July for a two-year extension 
of their deadline to build a community park in the company's flagship 
development, The Summit at Anaheim Hills. The company argued that it cannot 
afford to build the $1.5-million project yet. 
</P>
<P>
 On another front, the company is facing legal action filed by two former top 
managers -- division presidents who say they were forced out because the 
Baldwins didn't want to pay them what they had been promised. In their suits, 
former Baldwin Ventura division President Robert Burns and Orange County 
division President Geoffrey Fearns also allege that the Baldwin brothers misled 
bond investors by omitting critical information. 
</P>
<P>
 Burns states in his civil suit that he was told by the Baldwins that he would 
have a 10% partnership interest in all company projects within his division, 
but he alleges that the brothers repeatedly put off executing a formal, written 
partnership agreement. The suit alleges, too, that Burns' partnership agreement 
was not disclosed to bond investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Burns was hired to create a Los Angeles-Ventura division for Baldwin and do 
advance planning for projects. None of the homes planned for the seven projects 
he identifies in his suit had been built when he left the company in January, 
but he states in the suit that he is entitled to 10% of future profits -- an 
amount he estimates to be "not less than $35 million." 
</P>
<P>
 Al Baldwin said that Burns is lying and that he is not concerned about the 
outcome of the suit. "He's a lawyer," he said, "and if there were a partnership 
agreement it would be in writing. There isn't any." 
</P>
<P>
 Burns also alleges in his suit that former Baldwin employees Fearns and San 
Diego division President Gregory Smith were approached by the Baldwin brothers, 
who tried to "coerce them into engaging in a sham tax transaction." 
</P>
<P>
 The brothers, the suit states, wanted Fearns and Smith to agree to have the 
company "transfer to them certain properties encumbered by substantial 
indebtedness, in exchange for their partnership interest," in the properties. 
</P>
<P>
 The exchange would enable Baldwin Co. to avoid reporting taxable income from 
the properties, the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though there is no indication that the Internal Revenue Service has begun 
investigating Burns' allegations, Baldwin Co. revealed in its recently filed 
1993 annual report that the IRS is examining it for the years 1979 to 1987 and 
that the result could be a demand for payment of about $8.6 million in back 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Baldwin's response to the Burns and Fearns suits is that they were filed to 
create negative publicity about the company in order "to leverage us to pay a 
lot of money they don't have coming to them. And we're not going to pay them 
for work they didn't do." 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that Burns, Fearns and Smith all have left the company since the 
bonds were sold may ultimately have more effect on Baldwin Co. than anything 
alleged in the lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Goldman, head of bond trading at the Los Angeles brokerage Jefferies & 
Co., said a large mutual fund that invested in the Baldwin bonds is very 
concerned about the exodus. 
</P>
<P>
 "You start asking questions," he said, when the management team presented 
during the sale of a bond issue is gone six months later. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond nervous investors and angry former employees, the Baldwin brothers are 
dealing with other woes. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners who bought homes in The Summit at Anaheim Hills development partly 
because the company promised to build a 16-acre park there are complaining 
about the delay in the park's development. At a July 19 public hearing before 
the Anaheim City Council, more than 100 homeowners attended to express anger 
over what they characterized as foot-dragging by the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the start of construction on the park is months overdue, the 
council negotiated a compromise that requires construction of a playground by 
early next year but postpones completion of the rest of the park until 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Frank Feldhaus and other council members told homeowners at the 
hearing that they were concerned that Baldwin Co. could be pushed into 
bankruptcy if the park issue were forced -- and the company's representative at 
the meeting did not step up to the podium to counter the impression that a 
single park was all that stood between the company and Bankruptcy Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Baldwin denies bankruptcy is a possibility, and such a scenario certainly 
would have been unthinkable in the 1980s, when Baldwin Co. consistently ranked 
among the top 10 builders in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 30 years since it was incorporated, Baldwin Co. has built 15,000 homes 
in Southern California, most of them in master-planned communities in Orange, 
San Diego and Ventura counties. "They have some exceptionally well located 
properties, but it remains to be seen whether they can bring those projects to 
the market on a timely basis," said Kenneth Agid, an Irvine real estate 
marketing consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 Baldwin Co. was strapped for cash last year when it turned to Wall Street. The 
company was in default on more than $100 million of its $183 million in debt 
and had to use most of the bond proceeds to pay off overdue loans. It was left 
with only about $30 million for new construction. 
</P>
<P>
 That a company mired so deeply in financial difficulty could sell bonds based 
on its promises of a rosy future caused other Southern California developers to 
cheer. After three years of deep recession, they said, the Baldwin deal showed 
that investors were finally regaining their confidence in Southern California 
real estate. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Baldwin agrees with that: The company's valuable land holdings, he said, 
were more attractive to the investment community than its 30-year history of 
profitability. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond issue in July, 1993, was well received on Wall Street. The deal was 
oversubscribed by hungry investors -- meaning that more bonds were sold than 
were initially offered. 
</P>
<P>
 But some traders now say their initial enthusiasm waned quickly. Though the 
bonds' value picked up Friday on the news that the company had completed a 
$14.9-million land sale in San Diego, they had dropped shortly after they were 
issued last year when the company posted lackluster quarterly returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Mueller, managing director of the high-yield department for Bear, 
Stearns & Co., the New York brokerage that sold the bonds for the Baldwins, 
defends the company. 
</P>
<P>
 "What investors anticipated were the quarterly numbers predicted in the road 
show," such as home sales and the number of homes built but unsold, he said. 
"But the Baldwins look at the big picture." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the company is privately owned, he said, it was not as concerned with 
the differences between quarterly and long-range numbers as a publicly traded 
company might have been, "so people got a little jittery," Mueller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Baldwin says that no such numbers were ever tossed out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made no projections on the road show or in the prospectus," he said. "We 
talked about our historic performance, about our land holdings and about future 
product lines, but we made no projections." 
</P>
<P>
 That was not the perception in the investment community. 
</P>
<P>
 David Siegel, chief financial officer for Presley Cos., a Newport Beach home 
builder, said that the Baldwin bond deal made his company's private sale of 
$200 million worth of junk bonds last month more challenging. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that the Baldwins didn't make their numbers, as many people have 
stated, really created some caution on the part of bond buyers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other analysts see Baldwin Co. in a much more positive light. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Allen, a home building expert with the brokerage Donaldson, Lufkin & 
Jenrette in New York and a satisfied owner of a Baldwin condo in Del Mar, said 
she sees a bright future for some Southern California builders, especially 
those like Baldwin that have access to Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Analyst Kenneth Agid agreed. "They are pioneers," he said of the Baldwin 
brothers, "and they have survived what have been some very tough and lean 
years. Those two are survivors." The Baldwin Empire 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach-based Baldwin Co. has housing developments in the works from 
Ventura to San Diego counties. The company is preparing a massive housing 
construction effort, partly with proceeds from a successful junk-bond sale last

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: BEFORE RATES CAN DESCEND, SERIOUS OBSTACLES REMAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Was last week's second-quarter economic growth report the kickoff for a major 
drop in interest rates -- or just the bond market's version of "True Lies"? 
</P>
<P>
 Bond yields plummeted Friday after the government stunned Wall Street with a 
3.7% estimate of real economic growth in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Some economists thought the second-quarter number would be 5% or higher. 
Moreover, few pros guessed the extent to which inventory buildup -- as opposed 
to final sales of goods -- would factor into the growth number. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Straszheim, economist at Merrill Lynch & Co. in New York, says that 
"well over half (the second quarter's growth) resulted from an unsustainable 
surge in inventory building," particularly at the wholesale and retail level. 
</P>
<P>
 If the goods are on the shelves, but they're not moving (or are moving 
slowly), the assumption is that production will have to be restrained this 
quarter until sales catch up. 
</P>
<P>
 Ergo, a weaker economy, weaker inflation potential, and a chance for interest 
rates to pull back -- benefiting the stock market, bond owners, home buyers and 
a host of other constituencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so fast, some Wall Streeters warn. Despite Friday's bond rally, which 
sliced the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond from 7.55% to 7.39% -- 
the lowest since June 16 -- three high hurdles stand in the way of a 
significant drop in interest rates from here: 
</P>
<P>
 * A barrage of economic indicators. This week, markets face seven major 
reports on June economic activity, including construction spending, new home 
sales, leading indicators and consumer credit. And on Friday, investors get 
their first important look at July activity, with the release of the monthly 
employment report. 
</P>
<P>
 While the second-quarter gross domestic product report included many 
convincing elements of a slowdown, Wall Street will want to see them confirmed 
in June numbers, and definitely in the July employment data. Otherwise, the GDP 
report will begin to look like Schwarzenegger's "True Lies" -- where nothing is 
quite as it seems. 
</P>
<P>
 One warning for would-be bond bulls: Last Wednesday's report on June durable 
goods orders was twice as strong as expected. Everybody seemed to forget that 
Friday, with the GDP number. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're coming into the second half at a pretty good clip," argues 
David Jones, economist at bond dealer Aubrey Lanston & Co. in New York. Booming 
corporate profits, he says, should mean continued high business spending on 
plant and equipment. And a pickup in growth in Europe and Japan should boost 
U.S. exports, he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 * A cash-needy Uncle Sam. The Treasury will announce details this week of its 
"refunding," the quarterly borrowing binge that will take place next week. The 
government is expected to raise $40 billion in auctions of three-year notes, 
10-year notes and 30-year bonds, consecutively starting Aug. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 With that heavy supply ready to hit the market, some potential buyers may hold 
back this week -- especially after Sunday's White House decision to launch 
trade sanction proceedings against the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 The worsening trade row may guarantee that Japanese investors, who once 
vacuumed up T-bonds by the billions, will remain on a "buyer's strike" as far 
as U.S. securities are concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 And if the dollar plunges anew because of the trade decision, the bond market 
could be swamped with selling by Japanese and other foreign investors who fear 
their U.S. assets will suffer another severe round of devaluation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Uncertainty about the Fed's next move. The bond market's rally Friday, and 
particularly the steep drop in short-term T-bill yields, suggested that 
investors no longer believe that the Federal Reserve Board will tighten credit 
soon. Why should the central bank raise short rates again if the economy is 
indeed slowing? 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on three-month T-bills, which rose steadily from 4.34% on July 18 to 
4.54% by last Thursday as the market assumed another Fed rate hike was coming, 
plunged to 4.37% on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But when the Fed's policy-making committee meets on Aug. 16, the surprise may 
be that Chairman Alan Greenspan & Co. decide to tighten credit anyway, some 
economists warn. 
</P>
<P>
 Louis Crandall, chief economist at bond firm R.H. Wrightson & Associates in 
New York, believes that the Fed has succeeded in dampening economic growth with 
its four official rate increases since February. 
</P>
<P>
 But now the central bank's focus will turn exclusively to inflation, Crandall 
says. And he thinks there's enough inflation in the pipeline -- thanks to three 
consecutive quarters of healthy growth -- to compel the Fed to boost short 
rates even higher as an anti-inflation tonic. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the arguments that the second quarter's inventory buildup augurs price 
cuts rather than price increases, Crandall says that inflationary pressures 
often lag GDP growth, like mushrooms after a rain. Businesses "are just a lot 
more optimistic now about their ability to raise prices and make it stick," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 He figures that will mean that monthly increases in the consumer price index, 
which have been running at 0.2% to 0.3% for the past year, will pick up to 0.2% 
to 0.4% in the second half of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first time we get a 0.4% (monthly rise in the) CPI, that's going to be a 
very negative development for the bond market," Crandall warns. The July CPI 
report is due on Aug. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Notably, even as inventories grew in the second quarter, the GDP implicit 
price deflator, a key measure of inflation, rose at a 2.9% annualized rate -- 
the same as in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Brusca, economist at Nikko Securities in New York, agrees that the Fed 
is likely to feel pressure to tighten again because of latent inflation 
concerns. Compounding the problem, he says, is that U.S. worker productivity is 
declining this year while many commodity prices are rising -- a dangerously 
inflationary mix. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Fed is going to be very worried" about that trend, Brusca says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, Brusca believes that long-term bond yields, if not short-term yields, 
could still be primed to ratchet lower between now and year's end. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the CPI growth picks up from its 2.5% annualized rate in the first 
half to between 3% and 4% in the second half, the current 7.39% yield on 
30-year Treasury bonds represents a historically high return relative to 
inflation, Brusca notes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the bond market has just gotten too pessimistic" about the 
longer-term outlook and is overdue for a turnaround, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, overly bearish sentiment in bond and stock markets could mean that 
August's surprise will be a lightning-fast rally that drives bond yields down 
and stock prices up, assuming the economic data cooperate and the Treasury's 
refunding goes OK. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stock market, "short" sales -- the amount of borrowed stock sold by 
bearish traders anticipating further price declines -- are at record levels. A 
rally in bonds, however brief, could force many stock short-sellers to cover 
their positions, fueling panicked buying of shares. 
</P>
<P>
 But the sustainability of any market advance is questionable, especially in 
bonds. If you assume that the economy picks up again in the fourth quarter, or 
early in 1995, renewed jitters about interest rates and inflation won't be far 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
 R.H. Wrightson's Crandall continues to recommend that clients sell into any 
bond rallies. His rule of thumb for traders: Buy bonds when the 30-year T-bond 
yield is above 7.5%, and sell when it falls below 7.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 *  
</P>
<P>
 A Turn for Wall Street? The stock market didn't respond all that well to 
Friday's big drop in bond yields. The Dow industrials added just 33.67 points 
to 3,764.50. In contrast, when the T-bond yield plunged from 7.44% to 7.26% 
last May 17, the Dow mustered a 49.11-point gain. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the market did manage to rise in July, which may come as a surprise to 
investors who got bored with the lethargic trading action. The Dow jumped 3.8% 
for the month, the Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 3.1% and the Nasdaq 
composite index added 2.3%. 
</P>
<P>
 Curiously, on Friday, the market leaders were industrial issues such as Clark 
Equipment, up $1.50 to $68.75, Dow Chemical, up $1 to $69.125, and steelmaker 
LTV Corp., up $1.625 to $18.75 -- all of which traded at new '94 highs. 
</P>
<P>
 If the economy is on the verge of a major slowdown, you wouldn't expect stocks 
of commodity producers like chemical and steel companies to be surging. Either 
buyers of those stocks are in for a rude shock, or the economy's pace -- and 
the longevity of this expansion -- are better than the second-quarter GDP 
report might suggest.

U.S. MOVES TOWARD JAPAN TRADE SANCTIONS; COMMERCE: TOKYO EXPRESSES WILLINGNESS 
TO KEEP TALKING, BUT NOT UNDER THE THREAT OF PUNITIVE MEASURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Increasing its pressure on Tokyo to settle an irritating trade dispute, the 
United States took steps Sunday to impose punitive measures if a 60-day 
negotiating period does not give U.S. companies a greater share of Japanese 
government purchases of telecommunications and medical equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 However, analysts said they did not think the United States really wants to 
impose such sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor announced the measure after talks in 
Washington between U.S. and Japanese officials broke off Saturday, one day 
before a twice-postponed deadline to produce an agreement that would end what 
the United States says is Japan's "persistent pattern of discrimination" 
against U.S. manufacturers in the two lucrative sectors. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations have been conducted, on and off, for nearly a year, since medical 
equipment and telecommunications gear were given a high priority. 
</P>
<P>
 "The time has come to use our trade laws . . . if necessary to address the 
question of continued discrimination against U.S. companies," Kantor said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, Chief Cabinet Secretary Kozo Igarashi said Japan is ready to resume 
trade framework talks with the United States but has no intention of continuing 
negotiations under U.S. sanctions pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 Igarashi told a news conference, however, that both countries agree the two 
sides have the will to continue framework talks to seek a solution to their 
differences. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if trade talks on government procurement were to be canceled, other 
sectors under the framework talks should be maintained," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo markets, the dollar fell sharply this morning, opening at 98.45 yen, 
down 1.48 yen from Friday's close, but it recovered to 98.95 yen by midday. 
Stocks were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. and Japanese officials have said that the obstacle to reaching an 
agreement is determining acceptable "qualitative and quantitative" criteria for 
measuring the U.S. penetration of the Japanese market. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese object to any effort to set specific goals, fearing they could 
become mandatory targets that, if not met, could lead to the imposition of 
sanctions in the form of U.S. tariffs on Japanese products sold in the United 
States or quotas limiting such sales. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States insists that the two nations arrive at some system that will 
provide a clear measure of whether foreign companies are able to penetrate the 
Japanese market. 
</P>
<P>
 The procedures announced Sunday provide that if an agreement is not reached 
within 60 days, the Clinton Administration has the authority to raise tariffs 
on certain Japanese products shipped to the United States, a step that would 
probably lead to higher consumer prices for those items. 
</P>
<P>
 While the threat of sanctions would suggest that the difficult U.S.-Japanese 
trade relationship is headed for new depths, neither side expressed great 
concern. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey Young, an analyst with Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd. in Tokyo, said 
Japanese negotiators appear confident that Washington does not really want to 
impose sanctions. Some analysts in Tokyo, he noted, believe sanctions would 
hurt the United States more than Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials cite what they say is a need to apply strong pressure on 
Japanese negotiators, and Japanese officials expressed the expectation that the 
talks would resume in September before any sanctions are imposed. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than 15 years, the United States and Japan have been engaged in a 
running dispute over whether the Japanese government, in its own purchases, has 
frozen out foreign suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy is just one element among many straining U.S.-Japanese trade 
relations. U.S. firms also complain that Tokyo is frustrating their efforts to 
sell cars and car parts, to gain a firm foothold in construction and a bigger 
share of insurance and investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Kantor's office said sales by foreign companies make up 25% of the average 
domestic private and public telecommunications market in the industrialized 
world but that the foreign share of this $10-billion market in Japan is 5%. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. manufacturers hold 40% of the medical technology market in the European 
Union, the trade office said, but their share in Japan is less than half that. 
</P>
<P>
 Kantor said four factors hamper foreign suppliers in competing for Japanese 
government contracts: 
</P>
<P>
 * Limited access to early information on upcoming procurements. 
</P>
<P>
 * Reliance by government agencies on an informal network of Japanese 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 * Insufficient consideration of the technical merits of foreign bids. 
</P>
<P>
 * Development of technical specifications in telecommunications that favor 
local companies.

 And the settlement is . . . $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the size of the check North Hollywood candy maker Frank Sheftel just 
wrote to settle the federal lawsuit filed against him in March by the Academy 
of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences after Sheftel made Oscar-shaped chocolates 
for a party hosted by Columbia and TriStar pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute started after Sheftel's Candy Factory delivered 300 of the 
10-inch-tall chocolate statuettes to the home of Mark Canton, who heads 
Columbia and TriStar, for an Academy Awards party. The academy found out and 
sued, saying it wanted to protect Oscar's image. Sheftel formed a Candy Factory 
Defense Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to paying $1,500, Sheftel turned over 51 molds, but he declined to 
part with his two remaining chocolate Oscars. He and his lawyer ate those, but 
not before Sheftel shaped one to look like a man holding his arms up in 
surrender. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a signed settlement agreement, "Sheftel agrees that he will not 
advertise, manufacture, sell or offer to any entity any naked male victory 
figurine holding its hands or any object in front of its chest or abdomen."

 Don't leave home without a generous relocation package.

<P>
 That seems to be the lesson to draw from American Express Chief Executive 
Harvey Golub's experience. 
</P>
<P>
 In his latest Crystal Report newsletter, executive pay expert Graef S. Crystal 
chastises American Express for taking a huge bath on an unfinished mansion that 
it inherited from Golub. Crystal says he found the details buried in American 
Express' latest proxy. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Crystal, Golub in 1991 was building a 15,000-square-foot, 
$6.9-million mansion in suburban Minneapolis, where he ran American Express' 
IDS unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Golub then transferred to New York, where he later assumed the top job in 1993 
from James Robinson. American Express hired a relocation service to oversee the 
completion and sale of the home, which even has a car wash. 
</P>
<P>
 The home sold in 1993, with American Express taking a $5.2-million loss. In an 
interview, Crystal calculates the total loss at $6.6 million with carrying 
costs added. A Line Direct to the Boss

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ENTERPRISE; 'JUST A MATTER OF WORKING HARDER AND SMARTER'; 
LEASING: THE YOUNG OWNERS OF BALBOA CAPITAL CORP. HAVE SEEN FIRM'S SALES GROW 
BY 2,652% IN FOUR YEARS. 
</P>

<P>
 Patrick Byrne and Shawn Giffin used to play a friendly game of one-upmanship 
when they were eager young salesmen for a Santa Ana equipment leasing company. 
</P>
<P>
 If Byrne came to work at 7:30 in the morning, then Giffin would arrive the 
next day at 7:15 or so, which would bring Byrne in the following day at 7 a.m., 
which would trigger a 6:45 a.m. arrival by Giffin, and so on and so on until 
they called a pre-dawn truce. Then one day, Giffin would arrive a little 
earlier than Byrne and the race would be on again. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that Byrne and Giffin, both 28, are eager young owners of a fast-growing 
private equipment leasing firm, they have solved their rivalry of arrival: They 
have offices 60 miles apart. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is that same hard-driving style that has fueled the spectacular growth 
of Balboa Capital Corp. during the last six years through recession and 
interest rate cycles. 
</P>
<P>
 Byrne and Giffin say that Balboa Capital, which maintains twin headquarters in 
West Los Angeles and Irvine, has excelled by doing things differently, and 
perhaps more intensely, than its competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a matter of working harder and smarter," Byrne said with a shrug. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, Byrne and Giffin contend they have shaken up their corner of 
the leasing industry a bit -- but there are rumblings that the company may be 
too aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
 The $128-billion equipment leasing business, after all, was used to fatter and 
happier days. And while it has one foot in the country club world inhabited by 
banks and insurance companies, the other foot remains planted in a pool hall 
atmosphere associated with slick salesmanship. 
</P>
<P>
 Balboa Capital -- in competition with other independent firms, banks and 
subsidiaries of manufacturers -- acts as a middleman between a business that 
wants to lease equipment and the company that makes or distributes the 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 More businesses have opted to rent in recent years because they can frequently 
get lower payments than they would for an outright purchase, and because 
leasing allows them to leave their bank lines of credit alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Balboa Capital is still relatively small by industry standards but is swelling 
so quickly that it made the latest list of fastest-growing privately held 
companies published each year by Inc. magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to sales growth of 2,652% between 1988 and 1992, Balboa ranked 67th 
among 500 private companies on the roster. Balboa was also a finalist this year 
in an Entrepreneur of the Year competition sponsored by the magazine along with 
Ernst & Young and Merrill Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
 Balboa expects revenue of about $40 million this year, which includes about 
$35 million in equipment costs (much of which passes on to Balboa's equipment 
vendors) and about $5 million in interest revenue (which Balboa keeps). 
</P>
<P>
 The company, named for its first office on Orange County's Balboa Island, has 
grown to four locations and 75 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Not bad for two guys who, one year out of the University of Arizona, pooled 
$2,000 apiece in savings to tackle the leasing business. They focused on 
providing high-tech equipment to small and medium-size companies in such 
industries as apparel, photography, film post-production, telecommunications 
and computer graphics. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the beginning, we were a start-up company, we didn't have any customers 
and we were 23 years old . Now that was when it was hard," Byrne said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two spent a lot of time doing business by telephone or letter before 
meeting with bankers to whom they hoped to sell their leases, Giffin said. But 
after a few months in operation, Balboa landed a nearly $1-million transaction 
with a Mississippi department store chain. 
</P>
<P>
 "That really gave us real credibility in the eyes of the bankers," Giffin 
said. But the "youth thing," as they call it, can still be an obstacle in more 
stuffy financial circles, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can always see that glint in their eyes when they see how old we are," 
Giffin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always fun to see their faces," Byrne added. 
</P>
<P>
 Less fun was a falling-out with five key salesmen from the Los Angeles office 
in March, 1993, when they left to form their own leasing company a few blocks 
away. A messy lawsuit followed, and tempers flared. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute was marked by harassing phone calls, complete with heavy breathing 
and giggling, placed from Balboa's office to the new competitors, and it 
escalated to where the former employees caught Byrne going through their 
dumpster one July night looking for documents, court filings contend. A 
building janitor declared in court documents that Byrne jumped from the 
dumpster and wiped his filthy hands across the clean dress shirt and tie of one 
of his former employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact of the matter is, all defendants are on the brink of personal 
bankruptcy," former Balboa employee Daniel Bassett -- he of the soiled shirt -- 
stated in a court filing. "We did not anticipate having to fight a ridiculous 
lawsuit when we started Truxton Financial and now we have exhausted our 
personal resources." 
</P>
<P>
 Truxton Financial went out of business, Bassett said in a brief interview. The 
former employees think they did nothing wrong but agreed to settle the lawsuit 
to avoid further legal expenses, said Bassett, who declined to say more.Byrne 
said the suit was settled for about $150,000 and the former employees agreed to 
stop using Balboa's trade secrets. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was kind of an ugly situation," Byrne said of the suit. "It got real 
personal." 
</P>
<P>
 But the loss of so many key salesmen was only "a minor setback," Byrne said. 
"It basically decimated the office, but we were able to build it back up." 
</P>
<P>
 Competitors' salesmen hint at disgruntled Balboa customers complaining of 
lease terms that change with no notice or are spelled out in tiny print; Balboa 
responds with testimonials from happy clients. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm's bare-knuckle image, said Kenneth D. Goodman, Balboa's vice 
president of marketing, has developed because Balboa is "aggressive in an 
industry that's used to being passive and too 'professional' to do marketing. . 
. . 'They must be doing something wrong or else how would they be beating us 
out of so many deals?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The recession, which ate up dozens of Balboa's competitors, was a challenge, 
"but we were so young and everybody we hired was so young when we got into the 
market that we didn't know any difference," Giffin said. And banks pulled back 
from the leasing business during that time, which helped, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also has reaped much new business from equipment trade shows where 
they are frequently the only leasing company there, Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond aggressive sales, Balboa is different because of the individual 
attention given to tailor a lease for each customer, Giffin said. A corporate 
mission statement hanging in each office declares: "No cookie cutter deals. 
Blast the boundaries of conventional wisdom."

 Afternoon Edition Dies: The San Diego Union-Tribune today halts publication of 
its afternoon edition, the last vestige of the old San Diego Tribune, which 
owner Copley Newspapers merged with the San Diego Union in 1992. Copley Editor 
in Chief Herb G. Klein said the closing of the once-popular edition, which 
carried closing stock prices and was dubbed the "green sheet" because of its 
green newsprint, reflects a national trend of diminishing popularity of 
afternoon newspapers.Home delivery of the late edition had declined to 65,000 
from more than 100,000 before the merger. Nevertheless, Klein said the 
Union-Tribune's daily circulation of 365,000 is up from the 350,000 papers sold 
five years ago by the Union and Tribune combined. On Sundays, the Union-Tribune 
sells 450,000 copies. No editorial employees were laid off, but eight or nine 
circulation employees will lose their jobs or be converted to part-timers as a 
result of the edition's demise, Klein said.

 Surfing to Ring Cash Registers: The U.S. Open of Surfing, the Assn. of Surfing 
Professionals' first world-class event on the U.S. mainland since 1991, opens 
Tuesday in Huntington Beach, and local merchants can hardly wait. The city 
expects a wave of business from surf fans and corporate affairs hosted by the 
event's sponsors, including Sebastian International Inc., a Woodland 
Hills-based hair products company that is bringing 2,000 distributors to 
town.Attendance at the weekend finals could soar to 100,000 fans daily. The 
cash-strapped city will get a boost as beach-goers pay to park in city-owned 
lots and eat at beachfront concession stands. Diane Baker, president of the 
Huntington Beach Conference and Visitors Bureau, said televised coverage of the 
contest by cable network Prime Ticket "is publicity that you can't buy."

 Employment Reports Due: Are Los Angeles County and the rest of California 
recovering or sinking back into recession? A good clue will come Friday when 
government officials release the July employment reports for the county, state 
and nation. For most of this year, analysts have agreed that California is 
finally following the nation in pulling out of recession.Even though aerospace 
plants hit by U.S. defense cutbacks continue to fire workers to cut costs, 
analysts have pointed out that service industries are picking up some of the 
slack in the economy. But optimists were dealt a big disappointment by the June 
statistics, which showed job losses in both the county and state despite a 
strong increase nationally. The jobless rates in June were 11% for the county, 
8.3% for the state and 6.0% for the nation. Even more troubling was the fact 
that the state's loss of 12,100 jobs, coupled with a downward revision in the 
figures for April and May, left California with a meager gain of 6,200 jobs for 
the first half of 1994.

 Nigerian Oil Drilling Activity Halted: Companies are pulling most staff from 
the country, which has been crippled by an oil workers' strike, an official in 
the industry said. The official with oil-field service giant Schlumberger Ltd. 
said from Lagos that the company decided Saturday to pull out all but a handful 
of personnel and evacuate expatriate families. He said there were "no rigs 
operating" in Nigeria by Sunday and the effects of the pro-democracy strike -- 
which enters its fifth week Monday -- will soon "completely shut down the oil 
industry" in that country.

owner of a family restaurant chain that lays claim to the original Coney Island 
Hot Dog -- includes menus attached to the gasoline pumps and intercoms that 
allow drivers to order fast food while they refuel, to be ready to eat when 
they pick it up.The feature is part of several improvements Unocal plans to 
make at about 200 of its stations. Another change: pumps that fill gas tanks 
40% faster than many of those now in stations.

QUIETLY, TRADERS WENT BEARISH ON WALL STREET; NEW YORK: FINANCIAL INDUSTRY'S

 The windows of the proud prewar skyscrapers are black, their lobbies dead as 
tombs, their "For Sale" and "Will Divide" signs yellow and cracked with age. 
When another bank or brokerage moves out, it takes the landlord three or four 
years to find a new tenant. 
</P>
<P>
 This is Wall Street today. Quietly, almost while no one was looking, it became 
more adjective than noun, more of a state of mind than a place. 
</P>
<P>
 There are still "Wall Street analysts" and "Wall Street profits," but no Wall 
Street, at least not as it used to be known. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street, the industry, has fled its birthplace, as Hollywood did. Now Wall 
Street is in mid-town Manhattan and New Jersey and Los Angeles, in suburban 
office parks and home offices. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wall Street the neighborhood -- the street itself and its immediate 
environs, an area covering a quarter-square mile in the core of lower Manhattan 
-- is going one way: down. 
</P>
<P>
 It has fallen victim to the age and obsolescence of its buildings; 
decentralization and downsizing in the financial services industry; the lure of 
other business districts with newer buildings, easier commutes, better food. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past year alone, plans for a new stock exchange building in the heart 
of the financial district collapsed for lack of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 And 40 Wall, one of the tallest buildings in the world, sold for $69 million 
less than it did four years earlier. Never in the history of commercial real 
estate had anything so big lost so much value so fast. 
</P>
<P>
 A third of the district's office space is vacant. A tower at 55 Broad has been 
empty since its chief tenant, Drexel Burnham Lambert, went ignominiously out of 
business. "Entire Building for Lease" is stenciled on the glass facade. A 
doorman stands morosely in the dim lobby, the Maytag repairman of Manhattan 
real estate. 
</P>
<P>
 A Conway's discount store in the base of 43 Broad St. advertises a sale on 
women's shorts. Above the front door, a bas-relief of an eagle with an anchor 
in its talons hints at grander days. 
</P>
<P>
 Fewer people attend Trinity Church's weekday services, fewer people eat lunch 
on the steps of Federal Hall. You don't have to wait as long for a restaurant 
table or a haircut or a cab. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the 1987 stock market crash, lower Manhattan has lost a fifth of its 
work force -- 100,000 jobs. Most probably aren't coming back. 
</P>
<P>
 "In '92, people still thought it was a cyclical downturn," says Elliott Schlar 
of Columbia University, a planning expert. "It's becoming clear it's more than 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 The computer, the fax and their ilk have reduced the need for a dense, 
high-rise office district. At the same time, the financial services industry 
has become more competitive; even as profits increase, firms employ fewer 
workers and use less space. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry has also spread out. Fewer than a third of the firms in the 
Securities Industry Assn. are even in Manhattan. Big mutual funds such as 
Fidelity and Vanguard are in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. And many clerical 
jobs once done on Wall Street can now be performed elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trend is toward an ever broader definition of Wall Street," says Charles 
Shapiro of the real estate firm Austrian Roth, "one that might be found on the 
information highway." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if they stay in New York, businesses want big, open, rectangular floors 
so they can rearrange their offices as needed; they want high ceilings, so they 
can raise floors to accommodate computers and wiring; they want extra 
electrical capacity, efficient air-conditioning and fast elevators. 
</P>
<P>
 But most Wall Street buildings went up before 1940 and were designed with 
smaller floors so workers would be close to the best source of light and air -- 
the window. Many have irregularly shaped floors (a legacy of the district's 
curving old streets), lots of columns, antiquated wiring and slow elevators. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years ago, businesses settled for anything with four walls. But now 
Manhattan is awash in vacant office space -- 50 million square feet, roughly as 
much as was built in the '80s. Those new towers, says Schlar, "sucked the life 
out of Wall Street." 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill Lynch and Shearson Lehman moved to the World Financial Center, on 
downtown's booming waterfront. Kidder Peabody, Paine Webber and Bear Stearns 
decamped to mid-town. 
</P>
<P>
 Mid-town is downtown's real competition; Pennsylvania Station and Grand 
Central Terminal offer access to the suburbs. Downtown has lots of subway lines 
to Brooklyn and Queens, but strap-hanging secretaries and clerks don't sign 
long-term leases. 
</P>
<P>
 Mid-town also has half a dozen of the world's best French restaurants; 
downtown had Delmonico's, before it went out of business last year after a 
century-and-a-half at 36 Beaver St. 
</P>
<P>
 Rents in downtown's older buildings are so low that half of them make no 
money; about three dozen are bankrupt or in foreclosure. After operating costs 
and taxes, there's often not enough to pay the mortgage, let alone make the 
renovations needed to attract prime office tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 If these buildings are no longer viable as offices, there are three options: 
Convert 'em. Mothball 'em. Raze 'em. 
</P>
<P>
 The real estate firm Jones Lang Wootten says Wall Street's next big need could 
be "demolition and site clearance." 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time in 400 years," predicts Columbia's Schlar, "we're going to 
take buildings away from downtown instead of putting them up." 
</P>
<P>
 That would create more open space and parking -- make Wall Street more like a 
suburban office park -- and allow an owner to rebuild when the market comes 
back. But demolition is very costly in cramped downtown, and in many cases 
zoning would preclude rebuilding anything as large as the original structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversion? Turning office towers into apartment houses sounds good, but how 
many people want to live on shadowy, narrow streets with no schools, parks or 
markets? 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves mothballing, but you must still pay taxes and renovate your old 
building when the market improves. By then, it's even older. 
</P>
<P>
 More probable is a gradual cycle of decline, in which the city lowers tax 
assessments and landlords lower rents, opening the area to fledgling 
businesses, nonprofit institutions and government. It won't be the old Wall 
Street, but at least it won't be a parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in decline, Wall Street has a great sense of place. It still is part of 
the nation's second-largest business district, still home of its principal 
stock exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 This is where New York began -- the street takes its name from a barrier built 
by Dutch settlers in 1653. And where America began, where George Washington 
took the oath of office in 1789, where the money was raised to dig the canals, 
lay the rails, make the guns. 
</P>
<P>
 At the top of Wall sits Trinity Church, whose dark spire was the tallest 
structure in the city until 1896. Even if some of the church's usurpers pass 
from the scene, says the Rev. Charles Cesaretti, life will go on. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sit at the crossroads of Broadway and Wall; there's no intersection like 
it in the world," he said. "Corporations come and go, but this location won't. 
The question is: What will this generation make of it?"

FOR MARKETS, AUGUST OFTEN SURPRISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ah, August -- when most investors are supposed to be at the beach, on the lake 
or in the mountains. It ought to be a dull month for stock and bond markets, 
yet in recent years it has been anything but. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, August's penchant for surprises in this decade has forced investors to 
pay attention, wherever they may be: 
</P>
<P>
 * August, 1990: Iraq invades Kuwait, and a bear market is born on Wall Street. 
The Dow industrial average plummets from a then-record 2,999.75 on July 17 to 
2,614.36 by Aug. 31, a sickening decline of 12.8%. 
</P>
<P>
 * August, 1991: A coup attempt in the old Soviet Union shaves a fast 100 
points from the Dow between Aug. 15 and Aug. 19, but the government of Mikhail 
Gorbachev quickly foils the coup, and the market rockets to new highs by the 
end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 * August, 1992: After George Bush's non-performance at the Republican National 
Convention, the markets come to grips with the likelihood that Bill Clinton 
will be elected in November. The Dow falls from nearly 3,400 at the start of 
the month to 3,232 just after the Republican convention, as interest rates turn 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 * August, 1993: A manic rally takes hold in the bond market, pushing yields to 
generational lows on investor expectations for snail's-pace economic growth. 
The 30-year T-bond yield, 6.5% at the start of the month, is under 6% by the 
end of the month, for the first time ever. The Dow rises from 3,560 to 3,650 
during the month. 
</P>
<P>
 But is August really any more fitful for markets than other months? Probably 
not. It may just seem that way to many investors because they're roused from 
what should be relaxing getaways. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also true, however, that the markets are potentially more volatile in 
August precisely because so many people are away from Wall Street: When 
liquidity is thin, market swings naturally can be much wilder than normal. So 
August can be a good month for opportunistic traders. TOM PETRUNO

 Exports Rise, Government Reports: Hong Kong's exports increased 6.4% in June 
over a year ago, according to government statistics.The volume of goods 
re-exported increased 20%. The value of domestic exports increased by $155 
million in June to $2.54 billion. The value of re-exports, at $10.36 billion, 
was $1.72 billion higher than a year earlier, according to figures released by 
the Census and Statistics Department. Taking domestic exports and re-exports 
together, Hong Kong exports increased by $1.86 billion, or 17%, to $12.92 
billion in June, 1994. Re-exports are goods produced outside Hong Kong (in 
southern China, for example) that are shipped to Hong Kong and then exported 
elsewhere in the world.

 Drought Drives Up Prices: The most serious drought in the nation's recent 
history is driving up consumer prices and threatens to slow economic growth, 
analysts and economists said.Abnormally hot and dry weather this summer has 
damaged about 10% of the nation's rice paddies and vegetable farms and killed 
hundreds of thousands of head of livestock. As a result, the prices of red 
peppers, cucumbers, cabbage, garlic and other farm products have more than 
doubled in the last month. Meat prices have also soared, but not quite as much 
as vegetable prices. Some companies have cut back production, and two paper 
manufacturers were forced to suspend operations.

 U.S. Software Firms Sue Alleged Pirates: Microsoft Corp., Lotus Development 
Corp. and Autodesk Inc. claim that five Beijing companies illegally copied, 
displayed and sold their software.The legal action, disclosed by the official 
newspaper China Daily, follows one of the first major moves by the government 
there against its alleged software pirates. The lawsuit charges that the U.S. 
companies lost millions of dollars in profits from 10 incidents of copyright 
infringement, the newspaper account said. The plaintiffs want between $10,000 
and $30,000 for each copyright breach, but "total damages will be far higher," 
said Stephanie Mitchell, vice president of the Business Software Alliance. The 
Washington-based group is representing the U.S. companies.

SOUTH KOREA READY TO ENTER FLAT-PANEL RACE; ELECTRONICS: NEW FACTORIES ARE 
EXPECTED TO HELP TWO FIRMS CRACK THE JAPANESE-DOMINATED FIELD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Right now, they're mere skeletons of buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the factories they will house start operating early next year, South 
Korea's electronics manufacturers say they will have cracked another industry 
dominated by Japan: flat-panel computer screens. 
</P>
<P>
 "A great future lies ahead for Korean manufacturers in this field," said Park 
Yong-bok of the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy. "This is certainly the 
biggest market available for us since the semiconductor boom." 
</P>
<P>
 In April, South Korea moved to offer flat-panel manufacturers a host of 
incentives including research funds, tariff reductions for importing equipment, 
and easier access to land for factories. 
</P>
<P>
 At least two South Korean electronics producers -- Samsung and Goldstar -- say 
that in 1995 they will begin mass production of these advanced screens, called 
thin film transistor-liquid crystal displays, or TFT-LCDs. 
</P>
<P>
 The panels take the place of cathode-ray tubes in notebook computers and 
portable televisions. 
</P>
<P>
 They offer vivid color images on a screen less than an inch thick. 
</P>
<P>
 In a factory being built at an existing semiconductor complex amid the green 
hills of this town outside Seoul, Samsung Electronics plans to churn out 60,000 
TFT panels a month beginning in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldstar Co. plans to start producing 50,000 screens a month next May, on a 
$375-million production line being built in its Kumi electronics complex in 
central South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 The location of these plants highlights South Korea's strategy of entering new 
markets by pairing research with technology where it enjoys a comparative 
advantage. South Korea hopes to repeat its success with computer memory chips 
-- another business that used to be dominated by Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 South Korean firms today provide about a quarter of the world's dynamic random 
access memory, or DRAM, chips. Samsung is the world's biggest supplier. 
TFT-screen manufacturing employs technologies and production processes similar 
to those used for memory chips. It is also a business well-suited to South 
Korea's big electronics producers, which can afford huge investments and have 
the technical resources needed for mass manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will have little difficulty in finding markets for our products. We do not 
expect TFT supply to catch up with demand until 1997," said Kim Sang-soo, a 
chief researcher at Samsung's LCD division. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has also recognized the potential marketplace for flat 
screens. Earlier this year, the Defense Department initiated a grant program to 
encourage U.S. manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 Just this week, IBM and Toshiba said they would soon double production of flat 
screens at a plant they jointly own in Japan to 200,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Output in Samsung's Kiheung plant is forecast to reach 100,000 screens a month 
by late 1996. The company is planning a second plant in 1996, expanding its 
total TFT investments to $625 million by 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 Samsung is now producing 3,000 nine- and 10-inch TFT screens a month at a 
pilot line used for U.S. clients such as Texas Instruments Inc. It says its 
screens consume less electricity and offer more vivid images than those made in 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldstar plans to have invested $800 million by 1997, when its monthly 
capacity will be expanded to 100,000 panels. The company hopes to generate $600 
million in annual TFT sales by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Hyundai Electronics, another success story in the semiconductor industry, is 
negotiating to install a TFT-production line in its Ichon complex. 
</P>
<P>
 In early June, Orion Electronics launched a production line, bought from 
Toshiba, to produce less advanced screens for color and monochrome notebooks, 
as well as wristwatches and calculators. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, South Korean firms will end up competing with the Japanese 
manufacturers that control 90% of the LCD market, worth $6 billion annually and 
growing at 30% a year. 
</P>
<P>
 With the rise of laptop computers, flat-panel screens have become critical to 
the computer industry and the military, in airplane cockpits and war room 
displays. In the future, they will make possible large, wall-mounted TVs only a 
few inches thick. 
</P>
<P>
 "LCDs are not a matter of choice. It is almost inevitable for South Korean 
electronics companies to enter the business," Samsung's Kim said.

 Company Licensed to Manufacture Aircraft Tires: Guilin Lanyu Aviation Tires 
Development Co. of Guilin received the first such license China has granted.It 
will make the tires for nine models of large passenger planes, including ones 
built by Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp., the official News Agency 
Xinhua reported, citing official sources. China joins the small number of 
countries -- the United States, Britain and Japan among them -- that 
manufacture aircraft tires. Lanyu Aviation took five years to develop the tires 
as part of China's Torch Program, which provides funds for high-technology 
research. Guilin is in southwestern China.

 Unemployment Situation Worsens: The number of positions available for a larger 
number of job-seekers fell in June to the lowest level in more than seven 
years.Japan's unemployment rate rose to 2.9% from 2.8% in May and 2.5% a year 
earlier, the government's Management and Coordination Agency said. The closely 
watched jobs-to-applicants ratio fell to 63 in June from 64 in May, the Labor 
Ministry said. The figure means that there were only 63 job offers for every 
100 applicants at government job placement offices. The jobs-to-applicants 
ratio stood at 62 in February, 1987.

 Foreign Bids to Be Sought on Natural Gas Projects: PetroVietnam, the 
state-owned oil and gas monopoly, said it will invite foreign companies to bid 
on up to $400 million worth of natural gas projects as early as November.The 
projects are aimed at developing Vietnam's embryonic gas industry to meet 
rising domestic energy needs and boost export earnings, said Nguyen Trong Hanh, 
a director for PetroVietnam. Under the company's plan, a plant would be built 
to extract liquid from gas pumped at the Bach Ho oil and gas field, Vietnam's 
only producing commercial oil field. PetroVietnam plans to export gas after 
satisfying domestic needs.

ACTIVIST PLEADS FOR ABORTION PROTECTION; RIGHTS: SAFETY OF CLINICS NEEDS TO BE 
ENSURED, A COSTA MESA CHURCH CONGREGATION IS TOLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 America's senior abortion rights activist, William Baird, pleaded Sunday for 
tolerance in the increasingly violent reaction nationwide to the right to 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want the antiabortion people to tolerate the right of Americans to make 
their own moral decisions," said Baird, speaking at a Costa Mesa church just 
two days after an abortion doctor and his security escort were shotgunned to 
death in Florida. "Why can't we say to the Catholics and the fundamentalist 
Christians, if you think (abortion) is wrong, then don't you have it." 
</P>
<P>
 But Baird, 62, a tireless abortion rights advocate who opened the country's 
first birth control and abortion counseling clinic in New York in 1963, also 
sharply criticized the federal government and police for not adequately 
protecting abortion clinics nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The man arrested as a suspect in the shootings, Paul Hill, had threatened to 
kill abortion doctors and told a radio audience last year that killing Baird 
would be "justifiable homicide," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This need not have happened. The man was a walking time bomb," Baird told the 
congregation of about 75 at the Orange Coast Unitarian Universalist Church 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI needs to treat antiabortion activists as terrorists, Baird said later, 
adding that unless clinics are fully protected, there is a risk of reaction to 
the violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two hundred clinics have been firebombed . . . and the right to life group is 
not determined to be a terrorist group," Baird said. "Tell me this is not a 
conspiracy. Where are the chemicals coming from? Who is training these people?" 
</P>
<P>
 Baird's fervent and often graphic discussion of the crude methods of abortion 
-- prior to legalization -- and the violence in the abortion debate brought 
groans from the gathering, who applauded him at the end of his talk. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's distressing," said George Shackelford of Irvine. "I have to say it seems 
like some things have gotten better, but this firebombing stuff definitely 
seems like terrorism to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Semler of Huntington Beach said Baird's message "makes me feel guilty I 
haven't done more . . . I cringe that people are getting killed." 
</P>
<P>
 Baird acknowledged that he is also a potential target. Throughout the years, 
he has been arrested eight times in five states and was the principal litigant 
in reproductive freedom cases three times before the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most important decisions came in 1972 when the court, by a 6-1 
vote, overthrew a Massachusetts state law that outlawed selling birth control 
to single people. That case, Baird vs. Eisenstadt, overturned his 1967 arrest 
for handing out contraceptives to Boston University students. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Baird said he lives with the knowledge that "I'm a target. 
When I walk out of here I have no way of knowing if somebody is waiting for me. 
But I must do what has to be done. . . . The message I try to convey is simple. 
Every woman has the right to determine her own morality. Every woman has the 
right to medical care, regardless if her husband says no, regardless if her 
children say no." 
</P>
<P>
 After 31 years of abortion rights activism, Baird said he believes some 
progress has been made, particularly in the courts. For example, birth control 
used to be against the law, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Florida killings show again the depths of the anger against abortion 
and reproductive rights, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had progress. Everything I fought for then was a crime, now it's 
legal," Baird said. "But we are now so polarized that one side honestly 
believes that God is on their side. . . . If these forces are pro-life, why 
don't they condemn the death penalty?" 
</P>
<P>
 Daniella Walsh of Orange called Baird's talk "really right on." 
</P>
<P>
 "My reproductive days are probably over, but I have two daughters," said 
Walsh, 43. "It's their business and their business alone. Their freedoms have 
to be preserved."

GAMES HAVE ENDED, BUT MEMORIES LINGER ON FOR SOCCER TEAM HOSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 With cities across the nation having hosted World Cup soccer games, there are 
nine U.S. communities that can now boast of offering up their municipal 
stadiums to the planet's biggest sporting event. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo isn't one of them. Who needs the games and glitz anyway? "We had 
the U.S. soccer team for 18 months," said Bill Irvine of the Mission Viejo 
Soccer Foundation. "For a year and a half, we lived and breathed soccer with 
those guys, and we'll never forget the experience." 
</P>
<P>
 As U.S. soccer officials prepare to move out of their team training center in 
Mission Viejo, residents of this soccer-crazy suburb are reflecting on the 
months of World Cup memories they gained in hosting the squad. 
</P>
<P>
 Left behind will be tangible signs of the team's presence: a $3.5-million, 
world-class soccer facility, millions of dollars pumped into the South County 
economy, and more than $100,000 invested in area youth soccer leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps more important, "this was a chance for thousands of kids in our soccer 
leagues to watch their soccer heroes up close, in person," said Jack Minter of 
Mission Viejo, who runs the country's second-largest league in the American 
Youth Soccer Organization. "No other city in the nation was able to give their 
children that kind of opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 And for a few golden months surrounding the World Cup tournament, the world 
passed through Mission Viejo's door. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had hundreds of journalists from dozens of countries in this city," Irvine 
said. "There was one paper in England that had a Mission Viejo dateline, and 
the first line (of the story) asked, 'Where's Mission Viejo?' Then it had a 
little story about us." 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer is a way of life in Mission Viejo and most of South County, where more 
than 13,000 children play organized soccer, American Youth Soccer officials 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 "For many people, the family vacation is planned according to the location of 
our soccer tournaments," said Alan Gallup, founder of the Mission Viejo Soccer 
Foundation, a nonprofit group formed to bring the U.S. team to Mission Viejo. 
"For example, Thanksgiving means the Las Vegas tournament. Our social lives 
basically revolve around soccer." 
</P>
<P>
 This soccer-hungry city embraced the team when U.S. officials chose Mission 
Viejo in 1992 as a training site over such major metropolises as Dallas, 
Washington, Los Angeles and Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer officials wanted a clean, family-oriented atmosphere for the players. 
They found what they were looking for in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 Host families helped team members settle into South County. Players bought 
homes in Mission Viejo and frequented local stores, theaters and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 The city built the team a beautiful practice facility to help it prepare for 
the World Cup, an emerald gem set in the golden hills near the Saddleback 
Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Every day, adults and children would sit on the grassy slopes above the soccer 
fields and watch players who would soon become known across the country -- 
Alexi Lalas, Tony Meola, Marcelo Balboa and others. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the stuff of memories, and Mission Viejo residents have plenty to 
remember. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Wednesday, 13-year-old Tiffany Smith was at a UCLA soccer clinic where 
U.S. team member Cobi Jones was scheduled to appear. Smith had gotten to know 
Jones at the Mission Viejo practice field, and the dreadlocked soccer player 
even showed up at one of her games. 
</P>
<P>
 A crowd of admiring teen-age girls was gathered around Jones at UCLA when the 
former Bruin spotted Smith. Jones walked up to Smith and gave her a big hug as 
the other girls watched with wide eyes and open mouths. Then a crowd gathered 
around Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 "They came up to me and said, 'Oh my God, you know him?' " she said. "He just 
wanted to know how I was and what I was doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine's lasting memory is the day that soccer legend Pele came to town to 
film a commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was phenomenal," he said. "He was so great with the kids, and even as old 
as he is, Pele can still do amazing things with a soccer ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallup saw soccer gain new heights in popularity in a city already fanatical 
about the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "I vividly remember the first game the U.S. team played at Trabuco Hills High 
School stadium against F.C. Zurich," a top-ranked club team from Switzerland, 
he said. "I walked into the stadium and there were thousands of people in the 
stands, all cheering for U.S. soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was so much emotion that night," Gallup said. "Those people were 
thrilled to see the national team in Mission Viejo." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the U.S. team, "I can put our feelings (about Mission Viejo) into three 
words," said Dean Linke, the team spokesman who met his fiancee while working 
in South County. "I'll miss it, and I believe I speak for a lot of the team. I 
think Mission Viejo had a great effect on us, not only as a soccer team, but as 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Left behind will be the training center, which youth club teams are planning 
to use. American Youth Soccer officials say sign-ups for league play have 
jumped 15% for this fall's soccer season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anytime you go through an amazing event like this, there's got to be a 
letdown," Irvine said. "But I'm already planning out schedules for teams to 
start play in September. Soccer life goes on."

RESIDENTS JOIN FORCES IN EFFORT TO GET RID OF CHRONIC EYESORE; LAW: THEY ALL

 For more than three years, Dave Flynn has glared with growing frustration at 
the unkempt house across the street from his Huntington Harbour home. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Huntington Beach has filed criminal complaints against Flynn's 
neighbor, Elena Zagustin, and in a lawsuit outlined a host of code violations 
at her home: rubbish and debris piled outside along with broken and discarded 
furniture, six-foot-tall weeds and numerous fire code violations inside. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, city officials and Zagustin's attorney say the college 
professor has been cleaning up her property in accordance with a settlement 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
 But Flynn and other neighbors in this upscale beach community aren't 
satisfied. They want Zagustin to move out. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of feuding, the neighbors have adopted tactics pioneered by a Bay 
Area group called Safe Streets Now! in a case that is being closely watched by 
others in Orange County who are locked in long-running neighborhood disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Flynn and 23 other Huntington Harbor residents -- three of them lawyers 
-- are taking Zagustin to small-claims court in Westminster. Each has filed a 
separate lawsuit seeking $5,000 in damages in hopes that a large judgment will 
send her packing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't care about the money," Flynn said. "We're only using the money as a 
tool. We want her to sell the house." 
</P>
<P>
 Zagustin's attorney, Robert Whitaker, said she has been cooperating fully with 
the city to comply with the court settlement. He called the neighborhood's 
small-claims action excessive and mean-spirited. 
</P>
<P>
 "The neighbors have a hyper-interest in the case," Whitaker said. "I've been 
to her house many times. I can tell you now, it's in absolutely fine condition. 
It's not an eyesore. They just don't think she fits in." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents from Oakland to Long Beach have used the Safe Streets Now! technique 
in a last-ditch effort to force evictions of drug-selling tenants and put the 
squeeze on slumlords. Locally, the Huntington Harbor case is emerging as a key 
test of the tactic in Orange County against unsightly property. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials and residents elsewhere in the county are quick to proclaim 
neutrality in the Huntington Harbour dispute. It's the approach that Flynn and 
his neighbors are taking, however, that fascinates them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The appeal of the Safe Streets Now! program is that residents can do some 
things that local or county government cannot do, and that is take property 
owners to small-claims court when everything else fails and operate without an 
attorney," said Santa Ana Councilman Robert L. Richardson, an aide to 
Supervisor Roger R. Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it'll be a good tool for people to take things into their own hands 
in a safe fashion and to get some peace of mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson heard about the program and organized a training session with the 
program's founder in January, in part for Midway City residents fed up with 
drug dealing on their street. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana community activist Jim Walker also attended the same training 
session and has been working with Flynn and his neighbors to prepare their 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 "This would inoculate the county," Walker said. "There's so much powerlessness 
among people. If they only knew the power they had, they wouldn't be so 
complacent or complicit in the crime that goes on around them. This is where 
people can see, hey, there is recourse." 
</P>
<P>
 Safe Streets Now! was founded by Oakland resident Molly Wetzel in 1989 after 
she and her neighbors prevailed in a suit against a neighboring landlord. They 
complained that the landlord's tenants had turned the property into a crack 
house, frequented by gang members and prostitutes who terrorized the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal is to force property owners to take action by suing them in 
small-claims court, where it is inexpensive to file a complaint and attorneys 
are not needed. Cases are heard within 30 days and individual judgments can 
reach $5,000. Several residents can file suits individually against one person, 
increasing the potential amount of judgments. 
</P>
<P>
 Key to the tactic's success: Plaintiffs must show that the nuisance seriously 
affects their daily lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1989, Wetzel has helped Bay Area residents pull in more than $760,000 in 
small-claims settlements from landlords in their neighborhoods. In Long Beach, 
neighborhood activist Betsy Bredau helped win residents more than $56,000 in 
judgments during the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 Bredau has become a fixture at community meetings throughout Southern 
California, training residents and officials on the use of small-claims 
actions. It was at one such meeting that she met Huntington Harbour resident 
Dave Flynn and agreed to help him launch his legal battle on otherwise placid 
Morse Circle.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think the program is really going to expand down there in the next year," 
Bredau said. "There's a feeling in Long Beach now that property owners are 
starting to understand what their responsibilities are. We really feel like up 
here we have some muscle in getting some of these wild properties under 
control." 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, Bredau said, just the threat of legal action prompted property 
owners to clean up or evict problem tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn and his neighbors say they are concerned that the condition of 
Zagustin's home is hurting their property values, and a history of code 
violations at her home has them fearing for their safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's absolutely driven us nuts," said Ray Goulette, who has lived next-door 
to Zagustin since 1975. "We're constantly in fear of a fire." 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn said he and his neighbors have lost hope that any city action will 
permanently resolve their dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no place else to go," Flynn said at a recent meeting held by 
neighbors to prepare for today's court hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Zagustin, a tenured engineering professor for 27 years who is on medical leave 
from Cal State Long Beach, has lived in her home for 25 years. Her attorney 
described her as "an independent, thinking person" who says her neighbors are 
trying to control the way she lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitaker said Zagustin has no intention of moving and has suggested that the 
neighbors can move if they're so upset. 
</P>
<P>
 Zagustin did not return calls to her home last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach Deputy City Atty. Paul D'Alessandro said complaints about 
Zagustin's property date back to the mid-1980s. The city has filed at least 
three criminal complaints against her, one of which resulted in a four-day jail 
sentence, D'Alessandro said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a year ago, city officials opted for a different approach, and took 
Zagustin to civil court, seeking a permanent injunction that would force her to 
keep the house up to city codes.  
</P>
<P>
 The city and Zagustin reached a settlement last month after she took what 
D'Alessandro described as "major action" to clean up her property. D'Alessandro 
said her case has consumed more attorney hours than any other city code 
enforcement matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd love to see the property owners prevail, because there is a problem," 
said Margaret Riley, a senior code enforcement officer for the city of 
Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Flynn and his neighbors prevail in court today, others throughout the 
county say the Safe Streets Now! approach could provide greatly needed control 
to residents in troubled neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Norm Canchola, Santa Ana's neighborhood improvement coordinator, said 
residents in several neighborhoods in the city are amassing the kind of 
information they need to take small-claims actions in an effort to clean up 
houses used by drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 But many people fear retaliation and find it difficult to rally the necessary 
neighborhood support, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A victory for Flynn and his neighbors could unleash a flurry of new cases, 
said Santa Ana neighborhood activist Sandra Thrower. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just going to take one good case that everyone will look at and say, 
'Gosh, this really works,' " she said. "And maybe that will strengthen people 
emotionally so that they can get the courage to move forward."

THEY'RE ALL BOOKED UP; FUN HAS TO WAIT UNTIL SUMMER SCHOOL ENDS, BUT THE EARLY 
MORNING ROUTINE IS ALMOST OVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LILY DIZON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is a bright and beautiful summer morning, and Rachel Stayner stretches and 
yawns, thinking wistfully about how much longer she could have slept if only 
she didn't have to be here. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Here is an Estancia High School chemistry class, full of other students who 
are also rubbing sleep from their eyes. Here is where the 16-year-old has begun 
all but one weekday morning for the past five weeks at the miserable hour of 
7:15. Here is where -- instead of sleeping in and then vegging lazily on the 
beach with her friends -- she has been learning about the periodic table, about 
protons, neutrons, electrons and positive and negative ions. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is summer school. It is, in a way, Rachel's penance for putting chemistry 
off for the past three years and then not wanting to suffer through it during 
her forthcoming senior year at Corona del Mar High School. She must take the 
course to be admitted to her college of choice, Brigham Young University in 
Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 "I assumed summer school was going to be easy, and I was just going to kick 
back and relax," groaned Rachel, elbows on a desk, her hands pushing back the 
sandy-blond curls from her face. "I was wrong. I'm always so tired because the 
schedule is so hectic. I'm stressed. This is out of control." 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is that Rachel will soon grab hold of her out-of-control summer: 
The Newport-Mesa Unified School district summer session ends Friday. The bad 
news is that between now and then, she has to read, study, take tests and, of 
course, pass the final exam. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is the life of students who opt to sacrifice most of the sunny days of 
their summer vacation to better their grades, to take a course they couldn't -- 
or wouldn't -- sign up for at another time, to pick up more credits or to keep 
from failing altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, there are about 42,000 elementary and high school students 
enrolled in summer school. Most have stayed for the duration, which was four, 
five or six weeks, depending on the curriculum and the school district. For 
many high schools, the summer session ends Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't wait until the end," Rachel says. "I'm going to sleep in every 
morning. I'm going to bed later at night. I'm going to watch TV. I'm going to 
spend time with my friends. I'm going to be lazy." 
</P>
<P>
 As tired as she is and as busy as her schedule has been of late, Rachel still 
manages to find time to continue other daily routines that are important to 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 A devout Mormon, she dedicates every Monday night to "family night," praying 
with her parents and siblings at home and discussing the previous week. On 
Tuesdays, she participates in her church youth club activities, although in the 
past few weeks she has been the first to leave so she can get to bed early for 
school. On Saturday night, she goes to youth dances. 
</P>
<P>
 And every morning before Rachel begins the day, she prays and reads the 
Scriptures with her family. 
</P>
<P>
 She says she is looking forward to increasing these church-related activities 
and having a chance to see her friends after Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 But until that day gets here, she has to "go on with misery," Rachel says 
during a class break, giggling as soon as the final word slips out. She meant 
to say "chemistry," she insists. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't get her wrong. Rachel is not dissin' chemistry, not completely anyway. 
The teacher, jovial Jim Rogers, is fun and makes the class more bearable, she 
says. She has three friends from Corona del Mar High who sit next to her and 
crack jokes when it gets boring. And she figures she's getting something done 
-- even if she doesn't like it -- by earning 10 credits for the course. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to look at it on the bright side," Rachel says philosophically, tucking 
the wayward curls behind her ear. "I'm being productive. I'm learning 
something. I'm not just sitting on the beach and sleeping my summer away." 
</P>
<P>
 Chemistry in the summer isn't really so bad, Rachel concludes. 
</P>
<P>
 But then she remembers: She has to wake up at 6:15 so she can make it to class 
by the time the bell rings an hour later; she has to fight to stay awake for 
the next five hours; the summer session lasts six long weeks, and there are 22 
chapters assigned. 
</P>
<P>
 When she's not at school, she does homework for at least three hours a day. 
And just about every day, Mr. Rogers gives the class a test. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell myself every day, 'It's going to end soon,' " Rachel says as the bell 
rings at the end of the 15-minute break.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to end soon. It's going to end soon," she repeats, walking back to 
the class where Mr. Rogers and the lab await her.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; HEARING ON HOME FOR ABUSED WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council will have a public hearing Tuesday on whether to permit a 
group home for abused women and their children in an Anaheim Hills 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Too cramped at its main location in Orange, the Eli Home is seeking to 
relocate to 100 South Canyon Crest Drive and renovate a dilapidated house 
there.The Eli Home, which offers emergency shelter and counseling to victims of 
abuse, would be able to accommodate up to seven families at the new site. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, however, has met with stiff opposition from neighbors who say 
the home would have a devastating effect on the upscale community, where home 
prices start at $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors argue that the home would violate community zoning codes, create 
parking problems, and might result in violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "The impact on our neighborhood would be devastating," wrote Ken Hall, Sr., 
who lives on the same street as the proposed home, to the City Council. "We 
believe that an aggravated spouse or parent can very easily locate the project. 
In our view, anyone who would commit this type of violence against another 
human being is capable of expanding this violence to include our neighborhood, 
including our children and our homes." 
</P>
<P>
 Eli Home officials said violence is "highly unlikely" and has reported that 
none of Orange County's 24 emergency shelters has had such an incident. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission voted unanimously in favor of the Eli Home's request 
in March. The Eli Home was been awarded a "Point of Light" by former President 
George Bush and a Presidential Citation from President Bill Clinton for its 
volunteer work. MARTIN MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; AT AGE 5, CENTER FACES A CHALLENGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN EYERLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Unlike its clients, the 5-year-old Tustin Area Senior Center is experiencing 
growing pains. While increasingly challenged to meet the diverse needs of 
people age 50 to 102, the center is also feeling the pinch of funding cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really outgrew the building in three years," Recreation Supervisor Melissa 
O'Neal said during a recent ballroom dance party celebrating the center's fifth 
anniversary. A 12% jump in the number of participants each year has put a 
squeeze on facilities, she said, despite the center's spaciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's real challenging in terms of trying to be all things to all people," 
O'Neal said. Many of the programs are designed for seniors in their late 70s 
and 80s, "but we're also looking at the younger, recently retired people." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the offerings are TLC (transportation, lunch and counseling), bingo, 
cards, free movies and classes in Spanish, computer fundamentals, exercise, 
arts and crafts, dancing, music and autobiographical writing. 
</P>
<P>
 The center also offers blood pressure screenings and legal assistance, along 
with support groups for people suffering from Alzheimer's disease, diabetes and 
Parkinson's disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Maintaining this level of service can be difficult, however, when all levels 
of government are grappling with tight budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tough time with grant funding for everybody," O'Neal said. "But I try 
to yell louder." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, most of the news is positive at the center, which is owned and operated 
by the Tustin Community Services Department. Before the $2.7-million, 
17,500-square-foot facility was built, the city did not have a senior center. 
</P>
<P>
 Weekly meetings for seniors were held at City Hall, and there was a lunch 
program at a local church, "but everybody wanted to be under one roof," O'Neal 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A combination of state, city and private funding paid for the center, which 
was built next to Peppertree Park on land bought from the Tustin Unified School 
District. Seniors helped design the facility and chose the color scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not just a City Hall staff concept," O'Neal said. "There was senior 
input the whole way. And that hasn't stopped," she said, referring to the 
Senior Advisory Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Established by the Tustin City Council, the board advises city staff and 
elected officials on matters of concern to local seniors. Among the board 
members is Margarete Thompson, a 74-year-old businesswoman who is also 
president of the nonprofit Tustin Area Senior Center Fund and a member of the 
city Parks and Recreation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 For her efforts in obtaining private donations for the center's construction, 
she was named Tustin's Woman of the Year in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 When the center's dedication ceremony was held on a sweltering July afternoon 
in 1989, one of the world's most famous senior citizens, actor-comedian George 
Burns, was invited to attend. His written reply, which is displayed at the 
center, politely declined the invitation due to a scheduling conflict. Burns 
was already booked at an Atlantic City casino. 
</P>
<P>
 "And even though I have played 'God' in three movies," Burns wrote, "I cannot 
manage to be in two places at one time." ALAN EYERLY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; MALE FIRE VICTIMS TO GET SUPPORT GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new support group is being formed to help men who lost homes in the October 
fire and are feeling overwhelmed at the prospect of rebuilding their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's just a little more difficult for men to reach out and access any 
mental health services," said David Bishop, an outreach supervisor for Laguna 
Cares, which is forming the group. 
</P>
<P>
 Some men have trouble expressing their feelings within their own families, he 
said, and the support group will give them a chance to shed "the 
pillar-of-strength image" and speak openly with other men. 
</P>
<P>
 "Men can talk to men about things in a similar fashion," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Cares is an offshoot of the Laguna Beach Community Clinic formed to 
help meet the psychological needs of fire victims. 
</P>
<P>
 The group is also seeking supplies for their art therapy sessions. Items 
needed include art portfolios, plexiglass, legal- and letter-size typing paper, 
colored felt-tipped pens, packaging tape and slide and overhead projectors. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information about the men's group or women's groups or to donate 
supplies, call (714) 376-2141. LESLIE EARNEST

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; SCHOOL DRESS CODE GAINING ACCEPTANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF BEAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Traditional school-year classes have not started yet, but some parents are 
already calling the Capistrano Unified School District with questions about 
what students will be forbidden to wear. 
</P>
<P>
 District spokeswoman Jacqueline Price said about 10 parents have telephoned in 
the past week to check what's acceptable apparel and what's not. 
</P>
<P>
 Price said the inquiries are an encouraging sign that parents -- and students 
-- are becoming accustomed to the district's dress code, passed by trustees in 
July 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, a copy of the "Student Dress and Grooming Standards" was mailed 
to each of the 23,000 homes served by the district. The district has 32,000 
students. A copy of the code was also sent to area retailers who carry clothing 
popular to teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's code forbids revealing clothes, "gang-related" apparel, any 
clothing that is considered unsafe, and that which has offensive or obscene 
symbols.JEFF BEAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT; ELECTION MONTH TO SHIFT TO NOVEMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF BEAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council agreed last week to permanently shift the city's election to 
November to coincide with state's general election. 
</P>
<P>
 The move means that the next city election would be held in November, 1996, 
and then every two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The switch from city elections in June that corresponded with the state 
primary will add five months to each council member's four-year term, according 
to City Clerk Sharon L. Waits. 
</P>
<P>
 The change was recommended by the city attorney in part because of low voter 
turnout in June elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Point was the only South County city that didn't hold its election in 
November, Waits said. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council is scheduled to vote Aug. 9 on an ordinance that spells out 
the switch to November elections. JEFF BEAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; ROOFING FAIR WILL FOCUS ON FIRE SAFETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city will hold a roofing safety fair this weekend in hopes of convincing 
residents to cover their homes with fire-resistant materials. 
</P>
<P>
 The fair, scheduled for Saturday and Sunday at Civic Center Plaza, will bring 
together more than 60 manufacturers, distributors and sellers of 
non-combustible roofing materials. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1993 city study found that 45% of Irvine homes are topped by wood shake 
roofs, which city officials consider a fire hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 About 17% of residences have wood shakes that have been treated with a 
fire-retardant coating. 
</P>
<P>
 About 38% of homes use such non-combustible roofing materials as tile, the 
study found. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the wood shake roofs are found in Irvine's older villages, such as 
Woodbridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Newer developments such as Westpark use terra-cotta tile roofing. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the fair is a good place for residents to learn about the 
different types of roofing materials available and to find out the costs of 
re-roofing. 
</P>
<P>
 Citycode enforcement officials will also be on hand to discuss city ordinances 
and dispense fire safety tips. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of fire safety took on new urgency last year after the Laguna Beach 
firestorm, which burned about 400 homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire briefly threatened the Turtle Rock area, prompting evacuations. 
</P>
<P>
 No homes in Irvine were burned. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials said the potential for a serious fire exists, especially in 
neighborhoods with untreated wood roofs. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has asked homeowners associations across Irvine to be cooperative if 
residents seek to remove their wood roofs and replace them with treated 
coverings. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; COUNCILMAN WANTS PENSION TAX ENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A charter amendment that would eliminate a tax funding city employees' 
retirement costs is expected to be among items the City Council will consider 
at tonight's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman David Sullivan plans to ask his colleagues to place the issue on 
the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just proposing that the citizens should have a right to vote on it," 
Sullivan said, charging that the retirement tax is "outrageous." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Administrator Robert Franz said that elimination of the tax would 
mean a $6.3-million loss to the city's general fund budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has been collecting the tax since 1966. It appears on property tax 
bills as "Huntington Beach city debt." 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach is the only city in Orange County where a property tax is 
used for retirement purposes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In other business, the council is expected to discuss in closed session the 
city's legal options in challenging the state's Public Employees' Retirement 
System, which is forcing the city to pay for retired employees who inflated 
their pensions through spiking. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiking is the practice of employees' raising their salary in their final year 
of work by forgoing vacation days, car allowances and other benefits and 
instead receiving the value of the benefits in direct wages, upon which their 
pension is based. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the council voted to eliminate its role in spiking. Nevertheless, 
the state pension agency told the city it is still obligated for past spiking 
costs. The city's total cost for pension-spiking is estimated at $13 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In another item on the agenda, the council, acting as the Redevelopment 
Agency, will consider eminent-domain taking of property downtown in the 
Main-Pier redevelopment area. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a staff report, the agency's final offer of $1,365,500 to buy 
private property within the redevelopment area, known as Third Block West, has 
been rejected by the owners. The project area is bounded by Main Street, Olive 
Avenue, 5th Street and Orange Avenue. Subterranean parking, a two-story retail 
and office structure and 68 condominiums are proposed there.  
</P>
<P>
 Other public hearings scheduled include: 
</P>
<P>
 * An appeal filed by Councilman Ralph Bauer of the Planning Commission's 
denial of a special permit for an indoor swap meet within a 212,500-square-foot 
industrial building, 5555 McFadden Ave. at Graham Street. 
</P>
<P>
 * A proposed business license ordinance that would set fees for indoor and 
outdoor swap meets, special events and charitable events. If approved, the 
estimated increase in revenue would be $200,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will also consider a new contract agreement with the Municipal 
Employees Assn., the city's largest bargaining group, which represents some 500 
workers. The contract offers no salary increases and would eliminate pension 
spiking as of Jan. 31, 1994.

</P>
<P>
 Thousands are expected at the 26th annual powwow sponsored by the Southern

</P>
<P>
 About one-fifth of them live in Orange County.

 The Southern California Indian Center, which has an office in Garden Grove, 
provides job training, educational assistance and social services to the Native 
American community. 
</P>

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / NORTHWEST: BUENA PARK; PLANNING BOARD CUT STIRS ANGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jack and Tricia Mauller have sat through countless meetings as volunteer 
commissioners, and now they feel betrayed by their city. 
</P>
<P>
 After weeks of debate, the City Council has decided to reduce the Planning 
Commission from seven to five members, with no alternate position. Jack 
Mauller, as the most junior commissioner, was the odd man out. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said they have wanted to streamline the commission for years. 
When Commissioner Brenda Miller resigned in June, council members said, they 
decided to accomplish a longstanding goal of streamlining the panel. They 
wanted to reduce the panel to five members because a six-member commission 
could lead to deadlock votes. They also considered creating an alternate 
position, largely so they would not have to fire Mauller, but decided that 
would be too cumbersome. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Jack Mauller nor Tricia Mauller, who serves on the city 
Beautification/Environmental Committee, is buying that logic. They charge that 
council members wanted to retaliate against the Planning Commission because it 
refused to back the council's controversial decision to close the city's Fire 
Department and contract with the county for services. 
</P>
<P>
 To back up her husband, Mauller resigned from the Beautification/Environmental 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be free to speak out against the things that I feel are wrong -- 
the lies, the back-room politics and the hidden agendas," she said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel that the council is doing enormous damage to the volunteer spirit of 
Buena Park," Jack Mauller said in a statement. "They did not want to listen to 
the volunteer leaders of the community on the fire issue and several have had a 
get-even attitude since then." 
</P>
<P>
 Council members misled them, they charge, by saying that Mauller could stay as 
an alternate until November. Two commissioners are running for City Council and 
a victory by either would leave a seat open. 
</P>
<P>
 That idea was discarded in the study session because the council feared that 
it might be left with a six-member commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Rhonda J. McCune summed up the feelings of her colleagues about 
the Maullers' charge: "I want to say unequivocally, categorically, absolutely 
untrue," she said. She noted that the two commissioners they reappointed -- 
Chairman Larry T. Wieck and Robert J. Niccum -- also opposed the fire services 
transfer. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Arthur C. Brown said it was a coincidence that the decision about 
streamlining the commission came so soon after the fire issue was settled. 
Brown said it is unfortunate that there is an appearance that "the fire issue 
will color every aspect of the city government." LESLEY WRIGHT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / NORTHWEST: BREA; COUPLE ARRESTED AFTER BRIEF CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man and woman were arrested after leading police on a brief, one-mile chase 
that ended when their vehicle ran a red light and struck another car, police 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Kerry McClure, 23, of Anaheim and Linda Sue Zeski, 32, of Lake Havasu, 
Ariz., were treated at Western Medical Center-Anaheim for injuries suffered in 
the accident about 9:15 p.m. Saturday.Both were then booked at the hospital's 
jail ward, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 McClure was arrested on suspicion of felony evading police. Zeski was arrested 
on suspicion of check forgery and possession of stolen property, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 While fleeing, McClure and Zeski were in a car that ran a red light and then 
struck another car at Imperial Highway and Harbor Boulevard. The driver of the 
second car, Mill Alexander Conroy, 41, and Conroy's passenger, Theresa Lynnelle 
Freeman, 35, both of Rowland Heights, were treated at and released from St. 
Jude Medical Center in Fullerton, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 A man and a woman tried to pass a stolen check about 9 p.m. Saturday at 
Marshall's Department Store, 945 E. Birch St., police were told. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were called to the store, but before they arrived, the couple left the 
store and drove away on Imperial Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, a car driven by McClure slowed, but then accelerated rapidly along 
Imperial, where it ran a red light at Harbor Boulevard and struck Conroy's car, 
police said.

<P>
 The American Red Cross is seeking volunteers, especially those with bilingual 
skills, for work at blood donation centers countywide, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 While concerned people often flood the organization with calls offering 
assistance during disasters, help is scarce when the crisis is past, Judy 
Iannaccone said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said volunteers are always needed to work as receptionists and as blood 
donor assistants.

TOURIST KILLED WALKING ACROSS FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A tourist from Coventry, England, who wandered onto the Costa Mesa Freeway 
early Sunday was struck by a car and killed, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Clive Straiton, 38, was pronounced dead at Hoag Memorial Hospital 
Presbyterian about 1 a.m., according to a statement issued by Sgt. D. Walker. 
The driver, an 18-year-old Fountain Valley man, was not cited, Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver told police he was traveling south on the freeway in the slow lane, 
just north of 19th Street, when the headlights of his car revealed Straiton 
crossing the highway, Walker said. The driver tried to stop but hit Straiton. 
</P>
<P>
 Police investigators said the driver apparently was not intoxicated.  
</P>
<P>
 The incident remains under investigation, Walker said.

40,000 MELLOW FANS VIEW FINALE OF OP SURF CHAMPIONSHIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeffrey Pinchuk, 24, came from Venice Beach to enjoy the ocean air and watch 
the women. 
</P>
<P>
 Katy Vakili, 17, came from Irvine to catch some rays while "looking at the 
guys." 
</P>
<P>
 And Richard Doummar, 38, traveled all the way from Virginia Beach, Va., to 
take the whole scene in as a slice of life in Southern California, where 
surfers tackle the big ones while crowd members work on their tans. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot more radical than Virginia," Doummar said. "The people are a lot 
more carefree. It definitely fits the image." 
</P>
<P>
 The three were among the estimated 40,000 who turned out Sunday for the final 
day of the 13th annual Ocean Pacific Pro Surfing Championship just south of the 
Huntington Beach Pier. The event dovetails with the U.S. Open of Surfing, which 
begins at the same location on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean Pacific organizers, who have worked hard in recent years to eliminate 
the surfing championship's "beach party" image, characterize it as a major 
athletic event. And, indeed, much of Sunday's polite and well-mannered crowd 
seemed to consist of serious surfing aficionados. 
</P>
<P>
 But the event has also taken on a certain quintessential Surf City quality, 
replete with skimpy swimsuits and the smell of suntan lotion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's synonymous with the Southern California lifestyle," said Mike 
Kingsbury, Op spokesman. "You have fashion, music, surfing and environment all 
in one place. These are things that are important to surfers, and surfers tend 
to be trendsetters." 
</P>
<P>
 This year for the first time, Op officials had decided to charge $5 for 
seating in a series of bleachers set up along the beach and on the pier. Most 
of the audience opted for the free sand, however, leaving huge gaps in the 
stands. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, though, the crowd remained mellow as such favorites as 
Kelly Slater and Rob Machado battled the waves for dominance over nature and 
each other.

RIDING FOR REDEMPTION; THE CONNA FAMILY SET OUT TO CROSS THE COUNTRY BY BIKE, 
RETRACING THEIR GRANDFATHER'S TREK 71 YEARS AGO. THEY BRAVED ILLNESS AND 
SEARING MOJAVE HEAT. ALL IN HOPE OF A SIGN OF LOVE FROM A DYING MAN.

<P>
 The battered and dusty mountain bike leaned against the wall of a roadside 
market, looking as forlorn as the building that supported it. 
</P>
<P>
 Few motorists usually stop at the Afton Road exit of Interstate 15 between Las 
Vegas and Barstow. But on this 100-degree Tuesday in July, business was brisk 
as hot, tired gamblers returning to Southern California pushed through the 
doors in a steady stream. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, David Conna, 32, paced in his cycling togs, sweating and appearing on 
the verge of collapse. At a nearby table, his 22-year-old sister, Sheri, stared 
vacantly, her eyes puffy from two days of crying. Their mother, Mary Lou, 61, 
appeared to be sleepwalking as she returned to the table with a soft drink for 
her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 This bedraggled clan from Massachusetts was winding up a tortuous two-month 
journey that was part bicycle excursion, part quest for intergenerational 
redemption, part test of the human spirit. The route mimicked one pedaled 71 
years earlier by a stubborn young Easterner -- the now-infirm family patriarch 
whose approval they are seeking. 
</P>
<P>
 "My grandfather rode his bicycle from Philadelphia to Los Angeles in 1923," 
Conna explained. "It was a single-speed bike called an Arrow. We're following 
his same route." 
</P>
<P>
 He went to the car, rummaged through the piles of clothing, food and empty 
soda cans and retrieved a copy of a thin, soft-covered book titled, "Frisco or 
Bust -- Frank P. Kolbe on the Ride of his Life." 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the front cover, a photograph depicts his grandfather, Frank Kolbe, 
holding the sweeping handlebars of his bicycle, which he nicknamed "Black 
Beauty." His young face is a mask of fierce determination. 
</P>
<P>
 Kolbe, 91, lives in Doylestown, Pa., outside Philadelphia. He is blind from 
the effects of glaucoma. Arthritis and an untreated back injury caused by a 
traffic accident cost him the use of his legs. He has been bedridden for more 
than two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Conna, an energy conservation consultant from Weston, Mass., nodded toward his 
family's table: "Mom rode her bike with us from Westboro (Mass.) to 
Philadelphia, but she could only do about 40 or 50 miles a day. Now she's 
driving that green Subaru out there. She keeps us in food and water." 
</P>
<P>
 And his sister? 
</P>
<P>
 "Sheri got real, real sick outside Las Vegas," he said. "It's been one 
incredibly long trip, and the last couple of days have been real, real tough." 
</P>
<P>
 The journey began, Conna said, with very little preparation. Neither he nor 
his sister had been on an extended bicycle trip; his mother hadn't been on a 
bicycle for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, when Mary Lou and her children began making plans to duplicate her 
father's bicycle adventure, she went to tell him the news. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad has been praying to die for I don't know how long," she said. "When 
the kids told them about their trip, he said to them, 'Well, I'm going to try 
to stay alive until you return.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a distant character, and hard to get close to," David said. "He doesn't 
even know our names. He refers to Sheri and me as, 'that boy' and 'that girl.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm probably as close to Dad as any of my brothers or sisters," Mary Lou 
said, "and I don't think I really know him, either. I don't think anybody 
does." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the family members weren't sure what drove them to attempt to 
duplicate Kolbe's feat and spent the next three days, in roadside restaurants 
and campsites in the Mojave Desert, discussing it. After consulting with other 
family members, they reached a consensus: The arduous trip was undertaken not 
as a tribute to Kolbe, but to make some kind of connection to him -- a 
last-ditch effort to win his approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a tough thing to do," said Bill Kolbe, a Garret, Md., high school 
English teacher, one of Frank Kolbe's six children and the unofficial family 
historian. "He's not a guy you go and talk to." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Kolbe's bid for approval came when he decided to apply his writing skills 
to a huge crate of letters and newspaper articles about his father's bicycle 
journey. After three years of effort, he presented the finished product to his 
father -- the same booklet the Connas used as their trip guide. 
</P>
<P>
 "His first comment was, it wasn't thick enough," Bill Kolbe recalled. But he 
read the narrative to his now-blind father, and the old man said he could see 
his exploits in his son's words. "That made me feel good, and that was all I 
could ask for." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin Pierce Kolbe was born in 1903, the son of a Presbyterian circuit 
preacher. His father, Frank Kolbe Sr., was one of four brothers who emigrated 
from Prussia in the late 1800s. Before long, the Kolbe brothers would own large 
chunks of real estate in the business district of Doylestown. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks after Frank Jr. was born, his father died while visiting Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 As a child, Frank was a loner, and one of his few friends was another loner: 
James Michener, an orphan who lived at the county poorhouse nearby. Even after 
Michener became one of America's most popular authors, he continued to visit 
the Kolbe home, Bill Kolbe said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Frank turned 20, he had an urge to travel. He took out a classified ad in 
the Bucks County Daily News announcing his intention to cross the United States 
by bicycle. He finally raised enough money to buy a bicycle and head out of 
town with $8 in his pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 During the two-month trip, he watched as President Warren G. Harding's funeral 
train passed by on its way to Harding's Marion, Ohio, home. Along the way to 
California, he sold postcards at county fairs and did odd jobs. He also mailed 
a steady stream of reports back to the Bucks County newspaper, which published 
his accounts. These dispatches formed the basis for the book assembled years 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 At Salt Lake City, despite his "Frisco or bust" declaration, Kolbe veered 
south, deciding he would brave the Nevada desert to cut hundreds of miles from 
his route to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 He had lost his canteen while traveling through Pennsylvania and, for some 
unaccountable reason, never replaced it. With no water supply in the desert, he 
wrote, he took to flagging down passing trucks to beg drinks of water out of 
the canvas bags drivers carried to refill their radiators. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his precarious circumstance, he adamantly refused other forms of help 
from passing motorists. In his journal he expressed his contempt in florid 
prose for passing motorists who would try to help him -- people he described as 
"pale tempters who wear the false face of prudent counselors whispering in my 
ear to quit." 
</P>
<P>
 After arriving in Los Angeles, Kolbe was interviewed by a local newspaper, saw 
the sights and went to the beach, where he poured out a jar of sand he brought 
with him from the beaches of the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
 After hitchhiking back to Doylestown, he taught school and started a furniture 
business. His enterprises were wiped out three times by legal problems, fire 
and the Great Depression. But Kolbe takes pride in the fact that no creditor 
ever lost a dime and that his family still operates a successful chain of 
specialty furniture stores in eastern Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
 He now lives in a modest three-bedroom, 40-year-old ranch house where nurses 
attend to his every need. Although his mind wanders, he is still lucid and 
spends much of his waking time listening to radio evangelists and Philadelphia 
Phillies baseball games. It's difficult, his son said, to find nurses willing 
to put with his demands. 
</P>
<P>
 "He may be blind and flat on his back," Bill said, "but he still wants to be 
in control." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Lou's husband, Ted, a child psychiatrist, could not join the ride because 
of sore knee ligaments, and he warned his wife about the dangers of such a 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "But she was determined to do it," Ted said. "I told Mary Lou I was surprised 
to see her being this unreasonable." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm stubborn, Ted," Mary Lou responded. "Stubborn is a Kolbe family trait." 
</P>
<P>
 Ted relented and became a reluctant supporter of the venture. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Mary Lou hoped to make the entire cross-country trip on her bicycle. 
She changed her mind near the end of the 375-mile ride from Massachusetts to 
her father's home. She crashed her bike trying to keep up with her children. 
Aching and bruised, she decided to drive the support car instead. 
</P>
<P>
 She also found herself mediating frequent fights between her children, who 
quickly came to realize that they hardly knew each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "David's 10 years older than me, so when I was little, he was already out of 
the house," Sheri said. "We were never in a situation where we had to deal with 
each other day in and day out." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The going got particularly rough in southern Wyoming, where they had to battle 
45 m.p.h. head winds. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 The relentless heat south of Las Vegas made Sheri feel as if she were trapped 
inside a convection oven, drawing the water from her body faster than she could 
drink it down. It hurt to breathe. 
</P>
<P>
 "A policeman pulled over and he told us we were crazy and it was 112 (degrees) 
in Las Vegas and the road heats up to 150 to 175," Sheri said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the warning, she cycled another 20 miles. At the California border, 
her mother helped her into a motel room and asked the front desk for medical 
help. Two emergency medical technicians came to the room and promptly ordered 
Sheri to bed. 
</P>
<P>
 For Sheri, the cycling was over. "The EMTs highly suggested I (not) get on the 
bike and ride in the desert again. Of course, when I was so sick, I was like, 
'I'll do anything you say, I don't care!' " 
</P>
<P>
 So while her brother pedaled on and her mother drove, Sheri curled up on the 
front seat of the car and cried. 
</P>
<P>
 With the desert winds too strong to allow them to pitch a tent, the family 
slept on the ground that night. The following day, the exhausted family tried 
to force down food at a coffee shop in Barstow. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know," Mary Lou told her son, "We could throw your bike on the back of 
the car and we could be in L.A. in two hours." 
</P>
<P>
 "Damn it all," David shouted, "I don't need you telling me that! I need you 
giving me support!" 
</P>
<P>
 After more mind-numbing travel and a restless night in a motel, Conna was at 
the Cajon Summit on Interstate 15. Below him lay San Bernardino and miles of 
cool, green citrus groves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just look at this!" he shouted into a tape recorder strapped to his 
handlebars. "I'm psyched! I'm psyched!" 
</P>
<P>
 He shot down the 12-mile grade at 45 m.p.h. and reached his brother's house in 
Van Nuys by mid-afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 After a day's rest, he made the final ride from the San Fernando Valley to the 
ocean. He crossed the stream of traffic on Pacific Coast Highway and dropped 
his bicycle in the sands of Topanga Beach State Park. 
</P>
<P>
 For a few minutes, he watched the waves. While his father, who had flown out 
from Massachusetts, and mother looked on, he walked down the beach a bit, made 
a sharp right turn and wordlessly walked into the water, fully clothed. He 
emerged, a few minutes later, shook salt water from his beard and smiled. 
</P>
<P>
 After 3,650 miles on a bicycle and 61 nights sleeping in campgrounds, youth 
hostels and cheap motels, there was nothing to say. 
</P>
<P>
 The physical part of the journey was over. 
</P>
<P>
 But the journey's emotional conclusion is yet to come. 
</P>
<P>
 In a few weeks, they plan to visit Frank Kolbe in Doylestown. Since the death 
of his wife last year, Frank has mellowed somewhat, they say. In fact, just a 
few months ago, Frank told his son Bill for the first time that he loved him. 
</P>
<P>
 The Conna family is prepared to take whatever comes. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Lou, who kept her father posted on the progress of the journey by 
telephone, isn't expecting any outpouring of emotion from him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kinda think he wants to talk to the kids, say his goodbys and let loose," 
she said. "I'll be surprised if he lasts another year." 
</P>
<P>
 David plans to give his grandfather a handful of sand he scooped up from 
Topanga Beach to symbolically replace the sand from the New Jersey shore that 
Kolbe carried with him during his own cycle odyssey.  
</P>
<P>
 "I hope maybe he'll say he's proud of me," David said, "but I don't expect any 
of that to happen. It'll just be neat to stand there and say I did it."

A NEW LESSON IN SCHOOLS: SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS UNACCEPTABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KRISTINA SAUERWEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 One more vulgarity, Elizabeth decided one day in April, 1992, and her right 
leg would crunch his crotch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whore," the teen-age boy yelled. Then he grabbed Elizabeth's behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Thwack.  
</P>
<P>
 He grimaced and groaned. And he never harassed her again. 
</P>
<P>
 From other boys, though, Elizabeth said she continued to endure leering and 
jeering, grabbing and jabbing, taunting and haunting. In her thoughts and 
dreams, their words reverberated: whore, bitch, slut, tramp.  
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'This is what it's like to be female.' I didn't like it," said 
Elizabeth, 15, claiming she suffered peer sexual harassment at Los Altos 
Intermediate School in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 In tears, Elizabeth told her mother, Diana, who talked to administrators. They 
investigated and ultimately enacted new anti-harassment policies, but Elizabeth 
and Diana, still not satisfied, filed a complaint in December, 1992, with the 
U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency investigated their claim under Title IX, the law designed to 
guarantee students an education free of discrimination, but concluded that the 
district had taken "appropriate action" to end the harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, "I didn't feel too safe," Elizabeth said. Her mother said the 
harassment eventually stopped, but she has encouraged her daughter, who soon 
will begin 10th grade at Adolfo Camarillo High School, to use force should it 
resume, "until, finally, no one bothers her anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to look out for myself," Elizabeth said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of new laws and heightened public awareness, parents have flooded 
state and federal agencies with complaints or inquiries about peer sexual 
harassment, and some have filed lawsuits; school officials hoping to forestall 
lawsuits are scrambling to develop policies and curriculum, and some students 
are publicly decrying behavior once dismissed as schoolyard teasing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Peer sexual harassment" is defined by attorney Jeanette Lim, director of 
policy and programs for the federal Office for Civil Rights, as: "Behavior so 
severe, pervasive and persistent that it creates a hostile environment for the 
student. It is usually of a sexual nature." 
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago, experts say, relatively few Americans realized that students 
were capable of such behavior, or that it even constituted harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the 1991 Hill-Thomas hearings, cases began to surface in which 
students were paid damages from districts that had failed to stop peer 
harassment. A 1993 study conducted by the American Assn. of University Women 
found that four out of five teen-agers had suffered some form of sexual 
harassment in school. 
</P>
<P>
 That same year, California joined a handful of other states in enacting laws 
targeting peer sexual harassment -- one requiring public schools to develop and 
distribute student policies; the other permitting administrators to expel 
harassers in grades 4 through 12. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Education's civil rights office has tracked what spokesman 
Rodger Murphey dubbed "a growth industry": 143 student complaints of sexual 
harassment in elementary and secondary schools during the 1992-93 academic year 
compared with only 15 in 1987-88. Murphey said that while some of these cases 
involve teachers, "a good number" are peer cases, although specific breakdowns 
are not tabulated. 
</P>
<P>
 The new laws have kept officials hopping at the state Department of Education. 
From July, 1993, through June of this year, the department had received 425 
phoned, written, faxed or personal inquiries, about one-third of which have 
dealt with peer sexual harassment, said Barny Schur, gender-equity consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue is really taking off," Schur said. "Many used to excuse this 
behavior as boys will be boys. It is now being perceived as unacceptable sexual 
harassment." 
</P>
<P>
 Schur added that it is difficult to determine a total number of state cases 
because most are resolved at the school level. Many Southern California 
districts say they haven't begun tracking the number of reported incidents; 
they've been too busy tuning and touting their new sexual harassment policies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Unified School District, for example, hopes to start 
documenting the number of peer sexual harassment cases next year, said Deanne 
Neiman, director of affirmative action. It became one of the first districts in 
the state to acknowledge the problem when, in May, 1992, it distributed 
anti-sexual harassment booklets in high schools. Now the 650,000-student 
district wants to introduce curriculum in the elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Schur lauds the LAUSD, saying that in the past two years, he has not received 
a single inquiry about peer sexual harassment out of the nation's 
second-largest school district. He compared that to the four cases he has heard 
about from Modesto-area school districts (with only about 30,000 students). 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In May, 1993, Jessica Hasenbank, 10, cowered in fear as she watched six boys 
slam two of her girlfriends onto the ground, stuff grass in their mouths to 
prevent screams, spew lewd remarks and try to strip them. 
</P>
<P>
 She knew how it felt, her father alleged. Jessica spent much of her time at 
Fairview Elementary School dodging -- and often enduring -- boys who 
consistently spit on girls, touched their genitals, screamed obscenities, 
locked them in chokeholds, kissed them, pinched their behinds and pinned them 
to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 So Jim Hasenbank and his wife, Leighann, filed an Office for Civil Rights 
complaint against the Modesto City School District. While many in the community 
dismissed the case by saying that "boys will be boys," the agency ruled in 
December that the district failed to take "timely and appropriate action" to 
stop the behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "The district did the best it could," said spokeswoman Carol Quinlan, adding 
that it has since developed a sexual harassment policy. "It's a total learning 
situation for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 The incident illustrates the confusion adults and children struggle with when 
determining if a behavior is harassment or harmless -- albeit annoying -- 
teasing. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1992 study by Wellesley College's Center for Research on Women and the NOW 
Legal Defense and Education Fund found that almost 40% of the 4,200 girls 
surveyed indicated that they encountered daily sexual harassment at school. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of that was mild, however, said Nan D. Stein, a Wellesley researcher who 
led the study. For instance, Stein explained, girls endured pats and pinches 
instead of being pinned against a wall and stripped naked. Often girls -- and 
girls suffer more than boys -- dismiss the non-blatant acts because they're 
either nervous about making a big deal or unsure if it's sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Five years ago, Lim, the civil rights official, only heard about teen boys 
sexually harassing teen girls. But no more. 
</P>
<P>
 She recalled the 1992 case in which Cheltzie Hentz, then 7, became the first 
student in the nation to formally accuse other elementary students of sexual 
harassment. In April, 1993, the civil rights panel ruled against the Eden 
Prairie School District in suburban Minneapolis, which led to sexual-harassment 
curriculum being taught in Minnesota elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quite frankly, (the agency) was really, really surprised that this could 
happen in elementary schools," Lim said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Nazar acknowledges the difficulty in determining when the line has been 
crossed. "I see girls put down a lot," said Nazar, who teaches at Wilson High 
School in Long Beach. Two years ago, she taught at Lakewood High, home of the 
sex-for-points Spur Posse. "I see a lot of sex play in the hallways. But the 
girls and boys do it to each other. Back and forth, back and forth." 
</P>
<P>
 An elementary-school teacher in Torrance thinks peer sexual harassment is only 
an issue among a few high school delinquents. "Boys always tease cute girls and 
call them names," she said, asking not to be identified. "That's not sexual 
harassment. It's called growing up. (Students) are too young to (sexually 
harass)." 
</P>
<P>
 Louise Brawdy scoffs at the term "too young." She heard it during the four 
years she publicly denounced the Petaluma City School District for failing to 
stop students from harassing her daughter, Tawnya. (In 1992, Tawnya, now 21, 
received $20,000 from the district in an out-of-court settlement). 
</P>
<P>
 Brawdy said parents and students have a responsibility to stop peer sexual 
harassment, and in 1992 she co-founded Parents for Title IX, an 
education-advocacy group that now has more than 500 members. In California, she 
says, education is especially crucial because "everyone seems confused about 
harassment (despite) the new laws." 
</P>
<P>
 A lack of mandatory sexual harassment education is the main flaw of the laws, 
said State Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara), who wrote the 
suspension-expulsion legislation. He wanted the law to require all school staff 
and students to receive sexual harassment sensitivity training, but said he 
took "what I could get." State budget problems make additional sexual 
harassment laws unlikely in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the fall of 1990, a rumor spread through Petaluma's Kenilworth Junior High 
School about a 7th-grade girl who had "sex with a hot dog." Graffiti on the 
bathroom walls labeled her "hot dog bitch." Girls threatened to beat her. One 
even slapped her. Two students wondered out loud if she preferred them "frozen 
or cooked." 
</P>
<P>
 In a federal lawsuit that details these incidents, the girl claims that 
officials at the school -- part of the same district that paid the settlement 
to Tawnya Brawdy -- failed to stop the harassment for 2 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager's attorneys say she suffered mental health problems, such as 
fear, depression, anxieties and an inability to function in social situations. 
In Jane Doe vs. Petaluma City School District, the girl, now 16, is seeking $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 The Doe case, scheduled to go to trial in January, will help clarify the 
liability of schools nationwide, agreed Petaluma Supt. Chuck Cadman and one of 
Doe's attorneys, Maria Blanco, of Equal Rights Advocates in San Francisco, a 
nonprofit law firm specializing in gender discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Cadman is looking to Doe for guidance. "My memories of junior high was that 
there were lots of behaviors some might label as 'boys will be boys,' " he 
said. "In the last few years, we've learned that kind of behavior is not OK. So 
schools are adjusting." 
</P>
<P>
 Cadman said that his district's sexual harassment policies went "above and 
beyond" what the law required and suggests that such efforts should not be 
punished with a costly lawsuit. "I'm hoping the courts will clear up what 
(behavior) is and is not OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Blanco wants the Doe case to slap districts with reality. "The school didn't 
protect Jane Doe, and (a district) must always protect its students," she said. 
"Or else they should pay." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the outcome, educators and legal experts expect more peer sexual 
harassment lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Schur, of the state Department of Education, said parents incorrectly assume 
schools have money for lawsuits. He encourages parents of victims to sue 
parents of perpetrators -- an action covered under state civil and education 
codes. "Parents are responsible for their children's behavior, so they should 
be liable. But schools are the ones taking the blame."

COMMITMENTS; WITH A WINK AND A SMILE, FLIRTING'S BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA BRONSON GRAY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eye contact. The quick quip. A double-entendre. A well-placed compliment. A 
funny retort. They're all part of flirting, which is making a comeback after a 
couple of bumpy decades, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 The '70s and '80s were a bad era for the art of flirting. Psychologists say 
that because social and sexual rules were looser, there was less of a need to 
meet others slowly and carefully. But now people are more interested in 
approaching relationships with caution, testing the waters before diving in. 
</P>
<P>
 And flirting isn't just for those looking for love. Marty Westerman, author of 
"How to Flirt" (Price Stern Sloan, 1992), says flirting reflects an openness 
and a playfulness that is commonly seen among children, spouses, seniors and 
strangers, as well as singles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Flirting is the art of being disarming, of being friendly, honest and open," 
Westerman says. "Flirting is for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Odegaard Turner, 40, a self-employed health care consultant in Thousand 
Oaks, says she flirts all the time. "I start by making eye contact; I can 
usually tell by looking at the other person if that elusive chemistry is there. 
Then I make a one-line comment, or answer a question with a double-edged 
meaning. If he is a flirt, he will respond in kind," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner, married with two children, sees her flirting as a harmless form of 
social banter. "It's fun and it's safe; you don't die of flirting. It's a game 
with the prize being the interaction itself," she says, adding that her husband 
doesn't mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerald Jellison, professor of social psychology at USC, sees flirting as an 
invitation to come closer. "We spend a lot of our lives letting people know 
they can't approach us; flirting serves as a signal, a request," he says. "It 
becomes a playful activity, a way to have fun, give flattery, tease." 
</P>
<P>
 What we call flirting may be a way of dealing with ambient sexual tension 
without taking it further. The ambiguity that is part of flirtation is part of 
what makes it interesting, Jellison says. The suggestions are so subtle that 
they can be either ignored or enhanced, depending on how things transpire. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people flirt by paying a great deal of attention to someone, showing 
intense concentration, offering slight smiles, and nodding their heads in 
agreement, says Jellison, who admits to engaging in that form of flirting. 
"It's a way of saying, 'I'm interested in more,' " he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Westerman says flirting is more common is societies with strict and clear 
social mores -- perhaps because the risk of having an overture taken too far is 
typically reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 For some, flirting is not so much about connecting with others as it is about 
building themselves up. Deborah Hendlin, a clinical psychologist in private 
practice in Irvine, says many find flirting increases their sense of 
attractiveness and their ego strength.  
</P>
<P>
 Some people, however, take flirting to an extreme, which can be a sign of 
deep-seated insecurity and a persistent need to affirm themselves or mask their 
sense of inadequacy, Hendlin says. Author Westerman claims such people are easy 
to spot: "You know when someone's working too hard at it." 
</P>
<P>
 For some, flirting is effortless and unconscious, but for others, it is an art 
they have to struggle to learn. One divorced man who is in therapy with Hendlin 
is easily discouraged about his attempts to connect with people. He reports 
regularly to Hendlin about how the flirtee he approached failed to respond with 
even a laugh or a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Flirting is not just for the young. Hendlin says seniors are usually very good 
at flirting, perhaps because they have attained a level of comfort with 
themselves and some of the normal sexual protectiveness of youth is down. 
</P>
<P>
 For some, the risks of flirting outweigh any potential pay-back. In an age in 
which sexual harassment is increasingly an issue in the workplace, Westerman 
warns office flirts to limit themselves to people they know well and feel 
comfortable with. He also cautions them to stop making flirtatious comments if 
they are not reciprocated and to avoid touching others without their 
permission. 
</P>
<P>
 Theresa Halzle, an Agoura-based free-lance photographer, says she considers 
herself chatty and outgoing, but says she is very careful not to flirt, 
especially in work situations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think flirting has to do with sex, and I'd rather be unencumbered," she 
says. "I think of flirting as high school girls with their hair swinging, or 
going up to a guy at a bar, and saying 'Hi,' while arching your back ever so 
subtly. When others flirt with me, I laugh -- without trying to make them feel 
embarrassed -- and always make sure I insert a positive comment about my 
husband and children." 
</P>
<P>
 Turner -- the frequent flirter -- has experienced the downside of 
over-flirting. At a party, she says, a concerned spouse joined the discussion 
and shot a few pointed comments at Turner and took her husband quickly from the 
scene. She has also had to stop bantering to make the point that she was not 
interested in pursuing the relationship to a more intimate level.  
</P>
<P>
 But more typically, Turner knows which people in her work and social circles 
are comfortable with flirting, and she sticks to them, she says. And her 
husband "flirts, too, but more subtly," Turner adds. Sometimes even with her. 
</P>
<P>
 Hendlin says flirting doesn't have to stop when you're married. 
</P>
<P>
 "The looking, talking to them in a certain way, smiling, the banter and 'in' 
jokes" -- this is the kind of flirting that makes marriage more fun and 
exciting, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Flirting within a marriage can be a way of saying we have a secret 
relationship," Jellison says. "In social settings, when (you) are separated 
from each other across a room, you can send a special smile that says, 'I can't 
wait until we're alone together.' "

COMMITMENTS; BUCKING TRADITION; WHY NOT HAVE A 'MAN OF HONOR' OR A 'BEST 
PERSON'? MORE COUPLES ARE ENLISTING FRIENDS OF THE OPPOSITE SEX FOR THEIR 
UNCONVENTIONAL WEDDING CEREMONIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Whenever she fantasized about her storybook wedding, Mimi Dangtu never 
imagined her best friend Mike Tuchin at her side. She does, after all, have two 
beautiful sisters. 
</P>
<P>
 But as her July 10 wedding to Jim Johnson grew closer, Dangtu didn't want to 
have to choose between her sisters for a maid of honor, and there wasn't really 
a place for Tuchin in the wedding party. 
</P>
<P>
 "It started off as a joke," she recalled. "I said, 'Mike, would you be my 
honorary bridesmaid?' and he said, 'Sure, what color is my dress?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Yet on the day of the ceremony for the Westlake Village couple at Malibu's 
Calamigos Ranch, there was Tuchin, clad in a pink cummerbund and tie made to 
match the bride's dress, as "person of honor." Whether he knew it or not, he 
had become part of one of the hottest trends in weddings: the best man or maid 
of honor who crosses traditional gender lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of their friends didn't know about Tuchin's position in the bridal party 
until the day of the outdoor ceremony, and even while he was walking in the 
procession friends snickered and whispered, "Where's your dress?" But Tuchin 
was proud of his role; he held the bouquet for Dangtu during the couple's vows, 
straightened her dress, and held her lipstick and eye drops for emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if I'll ever live down the jokes," Tuchin, a Newport Beach 
lawyer, said after the ceremony, "but I'm very honored." 
</P>
<P>
 Best man Dwight Spiers kidded: "I didn't mind breaking tradition like this as 
long we didn't have to walk down the aisle together." At the rehearsal, they 
joked about doing the first dance together. 
</P>
<P>
 Mon-Li, the wedding coordinator for Calamigos Ranch, who has handled 200 
weddings a year for the past nine years, said such arrangements have become 
popular. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since the first of this year, not a weekend has gone by that I don't have a 
man who wants his best friend -- a woman -- to stand up for him or a woman asks 
a man to be her bridesmaid, and I think it's wonderful," she said. "You just 
have to keep an open mind." 
</P>
<P>
 The trend is noted in the September issue of Bride's magazine. Executive 
Editor Barbara D. Tober said the idea started spontaneously on the East and 
West coasts about 10 years ago, and now it's happening more among white-collar 
couples in their 30s and 40s. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shows that there are fewer gender limitations in friendships today," said 
Tober, Bride's editor for 29 years. "Little boys now play with little girls and 
men and women become friends in the workplace." 
</P>
<P>
 A survey published in Bride's shows that most women are living alone before 
marriage and have close non-sexual friendships with men. 
</P>
<P>
 The preferred phrases are "best woman" and "person of honor," according to 
Bride's, but some Southern Californians also use "best person," "man of honor," 
"bridesman" and "bride's friend." 
</P>
<P>
 It's less common, Tober said, for a man to stand up for the bride than for a 
woman stand up for the groom. "There's more jealousies and guarding going on 
with men; men tend to be more proprietary than the female, so the groom may not 
want a man to stand up for his bride. I'm not sure that will ever change." 
</P>
<P>
 Mon-Li said she has noticed that if the couple is confident in each other's 
love, it doesn't matter what gender their friends are -- but that it often does 
matter to the families. 
</P>
<P>
 "Older generations sometimes balk about this mixing and matching," she said. 
"The worst is usually the bride's mother." 
</P>
<P>
 But Mildred Cohen of Santa Monica had no problem when her daughter Laura 
married Rolf Bell and his best man was a woman who wore a tuxedo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone said, 'My gosh, that's a girl,' but I thought it was great because 
she wore this stunning gray formal tuxedo to show that she was on the man's 
side," Cohen said. "It was a beautiful statement. Eclectic, yes, but 
beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 Dian Sorensen, manager of Las Vegas' Little Chapel of the Flowers, has seen "a 
lot of that happening lately. It's the '90s now, anything goes." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past five years, these kinds of wedding parties have doubled, Sorensen 
said. "The biggest problem is that very few men want to be called the matron of 
honor. It's not a very macho title." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In June, a dozen weddings at Casa Romantica in San Clemente featured 
non-traditional wedding parties. Coordinator Maureen Gates, who handles more 
than 100 weddings a year there, said in previous years there might be fewer 
than one similar wedding per month at the seaside mansion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen a father, stepfather, four brothers, even a dog be the maid of 
honor," Gates said. "If a couple gets married they should be surrounded with 
the people they're most comfortable with." 
</P>
<P>
 But what about the extras? Does a best woman then throw a bachelor party? Does 
a guy put on a bridal shower? 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, she should throw a bachelor party, because a best friend would know 
exactly what the groom would enjoy," Gates said. "But I've seen . . . 
bachelorette parties (that are) a lot worse than anything I've heard the guys 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly, parties before weddings are instead being combined into co-gender 
events, such as a picnic in a park or a bonfire at the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "This one couple had a male bridesperson who got together with the best man 
and they organized a romantic bonfire on the beach and watched the sun set," 
Gates said. "All their friends came. There was no stripper." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many couples have no problem with having best friends of the opposite sex in 
the wedding party, Gates said. "For the most part it's people in their 30s and 
40s who are doing this because they're already over any sexual hang-ups," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's such a phenomenon that the second printing of the marriage guide "The 
Romance of the Wedding Ceremony" (Foundation for the Actualization of Human 
Potential, 1991) will address non-traditional bridal parties. The author, the 
Rev. Richleigh Hale Powers, performed 387 weddings last year, including some on 
yachts and even hot-air balloons. His wife, also a minister, gave vows for 100 
couples at their 17-acre estate, the Plantation, in Fallbrook. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past five years such arrangements have increased every year and now 
more than 10% of my weddings are planned that way," Powers said. "I had a guy 
recently as the maid of honor with five bridesmaids because he knew the bride 
since he was an infant, and he was delighted to be among all those females." 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing in the Judeo-Christian ethic bars a female best man or male maid of 
honor, Powers said, and in fact, it often helps ease the tension behind the 
scenes before the wedding to forgo the tradition of gender separation before 
the wedding ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 Mon-Li said a male bridesperson had a great calming effect in the bride's 
dressing room before a recent wedding she helped organize. "He was fabulous, 
and it made it so much easier to have a male there because otherwise all these 
women were running around fussing and creating tension, but his presence was 
very soothing for the bride," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "And two years ago I had a best man named Jennifer and a bridesmaid named 
Steve," Mon-Li recalled. "He was holding the bridal train and she held the 
rings. I thought it was very unusual, but why not? The sex of the person didn't 
make much of a difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Breaking wedding tradition was no big deal for the Johnsons. Mimi had to 
explain to the very confused band members playing at their wedding that Tuchin 
would have to be introduced as the "person of honor." Jim said if he heard 
anyone teasing him, he'd personally "bust 'em in the mouth." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuchin said he now realizes what his girlfriends meant when they have 
complained about having to purchase outfits for a wedding that they'll never 
wear again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have this pink cummerbund and a tie to match Mimi's dress and, very 
honestly, I can't imagine they'll ever be used again."

LEITER MAKES CASE TO STAY WITH ANGELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mark Leiter winced when he heard the news. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels were desperately searching for a closer, and were close to 
acquiring All-Star Rick Aguilera on Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'Great, I'm going to lose my closer's role before I even had my 
first opportunity,' " Leiter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the trading deadline passed without a move, Leiter was the one saving 
the Angels' 4-3 victory over the Texas Rangers before 34,910 at the Ballpark in 
Arlington. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been wanting to do this for so long, that I said, 'Put him in there,' " 
said Angel starter Chuck Finley. "I'm tired of listening to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Said pitcher Brian Anderson: "That's a good role for him because he's 
half-crazy, anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Leiter's role is expected to last only until the Aug. 12 strike date, 
and once the season ends, the Angels will continue their search for reliable 
relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Bavasi, Angel general manager, was close to completing a trade for the 
Minnesota Twins' Aguilera, but decided the compensation was too much. He will 
try again, but not until the winter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came close to a deal," Bavasi said. "But we couldn't justify it 
personnel-wise. It was a fair request, but it still carved our club up too 
much. It would not have improved our club. It would have opened up some holes 
that we would have spent a lot of time in the future trying to fill. 
</P>
<P>
 "As tempted as we were, we just couldn't do it. We're talking about a premiere 
guy, but it was way too heavy for us." 
</P>
<P>
 The Twins, according to club officials, asked for first baseman J.T. Snow, 
Anderson or Andrew Lorraine, triple-A reliever Troy Percival and either 
pitching prospect Ryan Hancock or Jeff Schmidt. 
</P>
<P>
 The Twins modified their offer Sunday, but by the afternoon, Twin General 
Manager Andy MacPhail refused to budge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how close I came, but we closed shop this afternoon," MacPhail 
said. "It just wasn't going to help us enough." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels also talked with the Chicago Cubs about Randy Myers, but 
discussions with the Kansas City Royals about Jeff Montgomery ended with the 
Royals' nine-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were some people available that become unavailable because the pennant 
races changed," Bavasi said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels (44-62), who are 6 1/2 games behind the Rangers with nine games 
remaining before the strike date, realize there will be no help on the way. 
It's too late for this season, anyway, particularly if it ends in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, the players consider it a critical time, if not for anything else, for 
their pride. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way things were going there it looked like we were going to lose 100 
games," Angel shortstop Gary DiSarcina said. "We lost our focus." 
</P>
<P>
 Leiter will be closely examined these next two weeks to determine his 
position. He might not be considered a prototype closer, but Bryan Harvey was 
discovered on a softball field, after all. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been looking forward to this for an awfully long time," said Leiter, who 
pitched the last 1 2/3 innings for his second save. "I mean, to come in and 
face the meat of their lineup, with a one-run lead, it can't get any better 
than that." 
</P>
<P>
 Leiter, inheriting a 4-3 lead with one out in the eighth and Oddibe McDowell 
on first base, picked off McDowell and struck out Ivan Rodriguez. In the ninth, 
he struck out Butch Davis, yielded a single to Rusty Greer, and then induced a 
check-swing grounder from Jose Canseco. 
</P>
<P>
 With left-handed batter Will Clark due up, Angel Manager Marcel Lachemann had 
a decision: bring in left-handed Bob Patterson or let Leiter continue. 
Lachemann ordered an intentional walk, putting the winning run on first base, 
with Juan Gonzalez coming to bat. 
</P>
<P>
 Two pitches later, Gonzalez grounded out to third baseman Spike Owen, and the 
Angels had their second consecutive victory since ending an eight-game losing 
streak.

RAIDERS CONTINUE THEIR DOMINANCE OVER THE BRONCOS; PRO FOOTBALL: JAEGER'S FIELD 
GOAL IN OVERTIME GIVES L.A. A 25-22 EXHIBITION VICTORY OVER DENVER IN 
BARCELONA. 
</P>

<P>
 Change continents. 
</P>
<P>
 Change time zones. 
</P>
<P>
 Change seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 But some things never seem to change. Like the Raiders beating the Denver 
Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
 They've done it at the Coliseum and at Mile High Stadium. They've done it in 
the regular season and the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
 And they did it again Sunday night, winning in an exhibition game, 25-22, on a 
39-yard field goal by Jeff Jaeger in overtime, in Barcelona's Montjuic Olympic 
Stadium before 37,406. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the Raiders' fifth consecutive victory over Denver and ninth in their 
last 10 meetings, but at least the Broncos can take solace in the fact that 
this one doesn't count. 
</P>
<P>
 Or does it? 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly not in the standings, but the Raiders won a psychological victory 
Sunday that might well help them in the regular season if, as expected, these 
clubs battle for the AFC West title. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders won the mind game at the beginning and the end. 
</P>
<P>
 They won it at the start on their first offensive play when quarterback Jeff 
Hostetler threw a 75-yard touchdown pass to James Jett. 
</P>
<P>
 On the conversion, Hostetler, taking advantage of the NFL's new two-point 
option, threw to Ty Montgomery to give the Raiders an 8-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler threw six touchdown passes against Denver in their last two 
meetings, last year's regular-season finale and the playoff opener -- and 
quickly showed that, despite a revamped Bronco secondary, nothing had changed. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the game, the Raiders won another psychological battle when 
Phillips, eager to end this losing streak against the Raiders, put his 
defensive starters back in, both at the end of regulation play and in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Raider Coach Art Shell never blinked. He kept in his third-string unit and won 
with a backfield of Billy Joe Hobert at quarterback, Randy Jordan at tailback 
and Derrick Gainer at fullback. 
</P>
<P>
 Was Shell tempted to go back to his starters? 
</P>
<P>
 "I would never do that," he said. "I tell you what, it gave our young guys a 
good look at a veteran defense. It was pleasing to see our young guys get a 
chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Shell had told Jett on Saturday the Raiders were going long to him on the 
first play. 
</P>
<P>
 Shell kidded Jett that he seemed nervous. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can go to Tim (Brown) instead," Shell told his second-year receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, no," Jett replied. "Bring it on." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, it was the veteran, Hostetler, who got nervous. 
</P>
<P>
 Jett blew past Denver cornerback Ray Crockett and strong safety Darryl Hall 
failed to pick him up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their safeties like to bite on the run," Shell said, "and we know our 
receivers can run by their corners." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, when Hostetler saw Jett alone near the Denver 30-yard line, he 
tightened up. "I saw all that open field and I couldn't believe it," Hostetler 
said. "It was the toughest pass I've had to throw in a long time. I just didn't 
want to overthrow it." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he nearly underthrew it, forcing Jett to pause and wait for the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed like it took forever to get there," Jett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once it did, he raced into the end zone, hurdled a low barrier at the end of 
the field and landed on the running track. 
</P>
<P>
 That's familiar territory for Jett. It's the same track where he won a gold 
medal as part of the U.S. 400-meter relay team during the 1992 Olympics, the 
same track he stepped on when the team arrived in Barcelona earlier in the week 
and felt chills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Barcelona has been good to me," Jett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Elam got the Broncos on the scoreboard with a 35-yard field goal and 
Derrick Clark, a rookie running back out of Evangel College, put Denver ahead, 
9-8, on a one-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips had promised he would experiment with the two-point conversion quite 
often and he was true to his word. 
</P>
<P>
 The Broncos missed on their first conversion try when quarterback Tommy 
Maddox's pass to Anthony Miller was short. 
</P>
<P>
 Maddox came back to connect on a nine-yard touchdown pass to Glyn Milburn, but 
again, Maddox missed on the two-pointer, this one aimed at Mike Pritchard. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver, despite quarterback John Elway ending his day after only two offensive 
series, led at halftime, 15-8. 
</P>
<P>
 Vince Evans evened the game in the third quarter with a 20-yard touchdown pass 
to Daryl Hobbs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders went back out in front in the fourth quarter on a three-yard run 
by Calvin Jones, who finished with 31 yards in nine carries. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first series in there was pretty tough," he said. "But the guys settled me 
down, I took a deep breath and blew it out. The guys are a lot faster here. I'm 
not able to get around the corner as easily (as in college). I've got to make 
some adjustments, but that's why they have a preseason." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark scored on another one-yard run with 1:52 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, Phillips played it safe, going for a one-point conversion by Elam. 
With a chance to win the game in the closing seconds of regulation time, Elam 
missed on a 57-yard field-goal attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders won the coin toss in overtime and drove for the deciding kick. 
Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders' other new tailback, veteran Harvey Williams, outgained Calvin 
Jones by a yard with 32 for the team high. Williams averaged 5.3 yards per 
carry.

MIKE DOWNEY: THIS SERIES FEATURES TWO HOMESICK TEAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A baseball series will be played this week at Anaheim between the California 
Angels and the Seattle Mariners -- neither of whom want to be there. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels dislike the abuse they have been receiving at home. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners have no home. 
</P>
<P>
 You talk about tragic. I figure by week's end, both teams will be pouring 
their hearts out to Oprah. 
</P>
<P>
 Several Angel players have gone on record recently saying that they are sick 
of being booed by their own fans. A coach, Rod Carew, agreed in a TV interview 
last week that often the Angels prefer playing on the road because of the way 
they are treated at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Funny, but here I always thought Anaheim Stadium fans were among the 
friendliest and most patient in baseball. But apparently to the players it is 
about as warm and cozy as the Bates Motel. I never noticed that it had turned 
into their personal field of screams. 
</P>
<P>
 I never realized that the Big A had become. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Halo Hell!  
</P>
<P>
 Unluckily for the Angels, who haven't been held hitless for several games now, 
their scheduled trip to Seattle for this week was canceled because the Kingdome 
roof up there is crumbling. Several heavy ceiling tiles fell, causing Seattle's 
management to close the stadium indefinitely and search for a new place to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 It used to be the only things falling on your head in Seattle were raindrops. 
</P>
<P>
 Were they more creative, the Mariners would make use of their hardship and 
appeal to their fans to come out to the Kingdome anyway. You know, for 
promotions like: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Look Out Below Night! 
</P>
<P>
 -- Guess Which Inning a Tile Falls on Ken Griffey and Win Dinner for Two! 
</P>
<P>
 -- Free Construction Helmet Night! 
</P>
<P>
 -- Doubleheader with Red Sox and Amish Roof-Raising Between Games! 
</P>
<P>
 -- Lucky Concussion Night! 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the poor Mariners must travel on and on, like the Flying Dutchman or 
Charlie on the MTA. They are now the American League's permanent floating 
visiting team. Their life is one long baggage claim. They wear gray wherever 
they go. I sure hope each guy has more than one road uniform or else Seattle's 
laundry bill will be enormous. 
</P>
<P>
 Mariner management proposed that the team play its home games in Tacoma, at a 
park apparently more fit for games involving Charlie Brown and Snoopy. It is a 
minor league park, so it is understandable why the Mariners would feel right at 
home there. They already use an 18-year-old shortstop who could still be 
eligible for American Legion ball. 
</P>
<P>
 The proud Angels, however, said they would rather be in a coma than Tacoma. 
They said the park only held something like 9,000 fans -- which you would think 
would be plenty of seating for an Angel-Mariner game. 
</P>
<P>
 So, once again, Seattle caved in. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, agreed Mariner management, nobody has to come up here, ever again. Tell us 
when and where you want us. California, Texas, Massachusetts, we don't care. We 
will pile up that frequent-flier mileage and take the whole team to Rio de 
Janeiro after the season! They don't even check professional athletes in 
customs down there! 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, the Angels have consented to play them in that mean old place, 
Anaheim Stadium. Mortal combat between the two worst teams in the American 
League. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels provide a wonderful family atmosphere. There are characters in 
funny, furry costumes roving through the stands. There are funny sounds coming 
over the loudspeakers, like train engines and slide whistles. It's a happy, 
happy ballpark. It's like going to a baseball game at Chuck E. Cheese. 
</P>
<P>
 So, boys and girls, moms and dads, please don't boo. It makes the Angels so 
very sad. 
</P>
<P>
 Their record at home is 20-34. If things don't perk up, they may pick up the 
whole team and move to Baltimore or St. Louis or some needy place. 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't the Angels' fault that pitchers pitch perfect games against them. 
They are so depressed over how they get treated at home that they barely have 
the strength to pick up a bat. Maybe they could make themselves feel better by 
dumping a popular player or manager, but, well, it's like that Texas pitcher 
Kenny Rogers says, you got to know when to hold 'em and know when to fold 'em. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Seattle-Tacoma Mariners, please, don't boo them, either. One thing 
I never do is boo the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's simply rejoice in the fact that no Seattle announcer ever had to say: 
"Here's the 2-2 pitch to Griffey, going for his record-tying 61st home run, and 
it's a long drive! Way back! Going! Going! Gone! A home run for Ken Griffey 
Jr., who circles the bases, waving to the fans, rounding second now and. . . . 
Oh, my God! Junior has been hit by a ceiling tile!"

MILLER PLACES SECOND IN ALL-AROUND; GYMNASTICS: KOCHETKOVA WINS GOLD IN 
COMPETITION FRAUGHT WITH PROBLEMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two-time world champion gymnast Shannon Miller of Edmond, Okla., did not win 
an all-around competition for the first time since the 1992 Summer Olympics, 
but that was all anyone connected with the Goodwill Games seemed to know for 
sure at the Sport and Concert Complex on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 When the totals were posted during the medal ceremony, Russia's Dina 
Kochetkova was the champion with 39.325 points, Miller the runner-up with 
39.268 and Russia's Yelena Grosheva the bronze medalist with 38.943. 
</P>
<P>
 While no one argued that the majority of judges intended for Kochetkova to 
win, U.S. team officials and coaches had a number of questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Such as:  
</P>
<P>
 -- Which judges gave what scores for whom in the final discipline? 
</P>
<P>
 -- What really were the 16 competitors' total scores? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Can we get a ride back to the hotel? 
</P>
<P>
 It has been a long six days since arriving here for U.S. Coach Steve Nunno, 
whose team consists of five teen-agers he trains at Dynamo Gym in Oklahoma 
City. 
</P>
<P>
 They were scheduled to work out for the first time last Thursday, but Nunno 
refused to allow them to use the small gym they had been assigned because the 
apparatuses were so close to the walls that he feared his gymnasts would slam 
into them. Moving to the Sport and Concert Complex later that day, they trained 
while the United States was playing Russia in basketball not more than a couple 
of backflips away. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next two days, Miller skipped two workouts and her teammates missed 
one because transportation that was supposed to have been arranged for them by 
the organizers never came. 
</P>
<P>
 They had a similar problem after their fourth-place finish in the team 
competition Saturday night, when the bus scheduled to take them to their hotel 
was late. A former Soviet gymnast offered them a ride in her Fiat, but because 
there were nine of them, including assistant coaches, they declined. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the bus got them to their destination, the restaurant was closed. 
They ate tuna and cereal that they brought from Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you can't get a ride home from the meet, maybe you say, 'We're not 
welcome,' " Nunno said. 
</P>
<P>
 Little did he know that the chaos was merely beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 When he left the arena late Saturday night, he was informed that Miller, 
Marianna Webster and Soni Meduna had qualified for the all-around competition. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sunday morning, an ABC commentator, former gymnast Bart Conner, was 
perusing the start list when he discovered that no Chinese were listed. By his 
calculations, they had earned two berths. He called his bosses, who called the 
organizers, who had simply forgotten about the Chinese. They corrected the 
mistake, but that eliminated Meduna and a Spanish gymnast. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, moments after the competition began, it was discovered that the computer 
used to calculate the results would add the gymnasts' two vault scores but 
would not average them, as required for the all-around. The United States' 
Jackie Fie, president of the international gymnastics federation women's 
technical committee, was called upon to average them with a hand-held 
calculator. 
</P>
<P>
 But the worst was saved for last as Kochetkova and Miller entered the final 
discipline, the floor exercise, in a duel for the gold medal. Kochetkova had 
29.400 points after the first three apparatuses to 29.368 for Miller. 
Kochetkova is the reigning world champion in the floor exercise, but Miller 
outscored her there in Saturday's team competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller went first and was brilliant. When her scores were posted, it appeared 
as if the Romanian judge had awarded her a perfect 10.0. The average of the six 
judges' scores was 9.912, the highest for any gymnast in any event Sunday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 Kochetkova, on deck, noted the scores and knew that she would have to be 
almost as good as Miller to retain her lead. She was, and her scores, including 
10.0s from the Russian and Kazakstan judges, reflected it. Her average was 9.9, 
apparently giving her the victory by two-hundredths of a point. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Romanian judge claimed at some point that she gave Miller a 9.9 
instead of a 10.0, and the man responsible for logging the scores into the 
computer acknowledged that he made a mistake. As a result, Kochetkova actually 
scored higher on the floor exercise than Miller and won by a more comfortable 
margin of almost six-hundredths of a point. At least, that was the official 
explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials considered lodging a protest but decided against it because the 
order of finish would not have changed. 
</P>
<P>
 Making things worse for everyone, the television producers who run the event 
decided that only one gymnast should be on the floor at a time, instead of 
competing on different apparatuses concurrently, which meant that everyone had 
to remain in the sweltering gym more than an hour longer than usual. 
</P>
<P>
 Nunno said that Miller was "hometowned" by the judges and made a case, but, as 
her coach, that is what he is supposed to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said she made some mistakes on her landings, got the scores she 
deserved and was happy with her silver medal. She did not even complain about 
the heat, saying that her gym in Oklahoma City installed air conditioning only 
last summer. It is hard to imagine Miller ever being anything but cool. Notes 
</P>
<P>
 American Zeke Jones won the gold medal in wrestling at 114.5 pounds by 
defeating Janali Khosrow of Iran, 11-0. Russia finished with six gold and three 
silver medals; the Americans had two gold and three each in silver and bronze. 
. . . In women's cycling, Americans swept the 27-mile criterium with Brooke 
Blackwelder in first followed by Karen Livingston and Karen Dunne. . . . Russia 
defeated the United States, 15-3, 15-13, 15-8, in women's volleyball. . . . In 
archery, South Korean Kim Hyo-Jung won the women's gold and Russian Gennadi 
Mitrofanov won the men's event. Russia's Olga Sedakova took the lead after the 
short program in synchronized swimming solo competition with 98.240 points.

FOR BUBKA, 35TH MARK IS A BREEZE; TRACK AND FIELD: UKRAINIAN BREAKS POLE VAULT 
RECORD WITH LEAP OF 20-1 3/4, HELP FROM WIND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sergei Bubka, taking advantage of wind gusts that foiled other athletes 
Sunday, set a world pole vault record for the 35th time. 
</P>
<P>
 Competing at Europe's highest venue, the 1.264-mile high Alpine resort of 
Sestriere, Bubka leaped 20 feet 1 3/4 inches, adding a half-inch to the mark he 
set in Tokyo in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "The wind was good, blowing in the proper direction," Bubka said. "The track 
was perfect and altitude possibly helped." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's world record also was the 17th outdoor mark for the 30-year-old 
Ukrainian, who has pushed the pole vault mark up fraction by fraction in a 
11-year career. The victory earned him a $130,000 Ferrari sports car, a 
standing payoff for any world record set at Sestriere. 
</P>
<P>
 A four-time world champion and an Olympic gold medalist in 1988, Bubka said he 
can go even higher. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I can reach the same form of 1991, I could climb as high as 20-4 1/4 and 
even 20-8," Bubka said. "I improved my technique, capitalizing on errors of the 
last two years." 
</P>
<P>
 Bubka set the record on his first attempt after clearing 18-8 1/4 and 19-4 
1/4. He then drove a parade lap in his Ferrari. 
</P>
<P>
 Bubka shared the spotlight with others, including American Mike Powell, who 
matched his long jump world record with a wind-aided leap of 29-4 1/2. Powell 
defeated Carl Lewis by nine inches in their first meeting since 1992. Because 
it was wind-aided, the jump will not be recognized for record purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis jumped 28-5 in regular wind conditions and 28-7 1/2 with the wind. 
</P>
<P>
 The wind was not a factor when Jackie Joyner-Kersee jumped 24-7 in the women's 
event -- 1 1/4 inches short of the 1988 world mark of Galina Chistiakova of 
Russia. Heike Drechsler of Germany was second at 24-3.

MORNING BRIEFING: WHILE HE PLAYS ON AND ON, OTHERS KEEP DROPPING OFF

 David Ginsburg of the Associated Press put a new twist on Cal Ripken's 
consecutive streak, which reaches 2,000 games tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Ripken, a shortstop, began his streak with the Baltimore Orioles on May 
30, 1982, players have gone on the disabled list more than 3,100 times, 
Ginsburg notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, 492 players have started at shortstop in the 12 years since 
Ripken has started. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Conine of the Florida Marlins, with 265 consecutive appearances, has the 
closest current streak to Ripken's. 
</P>
<P>
 Add streak: Lou Gehrig, who holds the record at 2,130 consecutive games, came 
out early 69 times and missed two starts. Ripken has started every game during 
his streak and come out early 58 times.

most times hit by pitches (243): "Once when I was with the Dodgers, I fouled

next three batters and I scored. We won, 1-0. That was my greatest game." EARL

HARPER LOOKING ELSEWHERE, BUT A RETURN STILL POSSIBLE 
</P>

 Ron Harper isn't a betting man, but if the lone remaining unsigned big-name 
free agent had to wager on whether he'd return to the Clippers, he wouldn't bet 
on it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say don't take that bet," Harper said before playing in Magic Johnson's 
ninth annual Mid-Summer Night's Magic All-Star game Sunday night at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody knows that I'd like to play in Chicago. And everybody knows that 
I'd like to play for the (Atlanta) Hawks. I'd like to go to Manhattan and play 
for Pat (Riley, coach of the New York Knicks). I could sit here and name some 
teams that I'd like to go play for, but is it going to happen? I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Harper, who earned $4 million last season, admitted that he'd return 
to the Clippers if the money was right. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cash talks," Harper said. "It's like they told me, just wait and see. Money 
talks. I've got a chance of going back. Are the chances good? Who knows but me. 
I will not disclose that. . . . They could sign me, but it would cost them a 
nice little penny. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want your ballplayers there, you should at least try to sign them. 
They haven't made an attempt to sign me. They keep talking about 'We want Ron 
back.' Don't talk me to death. They haven't made me an offer. That should tell 
me a little bit of something." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers said they will try to re-sign Harper. 
</P>
<P>
 Could Harper, who was suspended for one game last season after likening 
playing for the Clippers to being in jail, return in good conscious? 
</P>
<P>
 "I could easily go back and wouldn't lose any sleep over it," he said. Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Magic Johnson had a game-high 34 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists as his 
team won, 168-166, on John Starks' three-pointer from the left corner off a 
pass from Johnson with four seconds to play. . . . Anfernee Hardaway had 35 
points, eight rebounds and five assists and Purdue's Glenn Robinson, the No. 1 
pick in the NBA draft, had 22 points and seven rebounds. . . . Forward John 
Williams, who became a free agent when the Clippers decided not to re-sign him, 
is considering offers from four teams.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>

<P>
 Tom Lasorda is managing the Dodgers as though there is no tomorrow. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Well, at least, no Aug. 12 or beyond. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "The probability of a strike has to affect the way I manage," Lasorda said 
Sunday after the Dodgers maintained their one-game lead in the National League 
West. "We're in the stretch now. Every game is extremely important." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda met with his coaches before Saturday night's game against Houston and 
asked for their thoughts about how to best cope with the Aug. 12 strike date 
set by labor. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 A few hours later, Lasorda removed pitcher Kevin Gross for a pinch-hitter with 
the bases loaded in the sixth inning, two out, and the Dodgers leading, 2-1. No 
strike imminent and Gross might have stayed in. Instead, Dave Hansen came to 
bat, and two runs scored on a passed ball. The Dodgers won, 6-1. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "That was an example of our thinking," Lasorda said. "Right now, we've got to 
operate like we have a one-game lead with 10 games left. We'll do anything to 
win. We might even switch our pitching rotation." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Catcher Mike Piazza often is rested during day games that follow night games, 
but was in the lineup Sunday when the Dodgers reached the magic .500 mark. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the strike was the prime topic of conversation Saturday on 
old-timers night. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "A strike is going to be lousy for everyone," Ron Cey said. "It's a no-win 
situation." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, (Richard) Ravitch and (Donald) Fehr can sit down and be rational," 
Doug Rau said. "They're getting paid a lot of money." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the strike will last more than a few weeks," Steve Garvey said. 
"But I don't see why anybody would want to stop a season like this one. If I 
were in baseball, I would hate to see football dominate the sports pages in 
August." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "The owners refuse to share the revenue among themselves, so they're asking 
the players to do it for them," said Mike Marshall, the 1974 Cy Young Award 
winner. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Maury Wills and Richie Ashburn long have been even more deserving of a spot in 
the Hall of Game than Phil Rizzuto, who was inducted Sunday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The new two-point conversion rule is putting some spice into the NFL 
exhibition season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 But don't look for coaches to go for two during the regular season when they 
have a 6-0 lead early in the first quarter like the Raiders' Art Shell did 
against Denver in Barcelona. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 If you are going to trade a goal-scoring machine such as Luc Robitaille, you 
better get something special in return. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Tocchet doesn't seem to fit that description -- not a 30-year-old 
Tocchet, who is coming off back surgery. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings, who have traded Robitaille, Tomas Sandstrom, Paul Coffey and Corey 
Millen the last couple of years, are left badly in need of firepower. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 And, no, don't expect the Pittsburgh Penguins to trade Robitaille back to the 
Kings, a la Marty McSorley. Luc should blend into the Pittsburgh system 
perfectly. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 So much for those of us who believed the Lakers would land one of the three 
attractive free-agent forwards -- Horace Grant, Danny Manning or Dominique 
Wilkins -- and good luck to Del Harris. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Manning isn't a franchise player, but Charles Barkley is and the Phoenix Suns 
ought to be the class of the Western Conference next season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the Clippers have a coach, how about some players? . . . 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of weeks before Puerto Rico won the Goodwill Games championship, it 
lost to Magic Johnson's team of former NBA players, 118-104. Magic had 26 
points and a triple-double. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Among the best prospects at the recent Las Vegas high school basketball 
tournament was Mike Bibby, a 6-2 guard from Arizona who is the son of Henry 
Bibby. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar De La Hoya was brilliant Friday night. Sure, Jorge Paez has seen better 
days. But De La Hoya, who was all business from the moment he left his dressing 
room, would have knocked out most any other 135-pounder. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California is brimming with quality fighters in the 130- to 140-pound 
range -- De La Hoya, Rafael and Gabriel Ruelas, Zack Padilla, Genaro Hernandez 
and Shane Mosley -- and the potential matchups are intriguing. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The 40th anniversary of Roger Bannister's unprecedented 3:59.4 mile recently 
was celebrated in grand style, but it won't be too much longer before someone 
runs two sub-four minute miles in the same race. On Saturday, Moses Kiptanui of 
Kenya set a two-mile record of 8 minutes 9.01 seconds.

 Playing nearly flawless golf Sunday, Helen Alfredsson was a four-stroke winner 
of the LPGA Ping-Welch's Championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly one week earlier, she cried as her lost weekend of golf ended.Seven 
holes into Saturday's third round of the U.S. Women's Open, Alfredsson led by 
six strokes. She played the next 11 holes in 8-over-par and trailed by two. The 
misery continued the next day when her 77 left her tied for ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, Alfredsson finished with five birdies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Swede shot a bogey-free 66 to win at 14-under 274. Pat Bradley, with a 68, 
and Juli Inkster, with a 69, were second at 278. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Dicky Pride, who started the final round tied for the lead with two others, 
defeated Hal Sutton and Gene Sauers with a 20-foot birdie putt on the first 
playoff hole to win the St. Jude Classic in Memphis, Tenn., his first victory 
on the PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 He advanced to the playoff by sinking a 25-foot birdie putt on 18.

GOODYEAR OUTLASTS COMPETITION; AUTO RACING: HE WINS MARLBORO 500 AT MICHIGAN 
INTERNATIONAL SPEEDWAY WHEN FASTER DRIVERS RUN INTO ENGINE PROBLEMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of racing's oldest adages, "To finish first, first you have to finish," 
never proved truer than Sunday in the Marlboro 500. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't pay to take the lead at Michigan International Speedway, Indy cars' 
fastest track. First, pole-sitter Nigel Mansell, then Michael Andretti and 
finally, in the dying stages of the 500-mile race, Raul Boesel and Al Unser 
Jr., lost the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 When Unser, the final Penske driver running, came smoking into the pits with a 
blown engine 20 laps from the finish, he turned the lead over to Scott 
Goodyear, who was had been a lap behind. The nearest cars to Goodyear's 
Lola-Ford were the unsponsored pair of Arie Luyendyk and Dominic Dobson. 
</P>
<P>
 For the final 20 laps, that's the way they ran as an estimated 75,000 wondered 
what fate might befall Goodyear, a Canadian whose only previous Indy car 
victory came on this two-mile oval two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's the way they finished -- Goodyear, then Luyendyk a lap down, and 
Dobson two laps back in his highest Indy car finish. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Goodyear had problems earlier while leading. He stayed out one lap too 
long and ran out of fuel in the second turn, barely coasting to his pits. It 
put him a lap back of Boesel and Unser. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the worst feeling I think I ever had in my life, a real pit in the 
stomach," Goodyear said. "I knew we weren't the fastest car out there, but the 
most important thing is we were there at the end. There are some days when you 
don't have to be the quickest." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday he wasn't even close. Unser had the fastest lap, 229.199 m.p.h., on lap 
122. Goodyear's fastest was 222.832. Fourteen of the 27 other drivers had 
faster laps than the winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other challengers, notably Mario Andretti, Robby Gordon and Emerson 
Fittipaldi, also were victims of attrition. Only eight cars were racing when 
Goodyear took the checkered flag. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Teo Fabi, who finished fourth: "It's a good thing I didn't finish third. 
I would have been embarrassed to go the press conference." 
</P>
<P>
 Before Boesel and Unser dropped out only six laps apart, the race was shaping 
up to be a classic, along the lines of Unser's victory over Goodyear in the 
1992 Indianapolis 500, the closest in history. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a shame for the fans," Unser said. "Me and Raul were going to have a 
super race. We were pretty even and I was looking forward to it. When he went 
out, I turned the boost down and was just cruising. Then it (the engine) just 
let go." 
</P>
<P>
 Boesel, who led 120 laps, was disconsolate. He was trying to win the first 
race in car owner Dick Simon's 25 years as driver and owner. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a huge disappointment for the entire team," the Brazilian said. "I led 
most of the race, I was running a good pace. Several times Little Al put some 
pressure on us, but I was able to respond with no trouble. Everything was going 
exactly to the team's plan. Unfortunately, the engine let go in turn three. It 
wasn't to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Eight caution flags for a period of 60 laps kept Goodyear's winning speed down 
to 159.800 m.p.h., the slowest since 1986. Among them was a fire in Adrian 
Fernandez's car caused when the Mexican driver started to pull out of the pits 
with the fuel hose still attached. He was doused with buckets of water by the 
neighboring crew of Mario Andretti before he was burned. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodyear's car is owned by drag racing champion Kenny Bernstein, who was 
competing at Sears Point Raceway in Sonoma, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 The race, No. 10 on the 16-event Indy car schedule, was the first in which one 
of Roger Penske's drivers failed to finish in the top three -- and it came on a 
track Penske owns. 
</P>
<P>
 Fittipaldi was running third when his engine blew late in the race, but the 
third driver, Paul Tracy, failed to survive a comedy of errors that included 
overshooting his pit, clipping a tire in the pits that damaged his suspension 
and dropping out, five laps back of the leaders, with no fuel pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 Mansell led the first 26 laps but was the second car out of the race when the 
throttle linkage stuck on his Ford. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just went from being perfect to being flat out everywhere," the defending 
series champion said. "I can't drive it if I can't stop it. I tried to pull it 
(the stuck throttle) out with the toe of my foot, but at those speeds it was 
too scary for me." Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Team owner Derrick Walker said Robby Gordon, 25, of Orange has signed a 
two-year contract extension and will be with the Indy-car team at least through 
1997.

STARS ADD SPICE TO L.A. OPEN; TENNIS: CHANG IS SEEDED NO. 1, BUT FOCUS IS ON 
BECKER AND AGASSI. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY WITHERSPOON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Call it the new and improved Los Angeles Open. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, attending the L.A. Open meant watching Michael Chang wear down a 
few court surfaces every day before losing in the final. The past two years it 
has meant watching Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands serve his way to the 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 But this year, the $325,000 tournament, which begins today at the L.A. Tennis 
Center at UCLA, promises to be different for two reasons: Boris Becker and 
Andre Agassi. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely a rivalry that people seem to get excited about," Agassi 
said. "Every time me and Boris play, it just seems to be the match of the 
tournament." 
</P>
<P>
 Ideally for tournament organizers, second-seeded Becker and third-seeded 
Agassi would meet in Saturday's semifinals. Top-seeded Chang is in the other 
half of the bracket, with fourth-seeded Alexander Volkov of Russia and 
fifth-seeded Krajicek. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is premature to talk about the semifinals before the tournament, 
there is little doubt Becker-Agassi would be the featured matchup. 
</P>
<P>
 These players share much: They burst onto the scene as teen-agers and achieved 
pop idol status in their respective countries before struggling with their 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Agassi, ranked No. 20 on the ATP tour, emerged in 1988 at age 18, when he 
advanced to the semifinals of the French Open and the U.S. Open and was ranked 
No. 3 in the world. Since then, the 1992 Wimbledon champion attracts such a 
large following at tournaments that it sometimes is difficult for him to fight 
his way through the crowd to get to practice courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Agassi was hampered by a wrist injury last season before undergoing surgery in 
December. He returned in February and won a tournament at Scottsdale, his last 
title before he won Sunday at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time Agassi played the L.A. Open was in 1988, when he lost in the 
final to Mikael Pernfors of Sweden. Agassi will play his first-round match 
against No. 84 Nicklas Kulti of Sweden on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Becker, the reclusive German star, won the first of his three Wimbledon titles 
in 1985 at 17. Becker had his best year in 1989, winning his third Wimbledon 
title as well as the U.S. Open. He reached the No. 1 ranking briefly after 
winning the Australian Open in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Becker, ranked ninth, has never played in the L.A. Open. He has returned from 
a recent leg injury, which prevented him from playing in the Players Limited 
International in Toronto last week. He will play No. 106 Grant Stafford of 
South Africa in a first-round match Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Becker-Agassi rivalry is more intriguing because they shared a common 
coach: Nick Bollettieri, who guided Agassi for 10 years until they split in 
1993. Bollettieri began coaching Becker this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Agassi is 7-3 against Becker. Their most memorable match, however, was won by 
Becker, a 6-7, 6-7, 7-6, 6-3, 6-4 Davis Cup victory that spanned two days in 
Munich in 1989 and helped West Germany to a 3-2 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Becker has not beaten Agassi in their seven matches since 1990, a 
matchup in the L.A. Open would be a tournament highlight. 
</P>
<P>
 With the focus on Becker and Agassi, top-seeded Chang is being overshadowed. 
Chang, who won the 1989 French Open at 17, lost in the L.A. Open final in 1989, 
1990 and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Chang's half of the draw seems easier than Becker's and Agassi's. Chang, 
ranked sixth, will play 91st-ranked Mark Petchey of England on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Krajicek, ranked 26th, will play wild-card entry Michael Joyce, ranked 168th, 
in a first-round match tonight. Krajicek gained momentum entering the 
tournament with a 2-6, 7-5, 7-6, 7-5 Davis Cup victory over top-ranked Pete 
Sampras last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixth-seeded Jason Stoltenberg of Australia might be the player to watch. 
Stoltenberg, who likely will move up from his No. 33 ranking today, advanced to 
the final of a tournament at Washington last month before losing to Stefan 
Edberg, 6-4, 6-2.

 Mario Lemieux will meet with Pittsburgh Penguin owner Howard Baldwin this week 
and is expected to tell him that he isn't healthy enough to play this season, 
according to sources close to the team.

DATELINE: ST. PETERSBURG; THEIR SHIPS COME IN WITH SALE OF MATROSHKAS  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Navy Day brought the best of the Baltic Fleet's battleships and submarines to 
the Neva River by morning Sunday and drunken sailors to the streets by night. 
</P>
<P>
 In between, St. Petersburgers enjoyed the festivities connected with the 
annual holiday, although no one seemed to know exactly why one was set aside in 
honor of the Russian Navy. 
</P>
<P>
 The role of the battleship Aurora in helping to bring down the czarist regime 
in 1917 was probably a factor, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter the Great started the Navy in 1694 with one ship and three admirals. 
That was pretty much its peak in the pre-nuclear days. 
</P>
<P>
 If Russian television producers had not been so relentlessly dull, they could 
have created a situation comedy about some of the things that happened and 
called it "Mikhail's Navy." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1904, the Japanese Navy staged a surprise attack upon Port Arthur on 
Russia's Pacific Coast. Seeking revenge, Russia's Baltic Fleet sailed halfway 
around the world and proved superior in its first engagement -- against a 
British fishing fleet. Seven months later, the Russians finally arrived in 
Japanese waters at Tsushima Bay and were sunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Navy Day was marvelous. Russians lined up five deep alongside 
the water across from the Hermitage on another atypically scorching day. 
Afterward, they went to the main street, Nevsky Prospect, to eat ice cream -- 
for as little as 15 cents a cone -- and watch foreigners shop. 
</P>
<P>
 For as long as most street vendors can recall, their most popular item for 
tourists has been the nesting dolls, called matroshkas . The traditional ones 
are of Russian women in traditional folk dresses. 
</P>
<P>
 But, with the shift a few years ago to a free market, the makers developed 
enhanced senses of commerce and humor, selling dolls of Gorbachev, Brezhnev, 
Kruschev, Stalin, Lenin, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, one can buy not only U.S. leaders, including Bill and Hillary Clinton 
and Al and Tipper Gore, but also NBA stars. 
</P>
<P>
 The most popular model features Michael Jordan on the outside, then descends 
to Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Charles Barkley, Ron Harper and Mark Price. 
</P>
<P>
 There also are team models -- Bulls, Knicks, Lakers and even the Heat. But not 
even on Navy Day can one find the Clippers. RANDY HARVEY

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; WILLIAMS HITS 39TH, 40TH TO LEAD THE GIANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Matt Williams homered twice, increasing his major league-leading total to 40, 
and drove in five runs Sunday as the San Francisco Giants defeated the Colorado 
Rockies, 9-4, at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 But he didn't want to talk about it. By the time reporters were allowed into 
the Giants' clubhouse, Williams was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice, but the important thing is to contribute to us winning," he said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams had a run-scoring single in the first, then drove in the go-ahead run 
with a 415-foot, three-run drive to left in the fourth inning against Mark 
Thompson (1-1). Williams hit a 420-foot solo homer in the fifth, giving him 95 
runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's hitting the ball all over the place and driving in runs when they're 
needed," teammate Barry Bonds said. 
</P>
<P>
 Darryl Strawberry followed Williams' first homer with a 435-foot drive off the 
top of the scoreboard in right. It was his fourth home run with the Giants, who 
are 17-4 since his July 7 debut. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds preceded Williams' fifth-inning home run with his 32nd. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams reached 40 homers in his 106th game, the fastest a player has reached 
40 since Reggie Jackson got there in game 97 in 1969. Williams set a National 
League record for homers through July but fell one short of the major league 
record of 41, established by Babe Ruth in 1928 and tied by Jimmie Foxx in 1932. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie right-hander William VanLandingham (7-1) won his fourth consecutive 
start, giving up four runs and four hits in six innings with six walks. He 
struck out seven. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 9, St. Louis 7 -- Frank Castillo, recently called up from the minors, 
won for the first time in a year and the Cubs scored six runs in the first 
inning at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago has won nine of 13 and scored five runs or more in the first inning in 
three of its last four games. St. Louis has lost six of seven. 
</P>
<P>
 Castillo (1-1) gave up three runs and five hits in 5 1/3 innings, with three 
strikeouts and two walks. He hadn't won since July 30, 1993, against the 
Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 Omar Olivares (2-4) gave up six runs and three hits in two-thirds of an inning 
with three walks. His earned-run average jumped from 5.34 to 6.21. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 13, Florida 4 -- Marquis Grissom went four for five with a home run 
and scored eluding a rundown as the first-place Expos completed a three-game 
sweep at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 Sean Berry and Cliff Floyd also hit homers for the Expos, who have won 11 of 
12 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedro Martinez (9-5) gave up two runs in six innings. For the fourth time this 
season, he was on the mound during a bench-clearing incident, but no punches 
were thrown. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 9, Philadelphia 5 -- Jeff Blauser had three hits, scored twice and 
knocked in the go-ahead run at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta's bullpen, which blew a 2-1 ninth-inning lead Saturday when the 
Phillies scored four runs to win, came through with 5 2/3 innings of two-hit 
relief after John Smoltz gave up seven hits and all five runs in 3 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 6, Pittsburgh 4 -- Jeromy Burnitz singled in the go-ahead run in a 
four-run ninth inning at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Dyer (1-1) came on to preserve a 4-2 lead, but retired only one of eight 
batters he faced in the ninth as the Mets won for the fifth time in six games. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati 2, San Diego 1 -- Bret Boone's bases-loaded groundout with one out 
in the 10th inning lifted the Reds at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Newly acquired Brian Hunter homered in his second consecutive game for the 
Reds. Real Clout

THE STREAK EXTENDS WITH THREADS OF STEEL; BASEBALL: THE ORIOLES' RIPKEN WILL 
PLAY IN HIS 2,000TH CONSECUTIVE GAME TODAY, A REMARKABLE FEAT FOR A SHORTSTOP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From The Baltimore Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The date was May 29, 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Reagan had been president for 494 days. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the last year of Earl Weaver's first term as manager of the Baltimore 
Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks Robinson was more than a year away from his induction into the Hall of 
Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Mattingly was more than three months away from his major league debut. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny Oates was in his first season as a manager, with the double-A Nashville 
Sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colts were still in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 And Cal Ripken Jr. didn't play the second game of a doubleheader against the 
Toronto Blue Jays. That's the last time the Orioles have taken the field 
without Ripken in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody could have guessed it at the time, but Memorial Day, 1982, was the 
start of something special. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 12 years later, The Streak is baseball's most amazing feat and 
Ripken perhaps the game's most respected performer. He commands adulation from 
his peers and fans alike. 
</P>
<P>
 Barring the unexpected, such as another collapsed ceiling, or the unspeakable, 
Ripken will play his 2,000th consecutive game in Minnesota today. He has tried 
to approach it as merely another game with a number, but this one is rounded 
off as much as possible to Lou Gehrig's all-time record of 2,130 and cannot be 
ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 While Ripken attempts to look at The Streak as a result of circumstances and 
good fortune, others are astounded by the magnitude of what he has 
accomplished. So much so, in fact, that they struggle for words while trying to 
describe it. Asked what 2,000 consecutive games meant to them, former teammate 
Mike Flanagan and Oates used an identical phrase. "It's mind-boggling." 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't even remember that far back," Oates said. "It boggles my mind to 
think of the stuff I've done in my life since he began that streak. My son 
hadn't even started school yet -- and now he's getting ready to go to college." 
</P>
<P>
 Flanagan has watched Ripken from three vantage points. He was with the Orioles 
when Ripken started his career and when his own ended. In between, he got an 
opponent's look while with the Toronto Blue Jays, and he now observes as a 
television commentator. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just think it's incredible," Flanagan said. "It's tough to comprehend. It 
hits me almost every day now -- if I stub my toe or something else freaky 
happens. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the amazing things about it is that he doesn't have any apprehension 
at all. You'd see that in the clubhouse -- but he's still one of the most 
playful players in there." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, some would shudder if they saw some of the antics Ripken engages in 
with Ben McDonald -- or watched him torment clubhouse attendant Butch Burdett. 
"He's still a kid who likes to have fun," Oates said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "This thing that happened," Ripken said, choosing his words cautiously when 
referring to The Streak, "is a byproduct of the type of player I am. I was 
fortunate enough, after a slow start, to get established early as an everyday 
player. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't platooned, I wasn't pinch-hit for, at least not after the very 
beginning, and they didn't feel a need to take me out for defense," he said. "I 
had some quick success and got established early. I had a desire to play and 
five managers who wanted to put me out there. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I've done is maintain my approach to the game. I try to do everything in 
my 13th year the same way I did in my first -- and my managers have allowed me 
to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The most astounding thing about The Streak is that Ripken has played all but 
27 of the games at shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
 "To play as demanding a position as he does and to play it as well as he does 
is unbelievable," said the Detroit Tigers' Alan Trammell. "He has got to be as 
strong mentally as anybody who has ever played this game. There is no question 
in my mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been fortunate as far as avoiding major injuries. But he's also needed 
to be mentally strong to perform every day -- to want to perform every day. He 
never gives in mentally."

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; KEY WINS NO. 16 AS YANKEES SWEEP INDIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jimmy Key became the majors' first 16-game winner as the New York Yankees 
continued their domination of the Cleveland Indians, 4-1, on Sunday at New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yankees' three-game sweep improved New York to 9-0 against the Indians 
this season. The Yankees have won 11 in a row against the Indians dating to 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Key (16-3) benefited from four double plays and two sparkling defensive plays. 
The left-hander had been roughed up in his previous two outings, but held the 
Indians to six hits in eight innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "They made some great plays behind me to enable me to do that," Key said. "I'm 
sure on the other side they're saying there's no way we can lose nine games to 
them, and they're probably right. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever voodoo we're holding over them or whatever you call it, I hope it's 
still there the next time we play them." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Wickman got Albert Belle to hit a sacrifice fly with the bases loaded for 
the second out in the ninth, and Steve Howe got the final out for his 15th 
save. 
</P>
<P>
 New York has won 14 of 17 games since the All-Star break and leads the 
second-place Baltimore Orioles by eight games in the American League East. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul O'Neill leaped to the top of the right field wall to rob Indian leadoff 
hitter Kenny Lofton in the first, and center fielder Bernie Williams cut off 
Eddie Murray's line drive to right-center leading off the fifth, throwing 
Murray out attempting to stretch it into a double. 
</P>
<P>
 New York scored three times against Dennis Martinez (10-6) in the first inning 
with the aid of Belle's two-run throwing error. 
</P>
<P>
 Belle, who begins a six-day, seven-game suspension today as a result of his 
use of a corked bat, had six hits and four runs batted in during the three-game 
series, giving him 98 RBIs and raising his batting average to .359. "Right now, 
after losing three ballgames here, it's a tough time to lose Albert," teammate 
Candy Maldonado said. "He's been the heart and soul of the middle of the 
lineup." 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City 9, Minnesota 5 -- The streaking Royals won their ninth in a row, 
holding off the Twins to complete a three-game sweep at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 The Royals got three doubles during a four-run second inning and 16 hits to 
extend their longest winning streak in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Winning is such a motivating thing," said Vince Coleman, who had three stolen 
bases in his first start since July 24. "It's great to see the excitement in 
this clubhouse, the excitement among the guys. It's a winning atmosphere. We're 
contenders now. We've got the fans behind us. We're playing winning baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman, Bob Hamelin and David Howard each drove in two runs for Kansas City, 
which last won nine in a row Aug. 15-23, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Rusty Meacham (3-3) got the victory in relief of Tom Gordon, who could not get 
out of the fifth despite the offensive support. Meacham gave up only one hit in 
2 1/3 innings. Gordon gave up five runs and six hits in 4 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota starter Jim Deshaies (5-11) gave up five runs and six hits in 1 2/3 
innings. He lasted only 1 1/3 innings in his last start against Kansas City on 
May 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto 6, Baltimore 4 -- John Olerud homered and tripled as the Blue Jays 
built a five-run lead and held on at Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 Olerud hit his 10th homer, a two-run shot, in a four-run second inning against 
Ben McDonald (12-7). Down, 6-1, the Orioles fought back but suffered their 
ninth loss in 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey Hammonds had three hits and Mark McLemore drove in two runs for 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Guzman (11-10) gave up four runs and six hits in 5 1/3 innings to improve 
to 5-1 in his last six starts. Darren Hall, the last of four Toronto pitchers, 
worked the ninth for his 14th save. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 8, Seattle 1 -- Lance Johnson hit a grand slam to cap a five-run sixth 
inning at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 The final game at Comiskey Park before the Aug. 12 strike deadline drew a 
crowd of 42,507. That pushed the series total to 126,025, the largest 
three-game crowd since the new Comiskey opened in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory also gave the White Sox a two-game lead in the American League 
Central after Cleveland lost to New York, 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson Alvarez (12-6) gave up a first inning run on a single and Jay Buhner's 
run-scoring double, then held the Mariners in check. He gave up four hits in 
eight innings, struck out three and walked one. Seattle, which has lost its 
last seven games, had only one hit after the second. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 5, Boston 2 -- Five Brewer pitchers combined on a seven-hitter at 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaime Navarro (4-7), who entered the game in the second inning when starter 
Ricky Bones left because of a strained right hip muscle, gave up three hits in 
4 1/3 innings and struck out five. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 5, Oakland 4 -- Junior Felix's two-run double capped a three-run 
comeback in the seventh inning at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers trailed, 4-1, but Oakland's bullpen couldn't hold the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Storm Davis (1-3) got the victory with two innings of relief. Ed Vosberg (0-1) 
pitched to three Tiger batters in the seventh and gave up two hits and a walk. 
His last victory was with Oakland on June 21, 1993.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; STATUS QUO NOW APPEALS TO REINSDORF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton hopes there isn't a baseball strike, and Chicago White Sox 
owner Jerry Reinsdorf broke ranks Sunday by saying he would be willing to have 
an agreement without a salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, at a Saturday night appearance in Cleveland, said he hoped there 
won't be a work stoppage but didn't say whether he would do anything about the 
threatened Aug. 12 strike by the Major League Baseball Players Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first 15 people I shook hands with said, 'Can't you do anything about the 
baseball strike?' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reinsdorf said at Comiskey Park that he could live with no change in the 
players' salary structure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, I'd be willing to sign for the same system," he said. "I don't 
want to go out, I really don't. There is no gain for us. Even if we get 
everything we are looking for, whatever we would save in the cap we lose in 
revenue sharing. The best deal for us is to keep playing." 
</P>

 A small, looped red ribbon on their uniforms and an emotional pre-game 
ceremony Sunday made the San Francisco Giants the nation's first professional 
sports team to raise funds to fight AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants held "Until There's A Cure Day" and will donate $1 from every 
ticket sold to San Francisco Bay area non-profit organizations. They expected 
to raise more than $100,000 for AIDS treatment and research. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Magowan, team president and managing general partner, said the Giants 
embraced the cause because of a "responsibility to the community." He said the 
Giants sought to dispel many of the misconceptions about AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is a controversial cause," Magowan said. "A lot of people 
associate it with a certain lifestyle -- I think incorrectly . . . AIDS can 
affect anybody, whatever lifestyle, whatever sex, whatever age."

QUIET CARLTON, LOQUACIOUS RIZZUTO JOIN HALL; BASEBALL: FORMER PITCHER REVEALS 
LITTLE ABOUT HIMSELF WHILE THE FORMER SHORTSTOP, AS ALWAYS, ISN'T AT A LOSS FOR 
WORDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Steve Carlton and Phil Rizzuto entered baseball's Hall of Fame on Sunday 
completely in character -- Carlton displaying little emotion until the end of 
his short speech and Rizzuto bringing down the house with a rambling half-hour 
soliloquy. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlton, stung by a magazine article this year that portrayed him as 
anti-Semitic, had a chance to break the silence that marked half his 24-year 
career and tell the baseball world what he really believes. He chose instead to 
reveal little of himself. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an altogether appropriate setting to honor one of baseball's great 
recluses. The makeshift podium from which Carlton spoke was set on a lawn on 
the outskirts of this quaint village, the deserted Catskill Mountain foothills 
in the background. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlton, 49, lives on a 400-acre spread in the Colorado Rockies. In one of his 
few personal recollections, he spoke of a White House visit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember we were in the White House after we won the World Series in 1980," 
Carlton said. "The next day there was a picture in the papers and I was listed 
as an unnamed Secret Service man." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlton, who struck out 4,136, second only to Nolan Ryan, is the only pitcher 
to win four Cy Young awards. He won 329 games, second among left-handers only 
to Warren Spahn. He credited catcher Tim McCarver, who was in the audience. "He 
forced me to pitch inside," Carlton said. "He'd set up behind the hitters and 
the only thing I could see was the umpire. I was one of the most focused 
pitchers to ever play the game and Timmy remembered everything about 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlton said the trade that sent him from a pennant contender, the St. Louis 
Cardinals, to the woeful Philadelphia Phillies in 1972 was one of the keys to 
his success. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trade was a blessing in disguise," said Carlton, who won 27 games that 
year on a team that won only 59. "It gave me a chance to put my ideas in 
focus." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlton was followed by Leo Durocher's former wife, actress Laraine Day, and 
their son, Chris, in the most riveting part of the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 The feisty Durocher, whose teams won 2,008 games, seventh on the all-time 
list, died in 1991 at 86. He once said he didn't want to go in the Hall of Fame 
after he died. If there was bitterness when he said that, it was forgotten 
Sunday when his son accepted the plaque. 
</P>
<P>
 "His last years were spent hoping he would get a call from the Hall of Fame," 
Chris Durocher said, sobbing and barely audible at times. "At first, I thought 
what a shame it was that he could not have lived to receive it himself. But now 
I know, as I stand here, that my father stands with us here today. I guess he 
got time off for good behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't take a hoarse Rizzuto long to change the somber mood. The 1950 MVP, 
who played on nine American League pennant winners in 13 seasons, was in top 
form. 
</P>
<P>
 Midway through, the former New York Yankee shortstop, and the team's current 
broadcaster, broke up the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people are understanding this speech, raise your hands," said Rizzuto, who 
will turn 77 in September. "My family knows me. They're raising their hands." 
</P>
<P>
 As he was rambling toward the end, Rizzuto told the 34 Hall of Famers on the 
dais they could leave if they wanted to. Johnny Bench and Yogi Berra, Rizzuto's 
former teammate, took the cue and walked off.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; IT'S NOTHING FUNNY WHEN PIAZZA'S HIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Mike Piazza was hit by a bat in left elbow by Andujar Cedeno in the ninth 
inning, causing him a great deal of pain, but he stayed in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bat came around his back and hit me in the funny bone," Piazza said. 
"It's a little sore. . . . it hit pretty hard. It wasn't a glancing blow." 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza, who combined with Rafael Bournigal in the third inning on a key 
pickoff of Scott Servais, praised Bournigal's aggressiveness in the field. 
"Rafael is always out there looking for something to help us out," Piazza said. 
"Rafael was out there sneaking behind the runner and when you have fielders 
like that who are aggressive, it's great. It takes me a little time to pull the 
trigger, but I did and we got him."  
</P>
<P>
 Besides his defense, Bournigal had a two-run single in the eighth that made 
the score 7-1. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After the game, the Astros announced that they had traded right-handed 
reliever Tom Edens to the Philadelphia Phillies for outfielder Milt Thompson. 
The deadline for trading a player without going through waivers was midnight 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ramon Martinez, who had two bad outings before Sunday, said part of his 
success this season is because he is more aggressive. "I didn't worry too much 
about the last two starts because in one I didn't know I was pitching until 
that moment and in the other game I had only three days' rest," Martinez said. 
"But this time I had the rest and I knew I could pitch my game." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, who tired in the ninth inning, was relieved by Todd Worrell, who 
entered the game with a runner on first and none out. Worrell struck out the 
next three batters swinging to end the game. * 
</P>
<P>
 Delino DeShields, who suffers from poor low-arch support, has been wearing 
arches in his shoes the last few games, and says it has made a difference. He 
has stolen eight bases in his last six games, giving him 26 stolen bases this 
season. He has been caught six times. * 
</P>
<P>
 Rudy Seanez has not given up a run in his last five outings. In his last nine 
games he has a 1.98 earned-run average, giving up three runs in 13 2/3 innings. 
He has stranded four of his last five inherited runners and struck out 13. . . 
. The Dodgers have played 41 games before crowds of 40,000 or more this season 
and are 24-17 in those games. The team is 11-7 before crowds of 50,000 or more.

MINOR LEAGUE NOTEBOOK / CHRIS FOSTER: BUCCHERI TIRES OF BEATING AROUND THE 
BUSHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 James Buccheri has spent three seasons trying to prove to the Oakland 
Athletics he is their leadoff man of the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Rickey Henderson keeps hanging around. So Buccheri is doing 
what any red-blooded baseball player would do. He's going to test the 
free-agent market. 
</P>
<P>
 Buccheri, an outfielder for the Tacoma (Wash.) Tigers, the Athletics' triple-A 
team, is in the final year of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, a minor leaguer with no major league experience usually is not in high 
demand during the annual winter bidding. But Buccheri has a couple things going 
for him -- tough financial times and some decent numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to go to a team that will give me a chance to play in the big 
leagues," said Buccheri, who played at Golden West College. "I feel I've shown 
I can play at that level." 
</P>
<P>
 His numbers, though not outstanding, are solid. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, he is hitting .304 and has stolen 21 bases. He has struck out 
only 16 times this season. 
</P>
<P>
 As a minor leaguer, he would be worth far less money for some team who wanted 
to make a low-risk investment. A salary cap would make him even more appealing. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why I wanted to have a big year," Buccheri said. "I feel the numbers 
I've put up should get me invited to a camp." 
</P>
<P>
 Buccheri has averaged 30 stolen bases in six professional seasons. But what 
held him back was his hitting. 
</P>
<P>
 He hit .206 at double-A Huntsville (Ala.) in 1990 and .212 the next season, 
which ended when he broke his ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 "The organization told me that it was too easy to pitch me," Buccheri said. 
"My batting stance made it easy to pitch me inside. They felt that teams would 
pound the ball in on me in the major leagues." 
</P>
<P>
 So Buccheri set out to change. He opened his stance, which raised his average. 
</P>
<P>
 He hit .367 at Reno in 1992 and was promoted to Tacoma, where he hit .299. 
Buccheri hit .276 at Tacoma last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Athletics didn't invite him to camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hoping to get the opportunity," Buccheri said. "But it's all a matter 
of timing. You have to be in the right place at the right time." 
</P>
<P>
 So Buccheri will go looking for that place this fall. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Worth fighting for? Steve Gill, West Palm Beach outfielder, thought it was 
just good hustle. 
</P>
<P>
 He had tried to score from second base on a single and wasn't going to make 
it. So he did what came naturally and tried to bowl over Charlotte (Fla.) 
catcher Daryl Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy, though, did not see the hustle in the play, especially since he was 
clipped in the chin by Gill's elbow. Kennedy turned to the umpire, called time 
out, then jumped Gill. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was completely surprised," Gill said. "The guy even took the time to call 
time out. I wasn't expecting trouble. I thought what I did was part of the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 The free-for-all that followed wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight during the team's game last month resulted in 44 players being 
suspended and a total of $4,425 in fines. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's doubtful whether it will prevent further fights. The example wasn't 
made, mainly because the participants still don't see why they were punished. 
</P>
<P>
 Gill, a former outfielder and pitcher for El Dorado High and Cypress College, 
was suspended three days and fined $125. But there is no lingering guilt. 
</P>
<P>
 "To tell you the truth, I didn't do anything," Gill said. "I was on the ground 
with two or three guys on top of me. But I got fined anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 So did West Palm Beach pitcher Neil Weber, who played at Corona del Mar High. 
He came out of the dugout and was hardly bashful in his participation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone was going crazy and I noticed what I thought was a player running at 
one of our guys," Weber said. "So I tackled him and ripped his jersey." 
</P>
<P>
 Turned out the victim was a coach for Charlotte, who was merely trying to 
break up the fight. Worse yet for Weber, he performed his flying takedown in 
front of the umpires. 
</P>
<P>
 His maneuver cost him $100 and drew a three-day suspension. But it apparently 
didn't teach much of a lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 "If something like that happened again, I'd do the exact same thing," Weber 
said. "You have to back up your teammate no matter what the cost." 
</P>
<P>
 So much for deterrents. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gill's bills: This was not Gill's first brush with league officials. Nor his 
second. 
</P>
<P>
 Gill has been fined three times. It has cost him $200 so far. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first two were for yelling at umpires," Gill said. "The umps aren't very 
good in this league. In fact, they're terrible." 
</P>
<P>
 That's $200 and counting. 
</P>
<P>
 "The league president told our manager that I lead the league in fines," Gill 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If at first you don't succeed . . . : OK, the Lake Elsinore Storm publicity 
department hasn't had the greatest success, but they get an "A" for effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Strike one: 
</P>
<P>
 They tried to lure the "Late Show With David Letterman" to Elsinore by 
inviting Mujibar and Sirajul to take batting practice and serve as bat boys. 
The two men, who became cult figures through their appearances on the Letterman 
show, made a cross-country tour, sending Letterman reports from Niagara Falls 
to Las Vegas. But the tour, and gag, ended before the Storm made their offer. 
Oops. 
</P>
<P>
 Strike Two: 
</P>
<P>
 The Storm tried a promotion to "Outdraw the Padres" last week. The San Diego 
Padres drew 9,195 that night, 3,000 more than the Storm. Close, but no cigar. 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes the latest from those whiz kids in Elsinore: 
</P>
<P>
 "Seek Shelter form the Strike with the Storm."  
</P>
<P>
 Should a strike halt play, all major league tickets will be honored at Storm 
games during their three-game series Aug. 12-14 against the San Jose Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 What's next, O.J. Simpson Day?

DEL MAR; 3-YEAR-OLD HAS TRAINER CROONING IN THE CROSBY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trainer Richard Mandella won the $107,400 Bing Crosby Handicap at Del Mar on 
Sunday, but it was with his 9-1 shot, not the 4-5 favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 Running two horses in a six-furlong sprint and then drawing the outside posts 
in an eight-horse field is not any trainer's idea of luck, but Mandella took 
both first and second money as King's Blade made the lead on the turn and then 
held off his more highly regarded stablemate, Memo, by a half-length. 
</P>
<P>
 King's Blade, one of only two 3-year-olds in the race, had a ground-saving 
trip under Corey Nakatani while Paul Atkinson, Memo's jockey, had to come six 
lanes wide as they tried to overtake the leaders. The two 7-year-old geldings 
in the race, Memo and Gundaghia, finished second and third, two lengths apart. 
</P>
<P>
 King's Blade, carrying 112 pounds, nine less than the top-weighted Memo, was 
timed in 1:08 3/5 and paid $20.60. First was worth $62,400. 
</P>
<P>
 King's Blade, owned by Tom Gamel and Burt Kinerk, stayed within a half-length 
of Trouble Onthe Line, a 48-1 shot, in the run down the backstretch, then 
Nakatani moved to the front as they approached the quarter pole. 
</P>
<P>
 "He broke a little slow, but he got going with it down the backstretch," 
Nakatani said. "I sort of nursed him into the far turn, then he went on with it 
by himself from there. I asked him to lay his body down in the stretch, and he 
did it." 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Delahoussaye, who had been riding Memo, rides heavier than Nakatani and 
would not have been able to make the 112-pound weight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Mandella told me that I had to make 112 for the mount, and I did it," 
Nakatani said. 
</P>
<P>
 In explaining the jockey switch, Mandella said: "We'll have to make this up to 
Eddie down the road. It really hurt not to let Eddie ride him, but I thought he 
needed the break with 112." 
</P>
<P>
 King's Blade's career started last year in a $40,000 claiming race at 
Churchill Downs. He broke his maiden by 11 lengths three weeks later at Turfway 
Park, and after winning another race in Kentucky, he has been on a stakes diet 
this year in California. He won the Bolsa Chica and the San Pedro at Santa 
Anita this winter and has run only one bad race, when Mandella tried him in a 
grass sprint. 
</P>
<P>
 The Crosby was King's Blade's first start in two months. "I ran him out of 
desperation," Mandella said. "There were no sprints for 3-year-olds around, so 
I decided to throw him in against the older horses. I figured that if he did 
all right, it would give us a lot of options down the line." 
</P>
<P>
 Those options might lead to the $1-million Breeders' Cup Sprint, a six-furlong 
race at Churchill Downs on Nov. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Memo has three victories and six seconds in his last 10 races. "I had to spot 
that other horse (nine pounds)," Atkinson said. "Too much." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Airistar, trained by Lewis Cenicola and ridden by Alex Solis, beat Avie's Song 
by a half-length in Sunday's other stake, the $62,150 Fleet Treet. 
</P>
<P>
 Favored Klassy Kim reared in the gate, suffered minor injuries and was 
scratched. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the fourth race, first-time starter Our Dutch Pal dumped his jockey, Chris 
Antley, in front of the stands during the post parade, and ran off before 
outriders effectively caught him on the backstretch. 
</P>
<P>
 The 40-1 shot was allowed to run by the stewards, trailed early and finished a 
distant last.

OP PRO SURFING CHAMPIONSHIPS; MACHADO WINS DUEL WITH SLATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After five dawn-to-dusk days of competition, the 13th Annual Op Pro Surfing 
Championships came down to a familiar rivalry -- Rob Machado versus Kelly 
Slater. 
</P>
<P>
 As the final four surfers paddled out, Machado took a lonely route into the 
two- and three-foot waves on the south end of the beach. Slater took main 
stage, just south of the pier, in front of Sunday's estimated crowd of 20,000. 
And in the end, Machado's strategy proved more effective. 
</P>
<P>
 Posting seven- and eight-point waves, Machado won the final round with a score 
of 29.11, the event's highest. 
</P>
<P>
 Slater showed his quickness and power with vertical moves and precision turns, 
but was not able to catch as many large waves or long rides as Machado. 
Australians Jake Spooner and Matt Hoy finished third and fourth. Both started 
slowly but Spooner made a late run to finish .36 points behind Slater. 
</P>
<P>
 Frieda Zamba of Flagler Beach, Fla., won the women's competition to take home 
her sixth Op Pro title. Joel Tudor of San Diego won the longboard division and 
Kalani Robb of Sunset Beach, Hawaii, won the Op Junior amateur division. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was always trying to paddle out down the beach away from the other guys and 
it paid off," Machado said. 
</P>
<P>
 As amateurs, Machado and Slater boosted their careers with victories in the Op 
Junior -- Slater in 1989 and Machado two years later. As professionals, they 
compete against each other in 11 world championship tour events and many 
qualifying series contests, such as the Op Pro. 
</P>
<P>
 In two previous meetings this year in Huntington Beach, Machado, who lives in 
Cardiff, lost twice to Slater of Cocoa Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 "He got me at the Bud event and he got me at Katin," Machado said. "Pay-backs 
are sweet." 
</P>
<P>
 In the men's quarterfinals, Machado caught a last-minute wave and scored an 
eight to go ahead of Shane Beschen, a San Clemente surfer who had been pressing 
Machado since the two began competition Friday. Machado and defending Op Pro 
champion Sunny Garcia advanced from that heat with Beschen finishing third. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a tight heat this morning. I lucked into that tube ride at the end 
and the judges gave me the score," Machado said. "It's like ice skating, they 
don't have to give it to you." 
</P>
<P>
 In the final, the crowd on the beach cheered for Slater, but the loudest 
support went to Machado. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels really good to hear that," Machado said. "I mean that's why I'm 
where I am in surfing. It's because people like to watch me surf." 
</P>
<P>
 Machado took home the winner's share of $6,000. Slater won $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
 While accepting her trophy and the check for $1,500, Zamba announced this 
would be her last Op Pro. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every year it's a little harder to get that fire going and I have to train 
more," Zamba said. "For the Op, I used to train for two months and for this one 
I trained four." 
</P>
<P>
 Zamba won the world title four times before leaving the tour four years ago. 
She opened a surf shop in Florida and continued to compete selectively. In 
January, she closed the shop to leave more time for traveling and competing in 
East Coast contests. 
</P>
<P>
 But even in semi-retirement, Zamba cut deep into every turn, slicing off the 
top of the wave, and completed a 360 before the final heat was over. Lisa 
Andersen of Ormond Beach, Fla., was right behind her. The lead changed five 
times in the 30-minute heat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I bit it a couple times in the beginning so I was trying to regain composure 
before taking riskier moves," Zamba said. "When the heat's close, you take 
chances." 
</P>
<P>
 Zamba had 22.63 points to Andersen's 22.27. Neridah Falconer of Australia 
finished third and Rochelle Ballard from Kuaui, Hawaii, finished fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my fifth second this year," Andersen said, "so it's kind of 
frustrating. But I set myself up well for next week." 
</P>
<P>
 Zamba and Andersen will compete in the U.S. Open of Surfing, which begins 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Op Junior, Robb combined floaters and cutbacks to score an 8.17, the 
third-highest wave of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the end of a perfect year for me," Robb said, referring to his 
earlier victory at the Amateur World Championships. The Op Junior was his last 
contest as an amateur. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Curran of Oxnard gave Robb a fight but settled for second place and said 
he is determined to win next year when Robb is a professional. Sunday's results

OP PRO SURFING CHAMPIONSHIPS; TUDOR EARNS PRAISE, RESPECT WITH TUBE RIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The highest-scoring wave of the Op Pro Surfing Championships didn't go to 
men's champion Rob Machado or runner-up Kelly Slater. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't go to women's champion Frieda Zamba, who's making a habit of winning 
at the Huntington Beach Pier. Nor was it scored by Op Junior champion Kalani 
Robb, the defending world junior amateur champion. 
</P>
<P>
 No, the best wave on a day of lifeless two- and three-foot conditions went to 
San Diego's Joel Tudor, who pulled into a small tube ride and scored a 9.0 out 
of 10 on his way to winning his first Op Pro longboard championship. 
</P>
<P>
 So what was it like in the tube ride, Joel? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," he said. "I had my eyes closed (because of water in them) and 
I couldn't see a thing. Then I popped out and the crowd was going crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 So were the judges, who gave him the near-perfect score on his fifth wave of 
the final, putting him in the lead for good. 
</P>
<P>
 The wave set the pace for a four-wave total of 26.3 as Tudor easily held off a 
charging Israel Paskowitz of San Clemente, who was called for interference in 
the final seconds and dropped from second to fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Tudor earned $1,500 for the victory and Huntington Beach's Joey Hawkins, the 
1992 world champion, earned $900 for second. Hawaii's Bonga Perkins received 
$600 for third and Paskowitz went home with $400 and memories of the costly 
interference call. 
</P>
<P>
 Tudor had a comfortable lead going into the final minute, with Paskowitz in 
second at 23.85. But Paskowitz dropped in front of Tudor on a wave, and the 
judges penalized him for the interference. As a result, judges scored Paskowitz 
on three waves instead of four and it dropped him behind Hawkins and Perkins. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a risk surfers often take during paddle battles for waves in the finals 
seconds of contests. Sometimes aggressiveness pays off, but it in this case, it 
didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him (Paskowitz), 'Don't go, don't go,' " Tudor said, "but he went 
anyway. You have to cover your butt. If it's a good wave and you're in second 
place, you can't let somebody take off. I thought I would stop him from going, 
but he took off anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always a bummer when somebody screws up on their last wave. He went from 
making a lot of money to no money, all because of one stupid mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 Tudor knows. He has done it himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many, many times," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tudor, 18, is already an experienced veteran of longboard surfing, which has 
become more popular with his generation over the past few years. Tudor rides 
the nine-foot longboard better than most people ride shortboards, using the 
traditional noseride and sweeping turns but also incorporating shortboard moves 
such as floaters and 360s. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's small waves brought out his creativity. He fell attempting a noseride 
on one of his early waves. But he came back later in the heat with the tube 
ride and a 360-degree tail slide in which he was caught sideways on the board 
for a few seconds, but eventually spun it around with some fancy footwork. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you get a big wave like that (the 9.0) you can sit back and wait for 
good ones," he said. "I thought I was doing terrible in the beginning, but 
getting a big score like that gives you the confidence you need later in the 
heat." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's victory was Tudor's second in Huntington Beach this year. He won the 
Bud Pro tour event at state beach in May, then took two months off doing 
promotional work and touring Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a nice break," he said. "I had nothing to do with surfing. It was 
insane. I've been doing it every summer. I just got home a couple days ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Tudor gets today off before returning to the pier Tuesday morning for 
longboarding heats at the U.S. Open of Surfing, a world championship tour 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the big one," Tudor said. "This one (the Op) is just a little sample." 
</P>
<P>
 Tudor, Paskowitz, Perkins and Hawkins will all be back for the U.S. Open. 
Among the first of Tudor's well-wishers after Sunday's final was Hawkins, the 
Huntington Beach local who will no doubt be looking for revenge this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Congratulations, ding-dong," Hawkins said, shaking Tudor's hand and laughing.

<TEXT>
<P>
 After five dawn-to-dusk days of competition at the Huntington Beach pier, the 
Op Pro Surfing championships came down to a familiar rivalry featuring two of 
America's best surfers -- Rob Machado against Kelly Slater. 
</P>
<P>
 And when it was over Sunday before 20,000, Machado, from Cardiff-by-the-Sea, 
was the victor, scoring seven- and eight-point rides for a final-round score of 
29.11, the highest of the meet.Surfers are judged on their four best rides 
during 30-minute heats. 
</P>
<P>
 Slater, from Cocoa Beach, Fla., performed quickly and powerfully in the two- 
to three-foot surf, but his rides were not as long as Machado's. 
</P>
<P>
 Frieda Zamba, of Flagler Beach, Fla., won the women's competition. Joel Tudor 
of San Diego won the longboard division and Kalani Robb of Sunset Beach, 
Hawaii, won the Op Junior amateur division. JODY BERGER

OUCHI WILL PUT BUSINESS IDEAS TO WORK FOR RIORDAN; CITY HALL: NEW CHIEF OF 
STAFF HAS SUCCESSFULLY ADVISED CORPORATE LEADERS. HE SAYS CONCEPTS WILL WORK IN 
POLITICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN PETERSON and TED ROHRLICH, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan needed to find someone to fill the 
powerful role of chief of staff, the search literally lasted about a second. 
The one name on his list was William G. Ouchi. 
</P>
<P>
 Theirs would seem to be a match made in management heaven: The mayor, who 
wants to take more control of a sprawling, untamed city government, and Ouchi, 
the scholar who has made a career of advising corporate executives faced with 
similar challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good fit," said Ouchi, a UCLA professor of management, consultant to 
Fortune 500 companies -- and City Hall novice -- who will take a substantial 
pay cut to help his friend of 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Ouchi's grand adventure in City Hall will be an experiment in applying ideas 
from the world of business to the world of politics. Riordan calls Ouchi his 
chief "strategist and tactician" as they seek to transform the bureaucratic 
culture in accord with the mayor's mantra: Take chances. Make mistakes. Ask for 
forgiveness later. In the long term, the two also hope to amend the City 
Charter to give the mayor more constitutional clout. 
</P>
<P>
 Ouchi (pronounced O-chee) says he has hurdled similar Mission Impossible 
barriers, helping private companies overhaul their organizational structures. 
Indeed, he contends that corporate and academic politics are every bit as 
Byzantine and nasty as the real thing, and that he is up to his new task. 
</P>
<P>
 Soft-spoken and personable, Ouchi makes it sound simple. "Half of it is 
technically understanding how the organization works and how it could be 
reconstituted. The other half is understanding the politics," said the 
51-year-old scholar, who spent the first year of the Riordan Administration as 
an off-the-books consultant in the mayor's back office, quietly studying the 
city bureaucracy and mapping ambitious plans to overhaul it. 
</P>
<P>
 Ouchi spent the first days after his appointment meeting many of the 15 City 
Council members for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of them were impressed. Zev Yaroslavsky, chairman of the budget 
committee, said Ouchi should not be underestimated as some ivory tower guru. 
"He works and plays in the real world also," Yaroslavsky said. 
</P>
<P>
 But other insiders asked whether Riordan was wise to take his top staff job 
away from William McCarley, a 33-year City Hall veteran, and put it in the 
hands of an academic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is L.A. ready for egghead politics?" wondered political consultant Joe Scott, 
who worked on Riordan's campaign but did not join his Administration. Scott 
said he could recall no other big city where the mayor had made a similar 
appointment. "You can play with models all you want but in the real world there 
are tensions, crises, things that need to move quicker than in the lab." 
</P>
<P>
 Ouchi brings minister-like passion to his work, which attempts to make 
organizations function more productively. A key to his strategy is empowering 
individuals to realize greater potential in organizations that often squash 
initiative and reserve power for a few higher-ups. 
</P>
<P>
 Ouchi, who grew up in a Japanese American family of professionals in Honolulu, 
once considered becoming a minister, but changed his mind in college when "I 
discovered that I loved the study of human behavior in small groups." 
</P>
<P>
 He achieved commercial success with his best-selling book "Theory Z," a 
treatise on how U.S. companies could learn from Japanese management techniques. 
Its key message: "No one is smart enough to tell another person how best to 
perform his or her job." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet for all the humanism inherent in his theories, Ouchi has been known 
occasionally to trample on the feelings of some near him who thought their own 
potential was overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
 He has offended some City Hall workers by bringing in high-powered outside 
consultants to do work, such as staging mayoral appearances, that employees 
felt they were capable of doing themselves. One City Hall colleague, who asked 
not to be named, described Ouchi as "quite the elitist." 
</P>
<P>
 He also has his share of contradictions: Ouchi typically displays impeccable 
manners and charm, yet sometimes surprises co-workers by appearing to ignore 
them when he passes by in the hall. 
</P>
<P>
 He was driven enough, he said, to work 110 hours a week for years, as an 
assistant professor striving to climb the academic ladder. Yet he seems relaxed 
and has a sense of whimsy, reflected by the sound-activated, fake fish in his 
office that wags its tail when he snaps his finger. 
</P>
<P>
 Changing human behavior, of course, takes more than the snap of a finger. 
</P>
<P>
 Ouchi has used lengthy questionnaires to uncover what people inside an 
organization really think and to facilitate change. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, for example, he helped Amgen, a huge biotech firm, figure out how 
to get new drugs to world markets more quickly. The company had been faced with 
making applications that often ran as long as 100,000 pages in an overall 
development process that has cost more than $200 million, said its chairman, 
Gordon M. Binder. 
</P>
<P>
 Ouchi helped figure out a way to streamline the process by negotiating a new 
plan for which groups of employees got involved -- and when. 
</P>
<P>
 In his personal life, Ouchi also has flourished as a negotiator -- maneuvering 
between suspicious, even hostile factions. 
</P>
<P>
 He played a key, behind-the-scenes role in arranging the controversial merger 
of two of the most prestigious private schools in Los Angeles in 1989, 
all-girls Westlake and all-boys Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
 Ouchi, who had children at both schools, was a Westlake trustee. Passions ran 
high among loyalists of both schools. Ouchi's own daughter stopped speaking to 
him briefly when she learned that he was pushing for the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said that although he loved the idea of all-girls education, he had no 
choice, because Westlake faced financial jeopardy unless the deal went through. 
"My obligation as a trustee went beyond my own children." 
</P>
<P>
 Ouchi's unusual journey to City Hall began in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 His father was a successful dentist, and the family was close to a 
Congregationalist minister who lived next door. The minister took Ouchi under 
his wing and arranged for him to spend part of a summer milking cows in New 
England when Ouchi was 11. Ouchi also visited prestigious Williams College on 
that trip -- and from then on there was no doubt that was where he would go. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, where Ouchi is now a trustee, had a special tie to the pastor's 
church. It had sent Christian missionaries to Hawaii in the 19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Ouchi considered the ministry the highest calling but decided he lacked the 
necessary discipline. He toyed with becoming a doctor, until a professor 
dissuaded him. "I am personally affronted by your performance on this 
examination," the professor wrote on Ouchi's chemistry exam. 
</P>
<P>
 Ouchi, whose own life provided some rare windows into Japanese corporate 
behavior, was ultimately drawn to the study of management. 
</P>
<P>
 His father-in-law utilized some Japanese principles in running his insurance 
business in Hawaii. And his wife's uncle was an attorney advising Sony Chairman 
Akio Morita on how to operate in the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
 Ouchi vaulted to public prominence in 1981 by melding his knowledge of 
Japanese and American management techniques in "Theory Z," based on his 
research at Hewlett-Packard and other corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming at a time of rising concern about Japan's economic challenge to the 
United States, "Theory Z" reported Ouchi's view of the strengths of Japanese 
management, such as an inclusive, consensus style of decision-making, with more 
responsibility vested in the rank and file. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, it offered a comforting message to Americans who were increasingly 
anxious about Japan: that country's approach was at least partly transferable 
to corporate America. 
</P>
<P>
 Involved workers, he wrote, "are the key to increased productivity." 
</P>
<P>
 "Theory Z," a bestseller for five months, was published in 14 foreign editions 
-- and transformed Ouchi from anonymous scholar to sought-after speaker and 
consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael S. Leeds recalls that after reading the book, his father invited Ouchi 
to the summer conference of their family firm, CMP Publications on Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came in and trained all the managers of the company in consensus 
decision-making and shared responsibility," said Leeds, president of the 
family-owned publisher. 
</P>
<P>
 That was 10 years ago. Today, it remains one of Ouchi's two private clients, 
along with Amgen. 
</P>
<P>
 Ouchi met Riordan through a mutual friend. When Ouchi moved to Southern 
California to work at UCLA, he and his wife of 28 years settled in what has 
become the fashionable, north-of-Montana Avenue section of Santa Monica. A 
neighbor was Carl McKinzie, the mayor's law partner. 
</P>
<P>
 As a favor to McKinzie, Ouchi spoke at seminars for the law firm's clients, 
one of whom invited him to serve on a corporate board with Riordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan, whose personal wealth is estimated at $100 million, hit what he calls 
his "home run" with that firm, Convergent Technologies, which pioneered 
"intelligent" computer work stations, made possible by the advent of smaller 
computer chips. He saw his investment multiply nearly 300 times. 
</P>
<P>
 As Ouchi and Riordan flew back and forth to board meetings in San Jose, the 
two men got to know each other well. 
</P>
<P>
 It was on one of their trips that Ouchi asked Riordan why he had never given 
money to UCLA. Riordan, a noted philanthropist, replied that he had never been 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next eight months, the men squabbled over how to structure what 
became the Riordan Scholars program, which teaches minority high school 
students about business. They also worked on a management program for minority 
college students and summer studies for professors at black colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 A mutual admiration emerged. The two men treated one another as equals, a bond 
that even now distinguishes Ouchi's relationship with the mayor from that of a 
typical assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 "It became instantly clear that I couldn't simply tell Dick what I wanted him 
to do and he would keel over . . . and he couldn't tell me what he wanted me to 
do and have me keel over," recalls Ouchi. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the two are almost like family. When Riordan moved into City Hall, he 
stationed Ouchi in his inner office. Riordan, whose aides often describe him as 
a visionary, describes Ouchi as his "strategist and tactician. He's a visionary 
too." 
</P>
<P>
 For his own part, Ouchi describes his boss in terms that many subordinates 
would not dare. "Like many creative people, he's not fully socialized," Ouchi 
said of the mayor. Riordan, he explained, is an original thinker who is not 
especially concerned with conventional ways to solve problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, Ouchi can claim impact. He played a key role in drafting Riordan's 
five-year plan to add nearly 3,000 police officers. He also brought together a 
group of business executives who proposed ways to tap city pension funds, 
improve bill collections and wring money out of city departments. 
</P>
<P>
 During the first year, a private, nonprofit group funded by the business 
community helped pay Ouchi and reimbursed UCLA for his $120,000 salary. Now 
that he has agreed to take a staff position, that setup has been scrapped and 
Ouchi is braced for a big pay cut. 
</P>
<P>
 All told -- counting speeches and consulting fees -- he has customarily earned 
between half a million and $1 million a year, said one associate. Ouchi 
declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 In a compensation package that is still being negotiated, Ouchi will probably 
be paid about $100,000 by the mayor's office and be allowed to keep consulting 
for Amgen and CMP Publications, since neither does business with the city. But 
he will have to give up far more lucrative speechmaking for fear of running 
into conflicts of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Ouchi said he is not sure how long he will stay in his new job. It depends, he 
said, on how long his colleagues at UCLA are willing to do without his services 
and on how effective he is. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenge he faces is truly daunting -- reorganizing a $9-billion city 
government, enlisting the cooperation of 40,000 employees and a sometimes 
hostile City Council, and somehow finding the money to put more police on the 
streets, upgrade technology and retrain workers. 
</P>
<P>
 To do these things, Ouchi knows he will have to build a reliable coalition for 
the mayor on the City Council. Ultimately, he hopes the council will give up 
some of its own power by putting a charter amendment on the ballot that would 
"rebalance" the system. The City Charter ordains a weak mayor system; power was 
further eroded by Proposition 5. 
</P>
<P>
 That measure, passed in 1991 in the wake of the Police Commission's attempt to 
discipline former Chief Daryl F. Gates, gave the council unprecedented 
authority to veto decisions by influential commissions appointed by the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound impossible? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the kind of thing I work on," Ouchi said.

NEWS ANALYSIS; DEMOCRATS FIND THE RIGHT'S STUFF: FAMILY VALUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD BROWNSTEIN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here's a sign of the times: Former Education Secretary William J. Bennett, 
whose moralizing "Book of Virtues" has been lodged near the top of the 
bestseller list for months, now has on his desk requests from about 100 
Republican candidates to come and speak on their behalf in the fall election. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's another: In Tennessee, moderate Democratic Sen. Jim Sasser opened his 
reelection campaign recently with a television ad that announced he's "working 
to strengthen moral values: (with) prayer in school and welfare reform that 
emphasizes work." 
</P>
<P>
 In Michigan, Republican Senate hopeful Spencer Abraham is running ads that 
portray him as a "young father, raising his twin daughters with the traditional 
values he learned growing up in mid-Michigan" and declare, "In a time of moral 
crisis, he's ready to fight for our families." In Georgia, Democratic Gov. Zell 
Miller says government programs must reflect and reinforce the "same values I 
learned at my mother's knee." 
</P>
<P>
 From coast to coast, moral decline is rocketing to the top of the agenda for 
campaign 1994. In a growing number of races for state and federal office, 
candidates are lining up to lament the trends in American family life -- and 
linking problems from crime to the decay of the cities to a perceived breakdown 
in the transmission of values from one generation to the next. 
</P>
<P>
 "Values and the breakdown of family is really emerging as an issue," says 
Carter Eskew, a Democratic media consultant. "It has been ascending for a 
while, but it is higher than it has ever been." 
</P>
<P>
 This focus on family sometimes teeters on the edge of smarminess: It has 
already become common for male candidates this year (prominent among them 
Republican Senate hopeful Oliver L. North in Virginia) to air television ads in 
which their wives earnestly testify to their husbands' commitment and 
engagement as fathers. 
</P>
<P>
 But to a substantial extent, this dialogue about values is bubbling up from a 
widespread public anxiety. In a Times Poll last week, for instance, a majority 
of all those surveyed said American families are more threatened by "a moral 
climate that hurts community standards" than by economic strains. 
</P>
<P>
 This bipartisan sermonizing about the nation's moral course represents a 
remarkable political reversal from 1992, when then-Vice President Dan Quayle 
was widely ridiculed on the left for accusing the television program "Murphy 
Brown" of glamorizing out-of-wedlock birth. This year, many Democrats are as 
quick as Republicans to condemn what they identify as damaging trends in 
American culture -- and to insist that policies on crime, welfare and the 
payment of child support demand individual responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1992, we went through a polarizing and largely unserious discussion of 
these issues," says David Blankenhorn, president of the Institute for American 
Values, a centrist think tank in New York City. "But it now appears that was a 
blip, and there is now a very solid agreement . . . that we face a very serious 
problem as a nation." 
</P>
<P>
 For at least the past quarter century, the political debate over values has 
revolved around an almost ritualistic jousting between left and right on the 
conservative social agenda of banning abortion and authorizing prayer in 
schools. Those issues -- and their successor in spirit, gay rights -- remain on 
the card in some races, particularly those involving candidates close to the 
religious conservative movement. 
</P>
<P>
 But especially in statewide elections, these dominant (and often symbolic) 
issues of the 1970s and 1980s are being supplanted by discussion of how values 
and moral standards influence more tangible, everyday concerns -- especially 
crime, educational performance and welfare dependency. 
</P>
<P>
 That grounding to daily life defines this year's emerging politics of values. 
Many factors are encouraging greater political debate about virtue and morals. 
Among them are relative satisfaction with the economy, which opens the space 
for other issues, and a growing interest in values among baby boomers raising 
children of their own, says Democratic pollster Celinda Lake. These issues have 
also moved into the spotlight because of President Clinton's focus on "personal 
responsibility" and deterring out-of-wedlock births. 
</P>
<P>
 But the driving factor may be the growing connection in the public mind 
between family breakdown and crime, the most visceral issue in the midterm 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you ask people how to fix the crime problem, you will get at least a 
plurality saying that it is the breakup of family and single-parent family" 
that has to be dealt with, said Republican pollster Bruce Blakeman. "You will 
get more people saying that you can solve the problem by parents taking control 
of their kids than by locking (criminals) up." 
</P>
<P>
 In campaigns around the country, it has become virtually a stipulated point 
that crime, especially juvenile crime, is rooted in the growing number of 
children growing up in disrupted or dysfunctional families, especially those 
born out of wedlock. (About three in 10 children are born out of wedlock, with 
the figure rising to two in three in the black community.) 
</P>
<P>
 Turning on its head the traditional liberal demand for more focus on "root 
causes" of crime, many conservatives argue that welfare programs exacerbate the 
problem by subsidizing births to single mothers. Jeb Bush, the son of former 
President George Bush who is seeking the GOP gubernatorial nomination in 
Florida, states the emerging Republican creed flatly: "Welfare does not prevent 
crime; welfare causes crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats don't go that far. As in the massive federal crime bill nearing 
final approval in Congress, many Democrats are emulating Clinton's call for 
social policy to balance responsibility with opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 In Colorado, for instance, Democratic Gov. Roy Romer, who is facing a 
difficult reelection fight, is pushing home visitation and parenting classes 
that try to help young parents raise their children and prevent additional 
pregnancies. Georgia Gov. Miller is sponsoring a guaranteed college scholarship 
program for any student who maintains a B average through high school. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the most part, on both welfare and crime policies, Democrats no less 
than Republicans are emphasizing what Romer calls the "iron fist" -- tough 
measures intended to discourage out-of-wedlock births, require work and punish 
those who break the law. It is, in fact, a source of frustration to Republicans 
in many races that they have not been able to open more distance with Democrats 
on these issues, which they have traditionally owned. 
</P>
<P>
 Exceptions remain: The death penalty is sharply separating the parties in 
gubernatorial races in Florida, Illinois, California and New York. In Texas, 
Republican gubernatorial nominee George W. Bush, also a son of the former 
President, is pushing a "family cap" proposal to deny additional benefits to 
women who have more than two children while on welfare and a comprehensive 
juvenile justice reform package that reduces to 14 the age at which violent 
juveniles can be tried as adults. His rival, Democratic incumbent Ann Richards, 
hasn't endorsed either idea, which could become an issue as the campaign 
progresses. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's difficult to find much difference between the television ads of 
typical Senate candidates such as Democrat Joel Hyatt in Ohio and Republican 
Mitt Romney in Massachusetts, both of whom highlight their demand that welfare 
recipients work for their checks. In Georgia, Miller has lobbied into law a 
family cap on welfare and a reduction in the age at which juveniles can be 
tried as adults to 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking over this agenda, some worry about implicit economic and racial bias. 
For all the hand-wringing about children growing up with only one parent, it's 
difficult to find any candidates talking about the high rate of divorce -- 
which tends to be a middle-class problem. Likewise, few candidates are 
discussing the economic strains on working-class and middle-class families that 
compel both parents to work outside the home, leaving less time for their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 In this new moralism, says Blankenhorn, "there is a huge danger" that 
politicians will focus their moral judgment only on groups outside the social 
mainstream. But, he says, there is also the possibility that both parties will 
now "compete for solutions to a problem they both acknowledge and understand in 
the same way." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the campaign dialogue over morals has so far been marked primarily by 
broad agreement between the candidates raising these issues, even on the limits 
of government's role in combatting the trends that concern them. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, for instance, Rep. Michael Huffington (R-Santa Barbara) 
launched his campaign against Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California 
with an ad devoted entirely to touting Bennett's book. Huffington urged 
everyone to read the book and declared it "a great reminder that solving 
problems in our country depends on strong individuals and strong families, not 
on government." 
</P>
<P>
 In all this, candidates risk a cynical shrug from voters who have concluded 
that politicians and virtue go together like whiskey and Seconal. But many 
believe candidates face a greater risk by seeming indifferent to the cultural 
longing evident in the extraordinary response to Bennett's book of fables and 
cautionary tales. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Wehner, an aide to Bennett at the conservative think tank Empower 
America, says: "I think what we're experiencing is analogous to an exploding 
star: Issues explode with the public and it takes a couple of light-years for 
people in the political world to see it." Bennett's 'Book of Virtues' Becomes 
Unlikely Bestseller 
</P>
<P>
 "The Book of Virtues" is one of the most unlikely bestsellers in years. Edited 
by William J. Bennett, who was education secretary during the Reagan 
Administration, the book is a sort of modern "McGuffey's Reader," "intended to 
aid in the time-honored task of the moral education of the young," as Bennett 
writes in the introduction. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than 800 pages, Bennett (with help from assistants) presents dozens 
of poems, fables, speeches and stories from an eclectic assemblage of authors 
leaning heavily toward the classics. Included are works from the Bible, 
Shakespeare, Aesop and Tolstoy -- as well as Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther 
King Jr. and, in a singular gesture of populist empathy, Babe Ruth. 
</P>
<P>
 The selections are intended to illustrate 10 distinct "virtues," from 
self-discipline and compassion to loyalty and faith. The book itself is 
apolitical -- in the introduction Bennett insists that "people of character and 
moral literacy" can be liberal or conservative -- but Bennett himself is 
ordinarily a slashing critic of liberalism and modern cultural trends. He is 
considering a dark-horse race for the Republican presidential nomination in 
1996.

HAVE SCATTERED AROUND THE GLOBE; MORE THAN 380,000 LIVE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. 
THE MONEY THEY SEND TO RELATIVES KEEPS MANILA'S SHAKY ECONOMY AFLOAT.

<P>
 The ad boldly states a basic precept among Philippine expatriates in 
California -- people who may have both feet firmly planted in a new life, but 
maintain deep attachments to the old one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your remittance dollar supports more than just your family. It supports a 
nation," goes the pitch in a recent issue of Philippine News by BPI Express 
Remittance Corp., one of the plethora of foreign exchange services that 
advertise in Filipino community newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, overseas Filipinos -- even naturalized U.S. citizens who have immersed 
themselves in American culture -- say they feel an abiding obligation to send 
money home to their kin. 
</P>
<P>
 The term "remittance dollar" doesn't refer to major infusions of working 
capital or big investments in the Manila stock exchange. Rather, it's a 
collective shower of small cash transfers, generated by Philippine 
professionals and contract workers who span the world. Their payments add up to 
an incredible sum -- billions of dollars a year, the largest single source of 
hard currency for their struggling homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still send back a few hundred dollars every month," said Artemio Pagdan, a 
Pomona physician and Philippine community leader who immigrated in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
 Distinctive among the huddled masses of global economic migration, overseas 
Filipinos represent the elite, high end of the labor market. They are generally 
well-educated and usually accomplished speakers of English. But like other 
itinerant workers, they lack opportunities in the dysfunctional Philippine 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 So women with college degrees serve as maids in Tokyo and Hong Kong. Doctors 
and engineers find employment in Saudi Arabia. Semi-skilled laborers toil in 
Kuwait, while Filipino seamen ply the oceans on the world's ships. Filipino 
business graduates dominate the middle-management ranks of many multinational 
corporations in Southeast Asia, earning wages they couldn't dream of at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Filipinos also make up one of the fastest-growing immigrant groups in the 
United States, accounting for more than one in every five newcomers from Asia 
since the end of World War II. Filipinos outnumber Chinese residents as the 
largest Asian population in Southern California, as well as in the rest of the 
state, and they place a close second nationwide, according to the 1990 U.S. 
Census. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet unlike Chinese or Korean residents, Filipinos tend to scatter rather than 
cluster in ethnic enclaves, quickly assimilating into the American mainstream. 
They are, in their own words, an invisible minority, poorly organized and 
grossly underrepresented in public office. 
</P>
<P>
 But Filipinos stand out, conspicuously, at the banks. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Filipino community wires home about $1 billion in cash each year. As 
the BPI advertisement suggests, Filipinos not only support their relatives, but 
prop up an economy that was looted by the late President Ferdinand Marcos and, 
until recently, crippled by political turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1990 Census counted 1.4 million Filipinos nationwide, more than half in 
California. Unofficial population estimates go as high as 2 million. Whatever 
their numbers, Filipinos are the vanguard of a global expatriate community that 
includes 2.5 million more temporary contract workers in Asia and the Middle 
East, deployed in a Philippine government program for the jobless. (The latter 
group represents about 4% of the total population of 64.2 million.) 
</P>
<P>
 Sordid stories abound of forced prostitution in Japan, physical abuse by 
employers in the Middle East and recruitment fraud in Manila. The Philippine 
public was outraged earlier this year when Malaysian police, looking for 
illegal immigrants, rounded up thousands of Philippine maids attending Easter 
Sunday Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such controversy, no one is complaining about the influx of money. 
Annual worldwide remittances -- through official banking channels as well as 
illicit cash courier services -- are estimated between $2 billion and $6 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 These payments unquestionably are the largest single source of foreign 
exchange reserves available to the Philippine government, providing dollars for 
purchasing strategic imports and making payments on a $34-billion foreign debt. 
They also fuel a vast underground economy that has thrived through years of 
social chaos, official corruption and massive capital flight. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of hundred dollars sent home each month can have a radical effect on 
people's lives -- building houses in depressed rural villages, paying off 
medical bills, sending little brothers and sisters and cousins to school. 
</P>
<P>
 "The remittances by overseas Filipinos to their families are considered direct 
foreign aid, because they do not go through the channels of corruption," said 
Alex A. Esclamado, editor and publisher of Philippine News, which is based in 
South San Francisco and has a national distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 Philippines government statistics show about $1.7 billion was remitted by 
banks worldwide last year, but that figure doesn't count the services of 
non-bank foreign exchange dealers. These money networks cannot pay dollars in 
the Philippines, but they can beat the banks on speed, delivering pesos 
overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an intangible aspect of the local economy in the Philippines," said 
Rodrigo De Leon, Los Angeles branch manger of the Philippine National Bank, 
whose branch alone remits as much as $45 million a year. "It feeds a good part 
of the population which would otherwise be disenfranchised." 
</P>
<P>
 Cash also is routinely concealed in the traditional balik bayen ("homecoming") 
crates shipped through specialized cargo handlers. Expatriates take cash to 
their relatives when they visit or entrust large sums to be hand-carried by 
friends; some use couriers hired by travel agencies, community sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's considered unusual for any Filipino to go home without a wad of money 
for their family, and it's part of our culture to send home packages," said 
Wilma Casaclang, deputy California labor commissioner in Los Angeles. "A good 
90% of Filipino Americans have to send back money. It's an obligation." 
</P>
<P>
 In Tagalog, this obligation is expressed by the term utang na loob , literally 
"debt from within." 
</P>
<P>
 The concept bears resemblance to the Confucian value of filial piety, but it 
applies to downstream relationships -- younger siblings, for example -- as well 
as to elders, patrons and authority figures. In a nation that is predominantly 
Catholic, large extended families tend to compound the debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Casaclang, who came to the United States 30 years ago, said she doesn't send 
money home only because she's the youngest in her family. But she paid her 
school tuition in the Philippines with remittances from seven older siblings 
working and studying abroad. Sometimes she "played tricks," she confessed, 
collecting tuition from all of them at once. 
</P>
<P>
 "There can be negative effects," Casaclang said. "People can lose their 
incentive to work, because the dollars keep coming." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, analysts note that most of the overseas cash spills directly into the 
sieve of consumer spending, without collecting in savings accounts where it 
might be put to productive use by industry, creating jobs that might draw the 
Filipino expatriates back home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their best asset is their human resources, and their No. 1 export is labor," 
said Joyce Chang, an economist with Salomon Brothers in New York and author of 
a favorable report on the Philippine economy. "But overseas remittances aren't 
important in capital formation or portfolio investment flows. I don't see that 
they have much correlation to economic growth." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, gross national product expanded by a surprisingly robust 4.8% during 
the first quarter of this year, exciting interest among financial analysts who 
long have dismissed the Philippines' economy as a basket case. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came back with the feeling that the economy had turned the corner," said 
Suhas L. Ketkar, an economist with CS First Boston who recently visited the 
Philippines. "The change wasn't necessarily economic, though. It's the enhanced 
political stability, and the psychology." 
</P>
<P>
 With this new flicker of hope, the Manila government says human exports -- in 
the form of the government's expansive overseas placement program -- are only a 
short-term solution. It hopes the program will become unnecessary as the 
economy expands. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a temporary program, and we hope the numbers of overseas contract 
workers will lessen once the economy picks up," said Manuel Imson, labor 
attache at the Philippine Embassy in Washington and a high-ranking official in 
the Overseas Employment Administration. "Unfortunately, we haven't seen that 
trend yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Filipinos in America, meanwhile, are warily watching developments back home. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of naturalized Filipino Americans seeking visas to reside in the 
Philippines has risen sharply in recent years, but the scale remains very 
small. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, for example, the Philippine consulate processed 81 such 
applications in 1991; in the first five months of this year, 144 Filipino 
Americans applied for resident visas. The six counties of Southern California 
are, according to census data, home to 387,563 Filipinos, the largest 
concentration outside the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, there are few signs of the kind of "reverse brain-drain" seen in the 
local Taiwanese and Korean communities, observers say. 
</P>
<P>
 "People would rather slug it out here. Most professionals would only consider 
going back as a last resort," said Ernesto Cortez, a civil engineer and 
president of the 150-member Philippine-American Chamber of Commerce in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "But as a businessman, I see opportunities that make it worthwhile to 
consider," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Cortez brought his contracting company to Los Angeles six years ago because 
"business was at a standstill" amid the political turmoil of former President 
Corazon Aquino's administration. He had contracts canceled on the pretext they 
were "tainted by corruption," a charge he vehemently denies. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Cortez plans to invest in a joint venture with an American design firm, 
using the Philippines as a base to target markets throughout Southeast Asia. 
He'll split his time between his adopted U.S. home and his native land. 
</P>
<P>
 At this end, Cortez said his mission is to educate American Filipinos in 
entrepreneurship, which doesn't seem to come naturally to many. Risk-averse and 
steady salary earners, Filipinos prefer to be employees, he said. 
</P>

 "The Filipinos who came here in recent years are career people," Cortez said. 
"It's only after the recession that a lot of professionals are realizing there 
are greater opportunities and considering going into business for themselves. 
But they're doing it very cautiously, not jumping on a bandwagon." 
</P>
<P>
 Filipinos got a late start in the American immigration experience, compared to 
other Asians who began arriving in the late 19th Century. Although the 
Philippines became a U.S. colony in 1898, Filipino contract laborers weren't 
brought in to work the fields of Hawaii and California until the 1920s, after 
exclusionary laws barred entry by Chinese and Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Quevedo's father was among them, one of the venerable manongs (community 
"elders") who arrived as a farm worker in 1924, later to become a labor 
organizer. California-born Quevedo, now a gynecological surgeon practicing in 
Burbank, grew up following the seasonal crops up and down the San Joaquin 
Valley with his family. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I decided that education was the way out of there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger Quevedo went to Manila, where he attended medical school and 
married a Filipina before settling in Los Angeles. He maintains strong ties to 
his ancestral homeland, returning once a year to conduct medical missions in 
rural areas. Keeping with tradition, Quevedo sent back cash to put his niece 
and nephew through school. 
</P>
<P>
 Gregorio Santillan, a biophysicist who teaches at California State University, 
Los Angeles, is another community leader who returns to the Philippines to 
share his expertise. 
</P>
<P>
 A former student dissident who was blacklisted for protesting martial law 
under Marcos, Santillan went back last year to help set up a bio-technology 
program at the University of the Philippines. He is a volunteer in a Manila 
government program called Transfer of Knowledge Through Expatriate Nationals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overall, I felt the situation was very optimistic," he said of his visit, 
"even during the electricity brownouts." 
</P>
<P>
 But Santillan said he is not quite ready to participate in yet another 
government program -- one that offers special incentives for Filipino 
scientists willing to return. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've considered it, but I think I can contribute more to the country by not 
going back permanently. As a scientist, there's better access to information 
here," said Santillan, who has retained his Philippine citizenship, even after 
his wife became a naturalized U.S. citizen and his children were born here. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'd be difficult for my family to go back. The kids are in school; their 
lives are here," he said. "We're very attached to the Philippines and in touch 
with what's happening there, but we're very American too." People Power

 Filipinos are among the most rapidly expanding immigrant groups in America and 
now account for the largest Asian population in Southern Califonia and the 
state as a whole.

PLANT SITING RAISES ISSUE OF ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK CLIFFORD, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Creative, clean and high-tech, it seemed like the sort of entrepreneurial 
enterprise tailor-made for a California economy in dire need of fresh capital 
and pollution-free industry. 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles lawyer with a scientific bent figured out a cheap way to recycle 
chemicals vital to the manufacture of computer circuitry. With a ready market 
in Silicon Valley and a state government determined to keep businesses in 
California, his firm last year became the first to benefit from the state 
Environmental Protection Agency's new streamlined approval process designed to 
avoid the multiyear delays that caused many companies to go elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 A gala groundbreaking was planned. The governor was invited. Officials here 
viewed the firm, called Pure-Etch, as the cornerstone of an industrial revival 
after a dismal decade that saw the loss of nearly 10,000 jobs in Salinas and 
neighboring Watsonville. 
</P>
<P>
 There was only one hitch. 
</P>
<P>
 No one, it seemed, had asked the neighbors, an enclave of Latino farm workers 
and their families, how they felt about living next to a plant that would store 
thousands of pounds of hazardous chemicals. The state's fast-track review, 
which found no threat to human health or safety, never mentioned that there 
would be people living a few hundred feet away, and who might be concerned 
about a possible chemical fire or spill. 
</P>
<P>
 Overnight, Pure-Etch was caught up in a prickly dispute involving charges of 
environmental racism with the Administration of Gov. Pete Wilson on one side 
and a group of prominent Democrats, including U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer and state 
Sens. Art Torres of Los Angeles and Tom Hayden of Santa Monica, on the other. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency also weighed in, under orders from 
the White House to pay special attention to the environmental justice movement 
and its claims that minority communities, lacking political influence, are 
overburdened with industrial hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 Active on a number of fronts in California, the movement has sought to curtail 
air pollution from oil refineries bordering low-income neighborhoods in Los 
Angeles and opposed the expansion of one of the nation's largest toxic dumps 
outside a Latino community in Kern County. Elsewhere, activists have fought to 
keep prisons, freeways and gas pipelines out of minority communities. 
</P>
<P>
 In Salinas, the hometown of John Steinbeck, who immortalized the plight of 
migrant farm workers in his novel "The Grapes of Wrath," the whole issue has 
become something of an embarrassment. On the eve of municipal festivities 
celebrating the author's life and work, officials are having to defend a county 
ordinance that allows heavy industry to locate next to migrant farm workers but 
nowhere near the homes of others. 
</P>
<P>
 "This law goes back many years to a time when migrant labor camps were seen as 
temporary, seasonal quarters," said Salinas City Councilwoman Anna Caballero. 
"No one anticipated that they would evolve into permanent communities." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Michael Silver, the Los Angeles lawyer who founded Pure-Etch, 
insists his plant is no threat to anyone and says the only reason it has become 
a litmus test for environmental justice is because a competitor who doesn't 
want him in business "played the racial card where it didn't belong." 
</P>
<P>
 The federal EPA has not dismissed Silver's claim. It says, however, that 
locating a chemical plant next to a migrant camp is worrisome, regardless of 
who raised the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy illustrates a dilemma faced by a number of California cities 
that are trying to recharge their industrial batteries without jeopardizing the 
health and safety of poor, non-white residents who live in industrial zones 
because they can't afford anything better. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent study by the state EPA, the agency that tentatively approved the 
Pure-Etch plant, concluded that "people of color live in areas that receive a 
disproportionate share of pollutant releases from manufacturing facilities." 
</P>
<P>
 UC Berkeley researcher William Pease, who directed the study, said there also 
is the fear that industrial accidents at many of these facilities could expose 
nearby neighborhoods to fires or toxic clouds. That is the issue in Salinas. 
</P>
<P>
 "The situation in Salinas is a clear case of institutional racism," said Luke 
Cole, a lawyer with California Rural Legal Assistance, one of several advocacy 
groups working to block Pure-Etch. "You have a company trying to take advantage 
of an outrageous zoning law that says you can put certain people in a heavy 
industrial neighborhood, regardless of the dangers." 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, the battle over environmental justice in California has tended to 
focus on landfills, incinerators, refineries and sewage treatment plants -- the 
class of noxious nuisances known as "LULUs," or locally unpopular land uses. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles was the scene of one of the movement's early victories, when a 
citywide coalition of activists persuaded then-Mayor Tom Bradley in 1987 to 
kill plans for a giant waste-to-energy incinerator that was to be located in a 
black neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salinas controversy, however, opens a new front in the campaign for 
environmental justice. The dispute focuses on a state-of-the-art manufacturing 
plant that would neither pollute the air nor foul the water, but instead would 
recycle chemical waste, producing what is called etchant for the circuit-board 
industry as well as nutrients used in raising poultry and growing rice. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Pure-Etch plant would store about 14,000 pounds of ammonia and 
20,000 gallons of hydrochloric acid, the state EPA's Department of Toxic 
Substance Control tentatively concluded that an accident would lead to a spill 
of no more than five seconds -- not long enough to threaten anyone's health. 
Under pressure from federal officials to review its findings, the department is 
expected to issue a new opinion within the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Lobbying the state EPA on behalf of Pure-Etch, the California Trade and 
Commerce Agency has made it clear that the Wilson Administration regards the 
battle over the facility as an important one. "Businesses like Pure-Etch are 
part of the continuum of high-tech industry," said Loren Kaye, the state's 
undersecretary for trade and commerce. "It is integral to the manufacturing of 
everything from desktop computers to anything else that uses electronic 
circuitry. 
</P>
<P>
 "More important, it's the kind of clean industry we need more of." 
</P>
<P>
 That is particularly true in Salinas, say officials who are struggling with a 
16% unemployment rate and a countywide housing crisis that finds a growing 
number of the estimated 15,000 to 20,000 migrants living on the streets or in 
caves. 
</P>
<P>
 The city already has committed more than $6 million to low-income housing -- 
an amount equal to 15% of its general fund -- and will use some of that money 
to rehabilitate the migrant quarters that honeycomb the city's industrial 
neighborhoods, said Councilwoman Caballero. 
</P>
<P>
 "We realize we have a real dilemma here," she said. "We need to take advantage 
of all our existing housing stock. We desperately need clean, new industry, and 
we have to consider the health and safety of our residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "One need is hitting smack up against another." 
</P>
<P>
 Caballero and other officials bristle at some of the racial rhetoric that has 
been flung at them over the Pure-Etch matter. She points out that she is the 
granddaughter of Mexican emigres, that the city is 55% Latino and that Latinos 
make up a majority of the City Council that voted for Pure-Etch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I resent being called a racist," she said. "That phrase they are throwing 
around, 'environmental racism,' is very simplistic, and it makes it all the 
more difficult to deal with a very complex set of problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, opponents of Pure-Etch don't condemn the company as much as what 
they say it represents. 
</P>
<P>
 Cole of the legal assistance group said Pure-Etch "in and of itself probably 
isn't such a bad thing." 
</P>
<P>
 "But the situation," he said, "is symptomatic of a number of others around 
California. It's the same old story. It's trust the technology. Only the people 
being asked to trust technology are poor people and people of color. They are 
the ones being declared expendable." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the risk posed by Pure-Etch's chemical inventory, it pales in 
comparison to what local residents already face. The tiny community of farm 
workers housed in an old motor court in east Salinas is surrounded by a small 
ocean of hazardous chemicals stored in a vast clutter of sheds, tanks and 
silos. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's just the point, argues Cole. "These people have enough to worry 
about as it is." 
</P>
<P>
 At the behest of Boxer, Hayden, Torres and other politicians sought out by 
Rural Legal Assistance and other groups, the EPA has intervened and urged state 
regulators to take a second look at Pure-Etch. Federal environmental officials 
have made it clear they don't think much of the state's initial review. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's pretty strong evidence that the state did not consider all of the 
information it should have," said Michael Feeley, the federal official in 
charge of monitoring the Pure-Etch permitting process. Feeley also expressed 
skepticism about the state's claim that a toxic release from Pure-Etch would be 
limited to five seconds. "That does appear to be a questionable assertion," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Feeley conceded that Pure-Etch does not present a clear-cut case of 
racial discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question is: Was there an intent to discriminate?" Feeley said. "Was this 
location chosen because the people who lived there wouldn't have the power to 
block it? Or was it chosen because it was an obvious place to locate this kind 
of facility?" 
</P>
<P>
 Silver, the man behind Pure-Etch, contends that the brouhaha was stirred up by 
a competitor, Phibrotech, the only current provider of industrial etchant to 
circuit-board manufacturers in California. 
</P>
<P>
 He maintains that Phibrotech retained the Toxics Assessment Group, a Davis 
consulting firm that often represents environmental organizations, including 
the Sierra Club. Saying it was representing a nonprofit environmental 
organization, California Communities Against Toxics, the Toxics Assessment 
Group has been a leader in the battle to keep Pure-Etch out of east Salinas. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Harnish, whose title is "principal" of the group, acknowledged that his 
firm had "shared some information and communications" regarding Pure-Etch with 
an attorney working for the competition. Harnish also said his firm had 
"received some financial help" for its work on the Pure-Etch matter, but he 
would not say if the money came from Phibrotech or its lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Silver argues that "if (Harnish's firm) had been upfront about who they were 
representing, they would have gotten nowhere with this hot-button campaign over 
environmental racism." 
</P>
<P>
 He insists there was no discriminatory intent in choosing the east Salinas 
site. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are other chemical companies all around; the site has access to a rail 
line," Silver explained. "It's less than an hour away from our biggest 
customers. It's zoned industrial. Where else do you go if you're an industry?"

BOMBINGS UNDERSCORE WORLD'S VULNERABILITY; MIDEAST: MORE DEADLY ATTACKS AGAINST 
JEWS ARE FEARED. ISRAEL SAYS PEACE PLANS MUST NOT SUCCUMB TO TERRORISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARKS, This article was reported by Times staff writers Tracy 
Wilkinson in Buenos Aires, Kim Murphy in Beirut, William Tuohy in London, Robin 
Wright in Washington and Mary Curtius and Michael Parks in Jerusalem and 
special correspondent Marilyn Raschka in Beirut. It was written by Parks. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A white delivery van parks on a Monday morning in front of a building in 
downtown Buenos Aires that houses many of Argentina's Jewish organizations. A 
few minutes later, a quarter-ton of explosives in the van are detonated, 
demolishing the building. Ninety-six people are killed, 230 are wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 A day later, a man believed to be Lebanese and using a crudely forged U.S. 
passport boards a small commuter plane in Panama -- and shortly after takeoff 
blows it up with a bomb he is carrying. Twenty other people die with him -- 12 
of them Jewish businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
 In London a week later, a well-dressed, middle-aged woman described as "Middle 
Eastern" or "Mediterranean" parks her car next to the Israeli Embassy, tells a 
police officer she is visiting friends next door and walks off, a department 
store shopping bag in hand. Minutes later, the car explodes, heavily damaging 
the embassy and wounding 14 people. 
</P>
<P>
 At 12:45 the next morning, another car bomb goes off outside a north London 
building housing Jewish community organizations. Five people are wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 From four terrorist strikes in nine days, profoundly troubling questions 
arise: 
</P>
<P>
 Are Jews around the world -- not only Israelis but all Jews -- now targets in 
a new surge of Middle East terrorism, a campaign able to strike globally with 
deadly suddenness? Can the Middle East peace process, still fragile despite the 
breakthroughs of the past year, survive such murderous attacks? Or will 
terrorism push the region toward war once again? 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, speaking to his colleagues at a special 
Cabinet meeting last week, responded to those questions with characteristic 
bluntness: 
</P>
<P>
 "Jews once again are being killed precisely because they are Jews. The motive 
this time is to halt the search for peace. We know where the trail leads. 
Israel will do all within its power to find and punish those responsible for 
these bombings. Peace must not succumb to terror." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the bombings showed how vulnerable the Jewish communities of the Diaspora 
are, whether in security-conscious Britain or remote Panama. 
</P>
<P>
 In the sober judgment of Israeli and Western intelligence analysts and 
counterterrorism specialists, any Jewish group virtually anywhere in the world 
is now a potential target, with Israeli and high-profile Jewish institutions at 
a significantly higher risk. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps the most dangerous time is still ahead as the peace process is 
actually implemented and as barriers between Mideast states come down," 
commented Bruce Hoffman, co-director of the Center for Terrorism and Conflict 
Studies at St. Andrew's University in Scotland. "As peace takes hold, 
terrorists will have even more to lose and more motivation to demonstrate their 
capacity as spoilers." 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the Renault van in Buenos Aires had carefully positioned it just 
outside the front doors of the building housing the social service 
organizations of Argentina's Jewish community of 250,000. It was a few minutes 
before 10 a.m. on July 18, a time when the building would be filling with more 
than 100 employees and clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, the brothers Schalit had arrived to arrange their father's funeral 
with the Argentine-Jewish Mutual Assn., which operates four Jewish cemeteries. 
Veronica Goldenberg, a receptionist for the Delegation of Argentine-Jewish 
Assns., had taken her position working the phone banks. Her colleague, Lucia 
Osiboff, had overslept and was on her way to work, late. 
</P>
<P>
 At 9:53, the car bomb was detonated, and the seven-story community center 
collapsed in a deafening explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Schalit brothers were killed, probably instantly. Goldenberg, 20, was 
crushed to death. Osiboff's sleepiness had spared her life. The driver of the 
Renault was blown into many pieces, and what was left of his body was found a 
full eight days later behind the van's charred steering wheel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never saw so much helplessness," said Nestor Pelliciaro, 35, a shopkeeper 
on the same block. Norberto Libster, a Hebrew teacher who lived across the 
street, recalled: "Everything was going in slow motion. It looked like a movie, 
like Lebanon, Bosnia, Sarajevo, anything but the window of my apartment." 
</P>
<P>
 Some people were rescued, but by the time specialists arrived from Israel with 
dogs trained to search through bomb rubble, the recoveries were only of the 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will last forever as a tragic date, as the mutilation of the body and 
bosom of the Jewish community," said Ruben Beraja, a banker and the president 
of the Delegation of Argentine-Jewish Assns. He was having coffee at a cafe 
three blocks away from the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nearly 100 families have buried their loved ones as though a lightning bolt 
of death struck," he said. " . . . This will not be forgotten." 
</P>
<P>
 The Argentine investigation has focused on the radical Islamic group Hezbollah 
(Party of God) in Lebanon, on an offshoot called Ansarallah, which claimed 
responsibility for the bombing, and on Iran as their patron. Authorities are 
trying to determine if Iranian diplomats provided support for their activities. 
Sheik Sobhi Tufeili, Hezbollah's former secretary general and now a leader of 
its most militant wing, is regarded by investigators and counterterrorism 
specialists as the likely planner of the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 A break in the case came when Argentine Judge Juan Jose Galeano traveled 
secretly to Caracas last weekend to interview Monoucher Motamer, a former 
Iranian diplomat and now political refugee in Venezuela. Motamer implicated at 
least two and as many as five people working at the Iranian Embassy in Buenos 
Aires, according to sources familiar with the investigation. "The information 
he gave me is of extreme importance," Galeano said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Iranian ambassador, Hadi Soleimanpour, was interrogated twice last week at 
the Argentine Foreign Ministry amid suspicions that he and his embassy's 
cultural attache were involved in the bombing. Five people have reportedly been 
detained for questioning in Buenos Aires. 
</P>
<P>
 Iran, for its part, rejected accusations of involvement, calling them part of 
"an American-Zionist conspiracy to justify further aggression" in the Middle 
East. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ansarallah, or the Partisans of God, which Western analysts believe 
Tufeili heads, said in a statement from Lebanon that it committed the Argentine 
and Panamanian bombings and planned more. 
</P>
<P>
 "Suicide squads (have been formed) to confront the Zionist enemy everywhere," 
the statement said. "The Argentina and Panama operations are but a proof of our 
struggle against Zionism." 
</P>
<P>
 Lebanese political analysts, however, saw Iranian hands in the bombings. Iran, 
which last week again voiced its opposition to the Arabs' expanding peace 
process with Israel, provides expertise and financing for many militant groups 
throughout the Middle East. It created Hezbollah in 1982, it maintains the 
anti-Iraq Islamic Alliance in Tehran, it aids the fundamentalist regime in 
Sudan, and it has links to a variety of militant Islamic groups in the Horn of 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Iran also reportedly lost 20 of its Revolutionary Guards in an Israeli attack 
June 2 on a Hezbollah camp in the Bekaa Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, according to this Lebanese analysis, Iran would have had the motive and 
capability to finance an operation like the Buenos Aires attack, providing 
logistic assistance such as false passports and calling in expertise from 
various countries, including Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because this was so well organized, it can't be viewed as a flash in the 
pan," a senior U.S. counterterrorism official in Washington said of the 
attacks. "Striking in the heart of big capitals as well as in the countryside 
of Panama sends a strong message." 
</P>
<P>
 The attacks set off alarms because of their boldness and changes in tactics. 
In the past, neither Hezbollah nor Ansarallah has been involved in a systematic 
series of bombings; their attacks have generally been tit-for-tat reprisals. 
And, although Lebanon's Shiite extremists have hijacked airliners, they have 
never carried out a midair suicide bombing. 
</P>
<P>
 The four attacks also demonstrated deadly expertise. Advance intelligence in 
Panama, where the flight patterns of Jewish businessmen were noted, and in one 
of the most protected sections of London deeply concerns counterterrorism 
officials. The Panama incident surprised experts -- as a site, for the evident 
knowledge about the target, and for originality. In London, the bomber coolly 
talked her way past a roadblock and a police officer; her shopping bag from 
Harrods department store showed attention to detail. 
</P>
<P>
 Counterterrorism specialists also believe that those who carried out the 
attacks had deep roots in the places where they were operating; they noted the 
local support networks, extensive reconnaissance and preparation. Trained 
terrorists probably traveled to each place to carry out the final planning and 
oversee the attack, but most work was done by local supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "This appears to have been planned for a long time," said Frank Brenchley, 
chairman of London's Research Institute for the Study of Conflict and 
Terrorism. "It's part of a widely spaced campaign that includes Buenos Aires, 
Panama and the attempt to bomb the Israeli Embassy in Bangkok, Thailand, in 
March. That kind of planning must be done months ahead. . . . I think this is 
not the end of the process. They may hit targets in other high-profile capitals 
like Paris and Rome." 
</P>
<P>
 Intelligence analysts and counterterrorism officials are increasingly 
convinced that the major factor in the attacks was the confrontation between 
Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Israel and Hezbollah have been exchanging 
blows for more than a decade, mostly in southern Lebanon but sometimes outside 
the Mideast. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposition to the peace process, the experts say, was an important but 
secondary element. 
</P>
<P>
 "Terrorism is never a direct line," Hoffman, of the St. Andrew's center, said. 
"It is wheels within wheels, shadows overshadowing other shadows. The big 
picture is the act in which it occurs: the Mideast peace process. But often 
there is a little picture that is far more important, like Israel's raids on 
Lebanon. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Hezbollah has to demonstrate to a certain extent that it will not remain idle 
and that it will defend its followers. The domestic element is the small 
driving force. The bigger picture is the unfolding peace process." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Kramer, deputy director of the Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern 
and African Studies at Tel Aviv University, said the success of Israel's recent 
attacks on Hezbollah targets in Lebanon probably led the group to seek softer 
targets elsewhere for its reprisals. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a long time, Hezbollah had ample targets in south Lebanon for launching 
tit-for-tat attacks against Israel," Kramer said. "Only when they were 
overwhelmed by some Israeli strike that they couldn't respond to locally have 
their eyes turned abroad." 
</P>
<P>
 Hezbollah's first foreign targets were French and not Jewish, he noted, 
recalling a series of devastating bomb attacks in Paris in 1985 and 1986 
intended to discourage France from supporting Iraq in the Iran-Iraq War. 
</P>
<P>
 Hezbollah's black flag with its insignia of a raised rifle flies across 
Beirut's fetid southern suburbs and other impoverished neighborhoods where 
Shiite Muslims, displaced by the fighting in southern Lebanon, have taken 
refuge. 
</P>
<P>
 With further strongholds in southern Lebanon, in Baalbek and parts of the 
Bekaa Valley, Hezbollah would appear to have lost little of its radicalism of 
the 1980s, when its bombings of American targets and kidnaping of foreign 
hostages made it one of the most feared names in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
 Hezbollah's leaders today, however, stress its role not as a militia but as a 
political party with deputies in the Lebanese Parliament. It runs more 
charitable and service organizations, including hospitals, pharmacies and 
schools, than the government. It should be seen as a member of the broad 
Islamic coalition against the negotiations with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Hezbollah had no connection with the bombings, asserted Hussein Khalil, chief 
of Hezbollah's political department, in an interview. He dismissed the Israeli 
allegations as an attempt to justify further attacks on Lebanon and to "tarnish 
the image of the resistance." 
</P>
<P>
 Khalil, in tailored black pants and a pullover, greets visitors in an 
elegantly appointed reception room, full of plush sofas and beautifully 
inscribed quotations from the Koran. It seems an island of cultivated civility 
in one of the foulest quarters of Beirut's sweltering, overcrowded southern 
suburbs. Yet the talk there is tough and uncompromising. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent Israeli strikes in Lebanon were an attempt to destabilize the country, 
Khalil said, charging that "Israel is interested in creating divisions in 
Lebanon and re-creating the state of civil war . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "We usually fight the Israelis on our own soil, but when Israel wants to 
expand its aggression against Lebanon, sometimes we are forced to expand our 
range of reprisal, even if it takes in the whole land of northern Palestine. 
Whenever aggression expands, reprisals must expand." 
</P>
<P>
 Still tougher talk comes from Tufeili, the Hezbollah leader suspected in the 
Buenos Aires bombing. "Even if the whole world signs peace with the Jews, we 
will continue to fight them," he told the Beirut newspaper L'Orient-Le Jour. He 
denied any role in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel has encouraged speculation that, just as it did after 11 of its 
athletes were killed at the 1972 Munich Olympics, its intelligence agents would 
methodically hunt down and kill those responsible for the Buenos Aires bombing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just as we found solutions to terror in the past . . . so too a solution will 
be found to Iranian terror," a senior general told Israeli military 
correspondents last week. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rabin is under considerable pressure from the Clinton Administration not 
to retaliate directly or immediately, according to officials here and in 
Washington, for fear this would widen the circle of reprisals, escalating 
attacks by Shiite extremists and bringing them to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 There were real fears, based on what FBI officials described as firm 
intelligence, that Hezbollah or another Iranian-backed group was ready to mount 
a terrorist campaign against Israeli and Jewish institutions in New York and 
other American cities. 
</P>
<P>
 There was also concern among some diplomats that the peace process -- Israel's 
new relationship with Jordan, the development of the self-governing Palestinian 
Authority, the just-starting-to-move talks with Syria -- could be enveloped by 
a wave of terror. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. officials claimed they are confident that current Israeli-Arab peace 
efforts would not be halted by either an upsurge in terrorism or a cycle of 
violence in which Israel retaliates for each attack and, in turn, provokes more 
suicide bombings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will, I am convinced, ultimately see a lasting and comprehensive peace for 
the Arabs and Jews," Secretary of State Warren Christopher told the House 
Foreign Affairs Committee Thursday. "Those results, of course, will be the best 
answer for terrorists." 
</P>
<P>
 Acknowledging that "the terrorist bombings in Latin America and London serve 
as a tragic reminder that the enemies of peace remain formidable," Christopher 
added, "We must take new and strong action to deal with this wave of 
terrorism." 
</P>
<P>
 In the worst-case scenario, combatting Middle East terrorism worldwide could 
be even more demanding than making peace after nearly half a century of war in 
the region. Counterterrorism officials contend that it will take unprecedented 
international cooperation on a scale witnessed only once -- during Operations 
Desert Shield and Desert Storm in 1990 and 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 That lasted only eight months, they point out, and this effort will require 
years of coordination, intelligence-sharing and multinational security 
arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 And while Hezbollah is likely to remain the most feared opponent, other 
radical groups also pose serious threats. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli and Western intelligence and counterterrorism experts believe strongly 
that the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, led by 
Ahmed Jibril, and another radical Palestinian group known by the name of its 
leader, Abu Nidal, will also mount attacks -- and that one or the other may 
have carried out the London bombings. 
</P>
<P>
 An Abu Nidal member is the prime suspect in the assassination of a Jordanian 
diplomat last spring in Lebanon, and others launched attacks there last year on 
Fatah, the principal group within the Palestine Liberation Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The Abu Nidal group, which has backing from Libya, retains an infrastructure 
in Europe and through much of the Middle East, according to intelligence 
analysts. As the peace negotiations proceed, it is likely to attempt disruptive 
attacks since it will have no political role in the future Mideast and thus has 
nothing to lose. Its targets, according to counterterrorism officials, will 
probably be Jordanians, Palestinians and finally Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
 Jibril has been comparatively quiet over the past year, but as Syria enters 
serious negotiations with Israel his organization stands to lose its base and 
financial supporter in Damascus. Any Syrian deal with Israel would certainly 
include an end to backing and refuge for militant groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Counterterrorism efforts are easy to mobilize when there is a specific threat 
and an end within sight, experts noted. The current challenge will be an 
indefinite struggle requiring a focus and a long-term commitment that the 
international community has never been able to sustain. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an illusion to think we can ever stop terrorism completely," Hoffman 
said, "but we can certainly make it more difficult to carry out." 
</P>
<P>
 But Western resolve to combat terrorism seemed, even to cynical Israelis, 
renewed and stronger than before. 
</P>
<P>
 "Imagine car bombs like that in Buenos Aires in the heart of Manhattan," a 
senior Israeli official commented. "Imagine the London bombs going off on 
Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles and then, 13 hours later, in Pasadena. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "After the World Trade Center bombing in New York, we are finally getting U.S. 
officials to take terrorism seriously. And this is serious: You could have 
synagogues and Jewish day schools and community centers being bombed across 
America. That is the meaning of Buenos Aires, Panama and London." Outbreak of 
Terror 
</P>
<P>
 A rash of attacks on Jewish targets in Latin America and Britain showed how 
vulnerable the Jewish communities of the Diaspora are. Israeli and Western 
intelligence analysts say any Jewish group virtually anywhere in the world is 
now a potential target. 
</P>
<P>
 * The investigation of a deadly bombing in Argentina has focused on the 
radical Islamic group Hezbollah and an offshoot called Ansarallah, both based 
in Lebanon, and on Iran as their patron. Iran and Hezbollah have denied 
involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 * Intelligence analysts believe the major motivation for the attacks was the 
confrontation between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, with opposition to the 
Middle East peace process a secondary element. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some diplomats fear a new wave of terror could damage the peace process 
between Israel and its Arab neighbors. U.S. officials say they are confident 
the efforts would not be halted by an upsurge in terrorism.

NEWS ANALYSIS; CLINTON'S GLOBAL GAP: LOFTY GOALS, A LESSER REALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOYLE McMANUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For two welcome days last week, President Clinton reveled in the role of world 
leader as he presided, beaming, over a historic declaration of peace between 
Israel and Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Only hours after the final ceremony, however, Clinton's foreign policy 
briefing was dominated instead by the agonizing post-Cold War crises -- Haiti, 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and now Rwanda -- that have frustrated him for 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 So painful and persistent have the Administration's setbacks been on those 
issues that, in private, Clinton sometimes rages at his underlings. At a recent 
meeting on Haiti, according to a participant, he snapped at Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher: "We can do better than this." 
</P>
<P>
 But in search of those responsible for his foreign policy setbacks, the 
President does not have to look even as far as his secretary of state. Instead, 
analysts of all persuasions agree, two major factors are to blame -- neither of 
which Clinton can easily change. 
</P>
<P>
 One is the chaotic nature of the post-Cold War world. The other, acknowledged 
even by some Administration officials, is the President himself. 
</P>
<P>
 As a presidential candidate, Clinton scoffed at his predecessor for being 
preoccupied with international issues. The first Democratic President in 12 
years, he launched an ambitious domestic agenda including economic stimulus, 
welfare reform and health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 But as he is now learning the hard way, foreign policy still matters. 
Clinton's international stumbles, from Somalia and Bosnia to the embarrassing 
standoff in Haiti, have sapped Americans' confidence in Clinton as a leader on 
all issues, notably the domestic initiatives that are dearest to his heart. 
</P>
<P>
 A Times Poll last week found that only 15% of the public believes that Clinton 
has offered the nation a clear foreign policy. In Congress, few Democrats rally 
strongly to the Administration's defense on international issues. Republicans, 
sensing vulnerability, are stepping up their criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 Even some of the President's chief allies are increasingly critical. 
</P>
<P>
 "The criticisms that are made of the President are that he has backtracked on 
positions he took in the campaign, that he has flip-flopped, that he's not able 
to articulate an overall vision for American foreign policy. I think there is 
some validity to each of these," said Rep. Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.), chairman 
of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "In general, I think he has the policies right," Hamilton added. "But his 
challenge is to sort out the U.S. role in the world and talk to the American 
people about it, and he hasn't done that yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans are less gentle. "There is a clear perception that the President 
lacks any fundamental convictions on these issues," said Sen. John McCain 
(R-Ariz.). "There is no connection between his rhetoric and his actions. . . . 
And in foreign affairs, that simply confuses your friends and encourages your 
adversaries." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and Christopher have often wished out loud that the public would pay 
more attention to what they call "the big issues" that are working reasonably 
well: international economic relations, Russian reform, Middle East peace. 
</P>
<P>
 But the world has not given them that luxury. It is Clinton's bad luck that 
the hallmark of the post-Cold War era has been the unleashing of ugly local 
conflicts around the world, each one posing a question that would challenge the 
most experienced statesman: When does a foreign policy goal justify using U.S. 
military power and putting American troops in danger? 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a tremendously difficult thing to work through," said Anthony Lake, 
Clinton's national security adviser. For earlier Presidents, he added, "it was 
much easier to gain an American national consensus . . . behind the use of 
force because you had a Cold War context in which to place it. The nature of 
the debates was simpler." 
</P>
<P>
 Lake contends that Clinton has handled these questions well. But most others 
-- including even some officials inside the Administration -- disagree. Where 
Clinton has gone wrong, they say, is in embracing lofty foreign policy goals 
and at the same time declaring severe limits to his foreign policy means. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clinton is caught in a dilemma of his own making," said Robert W. Tucker, a 
foreign policy expert at Johns Hopkins University. "He came into office 
intending to concentrate on domestic affairs . . . but he made a lot of 
commitments on foreign policy during the campaign, on Bosnia and Haiti and 
other issues. And he wanted to fulfill them without the use of American 
military power. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has developed something new under the sun: the idea of bloodless war," 
Tucker said. "The only problem is that it doesn't exist." 
</P>
<P>
 "This Administration has a problem with intervention," said Michael Mandelbaum 
of the Council on Foreign Relations. "It wants to do good around the world, 
mostly for humanitarian reasons. . . . But the American people, who were 
willing to shed blood in the Cold War when it was a form of self-defense, 
aren't convinced that they want to shed blood in a series of what appear to be 
humanitarian causes." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, he said, Clinton has sometimes appeared to violate an old 
principle of both police work and big-power foreign policy: "Don't point a gun 
unless you're willing to pull the trigger." 
</P>
<P>
 By demanding that Haiti's generals cede power while stressing that he wants to 
avoid any unilateral use of force to topple them, for example, Clinton appears 
to have convinced the regime in Port-au-Prince that it need not heed his 
warnings. 
</P>
<P>
 By calling on the Bosnian Serbs to give up territory to the country's Muslims 
while insisting that the United States will not intervene in their civil war, 
he has made both the Serbs and their Muslim enemies skeptical of U.S. and 
Western promises to police a peace settlement if one is ever reached. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake said that Clinton does not want to risk U.S. troops in a military 
adventure just to prove his toughness. "I do not believe that any President of 
the United States should ever put American lives at risk simply for the purpose 
of sending some sort of wider message," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Lake contended that some of the cases cited by Clinton's critics as 
bungles -- including Somalia and Bosnia -- actually demonstrate the proper use 
of military force. 
</P>
<P>
 "In all of those cases this President was prepared to use American military 
power and did it, I would argue, in an effective way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Somalia, he noted, some members of Congress wanted to withdraw American 
troops immediately last fall after guerrillas killed 18 U.S. troops in a street 
ambush. "It was this President who said no, we mustn't get out now, we need 
more time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Bosnia, he said, Clinton carefully used U.S. air power to end the siege 
of Sarajevo without risking any American ground troops. "There are people alive 
who are walking around the streets of Sarajevo who would not be otherwise," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But even some White House officials take exception to Lake's sanguine view. 
The National Security Council, whose staff is headed by Lake, "is in a bubble," 
said one. "They don't understand how bad the Haiti policy looks, for example." 
</P>
<P>
 "The President has gotten into trouble in places like Haiti, Bosnia and 
Somalia where he has not precisely defined American national interests 
beforehand," Hamilton said. "He never gave a speech on Somalia until he had 
decided to withdraw. He has never tried to define American interests in Bosnia 
so far as I know. In Haiti, he has begun to do it, but he needs to do more." 
</P>
<P>
 Leading Republicans, seeing Clinton's travails and noting the appearance of 
foreign policy as a concern in public opinion polls, have escalated their 
attacks on these issues, for a key strategic reason. 
</P>
<P>
 "In an election campaign, foreign policy is a proxy for the question of 
stature and leadership," a former Clinton aide said. "This is a way of raising 
questions about Bill Clinton's competence as a leader." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the Republican National Committee staged a daylong conference on 
foreign policy to roll out some big guns and let them take shots. Former 
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney declared Clinton "one of the least competent 
(foreign policy leaders) in the 20th Century." Former Secretary of State James 
A. Baker III said that the President has "squandered American credibility and 
has undermined American preeminence around the world." 
</P>
<P>
 "Jimmy Clinton," an Administration official groaned when told of their 
charges. His meaning: that the Republicans are trying to paint Clinton as weak 
and irresolute on foreign policy, just as they did former President Jimmy 
Carter when he ran unsuccessfully for reelection in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 But the sharpening partisanship of the foreign policy debate is more than just 
a rehearsal for the 1996 campaign. It already has become another chronic 
problem for Clinton and his aides -- because it has raised the potential 
political cost of every foreign policy decision they make. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, leading Republicans -- including Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of 
Kansas -- have said that they sharply oppose any U.S. invasion of Haiti to 
topple the military regime there, declaring that Haiti is "not worth the blood 
of a single American soldier." 
</P>
<P>
 That worries an Administration that is inching toward a decision to send U.S. 
troops into Haiti as part of a U.N.-sponsored multinational force. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very unfortunate if this were to become a partisan argument," Lake 
said. "When you are debating whether or not to shed blood and to put American 
lives at risk . . . leave partisan politics out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the President's friends are bombarding him with advice on how he 
can fix his broken foreign policy machinery. 
</P>
<P>
 Some, like Hamilton, have been urging him to spend more time on foreign policy 
-- both its making and its explaining. "He needs to define the American 
interest and talk to the American people about it, not just once but many 
times," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others have told him to replace his top aides -- either Lake or Christopher or 
both. White House officials have said that both men's jobs are safe until after 
November's congressional election, at which point Clinton will review their 
performance and decide whether changes are in order. 
</P>
<P>
 Some aides noted that in Washington's cutthroat culture, such a comment is 
taken as a virtual announcement that the jobs are up for grabs. Among those 
named most frequently as possible successors is former Vice President Walter F. 
Mondale, now U.S. ambassador to Japan, as secretary of state. 
</P>
<P>
 Still others, including some within the Administration, have advised Clinton 
to stay the course, arguing that Bosnia and Haiti are gradually moving toward 
solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of these problems come from campaign commitments," said a former 
Clinton aide. "We made a Faustian bargain, as any campaign does, in an effort 
to show how we were different and better on issues like Bosnia and Haiti. The 
real test will come on the new issues that have come up since the campaign, 
like Rwanda. And on those, I think they're doing better."

TROOPS MAY BE IN RWANDA FOR A YEAR, PERRY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB DROGIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Defense Secretary William J. Perry said after an inspection here Sunday that 
U.S. soldiers may be deployed for "a year or longer" to help more than 1 
million Rwandan refugees facing death and disease in nightmarish camps along 
the Zairian border. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry said that the 1,000 Americans now deployed in Zaire, Rwanda, Kenya and 
Uganda as part of Operation Support Hope are on "a humanitarian mission" to 
alleviate the suffering of the refugees and to help them return home. 
</P>
<P>
 He said no combat troops are being used, and he insisted that U.S. forces will 
not be drawn into a peacekeeping role if a vicious ethnic-based civil war 
resumes in Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked at a news conference how long the Americans will stay, Perry said, "I 
would certainly expect some aspects of the humanitarian mission to go on a year 
or longer." He added, "We'll stay here as long as needed to do our mission." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the fast-growing military operation is aimed at airlifting trucks, 
earthmoving equipment, bulk food and other emergency supplies for use by U.N. 
agencies and non-governmental groups running the frantic relief operations here 
and in Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. team has begun purifying water for distribution to the refugees. And 
Sunday, three soldiers used a bulldozer to begin digging a mass grave in the 
black volcanic grit beside Kibumba camp, where foul mounds of decomposing 
corpses -- estimated at more than 1,000 -- have lain uncollected in the sun for 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to prepare the men before they came," Army Lt. Michelle Ericksen 
said as the brown bulldozer pushed the shallow soil and clanked on the cold 
rock. "We had the chaplain out here, and he told them, 'Don't be afraid if you 
want to cry.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Later, a French army front-end loader began an even more grisly task beside 
the main road at Kibumba. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving down a long, horrific heap of hundreds of bloated bodies, it slowly 
scooped up rotting corpses and bloody offal in its saw-toothed shovel, wheeled 
around with a roar of black smoke and dumped them on a berm nearby. A yellow 
earthmoving machine pushed dirt, grass and rocks over the pile, but legs and 
arms and faces stuck out through the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry said his "heart was torn by the human tragedy here" in Goma. An 
estimated 1.2 million refugees overran this dusty border town two weeks ago at 
the end of Rwanda's civil war but quickly found themselves living on jagged 
volcanic rocks in miserable camps without sufficient food or water. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 20,000 refugees have died already, aid officials say, many in a 
fierce cholera epidemic. The death rate from cholera has fallen dramatically in 
recent days, but doctors warn that a fast-spreading strain of amoebic dysentery 
may prove even more dangerous because it is more difficult to treat. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry didn't actually visit any of the refugee camps, which lie outside Goma. 
The 98 U.S. soldiers already here don't have helicopters, and five French 
military helicopters at the airport were being used for a simultaneous visit 
Sunday by French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and Defense Minister Francois 
Leotard. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Perry greeted U.S. troops at the airport, visited the lakeside 
water-purification center and met with local U.N. and relief group officials. 
He also held a short news conference and was interviewed via satellite from 
Washington for CBS-TV's "Face the Nation." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his brief visit, Perry offered an optimistic forecast for what aid 
officials have called the worst humanitarian crisis in decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe we have truly turned the corner on this tragedy and will be making 
improvements every day," said Perry, who was tie-less and in khakis. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, Perry had visited the military airlift staging hub at Entebbe Airport 
in Kampala, Uganda, where the vast majority of U.S. troops -- 709 in all -- are 
now deployed. He then flew to the Rwandan capital of Kigali, where a 72-member 
airlift command unit had reopened the war-damaged airport. Five U.S. transport 
and supply planes landed in Kigali on Sunday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as trucks can be hired or delivered, officials said, the food will be 
hauled here, about 100 miles west, or distributed along the road for returning 
refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry and his top aides -- including Gen. George Joulwan, commander in chief 
of the U.S. European Command, which is in charge of the relief operation -- 
also met for about 30 minutes in Kigali with the new president of Rwanda, 
Pasteur Bizimungu, and his vice president and defense chief, Paul Kagame. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration formally recognized the government in Kigali on 
Saturday, paving the way for Perry's visit. The Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic 
Front won control of Rwanda two weeks ago after fighting a brutal civil war 
against the Hutu-based regime. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hutu leaders and army fled across the border to Zaire after conducting 
what human rights groups call a genocidal campaign against the Tutsis, a 
slaughter that has left up to half a million dead since April. About 4 million 
people -- nearly half the country's prewar population -- are now either 
refugees or displaced within Rwanda, according to the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Gen. Daniel Schroeder, who heads the military task force running the U.S. 
relief operation, said the new government offered assurances that Americans are 
not at risk in Rwanda and that no reprisals would be carried out against 
returning Hutu refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 Schroeder said Perry asked the Rwandan president "to define the functions 
where we could make a contribution" to ending the humanitarian crisis. 
Schroeder said there was no discussion or plan to provide U.S. military 
assistance to the new government.

 Schroeder said he would consider using a U.S. truck company to transport food 
and refugees in Rwanda. He said the military may also repair or replace 
shattered radio transmitters for the new government so they can broadcast 
appeals for the refugees to return home. 
</P>
<P>
 Schroeder said the 72 U.S. troops now in Kigali -- the force will soon grow to 
about 200 -- are under orders not to leave the airport and have a small 
detachment of military police for their protection. But the general said he 
considers the potential threat in Kigali to be low.

 "It is nonaggressive, non-threatening, almost benign," he said. "And every day

 Aid group officials here said Perry's visit had one tangible benefit after a 
week in which the U.S. operation had been widely criticized for delays and 
confusion. 
</P>
<P>
 In a deal brokered by UNICEF, Perry authorized the immediate airlift to Goma 
of nine large water-tanker trucks from Helsinki, Finland, to deliver 
desperately needed potable water to the refugees. The trucks are due to arrive 
this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will double our ability to deliver water in one day," said Steffan de 
Mistura, the UNICEF representative. "That's really where the U.S. Air Force can 
make a difference."

LAWYERS TAKE OFFENSE AT PEER'S UNORTHODOX DEFENSE; LAW: UTAH PUBLIC DEFENDER 
ELLIOTT LEVINE FACES POSSIBLE DISBARMENT FOR RESPECTING HIS CLIENT'S WISH TO BE 
EXECUTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It is hard to say whether his exposure to James Holland transformed Summit 
County public defender Elliott Levine into an unbridled renegade or merely 
uncovered long-held sentiments. What is clear is that the choices he made in 
defending Holland against murder charges appear to have galvanized him. What 
began as an earnest ethical inquiry into the obligations and boundaries of 
criminal defense lawyers has started to take on the markings of an unabashed 
infidel's crusade against his own profession. 
</P>
<P>
 This became evident when Summit County handed Levine another murderer to 
defend in early 1991 just as Holland was sentenced to death here for the second 
time. Holland had eagerly confessed, readily pleaded guilty, adamantly resisted 
his lawyer's efforts to appeal and flatly chosen the executioner over life in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 If anything, Von Lester Taylor's case -- as told in court documents -- looked 
even less promising than Holland's. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with a companion, Taylor, who was in his mid-20s, broke into the Tiede 
family cabin in the Beaver Springs mountain development not far from Coalville. 
When the Tiedes arrived home, Taylor without provocation shot the mother 
point-blank, then the grandmother, killing them both while one daughter looked 
away, praying. Later, he told his companion to shoot the father but impatiently 
did it himself after the companion took too long to aim. Then he doused the 
father with gasoline, cut the telephone lines, set the cabin on fire, took two 
daughters hostage and ran a couple of roadblocks before crashing his car. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking at these details later, there are those, chiefly in the defense bar, 
who sputter at the fact that Levine let Taylor plead guilty to murder, and 
those, chiefly prosecutors, who think he had little choice if he wanted mercy 
at a penalty hearing. There is also dispute about how this decision was 
reached. Levine says Taylor, who reportedly attempted suicide in jail, insisted 
he wanted no trial. Taylor now claims, through his new lawyer and in an 
affidavit, that he was just following Levine's advice. 
</P>
<P>
 What is beyond challenge are the events that unfolded at Taylor's penalty 
hearing in May, 1991. In order to make what's called a "proportionality" 
argument -- in essence to compare the character and actions of this defendant 
with current Death Row inmates -- Levine called a willing James Holland to the 
witness stand. Levine wanted to show the jury that Holland was a career 
criminal and three-time murderer who expressed little remorse, while the much 
younger Taylor by comparison had a single felony burglary conviction and lots 
of remorse. The judge wouldn't let him do it, so instead Levine simply had 
Holland testify generally about his background and his unhappy life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Levine launched a closing argument on Taylor's behalf that would often be 
quoted in the coming months, not infrequently with tones of wonder. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not as though Mr. Taylor is sitting here trying to cover up his deeds . 
. ." Levine began. "Mr. Taylor came forth and he admitted two murders . . . . 
In opening arguments I told you that the decision to do this came as a result 
of long hours of conversation between myself and Mr. Taylor. Let me tell you a 
little bit about my approach as a defense attorney . . . . Last Thursday I got 
home very late, walked in my house and what happens to be on TV but 'L.A. Law' 
. . . . I don't even know who the character was. She was talking to a judge, 
and she was explaining to the judge an obligation as a criminal defense 
attorney, and that is to do what I can to get my client off. In my opinion, 
that's a bunch of bull. You don't do yourself any good, I don't do my client 
any good, and I don't do the system any good. I don't feel that is my task as a 
defense attorney . . . . My approach differs in that normally what I try and 
do, I talk to my client, I need to know whether or not they committed that 
crime . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 If the client has committed the crime, "then I feel it's my obligation to get 
that person to take the first step, and that is to come forth, admit their 
wrongdoing, then to get them through the system in a sense that the appropriate 
punishment is imposed . . . . That's exactly what I've done in Mr. Taylor's 
case . . . . Mr. Taylor has taken that first step, a very difficult step for 
anyone, and that is admitting wrong . . . . He couldn't believe what he did. It 
sickened him . . . . Mr. Taylor does not lack emotion. Mr. Holland lacks 
emotion when he talks about his murders . . . . Mr. Taylor was very emotional 
here . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 There are those who look at this decidedly unorthodox description of a defense 
attorney's role with some understanding. Instead of denying or contesting, they 
point out, Levine was seeking mercy by saying his guy admits it, his guy is 
remorseful, his guy is willing to face the music. It was, some thought, a 
plausible approach -- even if Levine had gotten rather carried away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know that you can hold an attorney responsible for what he's saying 
to a jury in closing argument," one lawyer generously observed. "He's doing 
whatever he can." 
</P>
<P>
 Others were not nearly as generous. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stand up and atone and rehabilitate?" chortled attorney Bruce Savage, whom 
Summit County eventually appointed to take over the Holland and Taylor cases. 
"That only works if everyone is operating on the same page, if everyone agrees 
to rehabilitate you if you stand up. If everyone is not in agreement on how the 
game is played, you can't be doing this. You just can't be doing this. Pleading 
into a capital charge when you know they're coming at you with a syringe is 
problematic. You're not going to be an adversary, but the problem is, they 
still are." 
</P>
<P>
 If only Levine had stopped there, he might still have avoided all that was to 
come. But he did not stop there. 
</P>
<P>
 When the jury ended up handing Taylor a death sentence, Levine filed an 
appellate brief with the state Supreme Court. In it, among other points, Levine 
included what he later acknowledged was the incendiary "kicker." In it, Levine 
claimed a denial of rights because the trial judge hadn't allowed him to argue 
"that an individual such as James Holland is a prime candidate for the death 
penalty while (Taylor) is not." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the face of the vitriolic firestorm that erupted when the Utah legal 
community learned he'd offered his own client to the executioner, Levine has 
remained resolute. 
</P>
<P>
 He was not saying that Holland deserved to die or should die, Levine 
emphasizes to anyone who will listen. He was just saying Holland was a more 
likely candidate, on a spectrum of possibilities, if you were going to have a 
death penalty at all. How could he have jeopardized Holland's position, at any 
rate, when what he'd done was totally consistent with Holland's position? 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Holland has always taken the position that he wants to be executed for 
his crimes . . . ." Levine told the State Bar. "I, as counsel for Mr. Holland, 
have, in consultation with him, pursued his desires . . . . I defy anyone to 
specifically delineate any disadvantages which occurred to either client . . . 
. I have continually maintained a position, though not popular in the legal 
community, consistent with Mr. Holland's publicly stated desires and wishes." 
</P>
<P>
 Here and there in the legal community, a few isolated voices of support have 
been heard, one being that of Greg Smith, partner in Affordable Legal 
Advocates, a Salt Lake City law firm representing low-income people. 
</P>
<P>
 "This response to Levine has me baffled," he said. "What do they want? Are we 
to force the state's will upon our clients? Mr. Holland wanted the death 
penalty, and his attorney got him exactly what he wanted. I think Levine was 
playing adversary, in the sense that he was advancing the interests of his 
client against what the state wanted. What bothers me is, so many attorneys 
don't even see the danger here of Big Brother telling you what to do. This is 
an intrusion of the state between the defense attorney and his client. It's 
amazing to me that everyone sees this as so easy to call. I don't think it's 
easy, or cut and dried. I think it's nebulous. This is not an easy issue." 
</P>
<P>
 For most of the Utah legal community, though, it indeed has been an easy 
issue. For most, Levine's actions were, in the end, an utterly unacceptable 
betrayal of what they were all about. Levine was making not just the defense 
bar but everyone in the legal system look bad. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense attorney's unfettered advocacy of his client, after all, is what 
validates the prosecutor's resolute and unbridled effort to prove him guilty, 
and the state's devastating act of imprisoning or executing him. Each side 
assumes their unpleasantly hard pushes will be countered, and thus justified, 
by someone else's hard pushes. If the defense attorney refuses his role, the 
state's actions begin to look questionable, if not odious. 
</P>
<P>
 Plainly, Levine's stance demanded a response. That task fell to Utah state 
Assistant Atty. Gen. J. Frederic Voros, the appellate-level prosecutor in the 
Taylor case. In a motion to the Utah Supreme Court, he put his argument simply: 
To preserve the "integrity of the judicial system," Levine must withdraw from 
both the Taylor and Holland cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The state high court's justices unanimously agreed. On Sept. 23, 1993, 
granting Voros' motion, they removed Levine from the Taylor case and referred 
the matter to the Utah State Bar for "appropriate action." On Jan. 14, acting 
on their own, the justices also removed Levine from the Holland case. 
</P>
<P>
 They were appalled by Levine's "fundamental and underlying misconception of 
the defense attorney's role," and they were appalled by Levine's failure to act 
as an adversary at Holland's second penalty hearing. But what most troubled the 
justices was Levine's comment in Taylor's brief. 
</P>
<P>
 "Defense counsel breached his duty of loyalty to Holland . . ." the court 
wrote. "By asserting that Holland deserved the death penalty, Levine not only 
acted directly contrary to Holland's interest, but he aligned himself with the 
state's position . . . . We are aware that Holland might prefer the death 
penalty . . . . Nevertheless, an attorney is not justified in asserting that 
his client deserves the death penalty, even if his client desires to have that 
penalty imposed." 
</P>
<P>
 Levine received his first warning from the Utah State Bar's Office of Attorney 
Discipline in late October. That was followed in late February by notice that 
an "informal complaint" had been filed against him by the State Bar, and in 
May, after a hearing, that a State Bar panel had found probable cause to file a 
formal complaint against Levine in the state District Court. In coming weeks, 
Levine faces measures that range from reprimand to probation, suspension or 
disbarment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Levine has raised legitimate issues that need to be resolved," said Gary 
Ferrero, the State Bar's assistant disciplinary counsel. "Elliott Levine is not 
a bad guy. I see bad guys; he is not one. The thing that makes Elliott a 
problem is that Elliott doesn't see the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If Levine does not see the problem, he certainly does see the likely verdict. 
There is little chance, he realizes, that he's going to prevail. In late 
spring, as a result, Levine more or less stopped fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 He also stopped lawyering, for his practice had virtually evaporated in the 
wake of so much bad publicity. For a time, he worked as a customer service 
phone representative for Fidelity Investments in Salt Lake City. Now he is 
taking the summer off. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe I've adopted Holland's philosophy," he said one recent morning. "I 
don't want to fight. I have more important things to do with my life. I'd 
rather spend my time and energy on something else, like my 15-month-old 
daughter, instilling values. Look at the big picture: The worse thing that can 
happen is, I get disbarred. So? I'm not sure I want to be involved in the law 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Most lawyers in Utah would say that this is just as well. Most would say that 
Levine, by refusing to play their game, in a way has demonstrated precisely why 
it has to be played. Most would say that Levine, whatever the merits of the 
issues he's raised, just doesn't have the instincts and stomach for criminal 
defense law, so he shouldn't be cast in that role. 
</P>
<P>
 This story of a lawyer turned renegade to his profession, in other words, 
appears to be ending satisfactorily for just about everyone in Utah but Levine 
-- Levine, and, as it happens, James Holland. 
</P>
<P>
 The one who seven restless summers ago first inspired a lawyer's improbable 
rebellion now draws no solace from those who would defend him from Levine. 
Being described by his attorney as a prime candidate for the executioner has 
not altered Holland's thinking at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am mad as hell about the Supreme Court decision," Holland, from his 
5-by-7-foot cell, recently advised Levine in a three-page handwritten letter. 
"I've been on Death Row for 6 1/2 years and still can't get beyond automatic 
review . . . . The court wants an appeal and I don't . . . . I am guilty of 
murder . . . . I still want you as my attorney . . . . I will not accept any 
attorney the courts want to give me . . . . As far as I am concerned you are my 
attorney . . . . Elliott, I appreciate what you have done . . . . You have done 
nothing but what I wanted done."

STREAMLINING BILL GOES ON FOR 2,985 PAGES; MEASURE: OLD-TIMERS CALL IT THE 
BIGGEST LEGISLATION THEY'VE EVER SEEN. ITS GOAL IS TO REPLACE TWO TAX AGENCIES 
WITH A SINGLE DEPARTMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A four-volume, 2,985-page bill weighing more than five pounds and six times 
bigger than the state budget is causing some red faces and belly laughs around 
the state Capitol these days. 
</P>
<P>
 It all started innocently enough when freshman Sen. Tom Campbell (R-Stanford) 
introduced the legislation (SB 1829) at the request of the Wilson 
Administration in late February. 
</P>
<P>
 Designed to streamline the state's tax-collecting system to help save money, 
the measure calls for eliminating both the Franchise Tax Board and Board of 
Equalization and replacing them with a new, consolidated state Department of 
Revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of merging the two venerable bureaucracies, both of which employ 
several thousand state workers, has attracted support from the governor, who 
cited the need for consolidation in his 1994-95 state budget message, and Sen. 
Quentin L. Kopp, the independent from San Francisco whose merger bill was 
defeated on the Senate floor earlier this year. Tom McClintock, the Republican 
candidate for state controller, estimates that the change would save taxpayers 
$68 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the road to government efficiency hit an unexpected detour when a state 
computer spit out the 2,985-page measure to accomplish the task. It was the 
biggest bill Sacramento old-timers had ever seen. In comparison, the 1994-95 
state budget bill is 498 pages. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell's bill grew to monster proportions because of seemingly unending 
cross-references needed in state law. Every time the terms "Franchise Tax 
Board" or "Board of Equalization" appeared anywhere in the statute books, they 
had to be crossed out and changed to "Department of Revenue." And that meant an 
awful lot of changes and expense. 
</P>
<P>
 An initial 2,300-copy printing of the bill by the state printing plant cost 
$60,000. In contrast, the average bill costs about $2,500. Five more possible 
printings, as the bill moved through two committee hearings and the floors of 
both the Senate and Assembly, with amendments attached, could have added 
another $300,000 in printing costs. 
</P>
<P>
 When Campbell was told about the bill's size and printing costs, he was 
mortified. 
</P>
<P>
 Said longtime Senate Secretary Rick Rollens: "It easily was the largest bill 
printed that I've ever seen. He (Campbell) came running in here and shouted, 
'Stop the presses!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell contacted Rollens for advice on what to do. The remedy: a 
slimmed-down, 23-page Department of Revenue name-change bill in summary form. 
</P>
<P>
 The newest version of the legislation was approved by the Senate Revenue and 
Taxation Committee in early July, just before the Legislature broke for summer 
vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 The next step is an Appropriations Committee hearing, scheduled to be held 
after Aug. 8, when lawmakers return. 
</P>
<P>
 But if only the politics of consolidating the agencies were as simple to solve 
as rewriting a bill. The two institutions are large and powerful, although 
seldom generating public attention. The Board of Equalization in particular 
offers the politicians who run it lucrative jobs as well as a new landing zone 
for those pushed out of the Legislature by term limits. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Robert Presley (D-Riverside), the chairman of the powerful 
Appropriations Committee that will review the consolidation bill, is leaving 
the Legislature to run for a Board of Equalization seat in the November general 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 And although Campbell's bill wouldn't eliminate such jobs, their functions and 
responsibilities would be reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 And should the bill survive the Senate, it would have to pass muster in the 
Assembly, where its first stop would be the Revenue and Taxation Committee, 
chaired by Johan Klehs (D-San Leandro). Klehs is also running for the Board of 
Equalization. He has a rival reorganization plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Klehs wants to abolish the Franchise Tax Board, which includes the Board of 
Equalization chairman, the state controller and the state finance director, and 
transfer its powers and duties to the Board of Equalization. 
</P>
<P>
 The Franchise Tax Board has a $270-million annual budget and 4,600 employees. 
Its main job is to collect personal and corporate income taxes. The Board of 
Equalization has a $265-million annual budget and 4,000 employees. It collects 
sales taxes and considers appeals filed by taxpayers who think that their rates 
are unfair. 
</P>
<P>
 If Campbell's measure is approved by the Legislature, the entire 2,985-page 
bill still has to go to the governor's desk for his signature into law as a 
follow-up measure. 
</P>
<P>
 This would set another state Capitol record: the largest bill ever signed into 
law in California.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / U.S. SENATE; HUFFINGTON MAKES A NAME FOR HIMSELF; 
POLITICS: REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE, FORMERLY KNOWN AS MICHAEL, SAYS HE JUST LIKES 
BEING CALLED MIKE. CRITICS TERM THE CHANGE A PLOY TO MAKE A MILLIONAIRE SEEM 
LIKE A REGULAR GUY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There is a new member among the vaunted ranks of high-powered regular guys 
like President Bill, Governor Pete, Senator Bob and Congressman Newt. 
</P>
<P>
 California, meet Mike. Formerly Michael Huffington, the Republican candidate 
for U.S. Senate. And originally, at least at birth, Roy Michael Huffington Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 With little fanfare over the last several weeks, the campaign of Rep. 
Huffington (R-Santa Barbara) against Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein has 
decided to go casual with the candidate's moniker. He's Mike in the latest 
television commercials, a switch from last spring when ads called him Michael. 
And in campaign press releases, Mike became the standard reference about a 
month ago. 
</P>
<P>
 According to campaign officials, the change came one day when they were 
sitting around a table with the candidate and asked which name he preferred 
most. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'Frankly, I like Mike,' " said Ken Khachigian, a Huffington campaign 
adviser. "There's nothing sinister about it. It just got to be uncomfortable 
calling somebody I was getting to know real well, Michael. The reality is, he's 
Mike. He grew up with it and everybody knows him as Mike." 
</P>
<P>
 To Huffington's critics, however, it was a calculated political decision. They 
say he is being disingenuous by trying to appear like a regular guy who 
understands everyday life when he's a multimillionaire. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's sort of a con," said Feinstein adviser Bill Carrick. "This guy 
who is sort of a rich, preppy millionaire from Texas is trying to re-create a 
persona that is more attractive to middle-class working Californians. . . . So 
he is suddenly Mike. But for me, he is just plain Congressman Huffington." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's name change is not unusual. In fact, he joins a widespread 
practice in politics that some observers trace to the informality of John F. 
(Jack) Kennedy's White House and others to the presidency of Jimmy Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the august names that used to adorn Washington nameplates have 
converted into a cast of commoners. Theodore, Arthur and Walter are more likely 
to be known now as Ted, Art and Wally. 
</P>
<P>
 For many though, the change comes from more than a desire to feel comfortable 
and casual. Experts say high office is no longer considered as regal as it once 
was and the officeholders of choice today are the ones who share everyday 
lives, not just regulate them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody feels they want to be more approachable," said GOP consultant Sal 
Russo. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington still signs his name Michael, as he did when he recently wrote to 
Feinstein complaining about her campaign. And his wife, Arianna, still calls 
him Michael. 
</P>
<P>
 But for other purposes, Khachigian said, he has always gone by Mike.

LEGAL FALLOUT; JUDGE REJECTS CLAIM THAT NEVADA TEST SITE RADIATION CAUSED 
WORKER ILLNESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA L. La GANGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Alma Mosley sits alone in her cluttered house and thinks about justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Fallen behind a chest of drawers, unreachable, is a framed certificate for 
work well done, illustrated with a mushroom cloud and inscribed with her 
husband's name: Hugh Mosley. He has been dead since 1978, lost to colon cancer 
-- a victim, she says, of the Nevada Test Site, where he labored for 13 years 
at the height of the nation's nuclear weapons testing program. 
</P>
<P>
 But a federal judge here has disagreed, ruling there was not enough evidence 
to conclude that radiation caused the illnesses of Hugh Mosley and five other 
men who worked at the site in the harsh Nevada desert long ago. The judge said 
that for some of the men, lifestyles -- diet or cigarettes or alcohol -- may 
have been to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband was a clean man," says the diminutive Mosley, voice charged with 
pain, spine stiff with indignation. "He neither drank nor smoked. It was a slap 
in the face. . . . There's no justice in this government. They killed my 
husband, my children's father, and said they didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 The workers case, as Mosley's was called, was the last big Nevada Test Site 
radiation lawsuit against the government to finish trial. 
</P>
<P>
 This stretch of desert -- a restricted swath of sand and sagebrush larger than 
Rhode Island, pocked with craters from nuclear blasts and shrouded with the 
secrecy of its Cold War past -- was the site of more nuclear warhead 
detonations by the U.S. government than any other place in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 More lawsuits have been focused on this location, 65 miles northwest of Las 
Vegas, than on any other stop along the so-called Atomic Trail -- the nuclear 
weapon's path from uranium mine through manufacturing plant to proving ground. 
More protesters have been arrested here than at any other target of 
anti-nuclear activity in the country -- including more than 1,200 on one day 
alone in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the workers case possibly at an end -- an appeal is uncertain -- and 
U.S. nuclear testing halted for at least the next 14 months, a notorious 
chapter in the nation's weapons history may be coming to a close. As the United 
States heads toward next year's 50th anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima 
and Nagasaki, the Nevada Test Site is on the precipice of a dramatic change: 
</P>
<P>
 * The world's nuclear powers began meeting again last week in Geneva to 
continue work on a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty that could render the 
Nevada site unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 * The U.S. Department of Energy is scrambling to figure out what to do with 
1,350 square miles of irradiated Nevada desert. Among the options: turning the 
site into a Solar Enterprise Zone for solar energy research and development. A 
business/government task force met Saturday in Las Vegas to discuss harnessing 
the above-100-degree summer temperatures, which department spokesman Darwin 
Morgan euphemistically calls "our solar resources." 
</P>
<P>
 * No new lawsuits are in the works to hold the government accountable for 
alleged radiation exposure to men, women, children and animals between the 
first blast at the test site in 1951 and the last in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "The significance of the decision (in the workers case) is that, right or 
wrong, it ends . . . the legal history of the Cold War nuclear weapons testing 
project at the Nevada Test Site," says Larry Johns, an attorney for the 
plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Had the July 20 decision in U.S. District Court gone in favor of the six 
workers, says John Thorndal, an attorney involved in the government's 
successful defense, "it could have opened up the government to enormous 
financial exposure and probably clogged the courts for years here in Las 
Vegas." 
</P>
<P>
 Like the seven other major radiation exposure lawsuits to come out of the 
nation's nuclear weapons program, the workers case was actually a combination 
of many other lawsuits, in this case for a grand total of 220 plaintiffs. 
Because class-action lawsuits against the government are not allowed, six of 
the individual cases -- including Hugh Mosley's -- were chosen to go to trial. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, "there was a substantial number of people claiming their diseases 
were caused by exposure at the test site, but the court ruled otherwise," 
Thorndal said. 
</P>
<P>
 Driving south on U.S. 95 toward Las Vegas, there is very little indication 
that the hot, flat desert and dramatic mesas to the left hosted nuclear 
detonations, both aboveground and below, for 41 years. The off-ramp for the 
test site is marked simply "Mercury," the name of the small support town within 
the restricted region. A "No Services" sign is tacked on for good measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Chain-link pens, constructed in the 1980s to hold protesters arrested during 
waves of demonstrations, gleam in the setting sun on the approach to the small, 
secretive town. According to the blue Adopt-a-Highway sign, the mile-and-a-half 
stretch of roadway bordering the test site was adopted last year by the Nevada 
Desert Experience, a "faith-based" anti-nuclear group whose members both 
protest the site and pick up its highway litter. 
</P>
<P>
 In the beginning, the Nevada Test Site was a symbol of pride, the place where 
the Atomic Age came out of the closet when nuclear testing moved from the 
seclusion of little Pacific atolls to the glare of the continental United 
States, by order of President Harry S. Truman in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
 Early atmospheric tests became public relations events, with Las Vegas 
residents throwing rooftop viewing parties to watch the blasts. "Moe Dalitz and 
Wilbur Clark planned the opening of the Desert Inn to coincide with a 
detonation," says Deke Castleman in "The Nevada Handbook." "A silent majority 
certainly worried which way the wind blew, and a vocal minority seemed to 
contract a strange 'atom fever,' marketing everything from atom burgers to 
nuclear gasoline and appointing a yearly Miss Atomic Blast." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Johns, who came to spend nearly 25 years challenging the government's 
alleged cover-up of radiation exposure injuries, recalls the eerie early 
morning glow of nuclear shots that punctuated his Las Vegas boyhood. He 
participated in "duck and cover" drills at his elementary school and remembers 
the mushroom cloud emblazoned on the cover of the 1953 yearbook for Las Vegas 
High, where his father taught history. The Johnses rented their family home to 
a test site scientist one summer when they were away on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a honeymoon, a love affair that went on here into the mid-'50s," 
Johns says. "It was exciting. These were super scientists, and they were going 
to save the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Then things began to go wrong. Nearly 5,000 sheep died after a string of 
strong blasts in 1953 called the Upshot-Knothole series. "Wool sloughed off in 
clumps, most of the adult sheep had blisters and sores on their faces, and the 
new lambs were either stillborn with grotesque deformities or were so weak they 
were unable to nurse and died soon after birth," says Stewart Udall in his new 
book, "The Myths of August." 
</P>
<P>
 Udall, a former secretary of the interior, has brought many of the cases 
against the government, including the workers case and unsuccessful lawsuits 
seeking compensation for uranium miners and so-called "downwinders" who lived 
in the path of the radioactive fallout from the Nevada Test Site. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1956, U.S. District Judge Sherman A. Christensen ruled that the radiation 
doses received by the sheep were not enough to cause the carnage and that the 
government was not negligent. After congressional hearings in 1979 revealed 
that the government had falsified or withheld evidence during the trial, 
Christensen reversed his own decision and ordered a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "The conduct of the government amounted to a species of fraud on the court for 
which a remedy must be granted," Christensen said in his 1982 opinion. But four 
years later, the U.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Christensen's 
findings and canceled the new trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of strict government secrecy and general scientific ignorance about 
the effects of radiation, it took until the 1970s for lawsuits to be filed in 
large numbers against the government, alleging that radiation exposure from the 
test site caused injury and death. 
</P>
<P>
 Johns and Thorndal were opponents in the first big case of the 1970s, the 
Roberts and Nunamaker case. Johns filed the suit against the government and its 
contractors in 1972, after an underground nuclear blast vented into the 
atmosphere, causing a 10,000-foot mushroom cloud and exposing between 600 and 
900 test site workers in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 The two lawyers have become friendly adversaries over the last two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I started the Roberts and Nunamaker case, it was the first one that laid 
a lot of the groundwork," says Thorndal. "I had no kids when it started. Now my 
oldest is 22 and the youngest is 17." 
</P>
<P>
 The case has gone to the U.S. Court of Appeals three times and is still 
awaiting final resolution. It is the only big Nevada Test Site case that still 
has some life in it (the government has won the other four); attorneys have yet 
to decide whether to appeal the July 20 decision in the workers case. 
</P>
<P>
 Darrin Tuck, for one, does not want to spend the rest of his life fighting the 
government on behalf of his dead father, a former test site worker and one of 
the plaintiffs in the workers case. "It's a never-ending battle," he says over 
coffee at smoky Saddle West casino in Pahrump, Nev., near Death Valley. "I 
could see that during the trial." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuck, 35, was fighting to avenge the premature death of his father, Calvin, 
who in 1974 succumbed to pancreatic cancer at the age of 47. Calvin Tuck had 
worked at the Nevada Test Site for nine years as a radiation monitor, entering 
the tunnels after underground tests were held to see how much radiation was 
present. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd sit on his lap, play with his badge, feel his whiskers, because he'd be 
gone for two or three days at a time," recalls Tuck of his childhood and his 
father's top-secret job. "I'd get the James Bond fascination when I was 
younger. My mother said he couldn't talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Calvin Tuck did, however, talk about the pain, which sent him to doctors 
throughout his final years at the test site in the late 1960s. One doctor said 
Tuck had gout, another said he didn't know what he had. The disease was finally 
diagnosed in 1971 and he died in 1974. In the written opinion in the workers 
case, U.S. District Judge Philip Pro blamed Tuck's death on alcohol and 
cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 "That hurts me here," says Darrin Tuck, placing hand over heart and cigarette 
pack. "He was serving his country out there. He was a peacekeeper and didn't 
get recognition. All they say is he smoked and drank too much. He's not getting 
credit for what he really did." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the six men involved in the workers case, Keith Prescott of tiny Francis, 
Utah, can claim two major distinctions: Unlike Tuck and Mosley, his lifestyle 
was not fingered in his cancer diagnosis. And, after watching his friends and 
former colleagues die, one after the other, of painful cancers, he is the only 
living plaintiff. 
</P>
<P>
 There was Robert Bergen, Prescott's boss when Prescott came home from the test 
site for the last time at age 43. Bergen died 15 years ago, he says, as he 
lists his catalogue of colleagues. Then there was Doug Godfrey, dead for 
perhaps a decade, and Cal Walters, a shift boss. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nearly all my best friends that I worked with died of cancer," says Prescott, 
the former equipment operator who has battled multiple myeloma, or tumors in 
his bone marrow, for 25 years. "I was a pallbearer for three of them. It's hard 
on you, I tell you." 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the workers case appears to be over, Prescott is left with another 
reason to mourn: the loss of hope, the loss of pride. Deep down, he thought his 
case was so strong that simply getting to trial -- a process that took 15 years 
-- would automatically lead to compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 He hasn't worked since he was 43; he is 68 today, a dignified man who has 
always believed that he should earn his own, financially and emotionally. "I 
had to rely on my wife," he says. "There was so much my kids didn't get to do. 
I just thought if I could get compensation, I could pay them back and earn my 
way." 
</P>
<P>
 Prescott must, like the Department of Energy itself, now learn to move on. As 
the department searches for new uses for the sprawling test site, Prescott 
searches for a reason to wake up in the morning. "I've lost all of my strength, 
vitality, determination," he says. "That was a blow I didn't expect. There's 
not a thing you can do about it. I imagine after a while I'll get used to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Alma Mosley would not say she's used to it, but the vantage point is different 
when you're a survivor, not a victim. The 15 years of legal maneuvering, Mosley 
says, have had their advantages. For her, litigation is a memorial. 
</P>
<P>
 "The death of a loved one makes (the legal battle) very worthwhile, whether 
they compensate us or not," she says. "It's a way of not forgetting -- even 
though the government said they didn't do nothing."

PROBE FINDS NO ETHICS BREACHES AT TREASURY; WHITEWATER: BUT THE GOVERNMENT 
INQUIRY CALLS SOME CONTACTS BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT AND WHITE HOUSE 'TROUBLING.' 
SENATE HEARINGS RESUME TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ROSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, under fire from Republicans over his 
department's conduct in the Whitewater affair, said Sunday an internal 
government review found no evidence that either he or his senior aides violated 
ethics rules in their contacts with the White House about a criminal 
investigation affecting the President and Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen released a lengthy report by the Office of Government Ethics, which 
called some of the contacts "troubling" but concluded that they breached no 
ethical guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 "We turned the Treasury Department inside out to find every scrap of paper and 
every record that might conceivably have some bearing on this issue," Bentsen 
told a news conference. But on the basis of what the independent inspectors 
found, he added, "I can reasonably conclude that the conduct of the people 
working here . . . did not, I repeat, did not violate the standards of ethical 
conduct for executive branch employees." 
</P>
<P>
 The report was the third government review to conclude that White House and 
Treasury Department aides did nothing wrong by holding a series of discussions 
from September to February about the Resolution Trust Corp.'s investigation 
into Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan, a failed Arkansas thrift owned by James 
B. McDougal, the Clintons' partner in the Ozarks development known as 
Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitewater special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. has already concluded that the 
contacts violated no criminal laws. White House Counsel Lloyd N. Cutler has 
said that his own review found no ethical improprieties by the White House 
aides involved in the discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 But while Treasury Department officials clearly hoped that the latest findings 
would exonerate them before congressional hearings on the Whitewater affair 
resume today, the report failed to resolve a number of discrepancies that have 
emerged in the sometimes conflicting testimony of White House and Treasury 
Department aides concerning the extent and precise nature of the contacts. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the discrepancies revolve around conflicting accounts of when Bentsen 
and Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman learned of the contacts. 
Particularly controversial is what Altman and Treasury Department Counsel Jean 
Hanson told White House officials about the confidential RTC probe, which was 
examining allegations that federally insured deposits from Madison had been 
illegally diverted into the Whitewater venture. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen, Altman and Hanson will testify before the Senate Banking Committee 
beginning today. Hanson and White House Deputy Counsel Harold M. Ickes have 
already given sworn depositions that contradict some of what Bentsen and Altman 
have said about the information given to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Ickes, according to Republican members of the Banking Committee, told 
investigators that Altman gave the White House confidential information about 
the status of the RTC probe at a meeting Feb. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 That allegation was repeated on Sunday by the Senate panel's ranking 
Republican, Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York. On NBC-TV's "Meet the Press," 
D'Amato called Altman "absolutely out of line" when, according to the Ickes 
deposition, he told White House aides at the Feb. 2 meeting that the RTC could 
not finish its Madison probe before a deadline for filing civil claims in the 
matter had expired at the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the deadline was subsequently extended by Congress, any prior 
disclosure about the status of the probe would have violated RTC rules barring 
the communication of such information to anyone mentioned in its 
investigations. Although the Clintons were not named as subjects in the Madison 
probe, they were listed as potential witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Roger Altman deliberately misled Congress" and through the White House aides 
"gave sensitive inside information to the President and Mrs. Clinton," D'Amato 
charged, adding that the evidence was so "overwhelming" that he had no doubt 
that Altman "will be forced to resign." 
</P>
<P>
 Altman, a close friend of Clinton's, has denied passing along confidential 
information about the probe. Sen. Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, a 
Democratic member of the banking panel who appeared on the same program with 
D'Amato, came to Altman's defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not Watergate, this is not Iran-Contra . . ." Dodd said. "No one has 
suggested there has been obstruction of justice. Roger Altman . . . deserves to 
be heard." 
</P>
<P>
 However, even Dodd conceded that the depositions contained "conflicting 
testimony about these contacts (and) what occurred at these meetings."

NAACP CHIEF DENIES HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS; LITIGATION: CHAVIS WILL FIGHT 
EX-EMPLOYEE'S LAWSUIT. HE DEFENDS USING GROUP'S MONEY IN SETTLEMENT WITH WOMAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 NAACP Executive Director Benjamin F. Chavis Jr. asserted his innocence Sunday 
and vowed to fight allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination that 
have resulted in a lawsuit against the civil rights group and in calls for his 
resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know full well that the plaintiff's accusations are completely false and 
have no merit," Chavis said. He said he agreed in November to a financial 
settlement totaling more than $300,000 to protect the organization from "false 
and slanderous allegations." 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not intend to allow these false allegations to usurp my energy or 
commitment to continue to lead the NAACP in the positive direction we embarked 
upon 18 months ago," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 46-year-old Chavis has been under fire since he was appointed executive 
director of the 85-year-old civil rights organization in April, 1993. He has 
been criticized for leading the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored 
People in directions that some of its board members consider radical. The 
lawsuit and disclosure that he had agreed to a financial settlement without 
informing the board has further wounded him within the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 NAACP national board Chairman William F. Gibson, a staunch Chavis supporter, 
said he became aware of the employee's complaints in late 1993 and left the 
matter up to Chavis to handle as he saw fit. "Dr. Chavis had complete executive 
authority to address the administrative complaint," Gibson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The role of the board of directors of any organization is to guide its 
philosophy and overall mission. The CEO is responsible for implementation of 
the policies, recommendations of appropriate goals for the organization and 
administration of the day-to-day operations." 
</P>
<P>
 Some members of the organization's 64-member board were particularly disturbed 
that they had not been informed of the lawsuit at the group's annual convention 
last month in Chicago, where Chavis was asked about pending lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chavis did not at that time know of the lawsuit, said his attorney, Abbey 
Hairston, who said she'd decided it was "not important enough" to disturb 
convention preparations by informing him. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit was filed June 29 in Washington and served on the organization's 
Washington office June 30, but it wasn't forwarded to Hairston's law firm until 
the week of July 4, she said. When she tried to contact Chavis, she learned 
that he and other top leaders in the organization were in Chicago preparing for 
the convention. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made the decision not to disturb Dr. Chavis with a lawsuit that had no 
merit," she said. As a result, most members of the board learned of the 
lawsuit, the harassment complaints and the financial settlement from news 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
 In the lawsuit, Mary E. Stansel, a former NAACP employee, accuses Chavis of 
reneging on a promise to help her find a better job outside the organization. 
While Hairston stressed that sexual harassment is not an issue in the lawsuit, 
Chavis agreed to a $332,400 financial settlement last year after Stansel 
accused him of harassment and threatened to sue the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavis agreed to pay Stansel two installments of $25,000 each and then $5,400 
a month for six months. Chavis further promised to help Stansel find a job 
outside the NAACP and to pay her an additional $250,000 if she did not have a 
job offer after six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson said Stansel had received $82,400 as of June 30. "Of that amount, 
$64,000 came from NAACP funds. The other $18,400 beyond the NAACP cost was 
covered by friends of the organization who made contributions to avoid that 
additional financial impact on our institution." 
</P>
<P>
 He would not identify the donors. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavis did not pay the additional $250,000 because it was determined that he 
had fulfilled his obligation to help her find a job with the federal government 
by circulating her credentials to federal agencies, Hairston said. "Dr. Chavis 
has absolutely no authority to dictate to the federal government who they 
should hire for employment," she said. "Everything that the NAACP was supposed 
to do was done." 
</P>
<P>
 Only one agency agreed to interview Stansel, and that agency chose not to 
offer her a job, Hairston said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alleging that Stansel was not qualified for the level of employment she was 
seeking and that she did not cooperate with attempts to find her a job, 
Hairston said the NAACP filed a countersuit July 20 seeking unspecified 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Stansel, who has an unlisted phone number, was not available for comment 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Hairston said in an earlier interview with The Times that Stansel, a lawyer, 
had been "embittered" after she was not permanently hired at the end of a 
six-week temporary position last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavis, branding Stansel's lawsuit as "frivolous," said: "Faced with threats 
of serious and unfounded charges against the NAACP, I made an administration 
decision to protect the NAACP from exposure to false and slanderous allegations 
by entering into an out-of-court agreement and settlement designed to resolve 
the matter and avoid debilitating injury to the NAACP." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "I do not minimize the harm of sexual harassment when it happens. I 
have spent over 34 years of my life in the civil rights movement fighting 
against racial and sexual injustice. . . . I would not want the great work of 
the NAACP to be distracted by a frivolous lawsuit." 
</P>
<P>
 After Chavis was appointed, he quickly came under attack for reaching out to 
such black nationalists as Angela Davis and to Louis Farrakhan, the 
controversial black Muslim leader. Some board members criticized Chavis earlier 
this year when they learned that the organization had accumulated a 
$2.7-million deficit, which has since grown to nearly $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 He won vindication of sorts at last month's NAACP convention in Chicago, where 
he defeated an attempt by one of his harshest critics to join the national 
board. He also won a vote of confidence when delegates approved his initiative 
to expand the organization's reach to South Africa, despite the group's 
financial difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, some members of the board criticized Chavis for entering into the 
financial agreement without prior board approval. Mark Steppe, a board member 
in Detroit, called it "a moral fraud." 
</P>
<P>
 But, speaking at a news conference in Atlanta before reporters attending a 
joint convention of African American, Latino, Asian and Native American 
journalists, Chavis said: "We are confidant that we will prevail and be 
completely vindicated." In his first public comments on the controversy, he was 
flanked at the podium by his wife and several members of the NAACP national 
board. Chavis had been out of the country until Saturday.

MUBARAK SAYS SYRIA IS SHOWING FLEXIBILITY; MIDEAST: EGYPTIAN PRESIDENT PREDICTS 
A BREAKTHROUGH THIS YEAR IN PEACE TALKS BETWEEN ISRAEL AND DAMASCUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said Sunday that Syria has become "much more 
flexible" and predicted a breakthrough in its peace talks with Israel before 
the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 In a summit with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin to brief him on his 
latest mediation contacts in Damascus, Mubarak said he is optimistic that U.S. 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher's next visit to the region Aug. 8 will 
produce even more concrete results. 
</P>
<P>
 The Egyptian leader, who met with Syrian President Hafez Assad after 
Christopher's last round of shuttle diplomacy, said the two sides are making 
progress in their standoff over Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, 
captured by Israel from Syria during the 1967 Arab-Israeli War. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having talks with him two, three, four hours, I can tell what is in his 
chest. I can tell you he wants peace," Mubarak said of Assad. 
</P>
<P>
 "My impression is that Syria is really interested in peace. I hope Syria could 
reach an agreement by the end of this year." 
</P>
<P>
 But Rabin said Israel is waiting for concrete gestures from Syria to signal 
that it is ready to make peace. 
</P>
<P>
 He pointed to the interim agreements signed with the Palestine Liberation 
Organization and Jordan as pathways to trust between Israelis and Syrians, a 
necessary prelude to genuine peacemaking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Syria has to do something. It needs public diplomacy, it needs public 
utterances that will bring the people of Israel to be convinced that Syria is 
eager to have peace," Rabin told reporters.

 "I'll give you an example: President Sadat (the late Egyptian president) came 
to Jerusalem. Believe me, he broke down all the walls between Egypt and Israel 
by the mere fact that he came there. Even without signing a peace treaty, we 
had a trilateral meeting in Washington in which the President of the United 
States, the king of Jordan and myself shook hands, were together openly. We 
haven't seen anything of this kind, not even on a smaller scale, by Syria," 
Rabin said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the fact that Syrian television broadcast part of the signing ceremony 
with Jordan "might be the beginning of a sign." 
</P>
<P>
 Privately, Egyptian officials are upbeat about the prospects for a peace 
agreement but say little concrete progress has been made, even with 
Christopher's two trips to Damascus and Jerusalem and Mubarak's mediation last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Osama Baz, Mubarak's chief political adviser and a central diplomatic figure 
in the peace process, said there has been progress on a timetable for Israeli 
withdrawal from the Golan Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 For months, the two sides have appeared close to an accord on the principle of 
an Israeli withdrawal in exchange for a peace treaty, but have fallen apart 
over the issue of how much of a withdrawal and how fast, in exchange for how 
much peace, and how fast. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a matter of mistrust between both sides," Mubarak sighed. 
</P>
<P>
 But Baz said talks have focused on "what are the profits that they both expect 
to gain, and what are the benefits in the event that they reach mutual 
understanding. Both are using a more realistic view of the next steps that are 
needed . . . what are the stages that are needed to accomplish and what will be 
the amount of time needed to accomplish them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "After all the meetings and the rounds of talks, there has come a much clearer 
image of what is expected in the future," he said. "We hope within the next 10 
weeks to reach some advancement, because anything accomplished in these talks 
will back up and reinforce what has been accomplished so far." 
</P>
<P>
 Mubarak also questioned Rabin on the sensitive issue of Jerusalem. Israel's 
pledge to give Jordan a special role in overseeing the holy Muslim shrines 
there has raised alarm signals among Palestinians, who see Jerusalem as the 
capital of a future Palestinian state. 
</P>
<P>
 Mubarak reiterated Egypt's position that the status of Jerusalem must be left 
to talks on the final status of the Palestinian territories, to begin after two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin sought to downplay any alarm, emphasizing that the agreement with Jordan 
only recognized Jordan's role over the past 27 years as caretaker of the holy 
shrines. 
</P>
<P>
 "What was signed in Washington (with Jordan) was basically to respect the 
existing agreements about the Muslim holy shrines that are held by the . . . 
Waqfs (religious endowments) ministry financed by Jordan for the last 27 
years," he said.

PRO-JORDAN PAPER STOPS PUBLICATION AFTER PLO BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Palestinian newspaper announced Sunday it is closing indefinitely because of 
a PLO decision to ban its distribution in the self-rule areas of Gaza and 
Jericho. 
</P>
<P>
 Mustafa Sawwaf, a journalist at An Nahar newspaper, said Editor Othman Hallaq 
froze publication of the newspaper and put staff on unpaid leave until further 
notice.The paper's Jerusalem headquarters were locked Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 An Nahar has traditionally been close to Jordan, which last week signed an 
agreement with Israel that angered the Palestine Liberation Organization. 
Founded in 1985, An Nahar is one of the two daily newspapers serving 
Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palestinian Authority banned circulation of the newspaper in Gaza and 
Jericho on Thursday, saying it had failed to register with the new self-rule 
authorities. But Palestinian journalists said no registration process had been 
initiated in the two months since self-rule began.

U.N. VOTE GETS SUPPORT FROM HAITI'S STREETS BUT NOT ITS ELITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some Haitians welcomed the U.N. approval Sunday of the use of force to topple 
their military government, saying that freedom is worth any sacrifice. Others 
predicted a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid Haiti is going to become a new Somalia," said Antoine Joseph, a 
former president of the lower house of Parliament. A multinational peacekeeping 
force has failed to curb clan fighting in Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. Security Council authorized "any means necessary" to force Haiti's 
military rulers to step down and allow deposed President Jean-Bertrand Aristide 
to return. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are stepping in to restore constitutional democracy, that is to say, 
stepping in to violate it," said Jean-Claude Roy, a conservative politician who 
has close ties to the military. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Aristide is restored to office by a foreign intervention, he is finished," 
said Joseph, who opposed the 1991 coup that toppled Aristide but has 
nonetheless supported the military. 
</P>
<P>
 "He will be a puppet with no moral authority in the eyes of the Haitian 
people," Joseph said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coup leader Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras attended a Methodist church service shortly 
before the Security Council approved the resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 "After this service, I have enough strength to defend the country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reaction on the street differed. Bus drivers Jean-Claude, 38, and Pierre, 40, 
didn't want to give their full names for fear of reprisals. But they favored an 
end to military rule by any means. 
</P>
<P>
 "I support a military intervention if it uproots the military system we've got 
now," said Jean-Claude. "Haiti doesn't need a military occupation, but ever 
since we won our independence, we've never been free." 
</P>
<P>
 "I want another Haitian army," Pierre said. "This army is no good. I don't 
want this army to go on torturing and sowing the streets with dead bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 "National sovereignty isn't the problem," he added. "I want the Haitian army 
to disappear." 
</P>
<P>
 Haiti's military rulers have defied a worldwide trade and oil embargo and a 
U.S. ban on most financial transactions with the Caribbean nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration repeatedly has threatened an invasion and, 
following Sunday's U.N. vote, is "prepared to organize and lead" an invasion 
force, said Madeleine Albright, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Navy ships carrying 2,700 Marines are stationed off Haiti.

EXHAUSTED CREWS BATTLE 34 FOREST FIRES IN WASHINGTON; DISASTER: THE BLAZES ARE 
AMONG DOZENS ROARING IN SEVEN STATES. RESOURCES ARE BEING STRETCHED IN WHAT 
OFFICIALS ARE CALLING THE WORST SEASON IN DECADES. 
</P>

<P>
 Sprawled on the grass beside a pear orchard Sunday afternoon, 40 dirty and 
bedraggled firefighters stared at a thick column of orange-gray smoke rising 
off a steep slope overlooking this Bavarian-theme resort town. 
</P>
<P>
 Their rest did not last long. "Listen! You can hear it," two of them said in 
unison as orange flames leaped skyward and the hissing of orchard sprinklers 
was drowned out by the crackle of burning sage and timber in the forest less 
than a mile away. 
</P>
<P>
 Exhausted and weary, the team of firefighters trained to combat structural 
blazes in the nearby community of Yakima geared up once again to save lives and 
property from one of 34 forest fires burning roughly 15,000 acres in the 
Wenatchee National Forest of north-central Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities had to reach back to the turn of the century to recall anything 
comparable to the fast-moving fires that have torched at least 28 homes in the 
region and destroyed an estimated 100 additional structures since Friday. 
"These fires are incredible," said Leo Knowles, a spokesman for the Chelan 
County sheriff's office. "There is nothing to compare them to over the past 100 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Zaccardo, a spokesman for the state Department of Natural Resources, 
said, "We saw columns of smoke that rivaled what we saw on Mt. St. Helens when 
it erupted." 
</P>
<P>
 Zaccardo also expressed frustration over the emphasis that firefighters are 
having to place on protecting private property at the interface separating 
wilderness and expanding urban boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are protecting the houses first and therefore we cannot be as aggressive 
as we normally would in fighting the forest fire," Zaccardo said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fires here are among dozens of other major blazes roaring across seven 
states that are stretching resources to the limit in what federal fire 
authorities are calling the worst fire season in decades. 
</P>
<P>
 The fires erupted Friday in Icicle Creek Canyon, a few miles southwest of 
Leavenworth. By Sunday, they had damaged a water-treatment plant in 
Leavenworth, where residents were being warned to boil their water. About 1,500 
people have been evacuated in the arid eastern slopes of the Cascades. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials warned another 6,000 people Sunday afternoon to prepare to 
leave as winds picked up and propelled a fire to within four miles of the city 
limits of the apple-growing town of Cashmere. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five miles to the north, a fire that scorched 90,000 acres of grass, 
sage and pine veered from the lake resort community of Chelan on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the sparsely populated mountains here, smoke was so thick that 
breathing was difficult, and travelers were advised to turn on their 
headlights. 
</P>
<P>
 With resources stretched thin, Washington Gov. Mike Lowry and Oregon Gov. 
Barbara Roberts signed their first interstate agreement to exchange 
firefighters and equipment. For the 3,700 fatigued firefighters on the lines, 
some from as far away as Florida, additional help came Sunday with the arrival 
of 500 National Guardsmen from Oregon, and the first of two battalions of 
Marines from Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, more than 1,000 evacuees waited to see if their homes would still 
be standing when they returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them is Karl Reuss, 58, a retired aircraft engineer who moved here from 
Rowland Heights in 1991 and built a home in a wooded section of Icicle Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm concerned about it. On the other hand, God gave it to us and he can take 
it away," said Reuss, who has been staying at a Red Cross shelter here since 
Friday with his wife, mother, daughter and granddaughter. "Nothing says we 
can't start it again." 
</P>
<P>
 With temperatures climbing to 90 degrees and the National Weather Service 
predicting a chance of isolated lightning storms over the next few days, fire 
officials were resigned to more long, hot struggles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fire gets in trees like that and starts crowning," firefighter Todd Maltais 
said, nodding toward a stand of ponderosa pines on the steep ridge overlooking 
Leavenworth. "Then nothing's going to stop it." 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, fires sparked by lightning blazed out of control in Oregon, Utah, 
Idaho, Wyoming, California, Montana and British Columbia. In Montana, a tanker 
plane crashed near the Flathead Indian Reservation on Friday, killing its two 
crew members.

FBI INVESTIGATED SUSPECT BEFORE CLINIC KILLINGS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A month before he was arrested in the killing of an abortion doctor and 
bodyguard, a former minister was investigated but not arrested by the FBI for 
allegedly violating a federal law protecting abortion clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors weighed the clinic's rights against Paul Hill's right of free 
speech and decided an arrest wasn't warranted, FBI spokesman George Wisnovsky 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The director of the Pensacola clinic had asked that Hill be arrested under the 
Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act. The law makes it a crime to 
obstruct, intentionally injure or intimidate anyone trying to obtain an 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Taggart, director of The Ladies Center in Pensacola, complained that 
Hill had been screaming through the clinic's windows. Hill was a regular 
protester who advocated the killing of abortion doctors as justifiable 
homicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, 40, is charged with two counts of murder and one count of attempted 
murder in the deaths of Dr. John Bayard Britton, 69, of Fernandina Beach, and 
retired Air Force Lt. Col. James Herman Barrett, 74, of Pensacola. The men were 
killed Friday by multiple shotgun blasts as they drove into the clinic's 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrett's wife, June, 68, a retired public health nurse, was wounded in the 
arm.

<P>
 Three teen-age boys died in shootings Saturday night in separate incidents, 
and Los Angeles police suspect that each death may have been gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
 A 14-year-old died after being shot at from a passing car in Koreatown about 
9:30 p.m. The youth died from a chest wound at California Hospital Medical 
Center.

<P>
 Names of the two youths were not available Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than an hour later, Guillermo Nava, 14, was shot and killed on a sidewalk 
in Watts. Police said Nava, who lived in the area, died of a head wound at the 
scene.

FIRE HALTED SHORT OF CONDOR RELEASE AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hacking their way through rugged chaparral-filled canyons, 500 firefighters 
Sunday blocked the advance of a fire that threatened the remote ridgetop site 
in Santa Barbara County where scientists release condors into the wild. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the fire was 70% contained by late Sunday, "It's pretty tough 
terrain, so we don't expect full containment until 6 p.m. (Monday)," said state 
Deputy Fire Marshal Jim Tringham."The condor site is five miles away and it's 
not going to get close. So it's safe." 
</P>
<P>
 The 3,000-acre blaze was apparently started by human hands, but it was too 
early to say whether it was accidental or deliberate, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The flames did not endanger the Sisquoc Condor Sanctuary, where regulations 
discourage the use of airborne firefighting equipment. The refuge for the 
handful of survivors of the ancient, broad-winged avian breed lies several 
miles farther south, beyond a ridge within the San Rafael Wilderness Area. 
</P>
<P>
 Aided by four airborne tankers and a water-dropping helicopter, firefighters 
from local, state and federal agencies battled the blaze, which began just 
before noon Saturday in a rugged, road-less area five miles west of the town of 
New Cuyama. 
</P>
<P>
 Fanned by a westerly breeze, flames moved uphill toward Montgomery Potrero, an 
ancient Chumash Indian site near the spot where the condor program maintains a 
few temporary structures. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracie Welton, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Forest Service, said that 
firefighters were slowed down occasionally by aboveground oil pipelines that 
blocked bulldozer access, but that there had been no ruptures or spills. 
</P>
<P>
 No injuries or structural losses were reported.

ABORTION-RIGHTS LEADER URGES CALM; HEALTH: WILLIAM BAIRD PLEADS FOR TOLERANCE 
TWO DAYS AFTER A DOCTOR AND SECURITY ESCORT ARE SLAIN IN FLORIDA. HE CALLS FOR 
MORE PROTECTION AT CLINICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The nation's senior abortion-rights advocate pleaded Sunday for tolerance amid 
increasingly violent reactions against the right to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want the anti-abortion people to tolerate the right of Americans to make 
their own moral decisions," William Baird said at a Costa Mesa church, two days 
after a doctor and his security escort were shotgunned to death outside a 
Florida clinic. "Why can't we say to the Catholics and the fundamentalist 
Christians, 'If you think (abortion) is wrong, then don't you have it' " 
</P>
<P>
 But Baird, 62, a tireless abortion-rights advocate who opened the country's 
first birth control and abortion counseling clinic in New York in 1963, also 
criticized the federal government and police for not adequately protecting 
abortion clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 The murder suspect, Paul J. Hill, had threatened to kill abortion doctors, and 
told a radio audience last year that killing Baird would be "justifiable 
homicide," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This need not have happened. The man was a walking time bomb," Baird told the 
congregation of about 75 at the Orange Coast Unitarian Universalist Church. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI should treat anti-abortion activists as terrorists, Baird said later, 
adding that unless clinics are fully protected there is a risk of reaction to 
the violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two hundred clinics have been firebombed . . . and the Right to Life group is 
not determined to be a terrorist group," Baird said. "Tell me this is not a 
conspiracy. Where are the chemicals coming from? Who is training these people?" 
</P>
<P>
 Baird's often graphic discussion of crude methods from the era of illegal 
abortions and the violence in the abortion debate brought groans from the 
gathering, who applauded him at the end of his talk. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's distressing," said George Shackelford of Irvine. "I have to say it seems 
like some things have gotten better, but this firebombing stuff definitely 
seems like terrorism to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Semler of Huntington Beach said Baird's message "makes me feel guilty I 
haven't done more. . . . I cringe that people are getting killed." 
</P>
<P>
 Baird acknowledged that he is a potential target. Throughout the years, he has 
been arrested eight times in five states and was the principal litigant in 
reproductive freedom cases three times before the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 One important decision came in 1972 when the court, by a 6-1 vote, overturned 
a Massachusetts law that outlawed selling birth control to single people and 
writing on the subject. In that case, Baird vs. Eisenstadt, he had been 
arrested in 1967 for handing out contraceptives to Boston University students.

DOCTOR WORKING TO EASE INFANTS' PAIN; MEDICINE: O.C. SPECIALIST JOINS THE FIGHT 
AGAINST PROFESSION'S TRADITIONAL RELUCTANCE TO ORDER DRUGS FOR SUFFERING 
BABIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE MARQUIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a pediatric resident seven years ago, Dr. Perry Eisner had what would seem 
simple goals: to stick up for his tiny patients and, as much as possible, 
protect them from pain. 
</P>
<P>
 Turned out not to be so simple. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisner recalls being paged in the middle of the night to the bedsides of 
wailing infants fresh from major surgery. The parents would plead with him 
frantically: "Can't you do something for our baby?" But overworked surgical 
residents, who controlled the infants' cases, routinely would veto his orders 
for medication to ease their suffering. "Either they would claim it's not 
painful or they would say, 'It doesn't hurt in kids like it does in adults,' " 
said Eisner, 34, grimacing at the once-prevalent notion. "I couldn't stand it. 
It was awful." 
</P>
<P>
 So awful that Eisner later decided to make pediatric pain relief his life's 
work. After completing a fellowship in pediatric anesthesia and critical care 
three years ago, the young doctor joined a growing contingent of physicians and 
nurses who attack pain with the vigor their colleagues apply to 
life-threatening scourges. 
</P>
<P>
 Using numbing drugs infused through a catheter, Eisner can block the nerve 
impulses of his little patients to the point that they feel next to nothing in 
the days following surgery. The technique, long used in adults but uncommon in 
children, is just one way of practicing what academics, nurses and some parents 
have preached for some time: Babies recover best when they don't hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big change has come in the past five or 10 years," said Dr. Feizal 
Waffarn, professor of pediatrics at UCI Medical Center in Orange and attending 
neonatologist. "There is better training, I think, education, and some very 
nice studies done to show that infants indeed sense pain, feel pain no 
different than adults." 
</P>
<P>
 But in many hospitals and clinics, the old ways die hard. Five years ago, 
Eisner had to search high and low for a physician who would use a local 
anesthetic during circumcision of his newborn son. Now, he describes 
unmedicated circumcisions as a pet peeve, saying no one but a helpless infant 
would submit to such an excruciating procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you ask why (doctors are stingy with pain medication to youngsters), 
they say, 'Well, I've done it that way for years," said Eisner, who is on the 
staff of Saddleback Memorial Medical Center and Saddleback Valley Outpatient 
Surgery Center in Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, that's not really a good answer. The fact that you can do something 
without someone dying doesn't mean it's a good thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, children have received poor "pain management" across the United 
States, said Dr. Lonnie Zeltzer, who heads the Pediatric Pain Program at UCLA, 
one of just a few such centers in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of it has to do with the fear that drugs would be too toxic, and with 
not knowing how to measure pain" in the very young, who, after all, cannot 
speak for themselves, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation arises most commonly when physicians are treating newborns under 
2 months old and premature infants, said Dr. M. Douglas Cunningham, medical 
director for newborn medicine at Long Beach Memorial Medical Center, who 
practiced for many years at UCI Medical Center and Saddleback. 
</P>
<P>
 The result: Even major surgery, such as spreading the ribs to tie off a blood 
vessel near the heart in premature infants, has been performed with little or 
no anesthetic. Not to mention minor procedures such as placing chest tubes or 
drawing bone marrow. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been only seven years since the American Academy of Pediatrics 
announced that it was unethical to perform surgery on premature infants without 
an anesthetic. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors' aversion to pain medications -- particularly narcotics -- was not a 
matter of callousness or cruelty, Cunningham said. "A very large part of it was 
the fear of addiction. . . . That coupled with the fact that infants don't 
tolerate meds well (and) a concern about overdosing. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's where Dr. Eisner's group has really led the way: precise dosage, 
careful monitoring, focusing on the period when pain is real" and discontinuing 
medication when it stops, Cunningham said. 
</P>
<P>
 Surgeons whom Eisner works with also appreciate his use of local anesthetics 
because it minimizes the need for narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do a lot of procedures on the genitalia, testicular surgery," said Dr. 
Igal Silber, who specializes in pediatric urology. "This is the ideal type of 
anesthesia. If you just give injections of morphine, Demerol, (infants) still 
tend to thrash about a lot" in recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 The use of local anesthetics has become increasingly common, especially among 
more recently trained anesthesiologists. 
</P>
<P>
 A key development paving the way for longer-term treatment of infants' pain 
was the introduction of longer-lasting local anesthetics and the development of 
preemptive analgesia -- pain medication given before an operation to reduce 
pain afterward, said Dr. David Steward, director of anesthesiology at Childrens 
Hospital Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It stops the noxious stimuli from ever getting . . . to the spinal cord or 
brain," he said, even after the surgical gas wears off. 
</P>
<P>
 Other research has led the once-standard notions to crumble: that children do 
not feel pain as acutely as adults, that they don't remember what they do feel, 
and that they are so resilient that any unpleasant experience is of no 
long-term significance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some studies have been done over the past five or six years showing that when 
you don't use anesthesia, not only is it ethically a bad thing to do, there are 
real medical consequences," Eisner said. 
</P>
<P>
 One such study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1992, 
found that newborns lightly anesthetized during cardiac surgery fared much 
worse than those who were heavily anesthetized. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the study, by K.J.S. Anand and his team, the babies who received 
less anesthesia experienced a much greater stress response -- such as higher 
levels of the hormones epinephrine and cortisol -- and had a significantly 
higher post-operative death rate. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same issue that carried this research, the Journal issued a challenge 
to its audience, seemingly wondering why clinicians have been so slow to act on 
the latest science. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems that we are better able to tolerate an infant's pain than to deal 
with our own discomfort and insecurity about the correct dose of pain 
medication to give the infant," the Journal concluded in the introspective 
editorial. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that the benefit of pain relief has been so clearly demonstrated, it is 
our responsibility to treat pain in neonates and infants as effectively as we 
do in other patients." 
</P>
<P>
 Studies on rats suggest that if babies experience significant pain, it 
disturbs the growth and development of the nervous system and can make them 
more susceptible to pain as adults, UCLA'S Zeltzer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The overall objective, Eisner said, is to make the hospital or clinic visit 
"completely non-stressful." That means not only using the best medications in 
the best dosage, but treating the child and parents with sensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, he said, it is not a good idea to separate a child from his 
parents and hold him down -- probably kicking and screaming -- to place an 
anesthesia mask over his face. He remembers with chagrin his rotations at 
Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, when terrified youngsters would ask him, 
"You're not going to use the mask, are you?" 
</P>
<P>
 Better to give a child a mild sedative and sometimes even allow his parents to 
hold and rock him. Then apply the mask. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ninety-nine percent of the time, they don't cry at all," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisner can't ask his infant patients whether they appreciate his approach, but 
he said they have their ways of letting it be known when they don't: Grimaces, 
fixed stares and a high-pitched wail, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents are grateful when they don't have to hear that. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's blood-curdling," said Tracy Garrison of Irvine, who has learned to 
discern her 5-week-old son Joshua's I'm-in-pain shrieks from the I'm-hungry and 
I'm-wet varieties. 
</P>
<P>
 But the boy emitted nary a whimper after testicular surgery last week for 
which Eisner numbed his lower body. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's as happy as he could be," the baby's father, Mac, said as the child 
tugged on a bottle only an hour after the outpatient operation. 
</P>
<P>
 To prevent post-operative pain involving long-term recovery, Eisner often 
performs what is known as an epidural. He injects local anesthetic through a 
catheter placed in children's lower backs, which is fed into the epidural space 
surrounding the spinal cord. A local anesthetic, Marcaine or lidocaine, and a 
low concentration of narcotics are infused to numb nerves leading to the 
incision. During the days after leg, chest or abdominal surgery, youngsters 
often don't feel a thing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the procedure has been used for years on adults, he said, physicians 
are often loath to risk it on young children because of its limited track 
record. Eisner estimated that 10% of anesthesiologists use the technique on 
youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts like Steward of Childrens Hospital Los Angeles stress that the 
technique is only one means of pain control and cannot be used for all types of 
surgery. Also, it requires training and expertise, and the patients must be 
closely watched. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, to many doctors who treat children, the procedure has yet to prove 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's always been a caution in applying things in new age groups, 
particularly when what you're doing is complicated," Steward said. "You're 
dealing with smaller needles, a smaller catheter, a different anatomy in the 
epidural space. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't decided what the place of epidural anesthesia is in the neonate. 
People are waiting to see what the safety record is." 
</P>
<P>
 Eisner said he has never had a complication and expects use of epidurals in 
young children to become routine -- that is, as long as health insurance 
companies will pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think with kids it's going to be equally as safe as with adults, if not 
more so," he said.(MORE)

VETERANS LEAVE SMILING; SECOND STAND DOWN DRAWS TWICE AS MANY SEEKING HELP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 On his third day of rest, Lorenzo Ravize gathered his things and boarded a bus 
headed back to the streets of west Ventura. That destination was the only 
certain thing in an uncertain future. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Friday, the 50-year-old homeless veteran had eaten three meals a day and 
slept with a measure of security not usually afforded those who live on the 
streets. He collected a new wardrobe and some free legal help during a 
three-day relief effort aimed at lifting up down-and-out vets. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, the Ventura man was still broke and headed back to the doorways and 
empty buildings that have been his home for the past three years. But for the 
first time in a long while, he was also filled with hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really going to try to turn things around," said Ravize, an ex-soldier 
who has been homeless in Ventura for the past three years. "You can only spend 
so much time doing nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Stand Down 1994 drew 181 veterans from across Ventura County, more than twice 
the number of men and women who took part in the inaugural event last year. For 
three days, in a tent city put up at the Ventura College football field, 
homeless veterans saw doctors, lawyers and a host of other care-givers. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-term success of the program is hard to measure, event organizers say. 
All they know for sure is that some veterans get help. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I can say is that the veterans came in with a lot of stress in their 
faces and they are leaving with smiles," said Claire Hope, founder of the 
Ventura County event. "Some get a new lease on life. And those not helped this 
year can come back again next year." 
</P>
<P>
 Hope said that next year she plans to concentrate recruitment efforts on the 
cities of Thousand Oaks, Simi Valley and Moorpark. Only one homeless veteran 
came from the east county this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy veteran Gordon Amundsen of Simi Valley took advantage of the services, 
coming away with a new set of clothes and shoes, a medical exam and full 
stomach. 
</P>
<P>
 Vietnam veteran Eugene Morales also got the help he was looking for. 
</P>
<P>
 Steadying himself on a metal cane, the decorated war veteran lifted his upper 
lip to show bare gums. Dentists at Stand Down promised to fit him with dental 
plates. 
</P>
<P>
 Morales was one of about half a dozen men who took advantage of an "open mike" 
session Saturday night before the nightly USO show kicked off. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are like my brothers," he told his fellow veterans. "I'm very proud to 
have served my country, and I will defend you and America for the rest of my 
life, as long as I live." 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday morning, veterans hurried to squeeze in their final benefits. Some 
got haircuts. Others got their eyes examined. 
</P>
<P>
 In a canvas tent marked "Counseling," war-hardened veterans eagerly stood in 
line to experience Toni Charbonneau's holistic healing techniques. Her practice 
involves channeling energy to heal and relax her patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just decided the healing really needed to get out there," Charbonneau said. 
"I'm just doing it whatever way I can." 
</P>
<P>
 Stand Down 1994 ended Sunday during a ceremony in which the veterans stood at 
attention, saluting a color guard retiring the United States flag that had been 
flying over the football field since Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Veterans and volunteers then joined hands and formed a large circle as a 
patriotic song floated out over the loudspeakers. 
</P>
<P>
 When the song ended, the veterans collected their belongings. New clothes and 
blankets were slipped into plastic bags. They picked up oranges and chips on 
their out of the gate. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a wonderful deal," said 67-year-old Virgil Malicoat of Oxnard, a 
veteran of three wars. "They treated us like real men."

DEFICIT, INTERNAL DISCORD THREATEN ORCHESTRA; ARTS: THE VENTURA COUNTY SYMPHONY 
IS LOOKING TO RAISE CASH, CUT COSTS. IT ALSO FACES COMPETITION FROM ITS 
THRIVING CROSS-COUNTY RIVAL, THE CONEJO SYMPHONY, IN EFFORT TO ATTRACT A WIDER 
AUDIENCE.

<P>
 With the musicians on vacation, the conductor out of the country and the first 
concert months away, August would typically be a very quiet month for the 
Ventura County Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Burdened with the largest deficit in its 33-year history, the orchestra is 
fighting to preserve its season, raise emergency cash and drastically pare 
operating costs. At risk of being canceled are programs aimed at nurturing 
young musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have operated close to the vest every year," said Karine Beesley, 
executive director. "But this is the worst year we've had. . . . It is a 
crisis." 
</P>
<P>
 Symphony board President Felice Ginsberg described the orchestra's projected 
$80,000 deficit -- which has grown fourfold in three years -- as worrisome but 
not unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
 The fiscal woes, she said, are a sign of "growing pains" in an organization 
committed to improving its artistic standards, presenting contemporary 
composers and attracting a wider audience. 
</P>
<P>
 With the opening of the Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza this fall, the symphony 
is also hoping to expand on its traditional west county base and snare a bigger 
corner of the east county cultural market. Symphony officials, though, 
acknowledge that it will be a difficult task. 
</P>
<P>
 "Growth is going to cost money upfront," Ginsberg said. "This is just part of 
the natural process." 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the symphony's difficulties is discord between musicians and 
management. For the first time in the organization's history, the two sides are 
locked in tense contract negotiations over such issues as tenure and the right 
to replace less talented players. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of difficult to remain a cohesive group when players are being 
shuffled in and out," said Steven Thiraux, a bassoonist who is part of the 
musicians' negotiating committee. "We're concerned about losing our identity." 
</P>
<P>
 If a compromise is not reached soon, the symphony's first concert in October 
could be in jeopardy. Board members say they would rather cancel the 
performance than risk the threat of a last-minute strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't risk refunding subscribers' tickets because of a strike," Ginsberg 
said. "We just don't have the financial wherewithal to go through that." 
</P>
<P>
 For the county's largest performing arts group, the troubles couldn't have 
come at a more critical time. 
</P>
<P>
 With the opening of the much-touted Civic Arts Plaza in Thousand Oaks, the 
Ventura-based orchestra faces new pressure to expand beyond its home turf at 
the Oxnard Civic Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 In struggling to attract more east county patrons, the Ventura County Symphony 
will face direct competition from its thriving cross-county rival, the Conejo 
Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, announcement of the opening week's schedule touched off a public spat 
when backers of the Conejo Symphony complained that the Ventura County Symphony 
was booked to play the first full-fledged classical music concert in the new 
1,800-seat auditorium Oct. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 The Conejo Symphony will open its season three days later with a performance 
featuring pianist Victor Borge. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Symphony is also slotted to play at the Civic Arts Plaza 
twice during the spring. But symphony backers say those concerts are now in 
question. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at financial reality here and looking at what our ability is to 
assume risk," Beesley said. "And right now our ability to assume risk is pretty 
low." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Symphony draws about 70% of its audience from Ventura. The 
rest of the season subscribers come from Camarillo, Oxnard, Ojai and Santa 
Paula, with a sprinkling from Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 A telephone survey last year showed that 80% of season ticket holders 
preferred to attend concerts in Oxnard rather than Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, board members and musicians alike say it's important for the 
symphony to establish some sort of presence at the county's newest venue. 
</P>
<P>
 Said principal clarinetist Caroline Tobin: "I look at Simi and Moorpark and 
areas where we really aren't known. It is a county symphony, and it would be 
nice if the whole county could be able to hear us play." 
</P>
<P>
 Running a deficit is nothing new for the Ventura County Symphony, nor for 
other much larger groups throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra carries a nearly $1-million deficit, 
as does the New York Philharmonic. Regional orchestras throughout the country 
are also struggling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Running a deficit is no great shame," said Everett Ascher, executive director 
of the Conejo Symphony, which ended last year with a $60,000 deficit but 
doubled its season subscriber base in anticipation of performing at the Civic 
Arts Plaza. "What you do is work your way out. They will and we will." 
</P>
<P>
 What is striking about the Ventura County Symphony's deficit is that it has 
doubled in one year, surging from $41,700 in June, 1993, to a projected $80,000 
for the fiscal year that ended June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 And while many of the county's premier orchestras have enormous endowments to 
draw upon in tough times, the Ventura County Symphony's endowment sits at just 
$12,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the difficulties come at a time when audiences at the symphony's 
bread-and-butter concerts at the Oxnard Civic Auditorium have been near 
capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 Attendance swelled to an average of 1,400 last season, after hovering around 
1,200 in previous years. Patrons have credited Canadian conductor Boris Brott, 
brought in two years ago to replace symphony founder Frank Salazar, with 
recharging performances. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've always had a good symphony, but it seems that with each concert, they 
get sharper and clearer," said Ventura County Supervisor Maggie Kildee, a past 
board member and longtime season ticket holder. 
</P>
<P>
 Symphony directors say a number of factors contributed to the deficit, 
including steep increases in rent and production costs at the Oxnard Civic 
Auditorium, and the overall state of California's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the revenue shortfall also stems from an attempt to draw in untapped 
audiences by introducing contemporary composers and non-European music. The 
"Music Alive!" series, which featured musicians from India and China, won 
critical praise last season but proved a financial flop. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than half the number of tickets needed to break even were sold, and the 
concerts lost $25,000 altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 Beesley blames the loss on a lack of marketing, unrealistic expectations and 
unfamiliarity with music. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been moving quicker than we could afford to do," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 For orchestras the size of the Ventura County and Conejo symphonies, ticket 
sales are critical. And at a time when orchestras throughout the country are 
struggling to pay musicians, some wonder if the Ventura County Symphony should 
stick with what is safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not going to earn royalties (off recordings)," Asher said. "The only 
thing that keeps you going is people coming to your concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 "If your ticket sales are off, you need to ask why." 
</P>
<P>
 Ginsberg, for her part, believes that Ventura County audiences are interested 
in music beyond Mozart and should be given a chance to hear contemporary 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
 Low ticket sales for the annual Discovery Artists concert and a series of 
fund-raising setbacks also contributed to this year's deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Symphony directors had hoped that the Discovery Artist concert, which features 
young Ventura County musicians selected through auditions, would break even 
despite the lack of a major underwriter. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the concert sold about $4,000 in tickets, less than the cost of 
renting the Oxnard Civic Auditorium. After paying musicians' salaries, the 
concert lost about $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Roughly 55% of the symphony's total revenue comes from ticket sales. Private 
contributions, corporate donations and a small amount of public grants account 
for the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, the symphony's most successful fund-raiser, the Design House, brought 
in $73,000. Other efforts, however, were less successful. 
</P>
<P>
 A golf tournament in Ojai netted just $500 when the sponsor of previous years, 
Waste Management Inc., declined to underwrite the event after losing a bid to 
open a landfill in Weldon Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Most recently, legal snafus forced the symphony to postpone its newest and 
most novel fund-raising attempt -- the Ventura County Symphony Rubber Duck 
Race. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the district attorney's office said the event, built around 
10,000 plastic ducks bobbing down the Santa Clara River, was being promoted 
illegally as a lottery. 
</P>
<P>
 With adjustments in the fine print, the race has been rescheduled for Saturday 
at the Freeman Diversion Dam. The two-month postponement generated extra 
publicity, but also delayed the arrival of much-needed cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Duck races, run by a company in Scottsdale, Ariz., have helped raise money for 
hundreds of nonprofit agencies and service clubs throughout the country. But 
this is the first time that it will be used by an orchestra, a company official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 By asking supporters to sponsor plastic ducks for $5 each, symphony backers 
are hoping to net $15,000 to $20,000 from the race. So far, about $18,000 in 
pledges have been received, enough to cover the costs of running the race. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to searching for new approaches to the highly competitive business 
of arts fund raising, the Ventura County Symphony is also engaged in an effort 
to reduce its operating budget and develop a long-range plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 1992 and 1993, the symphony's budget grew from $650,000 to $710,000. 
Directors are now trying to shrink expenditures for 1994 back to $600,000. 
Salaries are frozen and the glossy brochure to attract season subscribers has 
been scaled back to a less flashy version. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to get lean and mean here," Beesley said. "It could mean we have 
to downsize the orchestra a little bit, and some of the plans for the future 
may be delayed a year or so." 
</P>
<P>
 To cover immediate expenses, a group of board members has loaned the symphony 
$10,000. Ginsberg said the symphony hopes to repay the loan by November. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the deficit, three programs aimed at inspiring young musicians 
are now in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Beesley, the symphony can no longer afford to subsidize the 
Ventura County Youth Symphony, classical performances in the schools and the 
Discovery Artists concert. To continue, those programs must be self-supporting. 
</P>
<P>
 That means schools will have to pay $550, rather than $200, for a string 
quartet to play. And parents of youth symphony players will have to pay more 
than the $75 annual tuition and conduct their own fund raising for the first 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Olson, a former symphony board member whose 15-year-old son plays the 
clarinet, said he believes that an increase in tuition is not unreasonable. The 
youth symphony, he said, fills a gap left by a dearth of music programs in 
public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can't raise a few thousand on a program like this, then maybe you've 
got to take a look at whether it's a worthwhile enough program," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And while the youth symphony is important, Olson said, it is peripheral to the 
orchestra's central mission: playing classical music for the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "The primary task for the symphony is to have a performing orchestra out 
performing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Discovery Artists concert, symphony officials are trying to secure 
a corporate sponsor to cover the cost of the concert, eliminating a financial 
risk if ticket sales are low. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, the symphony plans to continue the "Music Alive!" series, but with 
all or nearly all of the cost underwritten by a private foundation. Beesley 
said the symphony has a verbal commitment from the Barbara Smith Foundation, 
but details have not yet been worked out. 
</P>
<P>
 To reduce the costs of producing that series, symphony officials say they plan 
to import small, contemporary groups, such as the Kronos Quartet, rather than 
using their own musicians to accompany a guest artist. 
</P>
<P>
 That, however, does not sit well with the pool of musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are we a producer of concerts or a supplier of activities?" Tobin asked. "I 
think this is something the community needs to make their feelings known 
about." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the symphony's financial troubles, Ginsberg said she is optimistic 
that this year is a turning point in the symphony's struggle to become an 
orchestra with a regional reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We scramble like everybody else does in tough times," she said.

FELINE FIXTURE RIGHT AT HOME IN THE HALLS OF GOVERNMENT; PORT HUENEME: SHADY 
THE CAT HAS BEEN A RESIDENT FOR SEVEN YEARS. SHE HAS NEVER MISSED A CITY 
COUNCIL MEETING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Her name is Shady. No one knows where she came from, but seven years ago, she 
paid Port Hueneme City Hall a visit. She liked what she saw, and made City Hall 
her home. 
</P>
<P>
 She also took over their hearts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was not fond of cats before, but Shady turned me around," said City Manager 
Richard Velthoen, who is known to hold Shady on his arm while he talks on the 
phone. "I don't know what it is about her, but I can't help liking her." 
</P>
<P>
 Since she adopted City Hall, Shady has yet to miss a City Council meeting. 
During council discussions, she is often fondly patted by residents and 
sometimes dozes off on their laps. 
</P>
<P>
 "She adds a personal touch to City Hall," said 21-year Port Hueneme resident 
Laura Snell, who often attends council meetings. "Her presence tends to 
maintain a sense of community and neighborhood feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 But Shady, a tailless, black-haired cat, is also known for being independent 
and temperamental. 
</P>
<P>
 "She loves to be the center of attention, but she lets you know when she has 
had enough or is bored," said Elaine Morse, deputy city clerk. "She either runs 
away or gives you tiny bites." 
</P>
<P>
 According to city employees, Shady originally lived with a couple in a house 
near City Hall for a while. But after visiting City Hall one day, she did not 
return to the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "She would sneak in here," said Tamah Berger, a city code enforcement officer 
who is Shady's main care-taker. "In a short period of time, she had become 
ingrained here and no one could take her away because she would come back." 
</P>
<P>
 Shady spends her days roaming the building, sometimes napping in city offices 
as workers go about their jobs. But she invariably sniffs out any meeting in 
progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "She always knows where we are having a meeting," Velthoen said. "She likes to 
be around people." 
</P>
<P>
 Every morning around 7 a.m., Berger fills two blue bowls -- one with water and 
the other with cat food -- which are placed outside the back entrance of City 
Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I come to work, the first thing I do is to put my bag down and feed 
her," Berger said. 
</P>
<P>
 She spends about $25 a month to supply Shady with food. 
</P>
<P>
 "Often, I send a message in the computer to everyone asking them to pitch in," 
Berger said. "Usually people help." 
</P>
<P>
 But Berger is the one who financially supports Shady. She not only buys Shady 
food but also clips Shady's nails and takes her to the veterinarian, which 
costs Berger about $70 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't help it," said Berger, who has two cats at home. "I just love cats." 
</P>
<P>
 At night though, no one knows where Shady sleeps. Before City Hall employees 
go home, they make sure that Shady is outside. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is very independent and knows how to take care of herself," Berger said. 
"She is always waiting for me by the door at 7 o'clock." 
</P>
<P>
 Two park enforcement officers who work Saturdays and Sundays take care of 
Shady on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her antics and independence, not everyone is fond of Shady. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Figg, the city's director of community development -- who happens to be 
Berger's husband -- said he does not believe that Shady should be permitted to 
hang out around City Hall, even if she does provide some comic relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "She does have a tendency to bring humor to what otherwise would be a 
vulnerable and boring situation," Figg said. "But because she feels she has 
control over the place, she can become a nuisance." 
</P>
<P>
 Shady, however, is known to have calmed some residents in times of crisis. 
Port Hueneme police say Shady often stops by the police station -- located in 
City Hall -- and has been of use to them in dealing with the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have seen Shady walk into a room where a person was crying, jump in the 
person's lap or nearby chair and, in a few minutes, the person stopped crying," 
Sgt. Ken Dobbe said. "It was as if Shady sensed that something was wrong in 
that room." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether she continues to amuse and perform small services, one thing seems 
sure: Shady isn't about to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether anyone likes or not, she won't leave," Velthoen said. "What are we 
going to do with her? Take her away? She probably would end up back here 
anyway."

STREET SMART: LACK OF RIGHT-TURN LANE LEAVES MANY WITH A PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 There is a problem with cars turning right onto Valentine Road from southbound 
Victoria Avenue in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The existing right lane is very wide, but people rarely keep to the right side 
of the lane to make the turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, traffic backs up often during rush hour as cars slow down to 
turn right. 
</P>
<P>
 It would help a lot if the existing lane were re-striped as two lanes: one for 
right-turning traffic and one for through traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Can anything be done to improve this stretch of roadway? 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Nelson, Oxnard 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Your problem will be resolved, but not immediately, says Nazir Lalani, Ventura 
traffic engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 It is true that the right-hand lane at Victoria and Valentine is wider than 
normal, but it is too narrow to split in two, Lalani says. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cars would be too close together," Lalani said. "It would not be safe." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the city of Ventura is planning a $7-million overhaul of Victoria 
Avenue near the Ventura Freeway. The plan calls for a separate right-turn lane 
at the Valentine Road intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 But the project is not scheduled to get under way until at least 1996. 
</P>

 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, I've noticed that some of the streets in Simi Valley are 
falling into disrepair. 
</P>
<P>
 This especially seems to be a problem on the city's east end. The streets 
there suffered rain damage a couple of years ago and the Jan. 17 earthquake 
just made it worse. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm getting a little tired of driving over the bumps and cracks. If something 
isn't done soon, this could turn into a real problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Any plans to fix the roads? 
</P>
<P>
 George Myers, Simi Valley 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Take heart! Smoother roads in Simi Valley are on the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past few months, the city has pieced together a repair plan for its 
battered streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The result? 
</P>
<P>
 More than $2 million in pothole-patching and road-paving projects to be 
launched this summer and into the fall, says Alice Stoner, principal civil 
engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 Projects include stripping and repaving roadways and repairing damaged curbs, 
gutters and sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has applied for an additional $4 million in federal emergency relief 
aid to further address the problem. 
</P>

<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I'm concerned about a safety problem with the bike lanes on Los Angeles Avenue 
in Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since Los Angeles Avenue was widened for the new K mart, cars have been 
using the bike lane as a second lane. 
</P>
<P>
 This is very dangerous because people are trying to make a right turn from the 
regular lane while cars in the bike lane are trying to go straight. 
</P>
<P>
 Can anything be done to clear up this problem? 
</P>
<P>
 Gloria Shaffer, Moorpark 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the lanes you refer to on Los Angeles Avenue are not technically 
bike lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 They are merely sidelines painted a few feet from the curb to help funnel 
traffic toward the center of the road, says Ken Gilbert, Moorpark's public 
works director. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not illegal for cars to drive over the sidelines when turning right, 
Gilbert says. But they should not cross them if they are merely continuing to 
go straight. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purpose of the sidelines is to help channel the flow of traffic, but they 
are more of a suggestion that a rule," Gilbert said. 
</P>
<P>
 Motorists should use extra caution when turning right if there is a car in the 
sideline area, he says. SPEEDERS BEWARE 
</P>
<P>
 Today through Thursday, the county is planting a radar trailer on California 
33 in Oak View. 
</P>
<P>
 As motorists drive by, their speed will flash on a large digital board. 
</P>
<P>
 The radar is part of the "Courtesy on 33" campaign intended to persuade 
motorists to slow down along heavily populated stretches of the roadway.

FATHER-AND-SON DEVELOPERS ARE STUCK IN MIRE OF WETLANDS ISSUE; NEWBURY PARK: 
THEY HAVE ENDURED A LONG BATTLE TO BUILD HOUSES ON ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE 
PROPERTY. THEY HOPE A NEWLY ELECTED CITY COUNCIL WILL SUPPORT THEM IN DECEMBER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With papers piled high on his desk, and dozens of tract maps and aerial 
photographs propped against the walls, developer Albert Cohen puffed feverishly 
on a cigarette. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing has gone as planned. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of negotiations, a brush with bankruptcy, three lawsuits and 
countless public hearings, Cohen and his father, Nedjatollah Cohan, are further 
from their dream of developing the 45 acres of Newbury Park grassland than when 
it was purchased 16 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the Thousand Oaks City Council postponed a vote that could have 
doomed their plans to build 98 houses on the property and finally turn a 
profit. With the council set to take up the matter in December, the developers 
hope that time and a newly elected council will be on their side. 
</P>
<P>
 After more than a decade of fighting, even opponents of the housing project 
agree that Cohen, who changed the spelling of his last name, and his father 
have become casualties of a changing political climate in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Ned Cohan has faced opposition from increasingly powerful homeowners and 
anti-development forces. He has battled financially strapped government 
agencies that imposed on him a host of costly restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 And his construction plans have collided with a growing push to preserve 
environmentally sensitive wetlands -- which, to his dismay, were discovered on 
his land. 
</P>
<P>
 In the eyes of a loyal son, Cohen said, it appears that everyone is working 
against his father. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, it's like Ned Cohan has been running this race and, every time he 
gets close, the council steps in and moves the finish line," said Chuck Cohen, 
no relation, a Thousand Oaks attorney who briefly represented Cohan. "Now, even 
if he does get there, the question is whether there will be any practical gain 
left for him to enjoy." 
</P>
<P>
 In December, 1977, Cohan paid $2 million for 85 acres of land west of Reino 
Road between Lynn Road and Kimber Drive (he later sold half the land to another 
developer). At the time, Albert Cohen said, the parcel was considered the jewel 
of Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 City plans for the land called for hundreds of homes and the area's only major 
shopping center. Cohan even turned down the chance to buy a condominium complex 
in West Los Angeles -- which he says would be worth $20 million today -- to 
invest in this fast-growing town. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years after he bought the land, he eagerly began planning the construction 
of 138 homes and a shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything seemed perfect," Albert Cohen said. "We were even ahead of 
schedule." 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the news that two of the area's major flood channels cut right 
through the property. For years, the county had been eyeing his land as the 
perfect spot for a flood control basin -- a giant ditch that would help protect 
homes downstream from washing away in the rare event of a flash flood. 
</P>
<P>
 For approval to build, Cohen said the county told his father that he would 
need to make $4 million in improvements to his property, including construction 
of a flood control basin. 
</P>
<P>
 For four years, Cohan and his two sons negotiated with the county, but they 
could not reach an agreement. As the clock ticked, Cohan's money began to run 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to sell everything to keep us afloat," said Albert Cohen, 33. "I sold 
my car, my (auto import) business. I was living off a friend's credit card just 
to get Ned out of bankruptcy." 
</P>
<P>
 Even after Cohan thought that he had resolved his dispute with the Ventura 
County Flood Control District, getting permission to build houses was a 
complicated process. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Cohan offered to cut in half the portion of land that he would devote 
to commercial development. And in 1992, after twice being rejected by the city, 
the Planning Commission tentatively approved his project. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that point, it should have been approved," Chuck Cohen said. "But by then, 
there was strong pressure on the council from residents of Newbury Park." 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 protesters mobbed a pivotal City Council meeting in July, 1992. They 
carried petitions signed by more than 800 Newbury Park residents. Cohan's 
development, they argued, would trample wetlands, and increase traffic, noise 
and air pollution in their quiet neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 As the council members prepared to vote after seven hours of tense debate, 
65-year-old Cohan, who had come so close to gaining approval, collapsed to the 
floor and began to sob. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, he knew what was coming. The council rejected his project -- four 
votes to one. A majority of the council argued that Cohan was trying to squeeze 
too many houses onto the property. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since then, he hasn't been the same," said Larry Marquart, one of eight city 
planners who has, at one time or another, been in charge of the Cohan project. 
"He comes in depressed, sad. I think we could all see the stress building for a 
long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Marquart said city planners who have worked with Cohan are sympathetic to his 
plight. But, he said, efforts to limit the number of houses to be built on the 
property just mirror what is happening elsewhere in Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been a pattern established in that area, Marquart said, in which 
large developments have shrunk as the city's vision for that area has become 
more clear. 
</P>
<P>
 The nearby Dos Vientos development went from initial proposals of more than 
4,000 units to about 2,000, Marquart said. Two other nearby projects, which 
could have brought almost 2,000 more homes into the area, were both scrapped, 
and the land was preserved as open space. 
</P>
<P>
 Council member Elois Zeanah, one of those who voted against Cohan's 
development, said her opinion was shaped by the public's cry to preserve the 
city's remaining wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel badly that Mr. Cohan didn't understand that when he bought the parcel 
that encumbrances existed upon it," Zeanah said. "But we have to base our views 
on what is appropriate for that area." 
</P>
<P>
 Zeanah said she envisions a less-dense development on the land -- one that 
would keep homes away from the wetland areas on the property. She stressed that 
commercial development should be out of the question. 
</P>
<P>
 Albert Cohen said that proposal, which the council will take up in December, 
is unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's just a joke," he said, poring over one of several hydrology studies 
that he had done to combat the city. "This land is not a wetland. It's a few 
shrubs. Nothing lives on that land. Right now, it's nothing more than a dump." 
</P>
<P>
 His lone supporter on the council in recent years has been Mayor Alex Fiore, 
who said he believes that Cohan has done everything that could be asked of him. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he's in compliance with everything, even if there are 100 people in the 
audience screaming against him, I don't see how we can say no," Fiore said. "To 
me, that's just wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 In December, the council will vote on a city zoning proposal that would 
eliminate any commercial development on the Cohan property and sharply limit 
the number of homes. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, Fiore will have stepped down from the council and Cohan will have to 
face newly elected council members. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how the vote goes, Albert Cohen can't say with any certainty that he 
will ever see houses on his land. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has really hurt my family and my father," he said, noting his father has 
poured his lifelong savings into the property. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing," he said, taking a long drag on his cigarette. "My father put 
50 years of his life in that land and, with the swing of a vote, it could all 
disappear."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: EL RIO; ANNUAL FIESTA RAISES FUNDS FOR CHURCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kenny and Tammy Henschel of El Rio took their 21-month-old son, Brandon, to 
church Sunday, but this time, they didn't go to pray. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they headed for the Santa Clara Chapel's 10th annual fiesta in El 
Rio, a fund-raiser billed as a summer music explosion with half a dozen bands, 
carnival rides, food booths and games. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came out here for the eats and the rides," Henschel said. "We're having a 
good time." 
</P>
<P>
 Henschel, a warehouseman who has lived in El Rio all of his 29 years, said the 
festival gave his family a fun outing and helped them support their church and 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 "This way we can do both," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A fun house, Tilt-a-Whirl, bumper cars and other attractions enticed hundreds 
of children, who traded dollars for tickets to take a spin on the carnival 
rides during the three-day event, which ended Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going really well," said Father George Miller, who ministers at the 
century-old chapel. "The weather's nice, the turnout's good and people are 
enjoying themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said he hoped that the festival would generate at least $20,000 to fund 
the chapel's upkeep and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe O'Neill, fiesta committee chairman, said this year's event is more 
important than previous fund-raisers because of the possibility that the chapel 
will have to be relocated when the Ventura Freeway interchange at Rose Avenue 
is redesigned. 
</P>
<P>
 "This church is going to have to be moved because they're putting in a new 
cloverleaf," said O'Neill, an Oxnard attorney who owns a home in El Rio. "When 
Caltrans decides it's time to go, we're going to need a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
 The small chapel has already been moved once, Miller said. In 1952, it had to 
be relocated from its spot near Sears in Oxnard for expansion of the Esplanade 
mall. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in seven years, volunteer organizers offered a "Sweet Tooth 
Booth," a dessert booth selling cupcakes, brownies and other hand-made 
confections. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything's homemade by different people in our parish," said Eileen Meza of 
El Rio, who has attended church services at Santa Clara Chapel for 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone here is donating their time because we love the community and we 
love the church," she said. JEFF McDONALD

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Oxnard School District board members have announced that they will run for 
reelection in November. 
</P>
<P>
 James J. Suter, 68, has filed his candidacy papers with the county election's 
office, and Mary Barreto, 59, said she plans to do so this week.Both candidates 
are seeking a second term on the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack T. Fowler, 60, said he planned to step down in December after 20 years on 
the board of trustees. Fowler said he may begin writing a newsletter that 
covers school issues in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Barreto, who began campaigning in May, is a family therapist and a professor 
at Cal State Northridge. Barreto said she wants to continue playing a role in 
the education of Oxnard children. 
</P>
<P>
 "My experience in the first four years will help me to become a more effective 
board member," Barreto said. 
</P>
<P>
 Suter, who retired as a teacher in 1987 after working 35 years for the Oxnard 
School District, said he is seeking another four-year term on the board because 
his work with children is not complete. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still have a lot do," Suter said. "And I want to get parents more involved 
in the education of their children." CHRISTINA LIMA

<TEXT>
<P>
 A historical preservation group has set up a telephone number that people can 
call to get updates on its efforts to restore Ventura's turn-of-the-century 
Dudley House. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are always wondering what's going on with the house," said Marie 
Lakin, spokeswoman for San Buenaventura Heritage Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 "And we are trying, obviously, to get volunteers and donations," she said. 
"This is the best way we could think of to keep the house in the public's eye." 
</P>
<P>
 Callers to the number can find out about upcoming fund-raisers, opportunities 
to volunteer and updates on the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Preservation members are looking for carpenters, masons and others who can 
volunteer time and donate materials to complete refurbishment of the 1892 
landmark by this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 When completed, the house will be a living history museum reflecting the life 
of the Dudley family and the Ventura farming community from 1895 to 1925. 
</P>
<P>
 The Queen Ann-style structure is at Ashwood Avenue and Loma Vista Road. For 
updates and other information about the restoration, call 642-3345. KAY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; TEACHERS WIN GRANTS FOR CREATIVE 
PROJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Teachers in the Simi Valley Unified School District were awarded nearly 
$30,000 worth of grants this week to pay for a variety of creative projects at 
elementary, junior high and high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the second year the district has sponsored the Instructional Incentive 
grants, which are designed to encourage innovative academic programs and 
collaborative teaching. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is one of the finest things we've been able to do with tight 
budgets," Assistant Supt. Susan C. Parks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-term projects received grants as high as $2,000. For example, a Park View 
Elementary School project for developing a special course of study on ancient 
civilizations received $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaller grants were handed out for one-time events such as a planned medieval 
banquet at Sinaloa Junior High School, which got $350. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very impressed with the enthusiasm and the ideas," said board member 
Debbie Sandland. "It's very exciting." 
</P>
<P>
 Altogether, the school board approved funding for 29 grant applications for 
the 1994-95 school year submitted by individual instructors and several teams 
of teachers. A total of 55 applications were submitted, representing more than 
200 teachers. TRACY WILSON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; CABLE TV PRICE CUT, REFUND CONSIDERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks cable subscribers could receive hefty refunds if the City 
Council on Tuesday orders the two local cable providers to roll back their 
service charges -- and apply the lower rates retroactively. 
</P>
<P>
 In a survey of Ventura County Cablevision and Falcon Cable prices, a city 
consultant found that both companies charge reasonable monthly fees for their 
basic package of channels.But the consultant determined that both Ventura 
County Cablevision and Falcon have significantly inflated their hourly service 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 After a public hearing Tuesday, council members will consider slashing VCC's 
hourly service charge from $40 to $21.34 and Falcon's from $65 to $39.69. 
Federal law allows cities to regulate cable franchises, but the companies can 
appeal any council ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 If the council does order a rate rollback, the companies would have to 
determine how many customers had paid for installation or service visits at the 
higher rate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it's 100 people, maybe it's 500, maybe it's 10 -- we just don't know," 
said the city's media services manager, Shirley Cobb. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Cablevision officials would not comment on the consultant's 
study. And at Falcon, spokesman Steve Weingardt said the company would request 
a postponement of the public hearing. "We don't have enough time to frame a 
response," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But city staff is recommending that the hearing go ahead as scheduled. Because 
of an unusually heavy agenda, the hearing will start at 6 p.m. It will be the 
council's last meeting before a monthlong hiatus. STEPHANIE SIMON

'3 STRIKES' TOO HARSH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was dismissed from juror seat 5, Courtroom 47, County of Ventura. Thank God, 
I wasn't asked to judge whether or not repeat offender Roosevelt McCowan stole 
$300 worth of Sav-On merchandise the day after California's "three-strikes" law 
went into effect. 
</P>
<P>
 If the prosecution had not given me a preemptive dismissal, perhaps fearing my 
sympathies as a teacher of ethics at a Catholic school, I would have dismissed 
myself. For I had learned what jurors in this case are not supposed to know -- 
that due to the three-strikes law, Roosevelt McCowan, if convicted, would go to 
prison for 25 years to life. 
</P>
<P>
 Discovering this made it possible for me to make an informed moral decision 
about my inability to serve on this jury. I knew that I could not, in 
conscience, condemn a man to life imprisonment for the nonviolent theft of 
$300. But the drastic application of the three-strikes law to this case is 
being carefully kept from jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 How, then, can they act on their consciences? Don't jurors have the right to 
know what's at stake? I would quickly eliminate myself from any murder trial 
because I'm opposed to the death penalty. Knowing the usual consequences of a 
guilty verdict is part of knowing what you are getting yourself in for on a 
jury case. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mr. McCowan's case, it is as if a court said, "You are only being asked to 
determine the facts about a simple theft," without telling the jurors that a 
new law would be applied that demanded that the hands of the thief be cut off 
as punishment. Knowing this, how many of us would agree to sit on such a jury?

DON'T NEED DUMPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Times enlightened us all with the trashy thoughts of our benevolent Solid 
Waste Management Chairman Scott Montgomery ("3 Firms to Join Bidding for 
County's Trash," July 22). His wisdom: 
</P>
<P>
 "We dispose of our trash in our own back yard.We live with it in our own back 
yard, and we live with it because it's our garbage. Why can't Ojai and Ventura 
dispose of their trash in their back yard?" 
</P>
<P>
 The answer to Scott and the other east county politicians who seek hegemony 
over the Weldon Canyon site through their duplicitous promotion of the Taconic 
Resources-sponsored Weldon landfill initiative is easy -- we don't want or need 
another stinking dump in our back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Thorough studies have shown -- and now the proposal from Laidlaw to use the 
existing Chiquito Canyon landfill, BFI's proposal to rail-haul trash to a 
superior landfill in Arizona and other proposals to rail-haul trash to a secure 
Utah landfill demonstrate -- that the market can now bring forth 
environmentally superior and, equally important, more cost-effective and 
economic waste disposal solutions than an unwanted Weldon Canyon dump.

GUNMAN RESPONSIBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Recently, a senseless act of violence in Thousand Oaks by a 17-year-old young 
man led to the death of an innocent girl whose only mistake was to be an 
acquaintance. Any person of responsible age should have the right to keep and 
bear arms as they see fit, and not answer to anyone on that account alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Any person who pulls out a weapon and murders an innocent party in the name of 
fun and games or stupidity is fully responsible for his or her actions. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a newspaper account, the admitted act of this young adult 
occurred after the weapon had been in his possession for a week, and he had 
pointed the loaded gun at several other people before it discharged -- taking 
the life of an innocent girl. The article went on to say his lawyer would use 
the defense that gun laws need to be strengthened to prevent this kind of 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Any judge who would allow an act like this to be viewed as one of reckless 
youth and attorneys who would use a defense of not enough laws as an excuse for 
a stupid, irresponsible act of violence are themselves largely responsible for 
the degradation of morality, rampant crime and lack of common decency our 
nation is experiencing. 
</P>
<P>
 Capital crimes deserve capital punishment. Incidents of homicide by any person 
of responsible age by knowingly playing with a loaded gun must never be viewed 
as just a youthful mistake.

SHOP TALK: 'FAMILY LEAVE' LAWS GRANT TIME OFF TO FATHERS TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Do you have a question about an on-the-job situation? If so, please mail it 
to Shop Talk, Los Angeles Times, P.O. Box 2008, Costa Mesa, Calif. 92626. Or 
call (714) 966-7873 and leave a voice mail message. Questions of general 
interest will be answered in this column on Mondays.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Question: I have a question concerning the family leave bill passed last year. 
My wife is pregnant and will have the baby in November. I'm wondering what my 
rights as a husband are under the bill if I take time off to be with my wife. 
</P>
<P>
 -- P.P., Costa Mesa 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Both federal and state law now require an employer to give an employee 
up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave in connection with the birth or adoption of a 
child, so long as the employee has worked for the employer for at least 12 
months. These "family leave" laws apply to both parents, allowing prospective 
fathers the same rights as prospective mothers. Prospective mothers may be 
entitled to additional benefits under other laws that deal specifically with 
pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
 You can obtain brochures with detailed information about your rights under 
these laws from the federal and state agencies that enforce them. The Wages and 
Hours Division of the U.S. Department of Labor publishes "Compliance Guide to 
the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993." Send a stamped, self-addressed 
envelope to Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Ave. N.W., Room S3325, 
Washington, D.C. 20210, or call the agency's public information office at (202) 
219-8743.

 Question: After a very encouraging job interview -- I was certain I had the 
position -- I was given paperwork to arrange to take a drug test. I took the 
test, and the company said it would call me in a few days. After not hearing 
anything for a week, I called and was told the company had already hired 
someone with better qualifications. Was I treated unfairly? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: An offer of employment is generally extended to the most qualified job 
applicant. It is the responsibility of an employer to evaluate each perspective 
job candidate on the basis of individual skills, knowledge and abilities -- 
provided laws and regulations are satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
 Pre-employment drug tests are often conducted by employers before an employer 
will make a conditional job offer. The intent is to identify illegal drug use. 
Thus, an employer may reasonably determine that the results of a drug test are 
directly related to job fitness. Remember, employers have a legitimate interest 
in denying employment to individuals who are unable to perform satisfactorily 
on the job as a result of drug use. 
</P>
<P>
 You did not say whether you have tested "positive" for illegal drugs. However, 
you did state that someone was selected on the basis of "better 
qualifications." If you question the fairness of the decision, contact the 
employer and ask for further clarification.

 Question: Is there any place an individual can go to learn what rights he or 
she has when working for a company of fewer than 50 employees? My workplace has 
many unusual employee policies, such an only allowing three sick days a year, 
which includes doctor visits. And if you go to the doctor for two hours, you're 
docked for part of those three days. I'm not sure whether that's legal, and I'm 
not sure where to go to find out. -- R.C., Tustin 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Your question concerns conditions placed on paid sick leave, which an 
employer is not required by law to provide. When paid sick leave is provided, 
then specific conditions may be established. There are, however, certain 
federal and state rules that apply to companies with more than 50 employees 
involving the rights of a worker to unpaid family leave to care for yourself or 
family members. You can learn more about your rights from the following 
agencies: 
</P>
<P>
 * The state Department of Fair Employment and Housing, (714) 558-4266, 
provides information on discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 * California labor commissioner's office, (714) 558-4111 or 558-4114, provides 
information on wage and retaliation claims. 
</P>
<P>
 * Orange County Bar Assn., (714) 835-5294, offers free taped reviews of 
various legal subjects by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 And most bookstores sell inexpensive, easy-to-understand books on employee 
rights, such as "Your Rights in the Workplace" by Nolo Press.

 Question: I have been employed for several years as a commissioned carpet 
salesperson for a large department store chain. When I receive my commission 
checks, my employer deducts for things that occur after the transaction.  
</P>
<P>
 For instance, the carpeting may be flawed and the customer will demand an 
adjustment, or the customer may cancel the sale for reasons over which I have 
no control. Can my employer deduct from my commission checks when problems 
occur that are not my fault?  
</P>
<P>
 My feeling is that when I have successfully made the sale I have fulfilled the 
duty for which I was employed, therefore I'm entitled to the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 -- J.K., Laguna Beach 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: In general, commissions are a matter of what the contract between the 
employer and the employee provides. So long as the employer carefully drafts 
its commission policy to provide that commissions are not earned on sales until 
the employer is paid for the goods sold, the employer can probably charge back 
returns to the employee who made the sale or, in the absence of an express 
identification of that employee, to the employees at the store where the sale 
was made.  
</P>
<P>
 However, in each instance discussed above, it is possible that the employer 
has not properly drafted its commission policy, so the policy may be regarded 
as causing an improper forfeiture of earned commissions. If that were the case, 
the employer might have to repay the money that has been deducted. The best 
place to challenge a commission policy is through the state labor 
commissioner's office. The phone number in Santa Ana is (714) 558-4111.  
</P>
<P>
 The law provides that employees may not be terminated for bringing a complaint 
or concern to the labor commissioner.

IT'S AN ACE FOR 'MASK' AT BOX OFFICE; MOVIES: NEW LINE CINEMA'S ENTREE INTO THE 
MAJORS IS A HIT ON ITS OPENING WEEKEND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID J. FOX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "It was a marketing department's dream," New Line Cinema's marketing boss 
Mitchell Goldman said Sunday as he projected a No. 1 finish and a huge 
$23.5-million opening weekend box-office tally for his company's comedy-action 
release, "The Mask."  
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, look what we had to work with: Jim Carrey, hot off his 'Ace Ventura' 
smash-hit film, and special effects by ILM (Industrial Light & Magic)." 
</P>
<P>
 For months, the industry buzz on "The Mask" has been exceptionally positive, 
based largely on those two ingredients: Carrey as an ordinary bank clerk who 
becomes his exciting alter ego whenever he puts on a magical mask, and the mask 
that has extraordinary powers illustrated with special effects by the 
multi-Oscar winning firm ILM (of "Jurassic Park" fame). As preliminary weekend 
box-office results became known Sunday, Goldman, New Line's president of 
marketing, said his company and the production team were "ecstatic." 
</P>
<P>
 For New Line, which became a part of Ted Turner's entertainment empire in 
January, the release of "The Mask" in mid-summer was an opportunity to prove 
the studio could be an equal to the major production firms during the hottest 
movie-going season of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was our most ambitious campaign to date," said Goldman of the extensive TV 
ads that targeted two specific audiences: teens, as well as children and their 
parents. "But clearly we've got all groups -- adults too -- coming." 
</P>
<P>
 The $23.5-million estimated gross for Friday through Sunday does not include 
the $1.8 million from Thursday night previews of the film. Goldman pointed out 
that "The Mask," which cost $19 million to produce, is one of the few films 
this year that apparently has recouped its production costs in its opening 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrival of "The Mask" added to an already lustrous box-office picture that 
had four other summer movies grossing in the neighborhood of $10 million or 
substantially higher over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 They are: "Forrest Gump," in second place with $18.2 million and $140 million 
to date; "True Lies," in third with $13.4 million and $84.8 million overall; 
"The Client," in fourth, $12.5 million and $44 million; and "The Lion King," in 
fifth with $9.6 million and $218.1 million to date. 
</P>
<P>
 All indications, based on Sunday's estimates, were that the just-ended weekend 
would be the third non-holiday weekend in a row to surpass $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, according to records kept by the box-office tracking firm Exhibitor 
Relations Co., the total for the just-ended weekend will be substantially ahead 
of the comparable one a year ago, and it probably will push the 1994 
year-to-date total box-office gross slightly ahead of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Forrest Gump" phenomenon continued virtually unabated as the Paramount 
Pictures' release about a whimsical and pure-of-heart character, played by Tom 
Hanks, completed its fourth weekend at theaters -- during which it has never 
been lower than second place -- and saw business drop only 17% from the third 
weekend.  
</P>
<P>
 Paramount president of worldwide distribution Barry London forecast the film 
would top $150 million before week's end, while the competition heats up even 
more with the arrival Friday of Paramount's "Clear and Present Danger," 
starring Harrison Ford. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides "The Mask," two other new films opened on the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 TriStar Pictures' romantic comedy "It Could Happen to You," starring Nicolas 
Cage and Bridget Fonda, drew a strong $8.1 million, finishing sixth in the 
weekend's competitive field. "Black Beauty" from Warner Bros. did a languid 
$1.3 million and rounded out the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Other top-grossing weekend films: "Angels in the Outfield," $4.5 million with 
$30.8 million to date, was seventh, followed by "Speed," $2.7 million with 
$104.8 million to date, and "Lassie," $1.5 million and $6.7 million to date. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the art house films, Castle Rock Entertainment's "Barcelona," from 
director Whit Stillman, which opens in Los Angeles this weekend, played to 
strong business at four New York City area theaters, taking in $100,000.

HANGING OUT WITH YOGI AND HUCKLEBERRY; TELEVISION: MIKE LAZZO IS THE TOP CAT AT 
TED TURNER'S 2-YEAR-OLD CARTOON NETWORK. 'TO THINK THAT I GET A PAYCHECK FOR 
DOING THIS IS FLABBERGASTING. I'D DO IT FOR A DOLLAR A WEEK.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE WEINSTEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Mike Lazzo was 15, he came home from school every day, made popcorn and 
watched "Speed Racer." One afternoon, in the middle of some epic tussle between 
Speed and Racer X, his mother told him to mow the lawn. He said no. He had to 
finish watching the show.  
</P>
<P>
 "And she said, 'You know, son, these cartoons are not going to do you any good 
when you need to go out and find a job,' " Lazzo recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 How wrong she was. Lazzo, 36, is the vice president of programming -- the top 
cat -- at Ted Turner's 2-year-old Cartoon Network. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, I had no idea watching cartoons would pay off," he said. "I just 
loved them. To think that I get a paycheck for doing this is flabbergasting. 
I'd do it for a dollar a week." 
</P>
<P>
 He makes a lot more than that pondering such earthshaking Cartoon Network 
questions as what time of day is best for "Yogi Bear" and whether Dino of "The 
Flintstones" fame is a dog or a dinosaur. (Viewers decided dinosaur.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Mom still doesn't get it," Lazzo said. "She thinks it's silly I'm still 
playing with cartoons. I guess she'd rather I was a doctor or a lawyer. A 
fireman even." 
</P>
<P>
 As head programmer for the only TV network that runs nothing but cartoons, 
Lazzo spends much of his time developing new animated products to complement 
the Cartoon Network's library of oldies, consisting mostly of Hanna-Barbera 
cartoons acquired when Turner purchased the company in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 So far the Cartoon Network -- which is available in about 10 million homes 
nationwide, barely one-sixth of all houses with cable -- has two pieces of 
original animation on the air, designed in part to make the channel more 
indispensable to viewers so that more cable operators will make room for it on 
their systems.  
</P>
<P>
 The first piece is Moxy, a renegade computer-generated dog who works at the 
network and operates his own pirate feed out of a broom closet, which is used 
mostly in between regular programming or to introduce a batch of themed 
cartoons. Voiced by comedian Bobcat Goldthwait, Moxy periodically interrupts 
the network's regular feed to present, for example, his favorite batch of 
"Huckleberry Hound" episodes. 
</P>
<P>
 The second original program, "Space Ghost Coast to Coast," came out of the 
hype that has surrounded the late-night talk-show scene the last two years. 
Lazzo and his staff were sitting around trying to figure out a creative way to 
use Space Ghost -- that famous animated super-hero from the 1960s and one of 
Lazzo's all-time favorite cartoon characters -- and concocted this scenario: 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting up on the ghost planet, having vanquished all of his archenemies, 
bored out of his cape, Space Ghost hears about the talk-show wars on Earth and 
decides he has to get into the battle. He builds his own set and hires a band 
and a director -- all animated and all up in outer space somewhere. In each 
show he interviews famous earthlings, who appear in live form on a TV screen 
beside his desk, interspersing the usual dull talk-show questions with his own 
special inquiries: What are your superpowers? Do you have any secret 
identities? Who are your archenemies? 
</P>
<P>
 So far, guests have included diet guru Susan Powter, cast members from 
"Gilligan's Island," the Bee Gees and "Tonight Show" bandleader Branford 
Marsalis. Upcoming on the 15-minute show, which airs Fridays at 11 p.m., will 
be David Byrne and the band Sonic Youth. The network has produced six "Space 
Ghost" shows so far and is making 13 more. 
</P>
<P>
 But the big project over the next two years, Lazzo said, will be the creation 
and presentation of 48 original six-minute shorts. They've hired dozens of 
animators, many just out of art school and some, like Ralph Bakshi ("Fritz the 
Cat" and "Cool World"), with much experience and an edgy reputation. The 
cartoons will begin turning up in January.  
</P>
<P>
 "Animation started with these kinds of shorts back in the '30s and '40s with 
such wigged-out directors like Tex Avery, Bob Clampett and Chuck Jones. This is 
where characters like Bugs and Daffy came from," Lazzo said. "Hopefully out of 
these, we will develop some new Yogi Bears, and when something hits, we'll make 
more." 
</P>
<P>
 The bulk of the network's schedule, however, is dedicated to old cartoons such 
as "The Flintstones," "The Jetsons" and "The Smurfs." Lazzo said he has some 
8,500 cartoons at his disposal from Hanna-Barbera as well as the old pre-1948 
Warner Bros.-MGM cartoons with Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck and some old Popeye 
and Betty Boop episodes. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he would like to buy other types of animation, especially certain 
cutting-edge cartoons from Japan, he is for now limited to what Turner has in 
the closet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ted has said, 'I bought you a library, now utilize it,' " said Lazzo, who 
worked his way up from the shipping department at Turner's WTBS in Atlanta. "I 
could spend lots of money picking up different cartoons that I want, and 
hopefully I will be able to do that at some point, but for now I have barely 
touched all the stuff I do have." 
</P>
<P>
 And he knows the plot of just about all of them -- everything from Col. Bleep 
to Sylvester the Cat. Even cartoon fanatics would be hard-pressed to name a 
cartoon that has been on TV that Lazzo doesn't know about. He attributes his 
obsession to the fact that his family moved frequently when he was young. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was shy and each year when we'd move to a new town, I found it difficult to 
meet new friends. But I found it extremely easy to find my favorite cartoon 
show I'd watched in my previous locale," Lazzo said. "So as I grew up, my 
friends were the Jetsons and Huckleberry and my comic books. I just grew to 
love these things. They were my buddies, and as I got older it didn't go away. 
I still love to sit down and watch Jonny Quest." 
</P>
<P>
 And now he gets paid for it -- more than enough to hire someone to cut his 
mother's lawn.

CROWELL HAS FOUND PEACE OF CHANGE; MUSIC: WITH A NEW ALBUM OUT AND A TURBULENT 
MARRIAGE BREAKUP BEHIND HIM, THE SINGER SAYS HIS SONGS NOW REFLECT AN INNER 
CALMNESS. HE'S AT THE CRAZY HORSE TONIGHT.

<P>
 About 16 months ago, during his last appearance at the Crazy Horse, Rodney 
Crowell tried out a wealth of new material in an acoustic setting. The idea was 
to give the songs a test run in front of a live audience before taking them 
into a recording studio. Now, those songs have coalesced into his latest album, 
"Let the Picture Paint Itself," and he'll be back at the Crazy Horse tonight, 
playing them with a brand new band. 
</P>
<P>
 On the phone last week from the Grand Canyon, where he was relaxing with his 
daughters, ages 5 and 12, before a string of California dates, Crowell said he 
found the feedback he got from that audience to be most useful. 
</P>
<P>
 "It worked well. When I played (the songs), I figured out what was wrong with 
them. I rewrote a couple. I scrapped a few and then went home and wrote some 
new ones. It was a very successful experiment for me in terms of what I learned 
about the songs." 
</P>
<P>
 "Let the Picture Paint Itself" turns out to be one of Crowell's most poetic 
and satisfying albums. 
</P>
<P>
 His two previous releases, "Keys to the Highway" and "Life Is Messy," were 
marked by dark emotional turmoil that many felt reflected the breakup of his 
12-year marriage to Rosanne Cash (who, ironically enough, also is in Orange 
County tonight, playing at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano). But the new 
record exudes the spirit of a man at peace with himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowell acknowledged that the album expresses a calmer state of mind. "I think 
the personal side of this album was not as much about the darkness as it was 
about resolving all of that stuff and moving on. I would say that the feeling 
on the new album is resolved, and resolution usually brings some form of 
happiness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Normally in the past," he added, "when I would get away from one of my 
records and then get back to it and listen to it, all the things that were 
wrong with it would glare at me. On this one, I find myself focusing on what I 
like about it instead of what I don't like." 
</P>
<P>
 And what does he like? 
</P>
<P>
 "I like me on the record more," he answered. "I think I'm just starting to be 
capable of what I want to do as a vocalist. I think my songwriting matured and 
developed more quickly than my performing did. On the last couple of records, 
I've only just begun to be satisfied that my performing self is starting to 
function at the same level as the songwriter." 
</P>
<P>
 He also said that -- though "talking about songwriting for me is like doing 
card tricks on the radio" -- he feels he is continuing to grow as a songwriter 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in a new phase right now. I think I went through a period, say through 
'Keys to the Highway' and 'Life is Messy,' when I wrote about my interior self. 
I kind of went inside and wrote about the landscape and the emotions on the 
inside of me. Now I've done that and I'm getting back to some of the 
descriptive writing I was doing much earlier. I've come full circle in a way. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was in my late 20s, I was really into experimenting with description 
with songs like 'Stars on the Water' and 'Ain't Livin' Long Like This.' Now 
I've kind of come back around. There's something subtle going on for me right 
now and I can't wait to see what it yields ultimately." 
</P>
<P>
 The songs he wrote when he was younger were, he said, almost pure inspiration, 
and he has matured, he feels he has become more conscious of his craft. 
"Somebody once said, and I think it applies to me: 'I have learned to do 
consciously what I used to do unconsciously.' And I find that the conscious 
stuff is as powerful as the other. It is still coming from the unconscious; I'm 
just consciously getting it and turning it into something." 
</P>
<P>
 After scoring No. 1 singles, winning a Grammy (for "After All This Time") and 
writing such songs as "Shame on the Moon" and "Till I Gain Control Again" that 
clearly have stood the test of time, what next? 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say something that you may find strange," he replied. "I don't think 
I discovered my market until about three months ago. It was almost as though 
somebody lifted a veil. 
</P>
<P>
 "My market is the country audience, definitely. That is what became very clear 
to me. It was like when they say a writer finds his voice. I suddenly knew what 
I'm supposed to be saying to people. It was as though I'd spent the last 15 
years not really knowing what I was doing. It was almost as though I had never 
connected with the audience that I had been writing for all that time. My 
audience is the audience that is interested in songs. The country market is 
about songs and storytelling."
