STATE APPELLATE JUSTICE MOORE DIES OF LEUKEMIA; THE LAW: COLLEAGUES HAIL JUDGE 
AS AN INSPIRATION AND AS A LEGAL SCHOLAR WITH SPECIAL INTEREST IN CHILDREN'S 
WELFARE AND PROBATE. 
</P>

<P>
 Justice Henry T. Moore Jr. of the 4th District Court of Appeal, a legal 
scholar with a special interest in children's welfare and probate law, died 
Friday morning after a long struggle with leukemia. He was 61. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his illness, Moore refused to give up his work and spent the month of 
March working from home, said Presiding Justice David G. Sills. Moore had 
planned to return to court Friday, and news of his death left colleagues 
saddened. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was an inspiration to us all," said Sills, who was friends with Moore for 
more than a decade. "He just refused to give in. He was working on his cases 
and opinions until he took a turn for the worse just a few days ago." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the one thing that everyone remembers about Hank was his love of the 
law," Sills said. "It was his whole life." 
</P>
<P>
 So serious was Moore's passion for legal scholarship and the law that no 
detail was too small to catch his eye, Sills said. "It was tough to hold back 
the tears" when he just recently came across legal papers in which Moore had 
made a correction in grammar, Sills said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Moore's most noted opinions came in the case of siblings who were in 
foster care. The natural parents were considered unfit -- but were holding up 
adoption proceedings by couples who wanted to raise the children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Children should not be required to wait until their parents grow up," Moore 
said in an oft-quoted ruling. His decision paved the way for the adoptions and 
has since helped focus child welfare law on the right of the children. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore, a Republican, was known for middle-of-the-road views that were based in 
the law but also reflected common sense. And he was not afraid to stand alone. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Moore dissented when the majority dismissed a murder conviction 
against a drug dealer who sold PCP to a surfer who later drowned. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore was in private practice, specializing in probate law, until his 1984 
appointment to the Orange County Superior Court bench. He was elevated to the 
appellate court in Santa Ana in 1988 by then-Gov. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
 Presiding Orange County Superior Court Judge James L. Smith said in a 
statement that Moore's reforms in probate court continue to serve as a model. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a legal scholar of wide renown, an extremely productive and creative 
trial judge and made contributions as a justice of the Court of Appeal that 
will ensure his place in the legal history of California," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven C. McCracken, president of the Orange County Bar Assn., said the 
printing of Orange County Lawyer -- a monthly bar publication -- has been 
postponed so a memorial page honoring Moore can be included. 
</P>
<P>
 "What a fabulous person, what a very fine jurist," said Orange County Superior 
Court Judge David O. Carter. "He was very well liked by those persons who had 
the pleasure of appearing before him." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Gregg L. Prickett, who frequently appeared before the 
appellate court, recalled Moore as a strong advocate of victims' rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "His facial expressions would always let you know whether he agreed -- and he 
was never afraid to let you know when disagreed," Prickett said. "He will be 
missed." 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Moore is survived by his wife, Lynda, and their three adult children, 
Michael, Kenneth and Laura. Funeral arrangements are pending.

CITYSCAPES / MIGUEL BUSTILLO: 'THIS IS TOO MUCH FOR US. . . . THERE IS NO 
PROFIT ANYMORE.'; COURTHOUSE CLOSURE PUTS NEIGHBORING STORES ON DEATH ROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The verdict is in on the courthouse in San Fernando, and for many of the 
merchants near the building on Maclay Avenue, it feels like the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 The 11-year-old structure, which was red-tagged after the Northridge 
earthquake, will remain closed for 14 months for a $15-million rebuilding 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 For some small businesses, which have come to depend on courthouse clientele 
for survival, 14 months might be too long. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the day it closed, the whole town just died," said Nick Yohanna, who has 
owned Maclay Cleaners for 18 years. "I never knew it affected things this much. 
Every day is Sunday now." 
</P>
<P>
 Yohanna said he lost about 40 customers after the courthouse closed, mostly 
lawyers, county sheriff's deputies and marshals, whom he knew by name.  
</P>
<P>
 Kira's Russian restaurant on Maclay and 3rd Street used to be packed with 
attorneys and court clerks during the day. Although the quaint, family-run 
operation still does good business during the lunch hour, it is empty 
</P>
<P>
 most of the rest of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is too much for us," said owner Garnik Mehrabian, who works in the 
restaurant, along with his wife, daughter, son, sister and brother-in-law. "We 
lost business during the recession, and the courthouse was the largest part of 
our business left before the earthquake. There is no profit anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Mehrabian said he did not feel the loss of courthouse customers for the first 
few weeks because the restaurant attracted a steady stream of FEMA workers. Now 
that most of them have moved on, he said, he will need help from the government 
for Kira's to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The loss of the courthouse has hurt the tiny city's economy, San Fernando 
Mayor Dan Acuna said. Several businesses affected by the closure have sought 
his help, and he is worried about the future.  
</P>
<P>
 "The courthouse means a lot to this city," said Acuna, who at first was told 
the building would take six months to repair. "The longer the courthouse is not 
in operation, the more damage that will cause to our economy." 
</P>
<P>
 A structural evaluation by a private engineering firm found that 16 support 
columns and many concrete walls, stairwells and pipes were damaged during the 
Jan. 17 earthquake, said Jim Abbott, general manager of construction and real 
estate for the county Internal Services Department, which is in charge of 
repairing county buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the building systems are damaged to one extent or another," he said. "I 
thought it was going to take $30 million." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to repairs, the tile roof will be replaced, standard seismic and 
fire safety upgrades will be installed, and the energy systems will be 
improved, Abbott said. 
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando, a community of 22,000, is not without its own big city-like 
problems. Gangs and graffiti, and the firing in January of parks Director Jess 
Margarito for alleged misuse of his office have blemished the city's 
once-pristine reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebuilding after the Northridge earthquake is the main political issue in the 
city. Luckily, the fiscally conservative city had money in its treasury and 
should be able to get by on budget reserves, City Administrator Mary Strenn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 An updated assessment of buildings damaged during the temblor found that 53 
structures -- including 30 businesses and 87 residential units -- need to be 
demolished, at a cost of about $47 million. 
</P>
<P>
 A more detailed analysis of the courthouse, which will take about 15 weeks, 
has begun.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, judges and clerks are mostly scattered between the San Fernando 
Municipal Court Building and Van Nuys Superior Court. Prosecutors and defense 
attorneys are sharing space with their Van Nuys counterparts, and some clerks 
are working out of the former San Fernando police station.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite the chaos, most San Fernando court cases are being tried on schedule 
and none have been dismissed or transferred, said Judge Judith M. Ashmann, who 
supervises the court. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a diaspora," Ashmann said. "But the judges I work with in San 
Fernando have just a wonderful attitude about it. To be a judge, all I need is 
my robe."

BALLOT PLAN ON LANDFILL NOT ENOUGH; WELDON CANYON: AUTHORITIES SAY THE SAN 
DIEGO COUNTY FIRM WOULD STILL NEED STATE, REGIONAL AND LOCAL APPROVALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER and CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A San Diego County firm that hopes to bypass Ventura County supervisors by 
seeking a ballot initiative on a dump at Weldon Canyon would still need state, 
regional and some local approvals, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Taconic Resources of San Diego County is negotiating to take over a lease to 
Weldon Canyon from Waste Management Inc., which withdrew its proposal to build 
the dump last summer because Ventura County supervisors would not support the 
project. If it gets the lease, Taconic says it plans to seek a countywide 
initiative on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Reaction to that prospect among Ventura County officials was mixed Friday. 
While some speculated that Taconic could mount a successful petition campaign, 
others questioned whether a ballot measure could pass and expressed doubt that 
any such vote would be legal or binding. "I think the perception is that east 
county voters want a landfill in Weldon Canyon," said Supervisor Maria 
VanderKolk, whose district extends from Thousand Oaks to Port Hueneme. "My 
opinion is that people realize there are a lot of alternatives to landfills, 
that you can't keep putting trash in a hole in the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Maggie Kildee, whose western county district includes Ojai, agreed 
that the county does not need another landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to have the legality of this thing looked at," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 If Taconic is successful in negotiating with Waste Management and Weldon 
Canyon property owners, the development firm says it plans to seek a countywide 
ballot question on whether a landfill should be allowed in Weldon. 
</P>
<P>
 Taconic, which specializes in solid and liquid waste projects, would then have 
to produce about 18,000 signatures on a petition by June 8 to get a measure on 
the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 If that measure were successful, permits would still be needed from the 
Ventura County Air Pollution Control District, California Regional Water 
Quality Control Board, California Integrated Waste Management Board and the 
local enforcement agency, which in Ventura County is the county's Environmental 
Health Division, said Kay Martin, manager of the Ventura County Solid Waste 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the face of it, I don't see why people should be afraid to get the voice 
of the people," she said. "There are sufficient state requirements to see that 
environmental considerations are taken care of." 
</P>
<P>
 But others, including Ojai City Councilwoman Nina Shelley, object to taking a 
land-use decision to voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not a fair way to decide whether there should be a landfill at Weldon," 
said Shelley, who fought the previous proposal by Waste Management. "The 
proposal has impacts on only one part of the county." 
</P>
<P>
 But, she said, "Residents, biased as they are in the east and middle county," 
would be voting on the measure. "We only have 1.5% of the voting public in 
Ojai." 
</P>
<P>
 Shelley said she also fears that such a ballot measure would divide the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 VanderKolk said the larger issue is that voters at large are not equipped to 
decide the merits of such a complicated, technical project as a landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 "They do not have access to all of the information we do," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Taconic representatives said the impending defeat of the Waste Management 
landfill proposal by the Board of Supervisors would have been based on 
politics, and not information. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would only bypass the county supervisors and Planning Commission," said 
Richard Chase, general partner of Taconic Resources. "We would still have to 
obtain other state, local and regional permits. But at least those permits are 
based, at least largely, on the technical merits of the project." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he believes the firm can win the necessary votes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are substantial groups in portions of the county that would be in favor 
of Weldon: Oxnard because it has the existing dump, and the people in the east 
would like the west county trash to stay out of the east county." 
</P>
<P>
 Taconic has entered a similar lease agreement with Waste Management to take 
over development of a landfill in northern San Diego County. Servcon-San Marcos 
Inc., a corporation in which Taconic has an interest, is the developer at 
Gregory Canyon there. 
</P>
<P>
 Taconic is also seeking a ballot initiative in San Marcos, where petitioners 
are gathering signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 If allowed, Taconic would develop a Weldon Canyon landfill, but would not 
build or operate it. Those options would be sold or leased to a third party, 
Chase said.

STUDY SAYS KEEP STREET AT VENTURA HIGH CLOSED; SAFETY: REPORT ALSO RECOMMENDS 
INSTALLING SPEED BUMPS ON SOME HILLSIDE ROADS TO DISCOURAGE TRAFFIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Poli Street should remain closed at Ventura High School during school hours, 
but speed bumps should be installed on nearby streets to discourage detouring 
traffic, a report released Friday says. 
</P>
<P>
 A committee headed by Mayor Tom Buford has concluded that either moving or 
redesigning the high school campus is the best long-term solution to traffic 
problems in the area. But because that option is too costly, installing speed 
bumps on Palomar Avenue and Sunset Drive was viewed as an acceptable 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish that we could come up with something that everyone could be happy 
with, but you can't do that," Buford said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillside residents reacted angrily to the report, saying the committee 
included too many school officials and parents intent on keeping Poli closed. 
The street is a major east-west artery that runs through the heart of Ventura 
High School, and its closure has increased traffic in some nearby hillside 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a completely stacked committee for the school," said Hazel Imbrecht, a 
75-year-old homemaker who is helping organize a ballot initiative to reopen 
Poli. "They have no right to keep Poli Street closed. It's a public 
thoroughfare." 
</P>
<P>
 Three hillside residents served on the 10-member committee, which was 
appointed by Buford. Four members were affiliated with Ventura High School and 
two members were residents who have no connections to either side. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents of Ventura High School students hailed the committee's nine-page 
report, saying their children's safety is more important than traffic problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a student loses his or her life, it's too late," said Nicky van 
Nieuwburg, president-elect of the Parent Teacher Student Assn. "These kids 
should be able to go to school and feel safe." 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of closing Poli Street has come up periodically in the past 20 
years. Most recently, the Ventura City Council in August voted to block off 
Poli during school hours to prevent drive-by shootings and pedestrian 
accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the closure pushed hundreds of detouring cars into nearby residential 
neighborhoods, barricades were installed on Palomar Avenue and Sunset Drive to 
push traffic onto Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillside residents, however, said the barricades in their neighborhoods hinder 
their ability to get in and out of their own homes quickly. They have been 
campaigning to keep Poli open throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
 They have circulated petitions, held protest meetings and are gathering 
signatures for a ballot initiative in November. But the committee's 
recommendation to replace the barricades with speed bumps may mollify some 
homeowners, said John Wolfe, a hillside resident who sat on the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "The speed bumps may not stop all the increased traffic from coming up here," 
Wolfe said, "but it would slow down the traffic that does come through." 
</P>
<P>
 Buford said the city's traffic engineers are not enthusiastic about speed 
bumps. According to a resolution adopted by the council in December, 1993, city 
policy generally discourages creating speed bumps. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that the traffic people like them because they're trying to 
design things that make traffic move, not slow it down," Buford said. "But they 
understand that there are engineering decisions, and then there are community 
and political decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 The council is expected to consider the committee's recommendation April 18. 
Buford said if many hillside residents oppose the committee's recommendation, 
the council may decide not to install the speed bumps. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what we'll do," Buford said. "This issue is not going to go away 
no matter what the council does. Every school year there will be people trying 
to get the decision overturned." 
</P>
<P>
 School district officials have been trying to get the council to close Poli 
for almost two decades. The issue has come up in 1974, 1991, 1992 and 1993. In 
May, 1974, Poli was closed for a two-week trial period and then reopened after 
hillside residents complained. NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura City Council will consider the committee's report on Poli Street 
at its April 18 meeting. Hillside residents, meanwhile, are gathering 
signatures for a November ballot initiative to reopen Poli Street. Residents 
must gather a minimum of 8,588 signatures of registered Ventura voters by June 
25 to qualify for the ballot.

YOUNG, OLD JOIN OXNARD PASSION PLAY; TRADITIONS: THOUSANDS OF THE FAITHFUL JAM 
THE STREETS OF LA COLONIA FOR THE 23RD ANNUAL OUTDOOR PAGEANT, WHICH RE-ENACTS 
THE CRUCIFIXION OF CHRIST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It is a pilgrimage that Regina Perez says demonstrates her faith. 
</P>
<P>
 As she has on Good Friday for the past 23 years, the 92-year-old left her home 
in Oxnard's La Colonia barrio shortly before noon and shuffled five blocks to a 
neighborhood church. 
</P>
<P>
 There -- as amateur actors prepared to perform the annual Passion Play 
dramatizing the trial, torture and crucifixion of Jesus Christ -- Perez slid 
rosary beads between her fingers and spoke of the meaning behind her loyal 
attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is for people who have faith in Christ," she said as street vendors 
buzzed around her selling balloons and frozen fruit bars. "It gives me faith. 
It fills me with something precious." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of the faithful jammed the streets of La Colonia for the outdoor 
pageant. The event keeps alive a tradition played out in towns across Mexico 
and started in Oxnard 23 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Peddlers hawked fruit cups and cotton candy and giant banana-shaped balloons. 
Youngsters scrambled onto rooftops and teetered atop concrete walls and old 
wooden fences to get a better view. 
</P>
<P>
 And as Saul Aguilar, a 31-year-old farm worker who for the third year in a row 
played the lead role of Christ, was condemned to die, the crowd booed and 
hissed on cue. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in black and wearing a lace veil, 74-year-old Rosario Corona Sanchez 
leaned over a trio of youngsters and explained what was going on. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is to remind us that Jesus Christ died for us," she told the children. 
"This is to remind us that God is alive and that he blesses us." 
</P>
<P>
 Then the crowd surged through the streets -- past the $1 store and the public 
housing projects -- following Aguilar as he shouldered a wooden cross on a 
six-block march to a grassy knoll behind Our Lady of Guadalupe Church. 
</P>
<P>
 Aguilar -- bloody and staggering and wearing a crown of thorns -- stumbled and 
fell to the ground several times, as told in the Bible story. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here is your God!" shouted the Roman soldiers as they pretended to kick and 
whip Aguilar. 
</P>
<P>
 Raquel Mendez wept as she watched the street play unfold, though she knew all 
along that Christ would be put to death. 
</P>
<P>
 "He gave up so much for us," said the Saticoy resident before being pushed on 
by the wave of bodies surging through the streets. "And still, we continue to 
do the things we should not do." 
</P>
<P>
 All the while, Father Jose Luis Ortega used a loudspeaker to keep a running 
commentary that drew parallels between the plight of Jesus and modern-day 
social ills. 
</P>
<P>
 "The struggle of Jesus Christ is much like the struggle that happens every day 
in our community," Ortega said. "It is a struggle for justice and a struggle 
for peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Aguilar made it to the grassy hill that doubles as a playground for 
Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic School. Aguilar was placed on a cross and 
taunted by the soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Then they cast lots for his garments and pierced his side with a spear when he 
died. 
</P>
<P>
 Clara Ramos watched the final moments of the pageant in the shadow of a 
concrete wall that separates new two-story houses from the old La Colonia 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 The 38-year-old Oxnard resident performed in the Passion Play as a child. And 
for the past 10 years she has helped stage the street play. She said she is 
amazed each year that thousands of people turn out to watch the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "Honestly, people are looking for something to believe in," she said. "This 
reminds us of our own mortality and where we came from." 
</P>
<P>
 As the crowd thinned, the street vendors moved in. They again peddled ice 
cream and cotton candy. But despite the carnival atmosphere that surrounds the 
pageant, event organizers say the Passion Play's meaning is as valid today as 
it was when the first production was staged. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without faith this is just a show," Father Ortega said. "Faith is the 
difference. Faith is the force that can move more than we imagine. Most people 
who come here do so because they are moved by their faith."

OJAI RESIDENTS WARN OTHERS ABOUT RADAR TOWERS; HEALTH: THEY START A NATIONAL 
LETTER CAMPAIGN AFTER FAILING TO GET THE WEATHER-TRACKING SYSTEM MOVED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Ojai residents have launched a letter-writing campaign to warn communities 
across the country of health risks they believe are associated with the 
National Weather Service's radar towers. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents have been unsuccessful in persuading the federal government to 
move a weather-tracking system on Sulphur Mountain to a less-populated area, 
and are now trying to rally support outside their town. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's working on getting the tower down, but specific people have 
volunteered to contact people in other communities," said Ojai resident 
Virginia Loy, who is leading the letter-writing effort. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, a federal judge ruled that the weather service had performed 
adequate studies to ensure the tower's safety, but residents believe the radar 
emits hazardous levels of radiation that could cause cancer or leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
 After U. S. Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr. refused to halt operation of the tower, 
saying further analysis was unnecessary, Ojai residents started a grass-roots 
campaign aimed at garnering support for their cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Their latest effort is notifying residents in cities where radar systems are 
to be constructed in the next year. Members of the "warning committee" plan to 
send letters and a 32-page report they have written about the Sulphur Mountain 
tower to public officials and newspapers in those areas, Loy said. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government plans to install 165 new weather tracking systems by 
the end of 1995, said Jim Campbell, deputy director of the weather service's 
western region. 
</P>
<P>
 About 70 radar towers have already been constructed nationwide, six of those 
in the western United States, including the Sulphur Mountain system. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's one going on-line almost every week," said Lori Arguelles, a 
spokeswoman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. "We're 
roughly halfway there." 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai residents have already contacted individuals in the San Diego and 
Monterey areas, which are slated for tower installation in the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Arguelles said her office is not concerned by the letter-writing effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly it is every American citizen's right to contact other citizens," 
she said. "I think we have the facts on our side and they will speak for 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to sending letters to other communities, Ojai residents are 
continuing to seek support for their cause in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 600 letters to politicians were generated at a town meeting Thursday 
night at the Chaparral Auditorium, Loy said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 people crammed into the tiny building to hear public officials, 
doctors, lawyers and Upper Ojai residents discuss how to force the weather 
service to relocate the Sulphur Mountain tower. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is morally wrong, it is legally wrong and it is scientifically wrong, and 
we are going to put a stop to it," Ojai resident Richard Loy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people of Ojai have changed things and they're going to do it again," Loy 
said. "We're going to win this battle because each and every one of you is 
going to write letters." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Supervisors Maggie Kildee and Susan Lacey spoke at the meeting, 
urging residents to write letters to their elected public officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I came to you to say there is an easy solution, but you and I both 
know that's not the way it's going to work," Kildee said. "I don't believe it's 
going to be won in a legal battle. I believe it's going to be won in a 
political battle. . . . God knows, you in this community have the power to do 
that."

OXNARD METROLINK SERVICE MAY BE SHORT-LIVED; TRANSPORTATION: THE COMMUTER 
TRAINS START RUNNING MONDAY. BUT MORE FUNDS ARE NEEDED BECAUSE FEDERAL QUAKE 
AID RUNS OUT OCT. 1. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Even as Ventura County transit officials prepare to celebrate the first day of 
Metrolink service to Oxnard, they warned that the service may be short-lived 
unless the county can find funds to keep the trains running after federal 
earthquake aid runs out Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Ventura County Transportation Commission at its Friday meeting said it 
faces an even bigger Metrolink problem: finding $3 million to keep regular 
Metrolink service running to Simi Valley and Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a special trial-period agreement with the Southern California Regional 
Rail Authority, the commission paid only $800,000 a year for the first two 
years of regular service to Moorpark and Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time that period ends next fall, the county must come up with new 
funding sources or be required by the state to take the money from local bus 
services, Transportation Commission Executive Director Ginger Gherardi told the 
panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, federal earthquake emergency funds run out in October for both the 
Oxnard service, scheduled to begin Monday, and the Camarillo station, which has 
been carrying commuters to Los Angeles since February. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency agreed to pay the bulk of the 
$1.2-million cost of running the two stations until October to help ease 
congestion on freeways damaged in the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big, ongoing issue here is long-term funding for rail in Ventura County," 
Gherardi said. "We are going to have to start looking at some new sources of 
revenue." 
</P>
<P>
 The commission could take the money from a state transit fund used mostly for 
buses and street maintenance throughout the county, Gherardi said. State law 
stipulates that if a public transit service is filling a need, it cannot be 
canceled if there is transit funding available, Gherardi said. 
</P>
<P>
 So part of the money now being set aside for buses could be used for train 
service, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gherardi also suggested that the commission consider putting a transit tax 
initiative on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County voters in 1990 overwhelmingly rejected a half-cent sales tax 
that would have raised $500 million for transportation projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The commissioners were reluctant to pursue either of Gherardi's 
recommendations, instead directing her to seek alternative funding sources and 
survey residents to find out whether they would support a tax measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking about putting something on the ballot when we haven't done our 
homework," said Commissioner Frank Schillo, who also serves as a city 
councilman in Thousand Oaks. "We've got to look at all the possibilities before 
we go looking for a tax increase." 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Bill Davis, who is a member of the Simi Valley City Council, 
suggested asking the state for permission to spend a $2-million surplus in 
money earmarked for emergency call boxes on highways. 
</P>
<P>
 "I truly believe there is money out there that we can get to," Davis said. 
"There are ways to do this without cutting into the bus service or taxing the 
citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Paul Lawrason, the mayor of Moorpark, said he is adamantly 
opposed to dipping into bus funds to pay for Metrolink. 
</P>
<P>
 "That money should not be touched," Lawrason said. "There are a lot of good 
alternatives." 
</P>
<P>
 Gherardi agreed to seek other funding sources but warned the commissioners the 
outlook was grim. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need to tell you the alternatives are very limited," Gherardi said. "We may 
be able to push this off for a year or so, but eventually we are going to have 
to deal with it." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink trains will leave from the Oxnard Transit Center, 200 E. 4th St. 
near Oxnard Boulevard, Mondays through Fridays at 5:31 a.m. and 6:21 a.m., and 
return at 6 p.m. and 7:14 p.m. Trains will make nine stops on the 1 1/2-hour 
trip to Union Station in downtown Los Angeles. A round-trip ticket to Burbank 
costs $12, and to Los Angeles $14. A monthly pass to Burbank is $176 and $208 
to Los Angeles. For more information, call (800) 438-1112 or (800) 371-LINK.

FAMILY GETS SETTLEMENT IN SLAYING BY DEPUTY; EXCESSIVE FORCE: SURVIVORS OF A 
MAN KILLED IN 1991 WILL GET $4.4 MILLION. OFFICERS SAID THEY THOUGHT VICTIM, 
WHO WAS CARRYING A STICK, HAD A FIREARM.

<P>
 The family of a Cudahy man who was shot to death by a sheriff's deputy three 
years ago won a $4.4-million judgment against the county -- one of the largest 
use-of-force verdicts involving a deputy in recent years, a county official 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a large verdict," said Principal Deputy County Counsel Patrick Meyers. 
"It's a bit to swallow. All of us anticipated that we would get a better 
result." 
</P>
<P>
 The death of Emiliano Camacho in early 1991 was attributed to a deputy's 
belief that the 40-year-old man was holding a gun when he answered the door of 
his apartment in the 3900 block of East Walnut Street. Instead, he was carrying 
a 29-inch stick, found lying bloodstained beside his body. 
</P>
<P>
 No weapon was found in Camacho's apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Deputy Steve Feliciano, who had answered a family disturbance call, 
believed the stick was a rifle or shotgun and fired two shots, hitting Camacho 
once in the chest, the district attorney's office said in a report exonerating 
the deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 Feliciano, who has since resigned, and Deputy Larry Moon went to the apartment 
shortly before 2 a.m. on March 23, 1991, and heard what they thought was a 
gunshot, the report said. As they sought cover behind a parked car, Feliciano 
saw the apartment door open and Camacho emerge holding what the deputy thought 
was a rifle or shotgun, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Camacho was shot, he made his way to a bedroom, where his body was found 
in a closet, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 After a two-month trial, a Superior Court jury in Norwalk deliberated for four 
days before finding Thursday that Feliciano was negligent for not ordering 
Camacho to drop his weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 "The jury found it negligent that we did not announce: 'Stop! Police! Drop 
your weapon!' " said Martha Shen, a private attorney retained to represent the 
county. "That happens on TV -- not in real life." 
</P>
<P>
 Shen described the verdict as "pretty outrageous." 
</P>
<P>
 Events leading up to the shooting began when Camacho's daughter, Monica, 
called 911 after her father awakened and began arguing with her mother, said 
attorney Gregory W. Moreno, who represented the family. 
</P>
<P>
 "The man was unarmed, he had been drinking and he argued with his wife," 
Moreno said. "There was no criminal activity by the deceased" at the time of 
the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 After the shooting, Camacho's wife and children were ordered out of the house, 
Moreno said. The attorney said they told Feliciano and Moon that Camacho was 
still alive and that he was unarmed. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the family was kept in the back of a patrol car while a SWAT team took 3 
1/2 hours to find out he wasn't armed," Moreno said. No officers entered the 
apartment where Camacho was mortally wounded, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A medical expert brought in by the family testified that Camacho lived at 
least half an hour after the shooting, and might have been saved with medical 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 But Shen said she thought Camacho died "pretty fast, " pointing out that the 
Los Angeles County coroner's office said he died within minutes of the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies yelled to Camacho for two hours to come out, Shen said. "They knew 
the family said he had no weapon, but they thought he had a gun," she said. 
"The jury did not find the deputies negligent for not going into house. That's 
insane to go into the house when you think he has a rifle or shotgun." 
</P>
<P>
 Camacho had been arrested three times, and convicted twice, on spousal abuse 
charges, Shen said. "Even though his daughter had witnessed fights between her 
parents before, for the first time in her life, she called 911," she said. "He 
was on probation for battery on his wife at the time he was shot." 
</P>
<P>
 She said Camacho's widow, Evangelina, and three of his children had sought up 
to $21.5 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the verdict is pretty outrageous on one hand," she said. "On the 
other hand, it is substantially lower than what they asked for." 
</P>
<P>
 The judgment includes $200,000 for Camacho's father, who lives in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 The county has not decided whether to appeal, Meyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 County records show that in a six-year period ending last July, taxpayers paid 
about $50 million in settlements, judgments and legal fees arising from 
excessive-force claims against deputies.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: 2 KIOSKS PLANNED FOR LOS PADRES FOREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two trail heads in Los Padres National Forest will have new kiosks to provide 
hikers with information about wildlife, fire dangers and trail difficulty, 
under a plan by the U. S. Forest Service. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12-by-6-foot display cases will be installed at the Oak Flat ranger 
station north of Fillmore in June, and at the Matilija trail head in Matilija 
Canyon north of Ojai in September. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each of them is unique," said Leslie Jehnings, recreational planner for the 
forest service. "We're trying an innovative design with wood and rock." 
</P>
<P>
 Jehnings said the Ojai district had hoped to construct seven kiosks for the 
most traveled trails in the Sespe Wilderness, but because of budget 
constraints, only two will be built this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The kiosks will cost from $2,500 and $3,500 each, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rangers hope to have similar structures installed at trail heads in Santa 
Paula Canyon and near Lion Campground near Rose Valley in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're trying to do is give an opportunity for the public to educate 
themselves about the wilderness," Jehnings said. An increase in trail use in 
recent years has warranted providing more information for hikers and nature 
enthusiasts, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The kiosk at Oak Flat, which is an entry point to the Sespe Condor Sanctuary, 
will also provide information about endangered California condors, which make 
their home in Los Padres National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Riddle, acting district ranger for the Ojai district, said the forest 
service had hoped to have the kiosks constructed by now. TRACY WILSON

LONGSHOREMEN OUTLINE PROGRAM AFTER 2 SLAIN IN SAN PEDRO; REACTION: UNION LEADER 
SAYS GROUP WILL LOBBY TO CREATE JOBS FOR HARBOR-AREA YOUTHS. RALLY IS AT SPOT 
WHERE JAPANESE STUDENTS WERE SHOT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SCHOCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles longshoremen gathered at noon Friday at the spot where two 
Japanese students were gunned down last week to mourn the deaths and to hear 
their union's promises to fight crime by creating jobs and promoting tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
 To applause, David Arian, president of the International Longshoremen's and 
Warehousemen's Union, outlined a union-backed program intended to stem violence 
in the Los Angeles Harbor area where many union members live and work. 
</P>
<P>
 "All around us we see death taking place," Arian told about 150 longshoremen 
and others gathered in the Ralphs grocery store parking lot in San Pedro. It 
was there that Marymount College students Takuma Ito and Go Matsuura, both 19, 
were fatally shot during a carjacking March 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Arian announced that the union would lobby to create jobs for harbor-area 
youths, support suitable penalties for crime, launch cultural exchange programs 
and plant trees in memory of the slain students. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't mourn, organize!" Arian urged members.  
</P>
<P>
 The gathering, part memorial service and part union rally, illustrated again 
how the shootings have shaken the harbor community of San Pedro, 23 miles south 
of Downtown. Some residents say they are chagrined and worried that because of 
the international publicity catalyzed by the students' deaths, their community 
has been unfairly cast as a crime capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Some who attended the rally said they want to make clear to the Japanese that 
they oppose violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came here to show that we are not all crazy gun-toting people in this 
country," said Ernie Peterson, 60, of Lomita, retired from the Merchant 
Marines. 
</P>
<P>
 Some have expressed concern that the publicity will damage Japanese trade in 
the harbor area. Japanese cargo accounted for about a quarter of the cargo 
tonnage passing through Los Angeles Harbor in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "The perception of Los Angeles is critical because Japan is our largest 
trading partner in terms of the amount of cargo moving in and out of here from 
Japan," said Jeff Leong, spokesman for the Port of Los Angeles. To date, there 
is no indication that Japanese shippers are diverting cargo to other West Coast 
ports, Leong said. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Bebich, secretary and business agent at ILWU Local 63, said many jobs 
depend on Japanese business, and he wonders if the shootings could make 
shippers think twice about Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 But most longshoremen interviewed at the Friday rally said they were there not 
out of fear that business could be lost, but to take a stand against violent 
crime. Several said they agree with Arian that a program to create jobs could 
help keep youths out of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you got a job to go to, you don't have time to mess up," said Norman Tuck, 
secretary-treasurer of ILWU Local 13, which has 2,700 area members. He said he 
is talking to industries in the area about job programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the rally was prompted by the deaths of the two Japanese college 
students, Tuck said: "We have to make sure that we don't exclude the youths 
that live and grew up in this area." 
</P>
<P>
 As the rally ended, Ronnie Escalante, 24, of San Pedro, who described himself 
as a former gang member, noted that no such outpouring followed the death of 
his younger brother in a San Pedro drive-by shooting two years ago. Youths in 
the area need jobs, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "The port of San Pedro is so rich. How come we can't get these jobs?" 
Escalante asked. 
</P>
<P>
 A passerby suggested he organize a meeting with the union, and Escalante 
promised to try.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; DEADLOCKED 
JURY IN RABBI'S TRIAL TO KEEP DELIBERATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jurors considering federal money laundering and conspiracy charges against a 
rabbi announced Friday that they are deadlocked, but the judge told them to 
keep trying to reach a verdict.  
</P>
<P>
 Abraham Low, 43, is a rabbi at the Fairfax-area Mogen Abraham synagogue.He is 
accused of offering to launder drug money during a videotaped meeting with an 
undercover FBI agent.  
</P>
<P>
 The jurors deliberated about five days before announcing that they were hung 
on all nine counts. U.S. District Judge Robert Takasugi instructed the panel to 
take the weekend off, then try again Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 Takasugi also told attorneys that a court security officer who passed a note 
to one of the jurors in the case has been fired.  
</P>
<P>
 Takasugi said an unidentified woman juror told him that the note, which was 
not made public, had nothing to do with the case, and that she could continue 
to serve impartially.

 Idaho-ho-ho: Boise, once high on the list of those places where people were 
advised to go to get away from it all, is experiencing growing pains. The Idaho 
city was recently the scene of a rally against the building of a bridge across 
the Boise River. Protesters wore T-shirts that bore the name "Boisangeles" 
enclosed in a circle with a red slash through it. As far as we're concerned, 
they don't have a right to take that name till they've had a 6.8 quake. Or at 
least a few Medflies.

 A new strain of Valley fever? Linda Hess of Van Nuys says she came down with 
it and her theory is that it was caused by the simultaneous closure of five 
malls in the Valley after the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>

 Free Minnie!A lad identified in the newspapers as "barefoot Charlie" saw the 
creature bobbing in the surf off Long Beach on May 4, 1897. Her body was roped 
and pulled ashore by employees of a house-moving company. 
</P>
<P>
 She became Long Beach's first tourist attraction. And one of its most 
profitable -- the city paid her captors a reported $600, compared to the 
millions that have been sunk into the Queen Mary. 
</P>
<P>
 The death of Minnie, a 65-foot-long whale, was just the beginning of her 
career. Her skeleton was on display for more than half a century before she was 
donated to the L.A. County Museum of Natural History two decades ago. But since 
then her bones have resided in a storage facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the 100th anniversary (of Minnie's arrival) coming up, it would be nice 
if she could be brought back and put on display," said Claudine Burnett, a Long 
Beach librarian who plans to write a book on the city's early history. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, John Heyning, the museum's curator of marine mammals, doubts that Minnie 
could be put back together. "Lots of her bones are missing," he said. "In fact, 
before we got her, her skull was sawed up into six or eight pieces over the 
years so she could be moved through doorways." 
</P>
<P>
 But, Heyning pointed out, visiting scientists still study Minnie. "Because her 
skull is cut up, you can look at parts you wouldn't normally see," he said. 
"Minnie's still serving a purpose."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: OFFICIALS BRACE FOR HUNDREDS OF UNWANTED CATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A handful of dogs in Ventura County have contracted valley fever over the past 
few months, but animal experts warn that a more widespread ailment has stricken 
the county's cat population -- spring fever. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with the Humane Society and county Animal Regulation say the cry of 
feral felines in heat this season is a harbinger of the hundreds of kittens 
that will be born in the spring. Most of them will have to be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're all in heat right now," said Jolene Hoffman, director of the Humane 
Society shelter in Ojai. "It's a horrible time of year. Every cat that has been 
coming in has been in heat or pregnant." 
</P>
<P>
 In late February and March, female cats enter the first of two annual 
reproductive cycles triggered by a change in the seasons. The cycles last for 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they are out and they're not spayed, you just assume they're pregnant," 
said Dr. Sean McCormack, a veterinarian at the Conejo Valley Veterinary Clinic 
in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The result of this spring fever is kittens, which are often dumped at animal 
shelters, Hoffman said.  
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, the Ojai shelter was receiving up to 60 kittens a day, she 
said. Last year, the numbers varied from one to 20 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just like having an assembly line all day long," Hoffman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Animal Regulation now has 40 cats at its Camarillo shelter, but that number 
will swell to nearly 1,000 in coming months, Director Kathy Jenks said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are now getting litters born and this will go on through October," Jenks 
said. "The problem is the number of kittens we have to kill." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoffman agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now you can't find any kittens (but) look in the papers in May, end of 
April, people can't get rid of them," Hoffman said. "Spay and neuter -- that is 
the only answer. (People) have got to become responsible pet owners." TRACY

 John A. Montoya died of head injuries after his 1993 Nissan plowed into a tree

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; VALLEY FEVER SURVEY REINFORCES THEORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About one in 12 Simi Valley residents tested for valley fever had been exposed 
to the fungal infection, a finding that reinforces Ventura County officials' 
view that the recent earthquake prompted the spate of cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal researchers, puzzled by an outbreak of 178 local cases this winter, 
randomly surveyed about 250 east Ventura residents and found 7% had evidence of 
the disease.A much smaller percentage had been exposed before the Jan. 17 
Northridge earthquake, said Gary Feldman, director of the county Health 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The epidemiologists from the national Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention returned Thursday to Atlanta, where they will analyze the data. But 
Feldman called the preliminary results reassuring. 
</P>
<P>
 But Feldman's counterpart in neighboring Los Angeles County remained skeptical 
about blaming the valley fever outbreak on the earthquake. That county has 
reported only 10 cases since January, said Shirley Fannin, director of the Los 
Angeles County Health Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Fannin suggested that Ventura County residents who had already been exposed to 
the infection rushed to the doctor for testing after news reports about the 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
 But Feldman said the CDC tests reveal there was not widespread exposure before 
the quake. Valley fever, spread by airborne spores, can cause flu-like symptoms 
in its mild form or meningitis and death in the most serious cases. 
</P>
<P>
 A 71-year-old Simi Valley man died of the disease last month. PHYLLIS W.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: GTE CUSTOMERS TO GET SMALL REFUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 About 200,000 Ventura County residents will see a small refund on their 
telephone bills this summer, officials with GTE California announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The refund to GTE customers in Thousand Oaks, Westlake, Camarillo, Oxnard, 
Port Hueneme and Santa Paula will be passed along as a 3.35% credit on 
customers' bills for August and September, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 That averages to about a $1 monthly savings for typical residential customers, 
company spokesman Mike Murray said. The credit will go toward all local and 
toll calls made using GTE, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 GTE is mandated by the Public Utilities Commission to share any earnings above 
a certain percentage with its customers, Murray said. The refunds reflect GTE's 
earnings in 1993, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Refunds will be given only during those two months, then normal billing 
procedures will resume, Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
 Refunds will be paid to GTE's nearly 3.1 million customers in California, 
company officials said. KAY SAILLANT

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; UNITED WAY 
GIVES $318,306 TO 31 GROUPS FOR QUAKE AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United Way of Greater Los Angeles gave out a total of $318,306 in grants 
this week to 31 Southland agencies that provide services to quake victims, it 
was announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesman Herbert Carter said the umbrella charitable organization is 
dedicating all of the donations received by its earthquake relief fund to 
agencies that are helping residents who suffered losses in January's quake. 
</P>
<P>
 This week's grants bring the total distributed through the fund to nearly $1.2 
million, said Kenneth Murphy, chairman of the local United Way's board of 
directors.  
</P>
<P>
 The money went to support 71 community service organizations in the Los 
Angeles area and in the Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys, Murphy said. The 
largest grant went to the Salvation Army, which was given $40,000 to continue 
its general quake-related relief services, he said. Catholic Charities received 
$30,000 for its outreach and counseling services.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; DEAF WOMAN 
SUES BURGER KING, IS HIRED AS CONSULTANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A deaf woman who sued Burger King when she was refused service at a drive-up 
window will be a company spokeswoman and help choose restaurants to test 
electronic ordering devices for the deaf. 
</P>
<P>
 Terrylene Sacchetti signed an 18-month consulting contract with Burger King, 
which also agreed to pay half her legal expenses, her lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacchetti, 26, will help the company choose 10 restaurants around the country 
where electronic ordering devices will be tested. The company will offer 
written order forms at 100 others. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very happy and surprised," Sacchetti said of the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacchetti, who lives in Santa Monica, said she drove past the drive-up 
intercom last year and handed a written order to an employee. She said the 
worker refused to fill the order, argued with her and threatened to call the 
police if she did not move her car. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, she sued the fast-food chain and the company that operated the 
Los Angeles franchise where she was denied service. The lawsuit charged 
violations of the Americans With Disabilities Act requiring businesses to 
accommodate disabled people in public places. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an unfortunate incident to have happen," said company spokesman 
Michael Evans. "We don't want to discourage anyone from coming to our 
restaurants."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: TOPANGA CANYON; 15-YEAR 
FIGHT FOR PARKLAND ENDS AS ESCROW CLOSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Escrow closed Friday on the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy's purchase of 
662 acres at the top of Topanga Canyon, bringing to a quiet end one of the most 
bitter land-use disputes in Los Angeles County history. 
</P>
<P>
 Land once proposed as the site of a links-style golf course and 97 luxury home 
sites passed into public hands after the conservancy wired $14.1 million to the 
account of the Canyon Oaks Estates Limited Partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's done," said conservancy staff counsel Liz Cheadle. "We own it, the 
people of California own it." 
</P>
<P>
 The transfer marks the end of a nasty fight that began more than 15 years ago 
over how the land in the Summit Valley should be used. Many residents of 
Topanga Canyon wanted the property to remain undeveloped. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of the deal, the conservancy agreed to pay $19.9 million in 
two installments for the property, which straddles Topanga Canyon Boulevard. 
Friday's installment covered 432 acres. The second, due in August, 1995, will 
pay for the remaining 230 acres.

 A 7-year-old Ventura girl died Friday after being struck by a delivery van 
while riding her bicycle, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred at 1:30 p.m. in the 300 block of West Simpson Street, 
just down the street from Sheridan Way School. 
</P>
<P>
 Karina J. Arias was pronounced dead 40 minutes later in the emergency room of 
the Ventura County Medical Center, said Deputy Coroner Mitch Breese. 
</P>
<P>
 According to residents and police, the girl had been riding her bicycle when 
she veered into the street and collided with a delivery van driven by Sukhvir 
Singh Grewal, 32, of Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramedics, who felt a faint pulse at the scene, took the girl to the 
hospital, but doctors could not revive her. Breese said Karina suffered a major 
head injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Cpl. Ray Broomfield said it did not appear that Grewal had been 
speeding. Hours after the accident, part of Simpson Street remained blocked off 
as police conducted their investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors said Karina had been staying with her aunt, who recently moved to 
Simpson Street. The girl's parents, Raul and Rosa Arias, live on Sherwin Avenue 
in Ventura. JULIE FIELDS

<P>
 Defense attorneys for two former promoters of an Oxnard card casino asked a 
Superior Court judge Friday to throw out charges of grand theft against their 
clients, saying there is no evidence they stole $10,000 in an unrelated 
construction deal. 
</P>
<P>
 But a prosecutor urged Superior Court Judge Allan Steele to let the charges 
stand, saying the defendants split the money after lying to get it from a group 
of local investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael E. Wooten, 45, of Camarillo and Frank Marasco, 48, of Ventura are each 
charged with one felony count of grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate case, the defendants are charged with six misdemeanor counts of 
money laundering in connection with illegal contributions allegedly made to 
local officials, including two Oxnard councilmen. The defendants had proposed a 
card-club casino for Oxnard, but the City Council eventually rejected the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 In the grand-theft case, the defendants allegedly submitted a false $10,000 
voucher to a consortium of Ventura County investors for work on a development 
project in Santa Paula, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of paying a construction firm for overseeing the work, Wooten and 
Marasco spent the money, Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff G. Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know exactly where this money went," Bennett said. "It went right in the 
(defendants') pockets."  
</P>
<P>
 But defense attorneys said there is no evidence the defendants broke any law. 
They said Wooten and Marasco supervised the project themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense lawyers also argued that the case against their clients would not even 
have a foundation in a civil court. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can't have civil damages how in the heck can you put this in a 
criminal arena?" asked Wooten's attorney, Richard C. Loy. 
</P>
<P>
 Steele will rule on the matter later. DWAYNE BRAY

 The area chapter of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society is accepting 
registrations for the fifth annual MSWalks for Multiple Sclerosis, to be held 
in Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo on April 10. 
</P>
<P>
 The society's Channel Islands chapter is also seeking volunteers to help 
conduct the walks, including assisting with check-in, driving safety vehicles 
and being part of a medical team. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the routes will cover 15 kilometers -- or 9.3 miles. The Ventura walk 
begins and ends at the Ventura Harbor Village. Same-day registration begins at 
8:30 a.m., with the event scheduled to start at 9 a.m. with aerobics and a 
continental breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants, who recruit pledges from friends, family and co-workers, must 
pay a $5 registration fee. 
</P>
<P>
 The area chapter will award two round-trip tickets to any destination in the 
United States to the volunteer who raises the largest amount of money. Any 
participant who raises $125 or more will also be eligible for a national 
drawing for a trip for two to Paris and other prizes. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from the walk will help provide counseling, employment aid, medical 
equipment and other services for the society's clients and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 Multiple sclerosis is a chronic, often disabling neurological disease of the 
central nervous system. About 300,000 Americans have it.

3 ROBBERS TERRORIZE FAMILY, RAPE GIRL; CRIME: THIEVES RANSACK DIAMOND BAR HOME. 
THEY REMAIN AT LARGE AFTER EARLY-MORNING CHASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Three armed robbers invaded and ransacked a Diamond Bar home early Friday, 
tying up five members of a family and raping a 13-year-old girl before 
escaping, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The robbery began about 1:30 a.m. when the men -- wearing ski masks and 
wielding guns -- piled out of a stolen Ford Aerostar van and cut the telephone 
lines outside the home on Shaded Wood Road. They then stormed the house where 
the girl lived with her 12-year-old brother, her parents and grandparents, said 
Lt. Bob Knapp of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Knapp said the robbers ransacked the house for about an hour, stealing several 
pieces of valuable jewelry and loading stereo and other electronic equipment 
into the victims' Dodge Caravan. 
</P>
<P>
 The three men fled in separate cars, taking the victims' Lexus in addition to 
the two vans. After the robbers left, the victims freed themselves and called 
911 from a neighbor's house, Knapp said. 
</P>
<P>
 A patrol sergeant responding to the robbery call spotted all three vehicles in 
the parking lot of a mini-mall at the corner of Lycoming Street and Brea Canyon 
Road about three miles from the residence. 
</P>
<P>
 As the sergeant called for assistance, two assailants fled on foot and the 
Dodge Caravan sped out of the lot and was chased by deputies, Knapp said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies lost the two men in the residential neighborhood behind the 
mini-mall. A shotgun and some jewelry were recovered from the Lexus and the 
Aerostar left behind in the parking lot. 
</P>

 Knapp said deputies chased the Caravan along the Pomona Freeway until the 
driver tried to fake an exit from the freeway near Downtown Los Angeles and 
crashed into the center divider at about 3 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The man jumped out of the Caravan and ran north into the Downtown area. 
Deputies lost the man near the Los Angeles Mall near the Civic Center, Knapp 
said. The search for the man was called off at about 5 a.m.

JUDGE TO RULE ON TRIAL FOR RAPPER; COURTS: LAWYERS FOR SNOOP DOGGY DOGG AND TWO 
OTHER DEFENDANTS ARE SEEKING DISMISSAL OF THE MURDER CHARGES. THEY SAY NEW 
EVIDENCE CALLS CASE INTO DOUBT.

<P>
 A judge said Friday that lawyers for gangsta rapper Snoop Doggy Dogg and two 
other men have raised serious issues in their attempt to have murder charges 
dismissed against their clients and he indicated that he would spend the 
weekend studying their arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Paul G. Flynn will issue a ruling Monday on whether the 
22-year-old rapper, whose real name is Calvin Broadus, his bodyguard and a 
friend will stand trial in the August, 1993, death of Philip Woldermariam, 20. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution contends that the incident was a gang-related drive-by 
shooting. The defense lawyers argued Friday that Broadus' bodyguard, McKinley 
Lee, 23, shot Woldermariam in self-defense at a Westside park after 
Woldermariam reached for a gun. Broadus and the third man, Shawn Abrams, 22, 
are charged with aiding and abetting. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense lawyers told Flynn that when the murder charges were filed, the 
prosecution was acting on the belief that Woldermariam was unarmed. After two 
of Woldermariam's friends told a grand jury last year that they hid 
Woldermariam's gun before police arrived, the prosecution continued to pursue 
the charges, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an opportunity to weed out a case that shouldn't go to trial," 
Abrams' lawyer, Johnnie Cochran, told reporters after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 But Woldermariam's family said they oppose dismissing the charges. His sister, 
Sophia, 22, said she does not know why her brother was shot, but that she 
believes his friends were pressured into making up the gun story to protect 
Broadus' successful career. 
</P>
<P>
 She said her brother, who with the rest of her family came to the United 
States from Ethiopia to escape civil war, was not in a gang, as the defense and 
witnesses have contended. Broadus also denies he is a gang member.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SATICOY; BIOLOGISTS ELATED OVER STEELHEAD FIND IN 
RIVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time in many years, a 20-inch steelhead trout was found in the 
Santa Clara River on its way to spawn upstream, probably in the far reaches of 
the river's purest and coldest tributary in Sespe Creek. 
</P>
<P>
 Elated state biologists said the find Thursday, along with the fact that more 
fish were caught last week, proves there is a viable steelhead population in 
the river, something many in the county have doubted in the last several years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Clara River once supported thousands of steelhead and was one of 
many rivers from Northern Mexico all the way up the Pacific Coast with thriving 
populations of the ocean-going fish. 
</P>
<P>
 But steelhead no longer exist in Northern Mexico, or San Diego or Orange 
counties, and are now limited to small populations in four streams in Southern 
California -- the Santa Clara and the Ventura rivers in Ventura County, Malibu 
Creek in Los Angeles County and the Santa Ynez River in Santa Barbara County. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now they are on the verge of extinction anywhere south of San Luis Obispo 
County," said Dennis McEwan, steelhead specialist with the California 
Department of Fish and Game in Sacramento. "So you can see why we're so elated 
at this news of finding the fish." 
</P>
<P>
 The trout was found Thursday in a trap on the Freeman Diversion dam that spans 
the Santa Clara River at Saticoy. The trap is part of a $2-million fish ladder 
built at the dam to allow steelhead to migrate. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, a dozen small smolts were trapped on their way downstream from 
freshwater to the ocean. Like the salmon, steelhead are born in freshwater. 
They remain in freshwater streams for one to three years before swimming to sea 
for a similar period. As adults, they return to their natal streams to spawn. 
After spawning, they either return to the sea, or die, worn out from the 
upstream battle. 
</P>
<P>
 The find of the steelhead, which is being considered for endangered status 
along the Pacific Coast, also proves that a fish ladder on the dam can work 
"when operated properly," said Dwayne Maxwell, a Fish and Game biologist. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, Maxwell said, water that diverted the fish to the trap was 
coming in too fast, possibly battering the fish. 
</P>
<P>
 But there may have been undetected steelhead in the Santa Clara River since 
the heavy rains of 1991, when the fish counter at the ladder was not operating 
properly, McEwan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the Freeman, which is owned and operated by the United Water 
Conservation District, is working properly, the steelhead should remain in the 
river, McEwan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Freeman, with the ladder and the screens, has got what it needs to 
provide protection for the fish," he said. JOANNA M. MILLER

 A 26-year-old Oxnard man died Friday morning when his car smashed head-on into 
a eucalyptus tree on the Pacific Coast Highway, according to the California 
Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 John A. Montoya died of head injuries after his 1993 Nissan plowed into a tree 
in the road's median at 9:30 a.m., according to CHP officers. He was traveling 
north on the highway, just beyond the Nauman Road exit, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers did not know how fast Montoya was driving or why his car hit the 
tree. 
</P>
<P>
 He was wearing a seat belt but died from the force of the impact, they said.

DISABLED TEACHER TRIES TO BRING OUT THE BEST; SIMI VALLEY: SUSAN JONES WILL BE 
HONORED FOR CLASSROOM EXCELLENCE. HER MISSION, SHE SAYS, IS TO FIND AND TAP 
SOMETHING SPECIAL IN EACH CHILD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDA DAY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a 21-year-old college graduate with an English degree and no teacher 
training, Susan Jones of Simi Valley got all jittery in the moments before she 
faced her first classroom of elementary students. 
</P>
<P>
 But the feeling didn't last. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the end of the day, those 50 kids were mine," recalled Jones, now a 
veteran of more than 20 years. "I think there was a God-given gift there that I 
knew what to do. It was a dream come true, being in that classroom. I'll never 
forget when that bell rang." 
</P>
<P>
 A second-grade teacher at St. Rose of Lima School in Simi Valley for 13 years, 
Jones on Monday will be recognized with a national award for excellence in 
teaching by the National Catholic Educational Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Her students think they know what makes Jones unique. Descriptions by her 
second- graders range from "She makes us laugh," to "She's serious" and "She's 
in a wheelchair." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the greatest compliment: "We've learned almost every single thing in 
second grade," said 8-year-old Nicholas Lyon. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10 years ago, a degenerative nerve condition forced Jones, 48, to shift 
from crutches to a wheelchair. The change may have improved her relationship 
with students by bringing her down to near eye level with the average 
second-grader, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not looking down on them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones makes light of her disability. "Some of the older kids come through here 
and say, 'She's the only teacher we can push around,' " Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 But she recognizes the impact she has on youngsters. "If they draw me, they 
draw the chair, but I think they also realize that wheelchairs and braces have 
a real person inside of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Her condition is painful, but "it's not painful between 8 and 3," Jones said. 
"Who can tune into that when you can tune into 41 kids? I'm too busy to get the 
pain signals." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones has a special rapport with children, St. Rose Principal Patty Pryor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can go to school and learn everything about teaching, but if you don't 
have the gift of reaching children, it's hard to be successful at it," Pryor 
said. "Susan has it. She knows how to get in kids' minds. She's full of love." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones' philosophy is based on the belief that each child has something special 
to offer. Her job is to find it and tap it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to catch them doing the right thing and build on that," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't always easy with 40 or more children in the class, but Jones tries to 
supply as much individualized attention as possible, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try not to let them go home without having their name called for doing 
something positive, something to let them know I know they're here and they're 
important," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the large class size, Jones is successful at making each child feel 
special and excited about learning, said Fran Foulkrod, who has had three 
children in Jones' class and who, along with Pryor, recommended her for the 
award. 
</P>
<P>
 "No problem is too small to give her individual attention," Foulkrod said. 
"She just is so exuberant about teaching that it rubs off on all her students." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones is among the 12 recipients of the 1994 Distinguished Teachers Award from 
the Catholic educators' organization, capturing the honor for the region that 
includes California, Hawaii, Nevada, Utah and the Pacific Territories. She will 
receive the award Monday at a ceremony in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones has mixed feelings about the award because she did not aspire to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't really feel I should be a model for somebody else," she said. "I am 
who I need to be and I know I do a good job with the talent I have." 
</P>
<P>
 One of her talents is the ability to see what is happening in the most remote 
corner of the classroom without even appearing to look. Her commanding voice 
fills the classroom, so when Jones says, "Billy, eyes up here," Billy snaps to 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 As second-grader Ben Abajian put it: "She watches people good. She keeps an 
eye on them." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones agrees that establishing discipline is one of her strengths. Her former 
students do not forget it, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can go out in the schoolyard and look at kids sitting on the tables, and I 
don't have to say anything. They get off the tables," Jones said. "They know I 
mean business." 
</P>
<P>
 If discipline is one cornerstone of her teaching method, love is another, 
Jones said. Even when she is disappointed in students' behavior, they know she 
isn't disappointed in them, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are probably some days they go home and do a lot of complaining about 
me, but that's OK. I go home sometimes and complain a lot about them," she 
said. "I always let them start over the next day." 
</P>
<P>
 The students probably give Jones as much in return as she gives them, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I give to them the sense that they can, and when they're successful, they 
give me back the sense that I can."

DEBATE OVER RESURRECTION SURFACES IN A NEW BOOK; EASTER: BIBLICAL SCHOLAR'S 
NOVEL IS ONE OF SEVERAL RECENT WORKS THAT ATTEMPT TO TEST THE FAITH OF 
CHRISTIANS. MANY CLERGY WELCOME THE CONTROVERSY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY B. STAMMER, TIMES RELIGION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paul L. Maier, author and biblical scholar, recalls that as a boy he always 
wanted to know more than the Sunday school teacher was able to tell him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember years ago asking her what Pontius Pilate was doing on the Monday 
after Easter," he said. "I recall her throwing up her arms in dismay." 
</P>
<P>
 Judging from a growing number of books like Maier's new novel, "A Skeleton in 
God's Closet," more and more people are wondering about Jesus following that 
fateful Good Friday crucifixion. 
</P>
<P>
 The questions seem especially urgent as Christians the world over approach the 
commemoration of the central defining belief of their faith -- the Resurrection 
of Jesus Christ three days after he was crucified on orders from the Roman 
governor Pilate. 
</P>
<P>
 In Maier's fictional account, a team of archeologists working in the Holy Land 
uncover what seems to be the bones of Jesus. The discovery not only shakes the 
Christian world to its foundation but has far-reaching political repercussions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Take away Easter and the bodily Resurrection, and Christianity's doomed," a 
brilliant but devious archeologist, Shannon Jennings, declares in Maier's 
novel, which has become a bestseller in religious bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
 Maier's work, of course, is not the first book -- fiction or otherwise -- to 
test the faith of believers. In 1966, the "Passover Plot" by Hugh Schonfield 
argued that Jesus' death and Resurrection were a fraud and clever conspiracy by 
zealous followers. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Resurrection has been hotly disputed from Day One (or Day Three). 
Even according to Biblical accounts (John 20:25), one of Jesus' own disciples, 
Thomas, doubted the first reports of his master's Resurrection.  
</P>
<P>
 But the debate, with notable exceptions, has more or less been out of earshot 
of rank-and-file churchgoers.  
</P>
<P>
 No longer. The debates are coming out of the closet and off the book presses 
as never before -- and many Christians for the first time are being confronted 
with potentially disturbing, perhaps even faith-shattering, scholarship and 
conjecture. 
</P>
<P>
 Maier's novel fictionalized a crisis of faith when the world was told that 
Jesus' bones had been found.  
</P>
<P>
 "It is a theological thriller to re-examine what you believe about the Easter 
event and re-evaluate the foundations of your faith," said Maier, a professor 
of ancient history at Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo and a member of 
the conservative Lutheran Church, Missouri Synod. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The book's plot, he said, was intended to be constructive -- to point out that 
despite many new archeological findings Christianity's basic foundation remains 
sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly, however, Christian doctrines have been called into question by 
scholarship that has drawn on cultural anthropology, non-canonical sources and 
an understanding of how early Christianity was torn from its Jewish roots and 
reinterpreted -- some say incorrectly -- by Greco-Roman culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of this misunderstanding, it is argued by some, inevitably led to 
Christian dogmas that would have shocked Jesus -- the literal physical 
Resurrection of Jesus, the Holy Trinity and the incarnation -- the idea that 
Jesus as God incarnate was both fully God and fully human. 
</P>
<P>
 As these and other challenges become more widely known, will the Christian 
faith be hobbled as Maier's novel portends? 
</P>
<P>
 Thoughtful Christians on each end of the spectrum, from a biblical literalist 
to another who thinks the Christian Scriptures are best viewed metaphorically, 
don't think so. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Jack Hayford, pastor of the Church on the Way in Van Nuys and a 
nationally recognized Pentecostal leader, dismisses non-orthodox findings as 
the work of a "revisionistic mind-set."  
</P>
<P>
 But suppose, Hayford said, that the long-lost "Q" document -- which New 
Testament scholars believe was a common source for the Gospels of Matthew and 
Luke -- was found. Suppose it reported that Jesus really didn't rise from the 
dead and the story of his miraculous Resurrection was fabricated by his 
followers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it probably wouldn't change anything even if they found that," 
Hayford said. "But they're not going to find that." 
</P>
<P>
 Hayford said he doesn't bother himself, or his congregation, with such 
speculation. "It's really not worth the time to deal with so transient an 
effort at undermining people's faith," he said. "It's just not going to 
succeed. All those battles have been fought already and won by Christian 
apologetics. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other end of the spectrum is John Hick, a professor of the philosophy 
of religion at the University of Birmingham in England whose latest book argues 
for interpreting the Christian Scriptures metaphorically instead of literally. 
</P>
<P>
 In a telephone interview, Hick said many believers have already reached an 
accommodation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really think there's a lot of people in the pews that are much more 
intelligent and much more thoughtful than a lot of pastors give them credit 
for," Hick said. "And although they will sing all the traditional hymns and say 
all the traditional things in the liturgy, a great many of them are conscious 
that this is not to be taken literally." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he said, a fundamentalist reaction to non-traditional views may be 
expected. "There will always be that. It's a question of how large a proportion 
of the Christian movement it is. It's always a minority, but in the (U.S.) in 
particular, it's a very powerful minority." 
</P>
<P>
 When faith confronts speculation there can be convulsive reactions, as was the 
case in 1988 when many Christians, not all of them fundamentalists, were 
offended by Martin Scorsese's "The Last Temptation of Christ," an apocryphal 
motion picture about Jesus, complete with children, two successive wives, 
adultery and old age. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, some pastors believe the controversy can strengthen rather than 
weaken one's faith, among them the Rev. Canon Lewis P. Bohler Jr., for 32 years 
rector of Advent Episcopal Parish in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I myself would ask my people to go through these things very well, and then I 
would give them an expansion. I would say, 'That's a point of view' and say, 
'Here is mine.' I feel that ultimately this (process) will make a better 
something -- a better non-Christian or a better Christian, a better non-Jew or 
a better Jew," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst thing would be to dismiss the claims of scholarship as irrelevant or 
lacking credibility, as he suggested some fundamentalists might try to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the fundamentalists this denial will be just what they need for their 
members. . . . But I'm sure late at night their members must ponder, 'Is it as 
cut and dry as my leaders said?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Since his novel was published, Maier said he has fielded a number of calls 
asking whether he had become an apostate or lost his faith. He hasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 But he added, "I cannot praise the sheltered or untried virtue. I think it's 
important that people see the counter-arguments to Christianity."

LANDLORD CALLS RENTER LAW BIASED; THOUSAND OAKS: OWNER ASKS THE CITY COUNCIL TO 
OVERLOOK VIOLATIONS AND ALLOW HIS TENANTS TO PARK FOUR CARS ON THE PROPERTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY F. POLS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Thousand Oaks landlord is asking the City Council to overlook violations of 
the city's overcrowding ordinance on his property because he says the ordinance 
discriminates against renters. 
</P>
<P>
 Adil Barakat rents a property on Calle Tulipan to an extended family of six 
adults and two children. Last year he asked for and was granted a permit to 
continue to rent to that family, even though their numbers exceed those the 
ordinance allows for the size of the house. 
</P>
<P>
 But the second part of his request, that the family be allowed to keep four 
cars on the property, was rejected by the Planning Commission because neighbors 
complained. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Barakat is appealing that decision to the City Council, saying it is not 
fair to force his tenants to park far from their homes while homeowners in 
Thousand Oaks can park as many cars as they want in their driveways. The 
ordinance places limitations on parking in commercial areas, which includes all 
rental properties. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council will decide whether to issue a permit to Barakat at its 
meeting Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Instituted in 1992 at the urging of Mayor Elois Zeanah to preserve a 
single-family atmosphere in the city's residential areas, the legality of the 
ordinance has frequently come under fire. Some council members question whether 
it would be upheld in court. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that we may have a legal problem here," said Councilman Frank 
Schillo. "To say to one person that they can't park in their driveway and that 
the other guy who lives next door can, just isn't right." 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission changed its initial approval of Barakat's permit after 
neighbors on the street complained about noise and numbers of cars nearby. As 
part of the consideration of Barakat's appeal, a city survey crew studied 
parking and traffic on Calle Tulipan and the surrounding streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The crew counted 68 available street parking spots. At peak usage times, 20 of 
those spots were occupied, 48 were vacant. With that many parking spots 
available, the Barakat family said they didn't see why there was a problem 
approving more street parking for their tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand the concerns of the other residents on the street, but I really 
do think we're being discriminated against," said Barakat's son and business 
partner, Nidal Barakat. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the tenants have been living in the property for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're good tenants," he said. "They take pride in the landscaping." 
</P>
<P>
 Zeanah said the Planning Commission had made concessions to Barakat by 
allowing eight people to live in the house. She said Barakat had not supplied 
the council with any hard evidence that the parking portion of the ordinance 
should be waived for his property. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeanah said she believed the ordinance was not discriminatory and that it was 
directed at rental units because they had been the subject of complaints in the 
past.

MOORPARK TEACHERS AND DISTRICT AGREE ON TENTATIVE CONTRACT; LABOR: IF RATIFIED, 
THE PACT WOULD GIVE UNION MEMBERS A BONUS EQUAL TO 2% OF THEIR PAY FOR THE PAST 
YEAR. 
</P>

<P>
 After nearly two years of negotiations, Moorpark Unified School District 
officials and representatives from the local teachers' union have agreed to a 
tentative contract, union officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The compromise agreement settles an impasse in contract negotiations between 
the two sides that began a year ago when talks broke down. If rank and file 
union members agree to the plan, they will receive a onetime bonus equivalent 
to 2% of their pay for the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 On average, the payment will amount to about $700 per teacher, said Richard 
Gillis, president of the Moorpark Educators Assn., the local teachers' union. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not everybody is going to be happy," Gillis said. "But we all have to face up 
to the realities. This will clear the way for negotiations in June." 
</P>
<P>
 The union has been operating under an old contract that was temporarily 
extended by the district. That extension expires in June. Gillis said the 
current agreement is only an interim solution until a new contract for the next 
three school years is agreed upon. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he hoped the process to reach an agreement on that contract runs 
smoother than during the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the teachers' union had resorted to picketing school board meetings 
and school district offices after negotiations on a contract reached an impasse 
a year ago. Even after a state mediator was brought in to help negotiations, 
the two sides could not reach a compromise until this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, the teachers' union was pushing for a new three-year contract, 
while the district wanted to extend the existing contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't want to have to reopen the whole process and reinvent a whole new 
deal," said Tom Baldwin, a school board member who negotiated with the union. 
</P>
<P>
 Baldwin said the district's finances continue to look grim with a projected 
$600,000 deficit. He said the compromise was a good-faith gesture on both sides 
to clear the slate in preparation for negotiations on a contract to cover the 
next three years. The bonus offered the district's 200 teachers will cost about 
$180,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now we don't know how dark our future finances are," Baldwin said. 
"This will clear the way for the next round of negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
 The union will probably announce its acceptance of the new contract at the 
school board hearing on April 12, union President Gillis said. After that the 
union will submit its proposal for the next round of negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Baldwin said he thought it would take until fall before the two sides could 
formally begin talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Pam Castro, another board member who negotiated with the teachers' union, said 
both sides know that they will have to lower their expectations to reach an 
agreement for the next contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (union) has been wonderful to work with, really," Castro said. "They 
understood the financial situation the district is in, and we truly would love 
to give them additional money -- they deserve it -- but these are tough times. 
We'll see what happens."

 When the rich and famous march alongside the down and out in the Easter 
Walkathon Against Violence from Inglewood to Southwest Los Angeles today, the 
emphasis will be on community renewal. 
</P>
<P>
 The march is sponsored by the 12,000-member West Angeles Church of God in 
Christ, which includes as members many figures from the entertainment and 
sports worlds. Bishop Charles E. Blake, whose Crenshaw Boulevard church is one 
of the fastest-growing Protestant congregations in the country, said the march 
was set for Easter weekend to remind people of the significance of the season 
and "the message of Jesus Christ for community resurrection." 
</P>
<P>
 "If we renounce violence, spark spiritual renewal, and raise the moral and 
ethical mentality of the community," Blake said, "the walk will have served its 
purpose." 
</P>
<P>
 Said the Rev. James M. Thomas, the church's director of community relations: 
"We're walking against violence against women, violence against children, crime 
among teen-agers." 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of marchers are expected to gather at 10:30 a.m. at First Church of 
God, at Crenshaw and 95th Street in Inglewood. Bishop Benjamin Reed of First 
Church will join Blake in leading the march north on Crenshaw to West Angeles' 
parking lot at 30th Street, where a rally will be held from 12:15 to 2:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Calvin Brown, who heads the evangelism outreach ministry of West 
Angeles, organized the event. He has scheduled talks at the rally by government 
officials, including state Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles), and music by the 
West Angeles Mass Choir and the church's Praise and Worship Team. 
</P>
<P>
 Although West Angeles counts among its members such celebrities as Stevie 
Wonder, Denzel Washington, Debbie Allen and Norm Nixon, Ervin (Magic) and 
Cookie Johnson, and Gladys Knight, it embraces the downtrodden equally, Blake 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 On Easter Sunday, as well as every Sunday, Blake will lead five worship 
services: at 7 a.m., 8:30 a.m., 10 a.m., 11:30 a.m. and 7 p.m. For more

DON'T SKIMP ON MILK LABELING; JUST TELL CONSUMERS WHETHER IT'S FROM COWS THAT 
WERE FED BIOTECH HORMONES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dairy cows, with the blessing of the Food and Drug Administration, are 
becoming "supercows." Farmers may inject them with a genetically engineered 
version of a natural growth hormone that prompts a milk production increase of 
up to 20%. The FDA says the milk is indistinguishable from that of untreated 
cows and thus no safety issue exists. Large dairy farmers find the product, 
developed by Monsanto Corp., a boon that will reduce milk prices to consumers 
worldwide. The U.S. biotech industry sees an enormous new market. And fatherly 
former U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop assures us it's perfectly safe. 
</P>
<P>
 But not everyone is happy. One acknowledged side effect of the product, known 
as recombinant bovine somatotropin, is an increase in udder infections, 
requiring more use of antibiotics, which, even if no traces are left in the 
milk, can contribute to overall bacterial drug resistance. In addition, some 
scientists are unwilling to accept the FDA's interpretation of test data on the 
absolute safety of the biotech hormone. 
</P>
<P>
 So consumers should just make their own decisions as to what kind of milk to 
drink, right? Well, that's not easy. Currently, labeling is scarce; indeed, 
milk companies that tried simple labels saying that their milk and cheese come 
from untreated cows find themselves being sued by the growth hormone's 
manufacturer. And the FDA's proposed "guidelines" on labeling are anything but 
helpful. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency invites each state to make its own label laws. And the label 
itself, says the FDA, can't be just, "This milk comes from cows not treated 
with genetically engineered hormones." It has to include disclaimers saying 
there's no detectable difference from untreated milk, that the producer is not 
implying anything about quality or safety, and on and on. This is ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
 While the FDA is still pondering the final guidelines, here's our advice: 
Require a label that's brief and clear to those of us who may lack a Ph.D. in 
biology. A competently done federal model for the label would give legal cover 
to the firms that use it and probably would be accepted by the states. And that 
would reassure milk drinkers.

MENTAL HEALTH AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The article, "Post-Disaster Mental Health Efforts Debated" (March 21), is 
misleading and unnecessarily negative -- in general and in its selective 
reporting. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times rhetorically asks: "Have those multimillion-dollar mental health 
programs really done any good?" We can answer a resounding "Yes!" from the 
thanks that crisis counselors have received from the thousands of people helped 
through three disasters in less than two years. It is a resounding "Yes!" when 
you consider the costs -- in personal suffering -- from long-term emotional 
distress. 
</P>
<P>
 The article demonstrates a lack of understanding about disasters and their 
effect on human emotions. Although people's reactions are individual and vary 
in any disaster, there are four recognized stages: 
</P>
<P>
 "Heroic" phase -- impact to approximately one week after the disaster; 
"honeymoon" phase -- one week to two or three months after the disaster; 
"disillusionment" phase -- two months following and as long as two years 
thereafter; "reconstruction" phase -- for those severely impacted, can last 
several years. 
</P>
<P>
 Project Rebound was created and funded to provide crisis counseling with these 
four recognized stages in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 The kinds of interventions used in the recovery process are dictated by the 
disaster itself. For example, after the fires and civil unrest -- a man-made 
disaster -- Project Rebound instituted programs to assist people in dealing 
with prejudice reduction, intergroup anger, teaching mediation and methods of 
resolving conflicts in nonviolent ways. That these programs took place long 
after the "disaster" did not negate their value to the individuals and the 
community. The interventions and programs provided by Project Rebound for 
firestorm and earthquake survivors are designed to be similarly congruent with 
people's needs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Cross does an admirable job in establishing shelters after disasters. 
In setting up the false comparison between the Red Cross and LACDMH counseling 
services, you neglected to mention that over 100 LACDMH/Project Rebound 
counselors provided emotional support and crisis counseling at designated Red 
Cross shelters.

U.S. RELATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Simon Winchester's article "Demanding to Be Left Alone" (Commentary, March 
22) deserves a reading by every American who wants to know what North Korea is 
about.  
</P>
<P>
 North Korea is not a rogue country and its leaders are not villains. They just 
want to be left alone to live in their own way, if unprovoked. It's unfortunate 
that they are communists but they chose communism because it was then 
considered the most effective and powerful tool available to beat the Japanese. 
They became anti-American because the U.S. helped install a government in South 
Korea dominated by those who had collaborated with Japanese rulers in betrayal 
to their own people. They certainly attacked South Korea in 1950 but they did 
it in an attempt to eradicate those national betrayers from the Seoul 
government and reunify the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The creation of two mutually antagonistic Koreas and by corollary the 
existence of an anti-American North Korea are the byproducts of misconceived 
post-World War II U.S. foreign policy of meddling in the affairs of the Korean 
peninsula. Why not just leave Korean affairs to Koreans themselves so that they 
themselves can somehow find the way to fulfill their long aspiration for 
national reunification? All factors considered, the most likely end result 
would be the guaranteed disappearance of an anti-American communist regime in 
favor of an emergence of a unified, peaceful and friendly Korea.

</P>
<P>
 After admitting to going only where the North Korean government wanted him to 
go, seeing only what they wanted him to see, and hearing only what they wanted 
him to hear, he is still convinced that he knows what the country's 22 million 
inhabitants want -- and, amazingly enough, it turns out to be exactly what Kim 
Il Sung's government wants them to want! And his paean of praise to North 
Korea's police state is truly bizarre, especially after stating at the 
beginning of his article that he "holds no brief for the country or its 
leadership." 
</P>
<P>
 I'm really curious about the man -- does he really think that he's fooling 
anybody?

the press, specializing in the Pacific region, he should know that North Korea 
should not be left alone, abandoned or even glorified as he has done. North 
Korea is the biggest threat in the world. With its heavily disciplined soldiers 
and wide array of war machines, along with nuclear capabilities, it could start 
the spark that ignites the whole of eastern Asia.  
</P>
<P>
 I am Korean, but too young to have witnessed firsthand the turbulent events of 
the Korean War. I know deep inside my heart that one day the walls of the two 
Koreas will come tumbling down. I know that some day many of the families that 
were separated because of the war will be reunited. There is too much cost and 
too many tears for North Korea to be left alone.

THE COURAGE OF HIS COMPROMISE; RABIN DEMONSTRATES COMMITMENT TO PEACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What was Baruch Goldstein, the murderer of 30 Palestinians in a Hebron mosque, 
trying to kill? Was his target solely those Palestinians? 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps no one ever will know what compelled him to this atrocity. But it is 
possible to imagine that Goldstein also had in mind Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhak Rabin and the "Declaration of Principles" that Rabin signed last 
September with Yasser Arafat, head of the Palestinian Liberation Organization. 
The Israeli right wing has vilified Rabin -- a war hero and a man who enjoys a 
unique level of public trust in his country -- as a traitor because of that 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 All that was necessary to sabotage the agreement, many on both sides believed, 
was for Israel to miss the April 13 target date for the withdrawal of its 
troops from the Gaza Strip. If that first, visible step could be halted, then 
the entire political transformation intended to follow it could be sabotaged 
and Rabin could be brought down. 
</P>
<P>
 If that in fact was what was on Goldstein's mind, then there was indeed method 
in his madness. This is why so many Israeli leaders have refused to 
characterize him as an isolated crazy. If his massacre did not have the prior 
approval and sponsorship of Jewish extremists in Israel, it clearly had their 
posterior endorsement. A pilgrimage to his grave on Thursday by at least 10,000 
Jewish militants has made that grimly clear. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldstein's gambit -- their gambit -- almost worked. The mosque rampage 
touched off horrendous violence in the streets of Gaza, a mini- intifada with 
foreseeable answering violence by the Israeli army. It looked for a week or two 
as if Goldstein's act indeed had blasted the April 13 withdrawal date off the 
Israeli-Palestinian peace calendar. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was not the case. Peace talks suspended after the Feb. 25 attack have 
been resumed. A marathon effort by the negotiators is being matched by a 
logistic prodigy on the part of the Israeli army, which will have left Gaza by 
April 13. Israel has made its apology for the mosque murders in the most 
painful and convincing way possible, by acknowledging and accepting a U.N. 
resolution of condemnation. Steps are rapidly being taken toward organizing a 
Palestinian police force for newly autonomous Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the most important symbolic step of all, Israel has consented to the 
presence of international observers in Hebron, where Goldstein's attack took 
place. The presence of international observers often suggests that the affairs 
of more than one nation are concerned. By strong implication, this move 
underscores that the Palestinians' interests are true national interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldstein has lost. Rabin has won. And under Rabin's leadership, Israel is 
staying the course to the only kind of victory that can last: a victory built 
on peace.

MURDER TRIALS FOR JUVENILES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In his March 11 column "A Legislative Con Job on Juvenile Crime," Ron Harris 
fails to understand why legislators are introducing bills to lengthen the jail 
time served by violent juveniles. Instead, he simply indicts all legislators 
who introduce such legislation as poll watchers who subordinate policy to 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris takes issue with my bill, AB 136, which gives judges the discretion to 
try 14- and 15-year-olds accused of murder as adults. The bill doesn't mandate 
adult trial for juveniles, it simply says judges can determine whether or not 
an accused murderer should serve seven years as a juvenile or 16 years as an 
adult -- on a case by case basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris claims I introduced AB 136 for political reasons since crime is a 
popular issue. If he was interested in being accurate, Harris would have told 
readers that I introduced the bill on Jan. 13, 1993, well before crime became 
the "hot" issue. I did so following the senseless and brutal killing of an 
8-year-old San Jose boy, Melvin Ancheta, by a 15-year, 11-month-old male. The 
15-year-old repeatedly stabbed Melvin and nearly decapitated him with a meat 
cleaver. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't want this 15-year-old out of jail at age 22, which is possible under 
current law. Unfortunately, it's too late to keep this 15-year-old in jail for 
a long term, but I certainly don't want other similar cold-blooded murderers 
released after seven years. Under Harris' blanket call for prevention programs 
in all circumstances, let us not forget the population about whom he is talking 
-- violent murderers, usually with an extensive criminal record, who could not 
be helped through local prevention efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 We are talking about convicted murderers. Anyone convicted of first- or 
second-degree murder is a very serious threat to society. To best provide for 
public safety, these individuals need the longer jail terms available through 
adult courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Harris is content to blame society for the barbaric actions of 
murderers, but I'm not. We should trust judges to make the right decisions on 
whether or not seven years is enough time served by sophisticated murderers.

ARKANSAS WATCH; THE REAL VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The players out on the basketball court today weren't even born in 1957. Some 
of their parents may have barely been born. Today in Arkansas, nobody cares 
about what happened in 1957; all they are thinking about is the University of 
Arkansas Razorbacks' big game in the semifinal of the National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. championship tournament. Today, nobody cares that many of the 
Razorbacks are African American. Today, nobody cares that the team's popular 
coach, Nolan Richardson, is also the team's first black coach. 
</P>
<P>
 But before Arkansas was known as the home of the Razorbacks, and not 
incidentally, of the 42nd President of the United States, it was known as the 
place where school integration was vehemently resisted. It was the place Gov. 
Orval Faubus ordered the National Guard in to prevent nine black students from 
enrolling in previously all-white Central High School in Little Rock. It was 
the place where angry white mobs that attacked blacks and broke school windows 
were controlled only by the presence of Army troops. 
</P>
<P>
 That was 37 years ago, and to this relatively young nation, that's a very long 
time. But what happened back then still matters. It won't matter to the 
cheering fans today, watching Arkansas play Arizona. But without the showdown 
in Little Rock in 1957, and the preceding landmark Brown vs. Board of Education 
case that outlawed "separate but equal" schooling for blacks, Richardson could 
not have been the coach that took Arkansas to the Final Four. But he is -- and 
there's no little symbolism in that.

CAN WOMEN BE SAINTS IN FRANCE?; A PUSH TO ENTER MARIE CURIE, RADIOACTIVITY 
CO-DISCOVERER, IN THE PANTHEON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When it comes to language, food and cultural patrimony, few nationalities are 
more inward-looking and resistant to change than the French. So it is 
unsurprising that in the two centuries since the Pantheon in Paris was 
dedicated during the French Revolution "Aux Grand Hommes la Patrie 
reconnaissante," it has served as the mausoleum only for those great men, men 
to whom the fatherland was grateful. There, in the imposing former church on 
the Left Bank, one finds the remains of France's great men of arts, letters and 
science -- among them Francois Voltaire, Jean Jacques Rousseau, Victor Hugo, 
Emile Zola. Burial there is the French secular equivalent of sainthood. But not 
for women, who did not even enjoy the right to vote until after World War II, 
in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
 Now some of France's leading women have prevailed on President Francois 
Mitterrand to mend this historical error in political correctness and merit. He 
has agreed to reinter France's greatest latter-day scientist, Marie Curie, the 
co-discoverer of radioactivity, in the Pantheon. This comes 83 years after the 
French Academy of Sciences refused to admit her. No matter that she had just 
won her second Nobel Prize that year, 1911. "Let in anyone, except women," said 
the then-guardians of French intellectual patrimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Curie, who died in 1934, is expected to be the first of a number of women 
interred in the Pantheon. She was an obvious first choice, not only because of 
her towering achievements but because her granddaughter, Helene Langevin 
Joliot-Curie, is both a prominent scientist and a political supporter of 
Mitterrand. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the Polish-born Curie will not be the first woman buried in the 
Pantheon, only the first on her own merits. The famed chemist Marcellin 
Bertholet, who died in 1907, insisted in his will that his wife be buried 
beside him. Now the question is whether the remains of Marie Curie's 
collaborator and husband, Pierre Curie, will join hers in the Pantheon. How 
delicious the irony if it takes a woman to bring a lesser male scientist like 
Pierre Curie into the Pantheon. He won only one Nobel Prize.

HEALTH CARE REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The Times editorial of March 17 on health care reform was right on 
target.Certainly President Clinton needs to vigorously sell health care reform. 
However, as citizens we need to help. 
</P>
<P>
 We can do this by first educating ourselves on the issues and then speaking 
out clearly on the changes we want to our legislators whether by letter, 
telephone, fax or in person. It is imperative that we take the responsibility 
for communicating our ideas to those who represent us. And let us not wait for 
the "other guy" to do it! 
</P>
<P>
 Health care reform is so important it cannot and must not be a "Big Flop." 
Speak out now.

 AROUND THE MAJOR LEAGUES 
</P>
<P>
 The Cleveland Indians on Friday trimmed their roster to one over the opening 
day limit, designating outfielder Ruben Amaro for assignment, optioning 
left-hander Brian Barnes to the minors and adding reliever Steve Farr to the 
25-man roster. 
</P>
<P>
 Amaro, acquired from Philadelphia last November for Heathcliff Slocumb, hit 
.291 in 101 games for the Phillies' Triple-A Scranton- Wilkes- Barre team. In 
25 games in the majors, he hit .333. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes, who was 2-6 with a 4.41 ERA and three saves in 52 games for Montreal 
last year, was acquired in a December trade that sent Randy Milligan to the 
Expos. Barnes was sent to Triple-A Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 San Diego Padre pitcher Doug Brocail is scheduled to undergo arthroscopic 
surgery Monday to remove a bone spur from his right elbow, and is expected to 
miss the first two months of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Brocail failed to win a spot in the rotation and was scheduled to work out of 
the bullpen. He was 4-13 with a 4.56 ERA in 24 starts for the Padres last year 
after being promoted from Triple-A Las Vegas.

 Facing another money-losing year, Oakland Athletics are seeking stadium lease 
concessions and, failing that, might invoke a clause that could lead to the 
sale and possible move of the club. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have sat down with Coliseum, city and county officials to discuss our 
financial situation and told them: "This can't continue. Not under this 
ownership,' " A's President Sandy Alderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Team owner Walter Haas Jr. does not want to sell or move the team but cannot 
keep absorbing financial losses, Alderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Haas reportedly has discussed invoking a lease clause that would give the city 
six months to find a local buyer at a price set by Haas. 
</P>
<P>
 If a purchaser wasn't found within that time frame, Haas "could sell, keep the 
team in Oakland, move it. There are a whole host of options," Alderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The A's lost $3 million in 1993 and they project up to a $10-million loss in 
1994. The team has turned a profit only three times in the last 13 years.

THE TIMES POLL; MOST IN STATE FEEL FREE OF VIOLENCE ON JOB, POLL SAYS; CRIME: 
DESPITE RECENT ATTACKS, MOST FEEL SAFER IN WORKPLACE THAN IN OWN NEIGHBORHOOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite recent outbreaks of bloody violence in the workplace that have drawn 
widespread attention, more than four out of every five Californians generally 
feel safe on the job, according to a Los Angeles Times Poll. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the poll shows that slightly more Californians feel safe at work 
than they do in their own neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll, taken between March 26 and March 29, found that 83% of the employed 
Californians surveyed feel either very or somewhat safe at their work site or 
at the places they must visit while on the job. Another 11% consider their work 
situations "somewhat unsafe," while 5% say they are "very unsafe" on the job 
and 1% say they are "not sure." 
</P>
<P>
 The trend in the figures was consistent among different demographic groups: 
Men as well as women, and Anglos as well as blacks and Latinos, all reported 
generally feeling safe in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Californians expressed significant concerns about crime. Susan Pinkus, 
assistant director of the Times Poll, explained that people generally feel safe 
when they look at their own workplaces and neighborhoods. "But when they look 
at the bigger picture, and they look at the (entire) community, they feel 
there's a problem," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, 75% of all Californians polled -- including people both in and 
outside the labor force -- feel very or somewhat safe in their own 
neighborhoods, but 55% believe that people living in their communities face a 
serious crime problem. In addition, crime was rated nearly neck-in-neck with 
the economy as the most important problem currently facing the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, only 22% of employed Californians responded that there is no type of 
crime that they fear at work. 
</P>
<P>
 The most commonly cited type of crime feared at work was robbery, with 27% of 
employed Californians rating it as a concern on the job. Next came assault, at 
18%, and random violence, at 16%. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 2% said they feared being murdered at work. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, many experts consider workplace homicide a growing problem. Last 
fall, the U.S. Labor Department issued its first major study on the topic and 
reported that homicides accounted for 1,004 work-related deaths in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the report said homicide was by far the leading cause of 
on-the-job fatalities for women and, including men and women, it ranked a close 
second to highway accidents as the most deadly workplace hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 The responses to the Times Poll's workplace crime questions came from 997 
employed Californians. The margin of sampling error among that group is plus or 
minus four percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
 The employed people polled by The Times were part of an overall survey sample 
of 1,608 Californians. For the full sample, the margin of error is plus or 
minus three percentage points.

TURMOIL FOR INVESTORS; BONDS TUMBLE; STOCK MARKET BRACES FOR A HECTIC MONDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN WEBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 New evidence that a powerful economic expansion is underway sent bond prices 
tumbling Friday and heightened fears that the stock market decline might 
accelerate next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Monthly employment figures released Friday were far stronger than expected, 
prompting renewed concern about inflation. That in turn caused a dramatic 
sell-off in the bond market, with 30-year U.S. Treasury bond prices tumbling as 
much as $20 per $1,000 bond and yields climbing as high as 7.28% before closing 
at 7.26%. 
</P>
<P>
 Stock exchanges were closed for Good Friday, forestalling immediate reaction 
to the news by equity investors. In light currency trading, the dollar rose 
against all the major world currencies on the economy's strength, closing at 
103.60 yen in New York, up from 102.60 late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 But stocks were pummeled all week in very heavy trading, and the job figures 
combined with the bond market reaction could put new downward pressure on share 
prices when trading resumes Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, brokerage houses and mutual fund companies were bracing for a 
tumultuous day Monday. Mutual fund leader Fidelity Investments, for example, 
said it had additional staff on hand over the last week and will keep them in 
place to cope with a possible flood of activity Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wall Street was very late to recognize the strength of the economy," said 
David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services in Chicago. "It will 
be a bad Monday." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average lost 138 points during the week, though it 
closed up 9 Thursday after a roller coaster day that saw the market down 65 
points in early trading. With the Federal Reserve expected to push interest 
rates up once again in response to the strong economic news, most market 
watchers expect further declines. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Hale and other analysts cautioned that Friday's bond market drop may 
have been an overreaction. Trading was very light as a result of the holiday; 
bond markets are typically closed on Good Friday, but with the market tumult, 
many dealers opened for an abbreviated trading day that ended at 11:00 a.m. in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (job) figures aren't really as strong as they look on the surface, so 
maybe after some thought over the weekend the markets might not react quite as 
strongly," said Lyle Gramley, a former Federal Reserve Board governor and now 
consulting economist for the Mortgage Bankers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Interest rates are not the only thing putting pressure on stock prices. Hale 
noted that politics are in flux in nearly all the major industrial countries -- 
not to mention trouble spots like Mexico and Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, many large investment pools known as hedge funds have sustained 
enormous losses in bond trading and are being forced to liquidate holdings, 
further depressing prices. 
</P>
<P>
 There remains little consensus, however, on whether the current stock slide is 
merely a "correction" that will soon end or the beginning of a long bear 
market. And many traders are waiting anxiously to see whether the new mutual 
fund customers who have been drawn to a bullish stock market over the past year 
will now head for the exits. Selected Interest Rates: Averages of daily rates 
ended Thursday, in percent:Corporate AAA bonds 7.61%, 90-day CDs 3.80%, 3-month 
Treasury bills 3.50%, Bank prime rate, 6.25%, Municipal bonds 5.92%, Federal 
funds rate 3.49%, Discount rate 3.00% Source: Federal Reserve Board

COSTA MESA'S ICN REPORTS $11.5-MILLION LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc. reported a loss of $11.5 million for 1993 and blamed 
some of its shortfall on costs from a yearlong proxy battle with dissident 
investor Rafi M. Khan over control of the company. 
</P>
<P>
 The drug conglomerate, based in Costa Mesa, said in a news release that it 
spent $7.6 million on legal costs during 1993 and $2.6 million on research and 
development.That put its annual loss at 57 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
 The company released its year-end results on Friday, when the stock market was 
closed for Good Friday and the company's own operations were shut down. 
Officials were not available to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 For 1992, the company lost $64.2 million, or $4.67 a share. The numbers are 
not comparable to those for last year, though, because they include results for 
a subsidiary that now reports earnings and revenue separately. 
</P>
<P>
 ICN, which had 1993 sales of $62.6 million, owns substantial stakes in three 
Costa Mesa-based subsidiaries: SPI Pharmaceuticals Inc., ICN Biomedicals Inc. 
and Viratek Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 SPI reported that earnings of its combined operations, excluding those in 
Yugoslavia, rose to $21 million, double those of 1992. These gains reflected an 
increases in sales, mostly attributable to SPI's Mexican unit, where sales were 
up 19% from 1992, the company said, though it did not release the amount of 
those sales. The increase, the company said, was largely because of the 
continued growth of SPI's antiviral drug Virazole. 
</P>
<P>
 SPI said its Yugoslav venture, ICN Galenika, a drug manufacturer based in 
Belgrade, broke even for the year. 
</P>
<P>
 In its news release, the parent company did not state earnings or revenue 
figures for ICN Biomedicals Inc. or Viratek, ICN's drug development unit.

STATE SAYS QUAKE CO-PAYMENTS ILLEGAL; DAMAGE: WARNING ISSUED AFTER HOMEOWNERS 
SAY THEY HAVE TO HAVE MORTGAGE LENDERS SIGN OFF ON THEIR CHECKS. 
</P>

 Responding to homeowner complaints, state insurance regulators Friday said 
they would move against insurers who continue to name mortgage lenders as 
co-payees in earthquake claim payments. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least one major insurance company -- Farmers Insurance Group -- said it 
has received few complaints and will continue to name lenders as co-payees. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Department of Insurance said it has received scores of complaints 
from homeowners whose lenders have been named co-payees on insurance claim 
payments related to January's Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Many homeowners have faced delays in rebuilding as they seek their mortgage 
lender's signature on the two-party claim checks sent out by insurance 
companies, the department said. In one homeowner's case, the mortgage lender 
was insolvent, and another resident's lender threatened to keep the insurance 
payment to pay off the mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some homeowners who've started construction now find they can't get their 
hands on the money," said Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi. "This is 
outrageous." 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi said lenders have no right to be named co-payees since earthquake 
insurance is purchased voluntarily to protect the homeowner's interest in the 
property. As a result, the department plans to issue a bulletin to all 
insurance companies by April 11 to advise them that such co-payments are 
illegal and subject to sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance companies are concerned that they might end up making two payments 
-- one to the lender as well as the policyholder -- if, for example, the 
homeowner runs off with the claim payment. But Garamendi said those concerns 
would be addressed in the state's bulletin.

AMERICAN SAVINGS SELLS CREDIT-CARD PORTFOLIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 American Savings Bank said Friday that it has sold its $140-million 
credit-card portfolio to GE Capital Consumer Card Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank was one of the few savings institutions that still maintained its own 
credit-card business. Great Western Bank and Home Savings of America also 
recently sold their portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although the credit-card business has been profitable for us, the size of our 
portfolio has been declining under steady competition from larger institutions 
able to offer incentives and discounts we were not able to take advantage of," 
said Joe Rookard, spokesman for American Savings.

 Three Popular Antibiotics Recalled: Eli Lilly & Co. recalled 4 million bottles 
of Ceclor, Lorabid and Keflex after small plastic caps were found in four 
bottles of medicine.Anyone taking the drugs should immediately stop and call 
their doctor, the Food and Drug Administration said. The Indianapolis-based 
drug maker recalled the products after four patients discovered plastic caps 
slightly smaller than a pen top in bottles of the medicine. One person choked 
on a cap but wasn't seriously injured, said FDA spokesman Don McLearn. Anyone 
who has found an object in the antibiotics was asked to call Eli Lilly at (800) 
545-5927.

 30-Year Fixed-Rate Mortgages Rise: The rate averaged 8.04% this week, up from 
7.8% last week, and the highest in nearly 15 months.The figure is from a 
national survey released by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. This week's 
level is the highest since mortgages averaged 8.04% during the week ended Jan. 
15, 1993. It is more than 1 1/4 percentage points above the 25-year low of 
6.74% last October. On mortgages with annual adjustments, lenders were asking 
an average initial rate of 4.65%, up from 4.60% last week. Fifteen-year 
mortgages, a popular option for those refinancing mortgages, averaged 7.55% 
this week, up from 7.30% a week earlier. The rates do not include add-on fees 
known as points.

 Woolworth Suppliers Told to Wait: Several retail credit and factoring 
companies have told suppliers to hold off on shipments to Woolworth Corp. until 
the retailer provides more information about an internal investigation into 
alleged accounting irregularities.Factoring companies guarantee manufacturers 
will be paid for shipments to retailers. Retail credit companies advise 
factoring companies and suppliers about the credit worthiness of retailers. The 
companies said they are concerned that a pending restatement of Woolworth's 
past earnings could adversely affect the company's ability to pay suppliers. 
The New York-based operator of specialty and general merchandise store chains 
said Wednesday it will restate figures for its last fiscal year, which ended 
Jan. 29.

 Saudia's Decision Expected on U.S. Jets: Saudi Arabia's national carrier has 
set May 1 as a target date for deciding which planes to buy from from McDonnell 
Douglas Corp. and Boeing Co. in a deal worth more than $6 billion, industry 
sources said.Representatives of the two U.S. aircraft giants have been in 
Jeddah for the past two weeks, separately discussing with the government its 
requirements, delivery schedules, financing and related matters. Saudi Arabia 
appears interested in the wide-body MD-11, which is made in Long Beach, while 
Boeing is offering 767s and 777s. The two firms are also in the running in the 
shorter-range class with Boeing's 737 and McDonnell Douglas' twin-engine MD-90.

 Teledyne Ryan Is Fined: Teledyne Ryan Aeronautical Inc. has agreed to pay a 
$500,000 fine to federal officials, the largest in history for releasing toxic 
materials into San Diego's sewers.The aerospace firm will pay the fine to the 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for discharging waste water with excessive 
amounts of chromium into city sewers between July, 1988, and March, 1991. The 
discharges violated the federal Clean Water Act. Teledyne said it agreed to pay 
the fine to avoid a costly trial, but it disagrees with the EPA's analysis of 
its waste water. The EPA said the company is now complying with federal law.

 Allstate Settles Coverage Denial Claim: Allstate Life Insurance Co. paid a 
$125,000 fine to settle charges it unfairly denied coverage to an individual 
who wanted an unrelated person to be a policy beneficiary, the Department of 
Insurance announced. Department spokesman Bill Schulz said the settlement was 
the first under a 1990 state law allowing policyholders to name whomever they 
please to be a life insurance beneficiary. He said the fine is one of the 10 
biggest ever levied by the department.

 GTE California Seeks OK for Rate Reduction: The GTE Corp. unit submitted its 
annual shareable earnings filing with the California Public Utilities 
Commission, asking it to approve a $7.7-million revenue and rate reduction.The 
Thousand Oaks-based company said that if approved, the refunds would be passed 
along as a 3.35% credit on customers' bills for local and toll services. The 
reduction would amount to a saving of about $1 monthly for residential 
customers, GTE said. The refunds, reflecting GTE's 1993 earnings, would be made 
in August and September. GTE California provides local voice, data and video 
services and regional toll calling for more than 3.1 million customers.

CULVER CITY FINDS A WAY TO HELP QUAKE VICTIMS; ASSISTANCE: SMALL SUMS ARE 
DIVERTED FROM REDEVELOPMENT PROJECTS AS GRANTS TO BUSINESSES. 
</P>

 Werner Moeller has spent 27 years upholstering furniture. Now that he's trying 
to stitch his business back together after the earthquake, Moeller is getting 
help from an unexpected source: Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
 As governmental budget shortfalls butt up against earthquake debris, nearly 
everyone agrees that small businesses need a financial boost. But few entities 
can afford to fill in the holes in the Small Business Administration's 
disaster-loan safety net. 
</P>
<P>
 Culver City has found an unusual way to provide grants -- not loans -- to 
businesses, by redirecting money slated for city redevelopment projects, said 
Susan Berg, the city's redevelopment project manager. 
</P>
<P>
 The grants are small -- up to $2,500 to a business with 100 or fewer employees 
-- and are intended to reimburse business owners after repairs are made. Culver 
City also is giving $2,000 grants to owners of homes damaged by the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purpose of our program is to get a small amount of money out to small 
business, so people can get back in business and function," Berg said. "So far, 
it's worked fairly well." 
</P>
<P>
 The department has sent out 26 checks so far, and has 39 grant applications 
pending. Moeller is hoping to get a check to cover about $2,100 he spent to 
replace glass and fix ceiling damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city of Culver City is taking care of us," Moeller said. "Then maybe we 
can get on with our lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Another grant program, administered by Operation Hope Los Angeles, aids small 
and minority-owned businesses and nonprofit organizations. Grants of equipment 
from major corporations have been made to more than 37 businesses and 
nonprofits. They runfrom $2,500 to $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
 For businesses with facade damage from the earthquake, Burbank is making 
one-year, interest-free loans of up to $2,500 each, using Department of Housing 
and Urban Development community block grant funds. The loans will be forgiven 
if businesses are turned down for SBA loans, said Steve Somers, a project 
manager for the Burbank Community Development Department. As part of the 
program, Burbank is also providing free facade redesigning service. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is to get the businesses back so that they look like they're in 
business," Somers said. Simi Valley is proposing a small loan program similar 
to Burbank's. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, the U.S. Commerce Department is working on loan programs to fill 
some of the gaps left by the SBA. And the California Trade & Commerce Agency 
has developed a guarantee program for one-year bridge loans to tide companies 
over until their SBA checks arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 The state program provides loan guarantees for 95% of the loan amount. The 
program has accepted 118 applications and backed 12 loans totaling $1.2 
million, said spokesman Mike Marando. 
</P>
<P>
 The bridge loans are issued by local lenders at prime rate with no fees, he 
said.

<P>
 Gualtiero Negrini is a stubborn man with a dauntless mission. And he thinks 
pretty big. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles knows him best, perhaps, as the mellifluous mock-tenorissimo who 
did the wicked Pavarotti imitation before meeting his cruel fate in Andrew 
Lloyd Webber's "Phantom." For Negrini, however, art means more than 
musical-comedy spoofery. Now he's putting his entrepreneurial energy and, no 
doubt, his money where his mouth used to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, he formed an organization to further some lofty personal goals: 
The Opera Orchestra of Los Angeles. As he bade a lingering farewell to the 
presweetened music of the night, he embarked on a series of concert 
performances intended to serve the lyric muse without the benefit -- or 
distraction -- of scenery and costumes. The erstwhile vocal pirate would 
forsake the high Cs in favor of podium and baton. 
</P>
<P>
 His debut outing, a rough and unready approximation of Verdi's rarely 
attempted "Attila" at an empty Wilshire-Ebell Theatre, proved most memorable 
for the refreshments sold at intermission. The second effort, involving 
Tchaikovsky's "Yevgeny Onegin," was promptly, perhaps wisely, canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 Many observers thought Negrini and his orchestra had become phantoms of the 
opera themselves. But no. Hope springs internal. The would-be maestro was 
emphatically back in action on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The locale this time was the relatively glamorous Pasadena Civic Auditorium, 
which can accommodate nearly 3,000 (it happened to accommodate a lot less on 
this possibly over-ambitious occasion). The vehicle this time was nothing 
remotely obscure but Puccini's beloved "Turandot." And, in place of the 
semi-amateurs who had disfigured innocent Verdi, the uneven cast this time was 
headed by a pair of singers who at least could boast major-league credentials. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was not a "Turandot" to treasure forever. Much of the time, 
however, it was an honorable facsimile of sprawling, vital, complex 
masterpiece. 
</P>
<P>
 The best news emanated from the chorus, an entity that functions as a primary 
force in Puccini's exotic scheme of things. The vocal ensemble was identified 
in the laughably inadequate program slip merely as "Opera Orchestra Chorus." No 
trainer was named. But the hundred singers assembled on bleachers upstage made 
a mighty, poised, plangent, flexible, well-meshed noise, propelling the 
invisible drama forward at every opportunity, producing a nice resonant hush 
for the mysterious passages and rising with zeal to the great, whomping 
climaxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The orchestra, though somewhat less lavishly endowed, mustered some welcome 
flash and fire, too. Positioned at the front of the stage, the players 
certainly did not sound like the ill-prepared pick-up group we so often 
encounter at events like this. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be an exaggeration to claim that Negrini conducted with maximum 
concern for dynamic finesse; he often allowed the instruments to overpower the 
voices all too nearby. It would be less than realistic to claim that he devoted 
a lot of attention to defining expressive nuances. He did keep things moving at 
reasonable paces, however, and he showed a firm grasp of the grand extrovert 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 The brief but cruelly exposed title role, with its high tessitura and almost 
constant demand for fervor without stress, was entrusted to Ghena Dimitrova, a 
veteran of many "Turandot" wars. Although she chose to omit "Del primo pianto," 
the Bulgarian diva still commands the right equipment for the heroic challenge. 
She understands the cool, assertive style, yet she won sympathy with some 
unexpected flights of gentle introspection. At this point in her distinguished 
career, however, freshness and steadiness of tone have become sometime things. 
</P>
<P>
 Giuliano Ciannella, a former Carlo Bergonzi pupil who did utility service at 
the Met in the early 1980s, partnered her as an ardent, sympathetic, 
light-toned Calaf who succumbed to inevitable strain under pressure at top 
range. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the cast operated on lower aesthetic levels. An Armenian soprano 
named Rima Karapetian sounded pretty but fluttery and jittery as a Liu who 
either couldn't or wouldn't float the wonted pianissimo phrases. Mario Storace 
sounded weak and woolly as old Timur. In the Ping-Pang-Pong trios, Hisato 
Masuyama, Agostino Castagnola and Chris Campbell sounded as if they still 
belonged in an opera workshop. 
</P>
<P>
 The incidental children's refrains were deftly chirped by the Pasadena Boy's 
Choir. 
</P>
<P>
 Next? 
</P>
<P>
 * "Turandot," performed in concert form by the Opera Orchestra of Los Angeles

 Inside Stage 8 at the Paramount Pictures lot this week, cast members from 
"Star Trek: The Next Generation," caked with makeup to age them 25 years, 
filmed the finale of their enormously successful syndicated TV series, which 
ceased production Friday after seven seasons and 177 episodes. 
</P>
<P>
 When long-running TV shows wind down, there's generally a sense of sadness and 
finality looming over the set during the final week of filming. But that wasn't 
the case here. In the futuristic world of "Star Trek," where old starship 
captains never die, the trek is truly a continuing mission with no end in 
sight. 
</P>
<P>
 Next door on Stage 7, original "Star Trek" hero William Shatner was decked out 
once again as the swashbuckling Capt. James T. Kirk for the start of the 
seventh "Star Trek" motion picture. Over on Stage 4, cast members from "Star 
Trek: Deep Space Nine" were completing filming on the second season of their 
syndicated TV spinoff. 
</P>
<P>
 And inside Paramount offices, writers and producers were in meetings about 
"Star Trek: Voyager," a new TV series that will be the building block for a 
fifth broadcast network Paramount plans to launch next January. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's called the franchise here at Paramount," Marina Sirtis said with a wry 
smile. She plays Counselor Deanna Troi on "Next Generation." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than brood over the end of a series, the tight group of "Next 
Generation" players were on set having fun, as usual. They simply didn't have 
time to feel too badly. After a short break next week, they will join "Star 
Trek" originals Shatner, James Doohan (Scotty) and Walter Koenig (Chekov) in 
shooting the feature film "Star Trek: Generations." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the script, the 23rd Century's Capt. Kirk and the 24th Century's Capt. 
Jean-Luc Picard, played by Patrick Stewart, meet in a time nexus after an 
artful scientist -- in his quest to return to a euphoric plane of space he 
discovered -- sends the universe spinning into chaos. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't had a chance to be nostalgic, because the hours have been very 
long," said Gates McFadden, who plays Dr. Beverly Crusher. "It's been an 
arduous last episode, and then we have the movie. So the cast members have been 
shuffling back and forth doing costume fittings and tests." 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount executives hope the Thanksgiving release of "Star Trek: 
Generations," budgeted at $25 million, will turn the "Next Generation" cast 
members from TV stars into bankable movie stars for a new line of feature 
films. Then they will use "Voyager" to fill the black hole left on TV by "Next 
Generation," the highest-rated one-hour program in syndication. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time to launch the motion picture franchise," explained Tom Mazza, 
senior vice president of network programming for Paramount. "The 'Next 
Generation' television series has been a huge success. We can build off the 
television success." 
</P>
<P>
 The late Gene Roddenberry's original "Star Trek" lasted only three years on 
NBC before it was canceled in 1969 due to poor ratings. The cast members were 
resurrected in 1979 for what became a string of movies that have grossed nearly 
$500 million domestically at the box office. Now the original cast has aged, 
and the next generation must take over. 
</P>
<P>
 "One reason this is a bittersweet ending to the 'Next Generation' is because 
nobody's really going away," said Rick Berman, executive producer of all three 
"Star Trek" spinoffs and producer of the new movie. "As far as 'Next 
Generation' is concerned, we are about to begin a motion picture, and hopefully 
we are going to do more. I don't think Paramount is looking at this as a 
sequel. This is not 'Star Trek VII.' This is the first movie for the 'Next 
Generation.' " 
</P>
<P>
 This will not be the first time Paramount risks "Next Generation" for 
corporate gain. When the studio launched the show in 1987, the networks had all 
but closed shop on expensive, hourlong series and weren't giving much of an 
on-air chance to the ones they did order. Paramount turned down two network 
offers for "Next Generation" and instead sold it to an independent lineup of TV 
stations, proving that a lavish series with high production values could thrive 
in first-run syndication. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Star Trek: The Next Generation' helped put a lot of out-of-work people in 
the hour-TV business back to work, because it helped spawn an industry," said 
Keith Samples, president of Rysher Entertainment. He credits "Next Generation" 
for the growth of his company, which syndicates "RoboCop," "Highlander," 
"Thunder in Paradise" and the upcoming "Lonesome Dove" series. " 'Star Trek' 
was the first one-hour show in syndication, and now there are over 20 of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount executives are currently banding together most of the TV stations 
they have fostered relationships with to form a fifth broadcast network -- and 
the cornerstone of the effort will be "Voyager." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all pretty clever. It's a clever time to shut down the 'Next Generation' 
and franchise another generation of characters," said Joel Engel, author of the 
biography "Gene Roddenberry: The Myth and the Man Behind Star Trek." "Because 
the people never really die. There are no dead 'Star Trek' captains. They can 
change the rules so they can all inhabit the universe at the same time. The 
more characters they have, the more possibilities they have in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 A series bible and a 40-page treatment for the two-hour premiere have been 
written for "Voyager," the latest "Star Trek" incarnation on TV, which will be 
another 24th-Century series set on a starship. The USS Voyager, a new smaller 
class of starship, holds only 200 people, as opposed to the Enterprise's 
2,000-plus. While giving chase to a group of well-meaning vigilantes, Voyager 
and the renegade ship are transported 70 years from home to the fringe of the 
galaxy. The series will follow their search together for the way home. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, the creators can come up with an entirely new galaxy of races 
and species and story lines to add to the "Star Trek" menagerie. There are even 
rumors that the captain this time around will be a woman (Berman isn't saying). 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a testament to Gene Roddenberry's imagination," said Brent Spiner, 
who plays Data. "He created the single best format anybody has ever thought of 
for a long-running piece. There is no end to the universe, or to the 
imagination, so there's always more stories out there." 
</P>
<P>
 There may never be another entertainment phenomenon to compare to "Star Trek." 
The original "Star Trek" series can still be seen in reruns in 94% of the 
United States and 75 countries worldwide. At least 400,000 people attended 130 
"Star Trek" conventions last year, and there are dozens of computer bulletin 
boards across the country devoted to the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 As one of the licensing industry's most enduring properties, with 200 current 
licensees, "Star Trek" merchandise has generated retail sales of more than $750 
million since 1967. The latest permutations range from CD-ROM multimedia games 
to traveling virtual-reality amusement parks in shopping malls. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's happening is that the people who watched the first 'Star Trek' series 
in the 1960s now have children watching 'The Next Generation,' " said Andrea 
Hein, president of the Paramount Licensing Group. "We have a whole line of 
successful children's toys. The original 'Star Trek' was not real popular with 
children." 
</P>
<P>
 So how do the "Next Generation" of cast members feel about becoming part of 
the pantheon of "Star Trek" characters who will be marketed and merchandised 
for the rest of their lives? They say they don't mind being associated with the 
characters, because they believe in the work they did. But there is another 
aspect. 
</P>
<P>
 "The show is such a machine now. It is really a conglomerate in itself," said 
Michael Dorn, who plays Lt. Worf. "There are two more TV shows -- one on the 
air and one coming. Instead of being, like, the original guys, we're just going 
to be part of the machine." 
</P>
<P>
 All the cast members are supposed to see a percentage of royalties from 
merchandising, but they say they have received virtually nothing so far. LeVar 
Burton, who plays Lt. Geordi La Forge, believes the cast will eventually have 
to pull together and demand an accounting from Paramount, which he said the 
original cast had to do to receive their fair share. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's show business," Burton sighed. 
</P>
<P>
 * The series finale of "Star Trek: The Next Generation" will air May 23 on 
KCOP-TV Channel 13.

POP BEAT: AT THE COCTEAU 'CAFE'; SCOTTISH TRIO'S LATEST ALBUM REFLECTS A 
TURBULENT PERIOD OF PERSONAL GROWTH. SOUTHLAND GIG BEGINS SUNDAY AT UNIVERSAL 
AMPHITHEATRE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LEVINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 The Cocteau Twins, the Scottish trio whose moody, ethereal style was one of 
the most influential sounds in '80s pop-rock, suffered through a period that 
was anything but peaceful while working on their latest album, "Four-Calendar 
Cafe." 
</P>
<P>
 After the band finished its 1990 tour, guitarist Robin Guthrie, 31, 
concentrated on kicking a drug habit, which led the group's singer (and 
Guthrie's longtime girlfriend), Elizabeth Fraser, and bassist Simon Raymonde to 
examine their own lives and their relationships as band members. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all got involved in Robin's recovery quite heavily, and as a result 
learned quite a bit about ourselves," said Raymonde, 31, during a stop on a 
U.S. tour that will include three Southern California performances beginning 
Sunday at the Universal Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
 "What makes us all so much stronger is that we've sorted out our lives and 
come out the other end. That's what the whole new record is about to me -- 
opening doors. There's a lot of what's gone on in the last few years stuffed in 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Fraser, 30, whose vocals have usually consisted as much of exotic sounds as 
actual words, wrote "proper lyrics" and sang them in a relatively 
straightforward fashion for "Four-Calendar Cafe," a haunting album that's more 
direct emotionally than most of the band's previous collections. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just journaling really," she said of her new approach to lyrics. "I 
just got so depressed. There's a lot about my hope (on the album)." 
</P>
<P>
 Influenced by such punk and new wave acts as the Buzzcocks, the Birthday Party 
and Public Image Ltd., the Twins pioneered a new brand of dreamy, textural pop 
in the early '80s. Though they didn't have a major-label U.S. distribution deal 
until they signed one with Capitol in 1988, they became critical favorites and 
influenced such bands as the Sundays and the Cranberries. 
</P>
<P>
 The Twins continued to evolve musically, making increasingly complex albums at 
their studio near their home in London. "Four-Calendar Cafe" is less musically 
dense than the band's recent albums, and the airiness left in its songs allows 
Fraser's delicate singing to better shine through the Twins' beautiful haze of 
layered guitar and quietly beating drum machines. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that subconsciously we wanted to not just keep putting more and more 
layers of music on just for the sake of it," Raymonde said. 
</P>
<P>
 While "Four Calendar Cafe" only reached No. 78 on the national pop charts 
after its November release, it has so far nearly matched its predecessor with 
sales of more than 200,000 in the United States -- and Capitol plans to promote 
the album for at least several more months. On their last tour, the Twins 
played the Wiltern Theatre, and their move up to the 6,000-seat Universal 
Amphitheatre reflects the band's growing commercial base. 
</P>
<P>
 The current tour -- their first since 1990 -- will also be their first with a 
full band. Having previously relied on sequencers to reproduce the full sound 
of their albums, the band is now touring with two more guitarists, a 
percussionist and a drummer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to be completely paranoid about live performance," said Raymonde about 
the Twins' decision to tour with a full band. "I wish we'd done it before 
because it sounds so much better. 
</P>
<P>
 "What can you lose? Maybe we'll bring some other musicians on a record one 
day. You've got to be open-minded about these things. You don't really get 
anywhere unless you change." 
</P>

TV REVIEW; 'ABRAHAM' ON TNT -- GRITTY BUT APPEALING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

 Television's celebration of Easter wouldn't be complete without a few channel 
sightings of old Hollywood epics like "The Ten Commandments." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But viewers this Easter can opt for a grittier, harder approach to biblical 
movies with the premiere of the four-hour Old Testament tale "Abraham" on TNT. 
</P>
<P>
 Featuring Richard Harris and Barbara Hershey as Abraham and Sarah, the 
prosperous shepherd and his wife leading followers to New Canaan, the 
production is almost devoid of the sword-and-sandals, sex-and-sin standard 
Hollywood Bible fare associated with the De Mille and Zanuck opuses of the 
1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 Shot in the south of Morocco (where Franco Zeffirelli's "Jesus of Nazareth" 
and David Lean's "Lawrence of Arabia" were also shot), the howling wind and 
dry, desolate, hardscrabble look of the land mirror what life in ancient 
Mesopotamia and Egypt might have been like in Abraham's time -- about 2000 B.C. 
</P>
<P>
 The production strives to be candid about the way people lived. For instance, 
the depiction of giving birth -- the mother inside a dusty tent with her legs 
agonizingly straddled and both the mother and a midwife howling like banshees 
-- is palpably real and almost hard to watch. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, this Easter presentation predates Christianity. It's a spiritual 
odyssey for diverse believers and even nonbelievers. As the patriarch of 
Judaism, Christianity and the Muslim religions, Harris' Abraham is seen as a 
down-to-earth figure not so much born to greatness as a man with greatness 
borne down upon him. 
</P>
<P>
 Doubters and nonbelievers can simply relish an extraordinary story. The 
miniseries, directed by Joseph Sargent from a script by Robert McKee, is, on 
one level, a lurid story of violence, animal and human sacrifice, wars and 
assorted skirmishes, including, not least, the destruction of Sodom, where 
straight and homosexual residents casually frolic in orgies on public streets 
and shadowy crevices. 
</P>
<P>
 But fans longing for action like that great chariot race in the 1959 "Ben-Hur" 
will be disappointed. The physical texture of "Abraham" is so comparatively 
ascetic and unadorned that when Abraham's people stumble into the grand lair of 
an Egyptian Pharaoh (Maximilian Schell, looking ridiculous in a huge, 
cumbersome Egyptian wig), you're relieved to cool off and get out from under 
the burning sun.  
</P>
<P>
 An international production (the joint venture of Italian, German and American 
companies) with a largely Italian cast, "Abraham" stands as both an accessible 
document of faith and a suspenseful Old Testament story mercifully told without 
sound and fury and, thankfully, with absolutely no resort to special effects. 
</P>
<P>
 When God/Jehovah speaks to Abraham, urging him forth to the Promised Land and 
later asking him to ritually sacrifice his beloved son Issac as a test of his 
faith, what we hear is not some booming, disembodied voice but God speaking to 
Abraham in the shepherd's very own low, whispery voice. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris grows with nice, easy strength into the stature of his character. And 
when we read in the final credit role that "Abraham lived to good fullness of 
his time" and was "buried in the cave in Hebron" next to Sarah, the word Hebron 
echoes with a newly forged and bloody identity. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Abraham" airs in two parts on TNT cable. Part I airs Sunday at 5, 7 and 9 
p.m.; Part II airs Monday at 5, 7 and 9 p.m.

Los Angeles Superior Court lawsuit that he bowed out of the series when 
Kricfalusi struck a deal with MTV Networks, which owns Nickelodeon. Macek says 
Kricfalusi agreed to pay him $2,000 for each episode he produced, plus 20% of 
his Nick profits. The suit alleges that Kricfalusi has paid Macek only $12,000 
-- even though he actually produced between 16 and 30 episodes in the show's 
first season. Nickelodeon fired Kricfalusi in September, 1992. ART

Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard, which has been vacant for more than a year. The 
Cinematheque, an organization formed to preserve and exhibit film and video, 
made a proposal last spring to restore the building as its headquarters, using 
the theater for rentals and its frequent film programs. Although the proposal 
was accepted by the CRA staff immediately, it did not get formal city approval 
until September and then the contracts had to be drawn. The earthquake caused

MADONNA BACK ON 'LETTERMAN'? IT DEPENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 One of David Letterman's producers said Friday that the CBS late-night show 
might be willing to have Madonna return as a guest, but not for a repeat of 
Thursday's performance. 
</P>
<P>
 The singer used four-letter words 13 times during the taping of "Late Show 
With David Letterman" Thursday evening.She also threw in a couple of other 
expressions the network considered inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS deleted the offending audio before the show was broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
 "If she's going to pull the same thing she did on Thursday night, I don't 
think it would be responsible of us to ask her back," co-executive producer 
Robert Morton told The Times on Friday. "If she came to us and said she wants 
to come on and sing her latest song, I'd be willing to talk about that." 
</P>
<P>
 Madonna was difficult from the outset, handing Letterman a pair of her panties 
as he greeted her onstage. He stuffed them in a desk drawer. Then she pouted 
and refused to chat about her career. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why are you so obsessed with my sex life?" Madonna demanded, referring to the 
frequent jokes Letterman makes about her on the air. Last week, for example, he 
said, "At a recent charity auction, an autographed bra worn by Madonna fetched 
only $200. I guess people figure why pay $200 for a Madonna bra when the 
chances are pretty good that she'll leave one at your house." 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's "Late Show" attracted 24% of the viewers in the 30 markets for 
which ratings were available Friday. CBS said the ratings in those cities were 
the 10th best the program has received, topped only by the first two telecasts 
last August and seven others that followed the Winter Olympics in February.

THEATER REVIEW; DRAWING ON 'MEMORY TRICKS' FOR COLORFUL CAST OF CHARACTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Marga Gomez's mother believed in perfume, high heels and all things French. 
But most of all, she believed in the mother-daughter connection. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gomez grew up to be a witty comic who makes fun of her mother's fancy 
accouterments. But by the end of her "Memory Tricks," at Highways, we see that 
the mother-daughter connection is, if anything, stronger than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 A larger Los Angeles audience got a taste of Gomez's memories when she 
appeared in "Carpa Clash" with Culture Clash, at the Mark Taper Forum in 
December. In contrast to that show's lavish production values, this one 
consists of Gomez, a park bench, and a few lighting and sound cues. 
</P>
<P>
 It couldn't be simpler -- or more accessible. Gomez eases into her 
reminiscence with the patter of a stand-up comic. Her mother's ultra-feminine 
ways were ripe for comedy, and Gomez's sharp timing extracts every laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 At times her mother, who was an exotic dancer on the Spanish-language stage in 
New York, begins to sound like a Charo-like stereotype. 
</P>
<P>
 Without preaching about it, Gomez paints a picture of a woman who was obsessed 
with her appearance, only to be stricken with Alzheimer's at a relatively early 
age. This is where the laughs become grim, but it's also where the strength of 
the mother-daughter bond becomes apparent. 
</P>
<P>
 However, it's also clear that Gomez's mother was strong on her own terms, as 
well. She made deals, rigorously discouraged crying and walked out on two 
husbands. She even chose to disappear for months in Paris, prompting the adult 
Gomez to go in search of her. We never find out what exactly happened over 
there. Gomez takes care not to reduce her mother's story to a psychological 
case study. 
</P>
<P>
 Gomez also does cameos of her father, of a particularly memorable neighbor and 
of a number of assorted acquaintances and strangers. It's a vital gallery of 
characters, but the emphasis on her mother makes it all cohere. We eagerly 
await more Gomez stories about the other people in her life. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberta Levitow directed, and David Ford shared Gomez's "developed by" credit.

THEATER REVIEW; CULVER CITY TROUPE MEETS THE CHALLENGE OF 'DREAM' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 August Strindberg's "A Dream Play" would be an ambitious project for any 
theater company. Culver City's singular productions selected it to launch the 
company's first subscription season at the renovated Ivy Substation. The 
staging justifies this singular ambition. 
</P>
<P>
 Written shortly after the last turn of the century, "A Dream Play" follows the 
daughter of the god Indra as she wanders among humans, trying to discern why 
they're so unhappy. Strindberg wanted to write a dreamscape. Boundaries of 
time, space and identity dissolve arbitrarily, dismantling conventional sense. 
</P>
<P>
 The audience should be prepared to go along with the dream. Actually, this 
means you should be wide awake; the play's unexpected turns require close 
attention. But the director must maneuver those turns with clarity, creating a 
kind of inner logic in the absence of regular logic, evoking dreaminess but 
discouraging confusion. Allison Liddi is a capable navigator. 
</P>
<P>
 Ingmar Bergman, whose adaptation Liddi selected, skillfully pruned the more 
tendentious passages, especially in the home stretch. Some of these cut 
references are specifically Christian, which may or may not suit one's beliefs, 
but certainly the adaptation retains an abiding compassion. And Michael Meyer's 
English translation, while hardly approaching the fluency of conversational 
speech, seldom sounds wooden and sometimes attains a lovely lyricism. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ivy's high ceiling and majestic architectural details and Ruth Judkowitz's 
soundtrack help set the stage for dreaming about cosmic matters. Set designer 
Susan Gratch, asked to create a succession of dreamy pit stops with what was 
surely a skimpy budget, accomplished much with little, abetted by Adrian Jones' 
lighting. 
</P>
<P>
 The goddess, played by Melissa Simon, is a sympathetic young woman with the 
human name of Agnes who never puts on immortal airs. She rescues a dashing 
young officer (Bill Brochtrup), who is already endlessly devoted to a mystery 
woman, an opera singer who keeps her suitor on perpetual hold. Brochtrup's 
fervent romance is funny and touching. 
</P>
<P>
 Agnes is caught up in a sad marriage to a lawyer (Jonathan Read), but the 
dreariness is established without making the scene dreary. Later Brochtrup is 
ensnared in one of the all-time classic student dreams -- he's back in an 
elementary classroom, unable to understand the lesson even though he's all 
grown up. This critic had a virtually identical dream two nights before seeing 
"A Dream Play." 
</P>
<P>
 Anne Darragh brings solidity to the potentially hazy role of the Poet, tour 
guide for the gods. Bill Barker and Marc Hart play roles in drag without 
underlining the humor, but there is humor here -- a graduation scene verges on 
slapstick. Everyone in the cast of 14 plays several roles. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing in the play itself comes as a great revelation. But Strindberg is well 
served, and the production serves notice to keep an eye on the Ivy. 
</P>

CHILDREN'S THEATER; THE 'FACE' OF RACIAL HARMONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A play promoting racial harmony is certainly timely, so the Los Angeles 
Repertory Theatre's decision to revive "Face 2 Face," a 50-minute musical with 
the theme "appreciate our similarities and respect our differences" makes 
sense. 
</P>
<P>
 But this 1991 show for children, written for South Coast Repertory's 
Educational Touring program by respected playwright Richard Hellesen ("Once in 
Arden, "Moonshadow") and accomplished veteran stage and Disney 
composer-lyricist Michael Silversher, is not as effective as it should be. 
</P>
<P>
 Staged by Peter Ellenstein on the floor of the cavernous Veterans Memorial 
facility Auditorium in Culver City, the play is about a boy named Benno 
(Charles Reese) and his odyssey through self-doubt to self-realization. 
Rejected by his peers for looking different, Benno at first tries to be just 
like other people, but learns that "the cool thing is to get to know each 
other." 
</P>
<P>
 That message is heavily delivered by the four adult actors who can sing, but 
give forced portrayals of children and seem uncomfortable interacting with the 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Eilber's choreography is unmemorable; inventive commedia del arte-style 
masks by Beckie Kravitz and Robert Beuth and wildly sculpted, neon-colored wigs 
by costume/set designer Alicia MacCarone supply visual interest. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Face 2 Face," Veterans Memorial Building Auditorium, 4117 Overland Ave., 
Culver City, Saturdays at 1 p.m. through April 23. $5; (213) 466-1767.

WITH OR WITHOUT PARENTS: 'HERE I COME' EASES KINDERGARTEN ANXIETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Starting kindergarten can be one of life's big challenges for the budding 
lunch-box brigade, but an outstanding new audiocassette by Mark Beckwith (of 
the Jumping Jam vocal group) can help smooth the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Notable for its simplicity, age-appropriateness, musical polish and hummable 
tunes, Beckwith's "Kindergarten, Here I Come," is a skillful, comfortable mix 
of learning and fun, set to a light pop and classic rock beat. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides sunny songs about vowel sounds, colors and simple anatomy, selections 
include a "Humpty Dumpty Freeze Dance," reassurance about "sad and mad" 
emotions in "Talk to Me" ("I'll Listen") and "Willie the Worm," an unusual pet 
for show-and-tell. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most comforting musical confidence boosters is "When I Go to 
School," which begins with a quiet acknowledgment of anxiety -- "I knew I had 
to go, but I just didn't know, if I would like this new school . . ." -- then 
launches into an irresistible, upbeat celebration of new friends and 
accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer-guitarist Beckwith, who consulted preschool and kindergarten educators 
when writing the songs, is an experienced performer and his strong vocals are 
parent-friendly and assured. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who join in chorus and instrumentals are veteran children's singer 
David Kinnoin, who co-wrote "Sounds of AEIOU" and "When I Go to School," 
guitarist Richard Campbell and keyboardist Bob Selvin (who wrote "Willie the 
Worm"). 
</P>
<P>
 * "Kindergarten, Here I Come." Ages 4 to 7. Building Block Records, P.O. Box 
5079, Sherman Oaks, Calif. 91413. $8.95, plus $2.50 tax, shipping and handling. 
Teacher's Guide with lyrics and suggested activities: $2.

AN ACTOR'S RESPONSIBILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lou Cohan hit upon a very good idea ("Actors Need to Carry Social 
Responsibility to the Screen," March 18). He may be interested to know that 
someone has already thought of it.What's more, the idea came from an 
organization created by the entertainment industry and it is widely used. 
</P>
<P>
 "Spotlight on Depiction of Health and Social Issues," intended by its 
publisher, the Entertainment Industries Council Inc., to provide clear-cut, 
accurate information to creators of TV and film productions when they deal with 
certain health or social issues, has been distributed to more than 2,500 
members of the Hollywood community. 
</P>
<P>
 Notebook depictions include such issues as AIDS, alcohol, children of 
alcoholics, tobacco in the media, women and addiction, mental illness, hearing 
impairment, alcohol-impaired driving and safety-belt awareness. 
</P>
<P>
 There are many examples of TV shows and movies that have been affected by 
EIC's efforts, including smoking in "Hearts Afire," drunken driving in "Growing 
Pains," alcoholism and recovery in "Cagney & Lacey," HIV-positive children in 
"The Equalizer" and "Life Goes On," among others. 
</P>
<P>
 A copy of the notebook is available to writers, directors and producers of TV 
programs and movies. Call EIC at (800) 783-3421.

 Re: "Rummaging in the Getty's Storerooms" by Susan Kandel (March 18).The 
Getty's seventh floor on Wilshire Boulevard may not be the best exhibition 
site, and the local artists selected may not have the New York art-world sheen, 
but the double accomplishment of opening up the collection to public scrutiny 
and simultaneously giving five Los Angeles artists a space should be 
encouraged, not trashed. 
</P>
<P>
 I, for one, relished the opportunity to browse through, select and handle the 
wondrous old books in the collection and am grateful for that experience. I 
hope my installation communicates these pleasures to viewers.

COMMUNITY LOSES AS A THEATER CLOSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I write with sadness on the upcoming loss of Los Angeles theater: Serendipity 
Theatre Company, in the Coronet Theatre, is about to close. Actors should take 
heed, this was an Equity company.Parents should take heed, this was 
legitimately thoughtful, honest, family entertainment. Schools should take 
heed, this was a bastion of learning, making its productions available to 
thousands of students every year. And Los Angeles corporations should take 
heed, this theater company built itself over four seasons on the wings of its 
own ticket sales by sacrificing salaries for any, and I mean all, of its 
management. Subscriptions increased yearly. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles is a mecca for thousands of entertainment professionals. Let us 
not forget that the tradition we are all participating in has been founded on a 
heritage of live performance. It may well be that film and TV are the defining 
storytelling media of our time, but nothing can replace the community 
engendered in sharing live theater. Serendipity offered an affordable place to 
bring our children that would challenge and delight people of all ages. 
</P>
<P>
 As an actor for Serendipity who has enjoyed the good fortune of fine reviews 
from this paper, I wish to thank Serendipity for its dedication, applaud 
Serendipity for its work and commend Serendipity for trying to bring a bit of 
tradition to a city so lacking in any kind of cohesive community heritage.

THEATER REVIEW; 'SCHOOL FOR WIVES' HAS LESSONS FOR MEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD STAYTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bound by scarves and wigs, wearing ribboned hats and florid outfits decorated 
with lace, they're prisoners of fashion. They totter on uncomfortable but chic 
high-heeled shoes. Consumed by gossip, they waste their lives scheming and 
backbiting. 
</P>
<P>
 Are these the women of 17th-Century France, playing out traditional roles? 
Look again and discover what A Noise Within, Glendale's gifted classical 
theater company, learned when it staged "The School for Wives." These catty 
coquettes are gentlemen of leisure, imprisoned by social standards. 
</P>
<P>
 That's just one of many insightful lessons offered in this droll, superbly 
performed, faithful revival of Moliere's classic comedy. Without any insecure 
gestures to "update" the story or period, the company makes Moliere our 
contemporary. It's 1662, yet we can see the roots of feminism. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Art Manke's disciplined ensemble speaks translator Richard Wilbur's 
rhyming dialogue with a natural grace, guiding us into the past while keeping 
us conscious of the present. 
</P>
<P>
 Like any man in midlife crisis, Arnolphe needs serious help. A wealthy 
bachelor who has devoted his life to betraying colleagues, he's decided it's 
finally time to marry. How to protect his good name and ensure that his bride 
will remain faithful? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since women are famous for their guile, Arnolphe shrewdly concocts the perfect 
plan: Raise his ward in a convent where she's taught absolute obedience by 
nuns. Now the innocent girl is ripe and ready to become his humble 
wife/servant. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's Arnolphe who's taken to school. His scheme to avoid heartbreak 
rapidly disintegrates once his ward meets the first available suitor. Love 
refuses to be controlled. 
</P>
<P>
 An inspired Joel Swetow portrays Arnolphe like a sweating, seething victim of 
machismo. His growing panic emerges from fears of intimacy and relationship, 
not just from farcical incidents. Much more than a fool, Swetow's Arnolphe 
turns unexpectedly tragic when, too late, he's taught the meaning of love by 
his ward. 
</P>
<P>
 Hisa Takakuwa's poignant Agnes is a compelling charmer who escapes her keeper 
without resorting to deceit. Her innocence is complemented by Eric David 
Johnson's earnest sincerity as her suitor. Jill Hill and Josiah Polhemus 
provide perfect farcical counterpoint as Arnolphe's dim-witted servants. 
</P>
<P>
 If any gender ever needed women's liberation, it's Moliere's dandies. Yet 
their behavior mirrors our own. A Noise Within could ironically translate the 
title to read: "The School for Men." 
</P>
<P>
 * "The School for Wives," A Noise Within, 234 Brand Blvd., Glendale. In 
repertory through May 14. (Call for schedule.) $15. (818) 546-1924. Running 
time: 2 hours.

MONTEL'S RAPIST SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "Wanna Confess? Call Montel" (March 25), Howard Rosenberg charges that 
Montel Williams' producers were somehow irresponsible because they believed the 
criminal confessions of a man who claimed to have committed 90 rapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenberg fails to mention that the doctor who treated this self-professed 
rapist also believed Jerome Stanfield was guilty and told producers that he had 
reported Stanfield's confession to the Baltimore Police Department because of 
his concerns for public safety when Stanfield left therapy prematurely.The 
candid conversations producers had with Stanfield's therapist were pivotal in 
their decision to move forward with this show. 
</P>
<P>
 How can we presume, in retrospect, that Stanfield was lying when he spoke to 
Williams and is telling the truth to everyone else? According to reports from 
private investigators hired by the show, Stanfield told the truth about every 
detail of his personal life, including the names of therapists and periods of 
treatment. He even gave his doctors permission to reveal confidential medical 
information to producers. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the program aired, several women who say they were raped by Stanfield 
have come forward. If even one case can be brought against Stanfield and he is 
convicted, the public good will have been served by this controversial program.

AIDS CONCERNS EVERYONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding Sharon Biggers' reaction to Tom Hanks' Oscar speech ("Reactions to 
the Oscars," Saturday Letters, March 26): 
</P>
<P>
 While Hanks' comments might arguably have approached being "overwrought," they 
were more than tempered by the honesty of his emotions. But "oppressive" in 
their political correctness? C'mon. 
</P>
<P>
 No one is asking you, Ms. Biggers, to feel responsible for or guilty about 
those who are combatting AIDS and HIV, nor must you see any of us as possessing 
a certain "nobility" for doing so. Still, you have responsibilities that you 
must face, the very least of which is to recognize that, since none of us lives 
in a vacuum, AIDS is everyone's concern. Hiding behind your statement that 
"AIDS is a predominantly behavior-related disease," with its implicit moral 
judgment, does not exempt you from accepting this. 
</P>
<P>
 When this plague breaks through your wall of denial, arrives at your doorstep 
and claims one of your loved ones, who will be to blame then? Will you still be 
in hiding? There's not much nobility in that either. 
</P>
<P>
 So I propose a deal: I will accept full responsibility for my lifestyle and 
all of my actions, but you must do likewise. And I'll just take my chances on 
becoming an angel.

DOLE'S GIFT TO HIS COUNTRY

 Academy Awards emcee Whoopi Goldberg would like to see the emasculation of 
Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.).

<P>
 If the emcee had been a white male and had made an offensive remark about a 
black female, suggesting that she be sexually mutilated, I wonder what the 
reaction might have been. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole is a handicapped American war veteran who deserves far more respect than 
Goldberg gave him the night of the Academy Awards. She should be censured. 
</P>
<P>
 I am urging my friends to boycott her TV appearances and movies until she 
apologizes.

 Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Calif.), Rep. Fred Grandy (R-Iowa), Sonny Bono and 
the nation's other actors-turned-politicians may again be haunted by work from 
their show-business days. 
</P>
<P>
 Under revised Federal Communications Commission regulations that go into 
effect later this year, election opponents of one-time performers will be 
eligible to receive equal time when their adversary's old work is rerun on 
television.  
</P>
<P>
 The FCC had exempted such appearances in a provision that went into effect in 
1992, ruling that a program only triggers the equal-time provision if it is 
"controlled, sponsored or approved by the candidate." 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to 1992, television and radio stations, when requested, had to provide 
equal time to opposing candidates whenever a candidate who had qualified for 
the ballot appeared recognizably -- by either picture or voice -- on a 
broadcast outside of bona fide newscasts, interview programs, documentaries or 
spot coverage of news events -- as, for instance, when Ronald Reagan turned up 
in late-night movies during his presidential campaigns of 1976, 1980 and 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Most stations tried to avoid the problem by not showing series episodes and 
movies that included actors-turned-candidates during campaign periods. 
Occasionally they slipped up, and the opponents would be granted time to boost 
their candidacies. 
</P>
<P>
 The FCC changed the rules in 1992, but a lawsuit over another aspect of the 
equal-time regulations led the commission in January to reinstitute the old 
rules. They have not yet gone into effect, pending their publication in the 
Federal Register, the daily government-published document listing every 
rule-making change of all federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California stations figure to be most impacted under the revised 
regulations, as at least three former actor-entertainers are running for 
various offices in the June 7 primary. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a station would either have to edit or refrain from showing the 
1988 film "Hairspray" because Sonny Bono appears in it, and he is running for a 
Republican congressional nomination in Riverside County. Otherwise, the station 
might be faced with having to give equal time to the other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Also affected when the FCC revisions take effect will be Dornan, who is 
running for re-election in his Orange Country congressional district, and 
Sheila James Kuehl -- best known for her portrayal of Zelda Gilroy in CBS' 
1959-63 sitcom "The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis" -- who is seeking a Democratic 
state Assembly nomination in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, neither the new nor the old equal-time regulations will have an 
impact on the nation's most famous potential candidate -- disc jockey Howard 
Stern -- for more than six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker said the regulations do not come into play until a candidate legally 
qualifies for the ballot. In the case of Stern, who said last week he would 
seek the Libertarian Party nomination for governor of New York, that would not 
occur until Oct. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 If Stern qualifies as a candidate on that date, radio stations carrying his 
morning program in New York state will either have to drop him from the air or 
grant a corresponding amount of time to all the other qualified candidates -- 
from four to five hours a day. (Stations outside of New York would not be 
impacted because the regulations only affect stations that broadcast where the 
election is being held.) 
</P>
<P>
 Entertainment programming on cable networks has never been subject to the 
FCC's equal-time provisions.

TV REVIEWS; KIDS GET ANSWERS TO MONEY QUESTIONS

<P>
 Is there really a tiny owl hiding on the $1 bill? What's with that mystical 
pyramid and eye on the back? And just how does an ATM work? Kids get the 
answers in a fluffy two-part special today and next Saturday, "Money Made Easy: 
The ABC Kids' Guide to Dollars and Sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Hosted by likable young "Step by Step" star Christopher Castile, each segment 
includes real kids' wise and/or inventive comments on money matters, periodic 
talking head spots with some rather pedantic experts, clips from old 
black-and-white movies and cartoons, and whimsical new animation. 
</P>
<P>
 Within this "education lite" style, the first half hour concentrates on money 
history, from the use of salt, stones and shells as currency to the invention 
of paper money and the prevention of counterfeiting. 
</P>
<P>
 The second show skims over banking procedures, with a visit to a bank vault 
and an ATM, a check-writing demonstration and an explanation of how to open a 
savings account. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the kids on the show have their own ideas: One says he prefers to 
save his money in his smelly socks as a deterrent to theft, others think that 
the "Mona Lisa" or maybe Christie Brinkley should be on the $100 bill. One, 
however, expresses moral indignation. "They give these little pieces of paper 
so much power," he complains. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Money Made Easy: The ABC Kids' Guide to Dollars and Sense" airs today and 
next Saturday at 11:30 a.m. on ABC (Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42).

RICK DU BROW: PINCH-HITTERS SCORE WHEN INSERTED IN THE LINEUP; TELEVISION: 
NETWORKS RELY ON SUCH DEPENDABLE TWO-HOUR MOVIES AS 'PERRY MASON' AND 'COLUMBO' 
TO HELP IN THE RATINGS. 'FAMILIARITY IS VERY IMPORTANT TO VIEWERS,' EXECUTIVES 
SAY. 
</P>

 Call them TV's premier pinch-hitters. 
</P>
<P>
 They are the dependable, two-hour movies -- most of them old pros like the 
"Perry Mason" mysteries, "Columbo" and "Matlock" -- that the networks in recent 
years have called on to keep afloat in the ratings, often when they're in 
trouble and new series have gone belly-up. 
</P>
<P>
 There are various reasons for keeping the familiar two-hour staples around. 
Most of them center around the fact that you can count on them to come off the 
bench and deliver because viewers who are otherwise fed up with reality shows 
and other TV trends are familiar with the dependable storytelling. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-hour "Perry Mason" revivals transcended the pinch-hitter category by 
becoming surprising hits on their own. And the networks continue to develop the 
form to fit their needs. NBC's Danielle Steele romances, for example, have also 
succeeded and are great counter-programming against sports. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's also important for the networks to develop more contemporary series 
as two-hour regulars when their weekly prime-time hours run out. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 21, for example, ABC brings back one of its sleeper series, "MacGyver," 
for a two-hour Saturday outing, once again starring Richard Dean Anderson and 
dealing with "an archeological adventure to locate a legendary fortune." 
</P>
<P>
 ABC is confident that the "MacGyver" revival during the key May sweeps will 
also provide support from "a faithful audience" to promote its movie that airs 
the next night, "City Slickers," says Alan Sternfeld, the network's senior vice 
president for program planning and scheduling. 
</P>
<P>
 The nice thing about pre-sold two-hour entries in general, says NBC executive 
Preston Beckman, is that "you have fewer sleepless nights. You generally know 
where you're going to wind up (in the ratings). 
</P>
<P>
 "Familiarity is very important to viewers," says Beckman, senior vice 
president of program planning and scheduling for NBC. "Another value is that it 
takes pressure off promotion because, for instance, you don't have to sell a 
'Perry Mason' movie." 
</P>
<P>
 There's a certain added drama that goes with pinch-hitting, whether in 
baseball or TV. "Matlock," bounced by NBC, showed its continuing pull when 
given a shot at ABC. Dick Van Dyke's new CBS series, "Diagnosis Murder," 
started as a two-hour fill-in and won a regular berth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally, the audience comes back to people they already have a relationship 
with," says Peter Tortorici, the executive vice president of CBS Entertainment. 
"And sure, the programs are great pinch-hitters." 
</P>
<P>
 When shows such as Van Dyke's win regular slots, says Beckman, it's like 
"doing a pilot and letting the public judge if this should be a series." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good testing ground for networks without committing themselves," says 
Kim Haswell, vice president of programs for Fred Silverman Productions, which 
has turned out a number of series and two-hour specials featuring old 
favorites. 
</P>
<P>
 The flip side on the production end, says Haswell, is that "a one-hour series 
can become very expensive and they're hard to sell in syndication. So the 
profit really isn't there. If you do a two-hour film, you can sell it overseas 
as a movie." 
</P>
<P>
 The trick, of course, is to keep coming up with more recent shows that will 
play over a long period as two-hour specials. In past years, CBS has continued 
to get mileage out of the grand old "Gunsmoke" series with new, periodic 
adventures. But at the same time, "Cagney & Lacey" producer Barney Rosenzweig 
is planning at least several new two-hour films of the series, reuniting stars 
Tyne Daly and Sharon Gless. 
</P>
<P>
 With producers such as Steven Bochco noting that viewers are defecting to 
cable and pay-TV in large part because of movies, the two-hour network films 
are also a valuable weapon in retaining the fickle audience. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC, for instance, has been getting mileage by developing its line of specials 
entitled "In the Line of Duty." As for the better-known series that have 
dominated this programming arena, from "Perry Mason" to "Columbo," Sternfeld 
says, "The reason they worked again and again is that they're well-made." 
</P>
<P>
 A good two-hour TV film based on a well-loved series with a popular star is a 
program for all seasons. It's as valuable as having a super utility player on 
call in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 If "Hart to Hart" and "Burke's Law" can have comebacks, as they have this 
season, you have to think of some of the dramas of both the distant and recent 
past that would still have plenty of gold to mine -- with a new look. 
</P>
<P>
 You could bet, for instance, that several, or more, two-hour films annually of 
"The Rockford Files," with James Garner, would be hugely welcomed and would go 
through the ratings roof. 
</P>
<P>
 How about Richard Chamberlain, in middle age, in a revival of the "Dr. 
Kildare" series that first brought him fame? 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent Los Angeles tribute to "Lou Grant" by the New York Museum of 
Television & Radio, mention was made of an attempt to do a new TV film of the 
classic series. Two or three a year would be more like it. 
</P>
<P>
 An annual special updating the characters of "thirtysomething" could go on for 
years. "The Waltons" has been replayed by CBS before, but several a year would 
still be welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 When Angela Lansbury finally quits "Murder, She Wrote," can you imagine the 
tune-in if she returns in occasional two-hour specials? 
</P>
<P>
 You could clean up with annual revivals of "Hawaii Five-O" or "Magnum, P.I." 
or "Simon & Simon?" Alas, we'll probably never get an updated look at Bruce 
Willis and Cybill Shepherd in "Moonlighting." But in a few years, we'll 
probably be ready for two-hour specials about whatever happened to the gang in 
"Beverly Hills, 90210." 
</P>
<P>
 The extraordinary industry that has evolved from "Star Trek" -- in films and 
TV variations -- will probably never be matched. But there's still gold in 
those prime-time hills.

TV REVIEWS; 'CHRISTY'S' PIONEERING SPIRIT ENRICHES A HOMESPUN TALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Hold on to joy," the idealistic new schoolteacher in Cutter Gap is advised by 
her Quaker mentor, Miss Alice, in Sunday's premiere of "Christy." 
</P>
<P>
 Christy Huddleston manages to do just that despite being a newly arrived 
19-year-old outsider who is burning to reform this poor and remote Smoky 
Mountains village that seems impregnable to change. 
</P>
<P>
 There is something highly appealing about this atmospheric CBS series, based 
on a popular novel by Catherine Marshall about a young woman who, after a brief 
stint at college, arrives in Appalachia in November of 1912 to establish a 
mission school. 
</P>
<P>
 Christy (Kellie Martin) is full of hope. But awaiting her is an inadequate 
one-room schoolhouse and a rag-tag bunch of grubby, shoeless, undisciplined, 
near-illiterate pupils with old people's faces. And confronting her are 
ignorance, superstition, clan feuds and a moonshining populace that considers 
whiskey stills a birthright. 
</P>
<P>
 She's spiny, though, pushing her educational and moral agenda while finding an 
ally and possible future romantic interest in a young Protestant preacher 
(Randall Batinkoff). And surely Cutter Gap's headstrong young doctor (Steward 
Finlay-McClennan), who resents her interference in local matters, won't stay 
mad at Christy forever. 
</P>
<P>
 Filmed in Townsend, Tenn., "Christy" is lush to look at and a distinctive 
addition to prime time. The surrounding characters don't have the gap-toothed 
rawness of those backwoods devils in "Deliverance," but Martin is a gifted 
young actress who conveys a pioneer spirit while still giving Christy a fresh, 
sweet vulnerability. And Tyne Daly is productive in her minimal time on camera 
as the complex Miss Alice, a likable figure despite continually spitting 
truisms and other chaws of wisdom.  
</P>
<P>
 There are some nice spiritual touches in Patricia Green's script, meanwhile, 
and only occasionally does Michael Rhodes' direction meander. 
</P>
<P>
 Christy's campaign to battle deeply entrenched traditions causes a terrible 
backlash. She and her modest schoolhouse take a beating, as does your heart 
when worked over by the drama's sentimental score and obvious message about the 
innate nobility of the poor and primitive. Yet this is too nice a series to 
pick apart. "Christy" may be only a penlight in an abyss, but better that than 
no light at all. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Christy" premieres at 8 p.m. Sunday and then will be seen at 8 p.m. 
Thursdays on CBS (Channels 2 and 8).

THEATER REVIEW; 'REAL WOMEN' A LOVING MEMORY PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAT LAUNER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The heat is unbearable and the deadline is almost past. The product is due, 
the equipment isn't paid for and La Migra may be at the door. What else is 
there to do but strip down to your undies and dance? 
</P>
<P>
 In "Real Women Have Curves," humor is survival and in sisterhood there is 
strength. Five Latinas toil in an East L.A. sweatshop, working overtime to 
finish an order of petite pink satin dresses. Their task underscores their 
plight: They can neither afford nor fit into these frocks. It's a metaphor for 
their new American life. 
</P>
<P>
 But they also have universal female concerns, from cellulite to contraception, 
anorexia to abortion, sexual obligation to spousal abuse. In a powerful display 
of feminist defiance, they bare their flawed bodies and celebrate their unity, 
individuality and potential to pursue the American dream. 
</P>
<P>
 Playwright Josefina Lopez created the autobiographical piece five years ago, 
when she was 19. It's a touching, humorous memory play, a loving look at 
hard-working immigrant women. Through her alter ego, Ana, Lopez preaches 
empowerment. At San Diego Repertory Theatre, Lopez plays Ana. Like the title 
character in Lopez's "Simply Maria," Ana doesn't feel she belongs in her 
mundane world; she wants to be a writer. 
</P>
<P>
 Her diary readings make the implicit unnecessarily explicit. Not quite 
trusting her audience, Lopez hammers home the lessons of her play. This, like 
the overabundance of issues, may be attributed to youth. But there is 
confidence and maturity in her snappy dialogue and her ability to create real 
characters with real concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 The play demands ensemble work, which was not yet evident on opening night. 
But the warmth and camaraderie grew during the evening. Director William 
Alejandro Virchis has given a lot of latitude to his cast. Lopez the actor is 
not as convincing as Lopez the playwright, but very strong performances are 
turned in by Roxane Carrasco as the oversexed Rosali and Lupe Ontiveros as 
Ana's hilarious mother, Carmen. 
</P>
<P>
 John Iacovelli has designed a deliciously detailed set, suitably lit by Brenda 
Berry. Dione Lebhar's costumes befit the characters, but Debby Van Poucke's 
sound design is unimaginative. Here the text, rightfully, takes center stage. 
In a modulated, less strident voice, playwright Lopez continues to challenge 
the sexual-political status quo, not just for Latinas, but for all real women. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Real Women Have Curves," San Diego Repertory Theatre's Lyceum Space, Horton 
Plaza, San Diego. Tuesdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 2 and 7 p.m. Ends April

PANDORA'S BOX IS PASSE. A NEW GENERATION OF PRODUCTS HAS MADE RIGHT ANGLES FOR 
SQUARES ONLY. THE SHAPE OF THINGS TO COME APPEALS TO CONSUMERS BECASUE IT'S 
SOPHISTICATED YET COMFORTING, DESIGNERS SAY. FUNCTION FOLLOWS.; CURVE APPEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GAILE ROBINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Curves are cool. Right angles are square. 
</P>
<P>
 Look, and you'll see a world going round. Appliances, electronics, furniture 
and housewares with undulating lines and soft shapes have been replacing the 
sharp-cornered designs of recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Boomboxes, once as solidly rectangular as a brick, look like knackwurst. 
Remote controls with all the grace of a 3-by-5 card have been transformed into 
palm-sized ovoids. And overstuffed couches -- slipcovered in antique 
fruit-print dish towels -- are far more fashionable than sleek, black leather 
sofas. 
</P>
<P>
 The curving trend goes beyond the home and into the driveway, where cars, shoe 
box-shaped only a decade ago, have become roly-poly jelly beans. 
</P>
<P>
 This new generation of curvy products is popular with consumers, who find the 
look sophisticated yet comforting, designers say. A soft edge is more 
humanistic than a hard one.  
</P>
<P>
 "People want friendlier products," explains Martin Smith, chairman of product 
and industrial design at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 But what really drives the curves is economics. Curvilinear shapes look new, 
and new shapes sell old products. Computer-aided design makes sinuous shapes 
easy to conceive and affords a more intricate end product. And because these 
curvy shapes require complicated tooling, manufacturers have fewer problems 
with cheap imitations flooding the market, says Herbert Tyrnauer, chairman of 
the design department at Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Although designers' infatuation with curves has been cresting for several 
years, it shows no signs of slacking off. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most product design periods run four to five years," says Tim Brown, director 
of the San Francisco branch of IDEO, an international product and industrial 
design firm. "Whenever it is just a design trend, it will reach a high point 
and fade away. If there is a sound reason for the trend, it can last longer."  
</P>
<P>
 In the past, products were shaped by their internal mechanics. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the '40s and '50s, most products were mechanical," Smith says. "In the 
'60s and '70s, they were electrical and mechanical. The '80s and '90s saw 
things become digital. . . . The mechanical nature no longer dictates the 
shape." 
</P>
<P>
 The digital electronics that run answering machines, coffee makers and 
portable telephones also aid the manufacturing process. Because product parts 
no longer have to fit a universal standard, companies can produce novelty 
designs in small quantities without going broke. 
</P>
<P>
 The low start-up costs and quick turnaround of computer-aided design and 
computer-aided manufacturing open the door for bright colors and unusual sizes, 
shapes and hybrid combinations. A telephone, for example, could take the form 
of a hot-pink plastic high-heel pump or a curvaceous compact desktop 
fax/answering machine/telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 Where digital technology liberated designers, CAD/CAM freed manufacturers. 
They can now indulge in making secondary products to advertise their primary 
wares. 
</P>
<P>
 Go Video, a Scottsdale, Ariz., electronics firm, recently introduced a 
dual-deck VCR system -- a model that could copy videotapes. But the 
accompanying remote control was too complicated. 
</P>
<P>
 "We needed something simple," says Ed Brachocki, vice president of marketing 
for the company, "something that would work with our VCR, have a broad 
application and would appeal to the mass market." 
</P>
<P>
 Translation: an inexpensive remote for the channel surfer -- one with an 
on-off control, volume regulator and channel changer -- that would work with 
the Go system and others. This product would put the name of the new company in 
many hands. 
</P>
<P>
 The company contacted Doug Patton, an Irvine-based industrial/product/software 
designer who had created a pen-shaped remote for Mitsubishi. He considered more 
than 50 designs, looking at every possible shape. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I design, I think about the design 24 hours a day," Patton says. 
"Everything I look at it has possibilities. It's a design tool called forced 
linking. 
</P>
<P>
 "One day when I went surfing, I was sitting on the beach picking up ocean 
rocks and skipping them. I thought, 'Hey, this shape feels good.' I took a 
bunch of the rounded rocks and started sketching." The result was a palm-sized 
remote control that resembles a flattened egg. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Louie Jones also breaks the box at every opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's rare that you ever see anything with a straight line in my collection," 
says the Laguna Beach furniture designer. His $4,000 chest of drawers is like a 
flame, a bright, red, twisting teardrop that flicks the ceiling. A 
one-of-a-kind, eight-foot-tall birch highboy resembles more a viola than a 
piece of furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is something sexy about curves. Adding curves to pieces gives them a 
life form," Jones says. 
</P>
<P>
 If nothing else, the shape of a product should make the user feel good, or the 
shape should feel good as it is being used. Evoking the warm-fuzzies is now 
part of the design criterion, designers say. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the form is set free, products can have a sense of emotional content," 
Smith says. 
</P>
<P>
 This is where the new and useful will stand out from the merely clever. Over 
the long haul, the practical and easy-to-use products, no matter what their 
shape, will outlast gimmicky ones, such as shoe-shaped phones. 
</P>
<P>
 "Design has moved beyond just designing tools for functionality," Brown says. 
"Tools are about experience. They have to give value to our lives. People don't 
change much from decade to decade. Products that connect to people last longer 
than ones that are merely a design trend." 
</P>
<P>
 Pandora's box is passe. A new generation of products has made right angles for 
squares only. The shape of things to come appeals to consumers because it's 
sophisticated yet comforting, designers say. Function follows.

GARDENING; LOTS OF PAMPERING STEMS WILTING EFFECT OF AGING ON LILIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No matter what date Easter falls on -- and it varies from year to year -- pots 
of fragrant Easter lilies are always on sale before the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the techniques used by growers to make that happen are clues for keeping 
the lilies flourishing while in bloom and after the flowering is over. 
</P>
<P>
 Growers use bulb-forcing to time the crop so the white, trumpet-shaped flowers 
appear for Easter, whether it be early (in March), late or in between (April 3 
this year). 
</P>
<P>
 The process starts about 17 weeks before a salable plant is shipped to 
retailers and includes controlled lighting, fertilizing and watering. After 
pre-cooling and potting, bulbs take about 120 days to flower. 
</P>
<P>
 Growers expect temperatures higher than 60 degrees to hasten flowering and 
lower ones to delay it. An inside joke says pots sometimes are worn thin on the 
bottom by being moved from one temperature to another. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the lily reaches your home, it has been well pampered, and for 
good reason. Most growers consider the Easter lily (Lilium longiflorum) their 
most profitable potted plant. And for best results, you need to continue the 
pampering. 
</P>
<P>
 In flower, they like bright, indirect light with daytime temperatures of about 
70 degrees, although a little direct sun won't hurt. Remove faded blooms as 
they develop. Don't fertilize. 
</P>
<P>
 Make sure the drainage hole is not obstructed. Fill with water once or twice 
and let drain. To avoid root rot, water only when the surface is dry to the 
touch. 
</P>
<P>
 Night temperatures around 40 to 45 degrees are ideal for prolonging blooms. If 
your climate permits, try a sheltered outdoor location at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Each flower lasts about a week. Remove faded flowers and stems as they 
develop. 
</P>
<P>
 The plant is not likely to again be satisfactory indoors. But it should 
flourish outdoors for years, except in severe winter climates. However, the 
flowering won't be around Easter but, rather, at the natural cycle a few months 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 To build up the bulb for outdoors once indoor flowering is over, set the pot 
in the sun, fertilize lightly with a time-release product such as Osmocote and 
keep the plant moist. Do not remove any green foliage. It eventually dies back 
but, in the meantime, manufactures nutrients for another season. 
</P>
<P>
 In-ground planting of the bulbs is best. They also can be transferred to an 
outdoor container slightly larger than the original pot and grown successfully 
in partial-shade conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 If time or weather dictate, place the original pot in an outdoor bed and cover 
with soil for later handling. 
</P>
<P>
 They won't survive in soggy soil so make sure any outdoor location has good 
drainage. If there is a slight slope, so much the better. Work a liberal amount 
of organic matter into the top 12 inches of soil and add a handful of 
superphosphate (0-20-0 formulation). Plant a little deeper than they were 
growing in the pot. 
</P>
<P>
 The first year, don't be surprised by some fall flowers as the bulb recycles 
to nature. 
</P>
<P>
 After about three years, the clumps become too large. Dig and divide in fall 
or spring. Replant the same as you did originally. 
</P>
<P>
 If you have other lilies, don't plant a potted Easter lily near them. Forced 
ones sometimes carry a virus. 
</P>
<P>
 Indoor forcing of new bulbs is possible on a windowsill, but most people find 
it difficult. Ace or Nellie White are good choices. Plant in a six-inch pot, 
with the tip just below the soil level. Keep cool and dark until a shoot shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Then move the pot to a shady windowsill and, as the shoot begins to lengthen, 
to one getting full sun. Temperatures are best held around 70. Fertilize 
lightly every two weeks at this point. Allow about 130 days from planting to 
first flower.

DO-IT-YOURSELF; CAR THROWS A WRENCH INTO THE PAINTING OF CONCRETE FLOORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At first glance, painting a garage floor -- or any concrete floor -- may seem 
simple enough. You just scrub the floor as best you can, buy a few gallons of 
enamel porch paint and roll it on. 
</P>
<P>
 Although this is exactly the way it's been done for years, the results have 
often been disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
 And new Environmental Protection Agency limits on paint solvents have not been 
a big help. These limits have driven some of the most rugged paints from the 
marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentally friendly, water-based epoxy enamels do work reasonably well 
when applied to concrete floors in basements or in workshops. And they are well 
worth considering for these areas if you want a pigmented surface. 
</P>
<P>
 But when automobiles enter the picture, the slab in your garage becomes a 
different beast than the concrete floor in your basement. Vehicles have a 
tendency to leak fluids, and, on hot summer days, they often arrive with 
sizzling hot tires. 
</P>
<P>
 The first problem is that no conventional paint will stand up to oil, 
gasoline, brake fluid, transmission fluid or any of the petroleum-based 
lubricants needed to keep a car on the road. A few drops on a painted floor 
will cause the paint to blister, and once blistered, no amount of cursing or 
coaxing will make a second coat adhere any better. 
</P>
<P>
 The second problem is that conventional paints are thermo-plastic, which means 
they soften with heat. Park a hot vehicle with hot tires on this paint, and the 
paint will soften, in some cases enough to stick to the tires. Each time you 
back away, a patch of paint can go with you, leaving an unsightly blotch. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid this problem, you need a paint that is thermo-setting -- in other 
words, it cures with heat. These specialty paints have been used at the 
commercial level for years and work well when applied properly. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with thermo-setting paints is that they really aren't made for 
homeowners. They are generally two-part epoxies, which must be mixed on-site 
and applied very quickly, often in less than 30 minutes. Also, because of their 
high volatility, they require plenty of ventilation, protective clothing and a 
respirator. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turns out, no matter how good the paint, surface preparation is 
critical. As such, most sources recommend sandblasting or acid-washing a 
concrete floor before painting. 
</P>
<P>
 With sandblasting and two coats of paint, a typical garage floor job could 
easily cost more than $500.

HOME IMPROVEMENT; HANDY REPAIR HELP IS A PAGE AWAY IN DO-IT-YOURSELF BOOKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONNIE KOENENN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Home repair is taking on a new urgency in quake-shaken Southern California, 
and even amateurs are taking a look at problems such as loose tiles and cracked 
plaster and wondering if they can fix it themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 A scouting trip to a bookstore could provide the answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who habitually tackles home-remodeling projects -- according to the 
U.S. Census Bureau, that's almost half the home-owning population -- knows 
there is no scarcity of information. Before the Northridge earthquake, 
do-it-yourself was already a major theme for the belt-tightening '90s. The most 
popular program on PBS is "This Old House," and today's brides are registering 
for power tools along with china and silver. 
</P>
<P>
 The surge of home-repair books, magazines, videos and TV shows presents a 
mixed blessing for the novice remodeler. Choosing the right reference source 
has become almost as daunting as wandering the aisles at the local builders' 
supply store with its acres of tools and materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading a parade of new home-repair books is "The Reader's Digest Book of 
Skills and Tools," a fat, colorful volume published last fall. It promises help 
for everyone from the novice who tightens screws with a butter knife to the 
artisan preparing to install parquet flooring. 
</P>
<P>
 The book joins a long list of Reader's Digest do-it-yourself titles, including 
"The Home Improvement Manual" and "The New, Complete Do-It-Yourself Manual." 
</P>
<P>
 The 360-page book has 2,000 illustrations, including 800 photographs of hand 
and power tools and accessories and 1,000 detailed drawings of techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 "An empowering book," says Doug Dutton, owner of Dutton's Brentwood Books. 
"Going to a Home Depot is an overwhelming experience. You could take this book 
to the hardware store and point."  
</P>
<P>
 He says the tightened economy is only one reason for a booming interest in 
do-it-yourself books. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a time when we seem to have so little power over what's around us -- we 
don't even know what's under the hood of our car anymore -- this is one of the 
few areas where you can actually have a certain amount of control over what 
you're doing," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Skills and Tools" ($30) is one of four major new books offering an 
encyclopedic scope for home repairs and remodeling, he says. Others: 
</P>
<P>
 * "Bob Vila's Toolbox," $25, William Morrow, 235 pages. The well-known home 
renovator ("This Old House" and "Bob Vila's Home Again"), who is also the TV 
spokesman for Sears, offers a comprehensive illustrated guide to hand and power 
tools.  
</P>
<P>
 * "The Stanley Complete Step-by-Step Book of Home Repair and Improvement," 
$25, Simon and Schuster, 470 pages. The emphasis is on projects, from 
installing alarm systems to masonry. Replete with color drawings of tools and 
equipment and a bonus of $75 worth of coupons from the Stanley Tool Co. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ortho's Home Improvement Encyclopedia, $24.95, Ortho, 511 pages. Heavy focus 
on photographs, with some line drawings, of specific interior and exterior 
projects such as building a patio. 
</P>
<P>
 Television and home videos also are popular with do-it-yourself consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 Two PBS staples are produced at Boston's WGBH-TV. "This Old House," now in its 
10th year, focuses each season on the comprehensive renovation of one house. It 
airs in Orange County on Saturdays at 4:30 p.m. on KOCE Channel 50 and at 5:30 
p.m. on KCET Channel 28. "New Yankee Workshop," which concentrates on 
woodworking projects, launched its sixth season in January with an emphasis on 
children's toys and furniture. It airs Saturdays at 4 p.m. on KOCE and at 5 
p.m. on KCET. 
</P>
<P>
 For do-it-yourselfers, both shows produce a line of videos demonstrating 
specific projects. Tips on Safety for Home Work 
</P>
<P>
 For people unaccustomed to doing their own home repairs, maintenance or 
remodeling, "The Reader's Digest Book of Skills and Tools" offers safety 
advice: 
</P>
<P>
 * Make sure you have safety equipment -- such as goggles, earplugs and dust 
masks -- appropriate for the task. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't wear gloves when handling tools that require a firm grip. Do wear them 
when working with rough materials, sharp edges and broken glass and when 
cleaning up after a project. 
</P>
<P>
 * If a cutting tool stalls because of an impediment, switch off the power and 
unplug the tool before trying to remove the impediment. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you set up a ladder or scaffold in front of a door, lock or bar the door. 
</P>
<P>
 * When using a ladder, climb only as high as the third step from the top; 
never stand on the braces, extension arms or paint shelf. 
</P>
<P>
 * When soldering, remember that lead solder is toxic. The work area should be 
ventilated. 
</P>
<P>
 * Always wear eye protection when working with metal to prevent injury from 
splinters; also wear heavy gloves and long sleeves to protect against sharp 
edges. 
</P>
<P>
 * Install a fire extinguisher and smoke alarms in your work area. 
</P>
<P>
 * When working with tools, don't wear sandals, open-toe or canvas shoes, and 
avoid loose-fitting clothing, which could become entangled in a power tool and 
cause serious injury. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't leave tools, hardware or building materials lying around when not in 
use. They're an invitation to an accident, especially if you have children.

GARDENING; HIGH-ENERGY HUMMINGBIRDS ARE ORNAMENTAL POLLINATORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The sight of a hummingbird is such a delight that certain plants are worth 
growing for the sole purpose of attracting it. 
</P>
<P>
 Hummingbirds' favorite food is floral nectar.Flowers that yield their nectar 
to hummingbirds do ask for something in return -- that the hummingbirds 
pollinate the blossoms. 
</P>
<P>
 Such ornithophilous (bird-pollinated) flowers have little need for insect 
pollinators, which are attracted to blue flowers. Hummingbirds are attracted to 
brilliant reds, oranges and yellows because they stand out against leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 The typical flower also has a long tube into which hummingbirds, but not much 
else, can reach. Because hummingbirds can hover in midair, such flowers do not 
need "landing platforms." 
</P>
<P>
 Hummingbirds are not hard to attract to the garden. In fact, they can be 
downright aggressive, often driving away larger birds. 
</P>
<P>
 And hummingbirds do more than decorate the garden. These birds supplement 
their high carbohydrate diet with some protein, which they get by picking tasty 
morsels such as aphids off plant tips, or capturing insects in flight.

HOME SAFETY; SMALL BATHROOM POSES BIG HAZARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Though usually small in size, the bathroom plays a big role in home accidents 
as the site of falls, electric shocks, poisonings and scaldings. Here are some 
tips on preventing bathroom accidents: 
</P>
<P>
 Avoiding Falls 
</P>
<P>
 * Provide good lighting, including a night light. You can avoid hazards if you 
see them. 
</P>
<P>
 * Use only rugs or carpets with non-skid backing. In the tub or shower, use 
suction-backed mats or non-skid adhesive decals or strips. Don't depend on 
rough patches already on the tub or shower floor. 
</P>
<P>
 * Install grab bars in the tub or shower and, if you have an elderly or 
disabled resident, next to the toilet. Fasten a grab bar to studs in the wall 
to ensure reliability. It must remain secured if a person's entire weight is 
thrown on it. 
</P>
<P>
 * Use only shatterproof safety glass or heavy-duty plastic for your tub or 
shower. Check with a supplier about products with American National Standard 
Institute certification. 
</P>
<P>
 Preventing Poisoning 
</P>
<P>
 Prescription drugs and other medications can be a hazard for young children. 
Keep all medications, including vitamins, in childproof containers and out of 
the bathroom cabinet. Or equip the cabinet with a lock. Discard outdated 
medications. 
</P>
<P>
 * Store cleaning products in a high cabinet, top closet shelf or some other 
place inaccessible to young children -- preferably one that is locked. Put 
cleaning products back promptly after use. 
</P>
<P>
 Preventing Scalding 
</P>
<P>
 * Never leave young children alone in a tub. They can easily fall or burn 
themselves by turning on the hot water tap. 
</P>
<P>
 * Always check water temperature before you enter a tub or shower. If your 
shower douses you with hot water when another tap is turned on or a toilet is 
flushed, have a plumber install a mixing valve with a built-in temperature and 
pressure regulator. Avoid burns by setting the water heater at 120 degrees 
Fahrenheit. 
</P>
<P>
 Electrical Hazards 
</P>
<P>
 Water is an excellent conductor of electricity, so be very careful when using 
electricity in the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 * Plug unused electric outlets with plastic covers, which are available at 
hardware stores. 
</P>
<P>
 * Avoid using electric appliances, such as space heaters, hair dryers, tape 
players or radios in the bathroom. If someone insists on listening to music or 
news there, get a battery-operated model. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't operate light switches or use any kind of appliance, including a 
shaver, when your hands or feet are wet, or if standing on a wet rug. 
</P>
<P>
 * Most new appliances have built-in cords, but those on some older appliances 
detach. Unplug a cord from the wall first; a cord dangling from an outlet can 
cause severe shock if dropped into water. Unplug appliances as soon as you're 
finished with them. Even better, when you buy new appliances, get cordless 
models. 
</P>
<P>
 * If your bathroom doesn't already have them, consider installing ground fault 
interrupters (GFIs) to prevent the possibility of fatal shock. A GFI is a 
highly sensitive device that cuts off power almost instantly if there is any 
current leakage -- well before the current flow can cause serious harm. A GFI 
can be installed by an electrician in a circuit-breaker panel to protect an 
entire circuit, or in a wall outlet. 
</P>
<P>
 Door Locks 
</P>
<P>
 * Privacy is less important than safety. If you must have a lock on a bathroom 
door, install a doorknob with an outside lock release.

INTERIORS; CERAMIC TILES PUT ACCENTS ON FLOORS, WALLS AND MORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You can put ornamental ceramic tile on walls or floor without blowing your 
decorating budget. Just use it as accents and borders. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are many options in pattern, texture, color, even size and shape," says 
Judith Gura, a representative for the Italian tile industry in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 Flat tiles come in many sizes, ranging from two-inch squares to 24-inch 
squares. Rectangular tiles are also available, but the most common sizes are 
four-inch and eight-inch squares for walls and 12-inch squares for floors.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition, edge tiles are available in many patterns. Finished on all edges, 
they can be used for small decorative projects such as a tabletop. Dimensional 
molding tiles come in shapes similar to wood moldings and are sold in lengths 
typically of eight to 12 inches. So-called pencils are narrow half-round 
moldings. 
</P>
<P>
 Gura, who collects examples of tile used in interesting ways by American 
decorators, says a number of recent ideas can create a big effect for 
relatively little effort and cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, only a small portion of a wall or a floor is tiled. One idea, for 
example, is to edge a fireplace opening with different tile patterns and 
colors. Another is to create a tile "headboard" on a bedroom wall. It can 
extend to form a backdrop for bedside tables, too. The tiling is framed by a 
narrow wood molding. 
</P>
<P>
 Designers often create an "area rug" by installing decorative tiles in the 
center of a tile or wood floor. Tiles can also create a decorative border 
around the perimeter of a room. 
</P>
<P>
 Tile a windowsill, maybe even around the window frame. Use the same tiles to 
cover a wood cornice. A simple curtain or shade is all that's needed to 
complete this unusual window treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Use small pictorial tiles as a border on the wall. If the tiles are placed at 
chair-rail height, paint the lower half of the wall in a darker color and the 
upper part in a lighter color. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiling kitchen countertops and back splashes is common. But what about 
installing a colorful sweep of tile behind the stove from range-top to ceiling? 
The treatment, reminiscent of an old Dutch room, adds pattern and color to the 
kitchen and protects the wall from cooking spatters. 
</P>
<P>
 For do-it-yourselfers, consider honing your tile-laying skills on a small 
tabletop or square planter or install decorative tiles around an unframed wall 
mirror. 
</P>
<P>
 When selecting tile, make sure it is suitable for its intended use by checking 
with a retailer or reading manufacturer's literature. Any tile can be used for 
a wall, but for a floor, more durable tiles are required. A foyer or bathroom 
floor, where water is tracked in or dribbled, should be impervious to water on 
both the underside and the glazed side, Gura says. 
</P>
<P>
 For floors, a level surface is critical. Without it, tiles are liable to crack 
with wear. Consult your retailer for methods of leveling a floor that is not 
badly out of alignment. A smooth wall makes for a more attractive installation. 
The wall can often be leveled by sanding or, in more serious cases, by covering 
it with wallboard. 
</P>
<P>
 The larger the area, the more difficult the installation. But no matter the 
size, it doesn't pay to rush the measurements before setting the tiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Gura: "A professional installer measures very carefully."

 Sewer Vents May Be Cause of Odors 
</P>
<P>
 Question: There is a musty odor throughout my mobile home, particularly by the 
door in the kitchen, and I don't know where it's coming from. All of the drains 
seem fine and the carpet is new and we have no pets. Any ideas? 
</P>
<P>
 J.W. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: "It's not uncommon to find odd odors in a mobile home, but tracking 
them down can be a problem," says Beth Land of Midway Mobile in Anaheim. "After 
several years, there's usually enough sludge buildup in the sewer vents that, 
with the heavy night air, the fumes remain down near the roof and are picked up 
by the furnace or air conditioner, which circulate it throughout the coach. 
This is often solved by raising the vent pipes up higher on the roof, or 
cleaning out the sludge." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: My concrete garage floor is sloped lower than the asphalt driveway, and 
when it rains, water rolls into the garage. I had a rubber seal placed on the 
bottom of my new garage door, but this doesn't seem to be helping the problem. 
Are there any solutions besides replacing the driveway or garage floor? 
</P>
<P>
 C.L. 
</P>
<P>
 La Habra 
</P>
<P>
 A: "It's going to depend on the severity of the slope," says Bill Sink of 
Angelus Building Supply in Santa Ana. "If it's no more than a half-inch, you 
may be able to build the area up so that it falls away from the garage with a 
combination of cement, sand and concrete adhesive. However, if the slope is too 
great, the driveway or garage will have to be redone so that water isn't 
draining through the door." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I have a 14-year-old home with a nice brick patio and barbecue. I'd like to 
put up a low brick wall with the same ridged bricks, but haven't had any luck 
finding them. Would it be worth finding someone to make what I need in this 
pattern? 
</P>
<P>
 B.M. 
</P>
<P>
 Yorba Linda 
</P>
<P>
 A: "You may want to check with some brick outlets first," says Ken Newland of 
Tustin Block. "Ridged bricks are available, it's just that you won't find much 
of a selection of them at the local hardware warehouse store. An independent 
brick dealer will have a wider selection of brick styles available. Having a 
particular brick made will be very expensive, and if you find that it's not 
sold anymore, you may need to get a brick that matches." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: A year ago when I installed a new water heater, I had a hard time hooking 
up the vent that fits on top. I noticed that the vent has come off, but before 
I put it back up, I was wondering that since the water heater is in the garage, 
do I really need it to be vented outside? 
</P>
<P>
 S.S. 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente 
</P>
<P>
 A: "Absolutely," says Ted Blanke of Central Plumbing & Heating Supply in La 
Habra. "You've got a monoxide gas being released, which can be deadly. If the 
garage is attached to the house, the gas could find a way into the living 
areas. The best way to install a vent is to hook it up and connect it together 
with sheet metal screws at each joint so that it doesn't separate. Many times 
people will store boxes or material near a water heater and these could bump 
into the vent pipe and disturb it. Check to see that the area is clear." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I want to spray-paint my mailbox white, but in my previous experience with 
spray painting, I've never been able to get good, even coats. What should I do 
to get it right? 
</P>
<P>
 R.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Seal Beach 
</P>
<P>
 A: "The key is to spray multiple, thin coats," says Jim Grant of Dutch Boy 
Home Decorating Center in Santa Ana. "Many people make the mistake of applying 
a thick coat of paint thinking they won't have to spray it again, but when you 
do it that way you'll have a problem with runs and missed areas. You'll have to 
spray over the area, let it dry according to the manufacturer's instructions, 
and then re-spray."

E-MAIL DELIVERS LIFE-SAVING MEDICAL HELP; TECHNOLOGY: COMPUTER ANALYST SENDS 
SOS TO CO-WORKERS, WHO QUICKLY COME TO HIS AID. HIS PAIN WORSENED AFTER A 
DOCTOR HAD PUT HIM ON HOLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There have been romances by E-mail, support groups by E-mail and fund raising 
by E-mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Jack Miller has received lifesaving medical help using his electronic 
computer mail. 
</P>
<P>
 The computing analyst -- stricken in his work cubicle with increasingly severe 
chest pains and losing consciousness -- punched a few keys on his terminal and 
sent an SOS to co-workers at Witco Corp. in Woodcliff Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 They came running and administered CPR while waiting for paramedics to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, E-mail means emergency mail," Miller, 56, told the New York Daily 
News from his Paramus home, where he is recuperating. "I was going and nobody 
would have noticed." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller isn't doing any more interviews for now about the March 17 emergency. 
His telephone answering machine had a recorded message Friday, which said: 
"You've reached Jack Miller. The ringer is off and I'm too fatigued to give any 
kind of an interview. I thank you for your interest in calling." 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Edelstein, a vice president at the chemical and petroleum company, said 
Miller is doing well but has not said when he will return to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said he first felt the chest pain on St. Patrick's Day during a 
lunchtime walk. When he returned to his isolated computer terminal he called 
his physician. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctor put him on hold and the pain worsened. He tried to shout for help 
but couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
 So Miller used the only other method available. He typed, "HELP. FEEL SICK. 
NEED AID." 
</P>
<P>
 "I could barely tap out the words," he said. "My chest had this strange 
coldness and I just couldn't breathe." 
</P>
<P>
 The message, intended for a few nearby co-workers, popped up on the screens of 
80 workers because Miller had hit the key programmed to send messages to all 
employees in his department, Edelstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Within seconds, dozens of employees were darting through a maze of cubicles 
looking for the source of the distress call. Some who were certified in 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation worked on Miller until an ambulance crew 
transported him to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the human element of the technologically linked community . . . the 
information highway," said Howard Rheingold, author of "The Virtual Community." 
</P>
<P>
 There are other stories, both touching and threatening, in the digital 
society. 
</P>
<P>
 Burke Stinson and Nancy J. Smith stayed in touch and in love through E-mail, 
conducting an electronic courtship before their wedding last year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The AT&T workers -- he in Basking Ridge and she in Philadelphia 60 miles away 
-- racked up more than 400 pages of love letters. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton received a threat via E-mail, the Secret Service said 
Friday. The threat was sent through a computer account belonging to a former 
student at a Cincinnati school, and the agency believes someone else got hold 
of the former student's password without his knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 E-mail and other forms of computer communications also can be used for support 
groups, fund raising and helping strangers. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half of the 2,000 largest companies in North America have some form 
of E-mail, according to the Electronic Messaging Assn., an industry trade 
group.

EPA HIKES ESTIMATE OF COST TO REMOVE DRINKING-WATER RADON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Average water bills for some families would have to be increased by as much as 
$242 a year to reduce radon in drinking water and prevent 84 cancer deaths a 
year, the Environmental Protection Agency reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The $242 annual increase would hit families in rural areas served by water 
systems that rely more on underground wells and have fewer than 100 customers. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA officials calculated that customers of large systems supplied primarily 
from surface water would pay an average of $5 more a year. 
</P>
<P>
 After what it called one of its most comprehensive cost-benefit analyses ever, 
the EPA acknowledged that the radon program would cost 50% more than it 
originally estimated. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of $180 million a year when the regulations were first proposed, the 
EPA said Friday that the total annual costs including amortizing $1.6 billion 
in new technology to meet the standards would be $272 million a year, or 
roughly $3.2 million for each life saved. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, the agency said, full compliance with its voluntary program for 
reducing indoor radon pollution in the air could prevent up to 2,200 cancer 
fatalities a year at an estimated cost of $700,000 per life saved. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA issued the proposed regulations in 1991 under the 1986 Safe Drinking 
Water Act and is under orders from a federal judge in Oregon to make them final 
by April 30, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 But the regulations have become the focal point in a debate between the 
Clinton Administration and critics in both parties over the cost-effectiveness 
of environmental standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Radon -- a colorless, odorless, radioactive gas occurring naturally in the 
soil and ground water -- is the second-leading cause of lung cancer in the 
United States, behind cigarette smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA estimates that about 19 million people are exposed to the gas at a 
level above its proposed drinking water standards and another 15 million at a 
level above its voluntary indoor air pollution limits.

DR. PAUL SPANGLER, 95; HEALTH ADVOCATE STARTED RUNNING AT 67 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paul E. Spangler, the elderly physician who did not take up jogging until he 
was 67 and spent the rest of his life trying to get his peers off their seats 
and on their feet, died this week while running. 
</P>
<P>
 He was 95, said his daughter, Betty Nolen, from the family home in San Luis 
Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing that would have been better is if he had died at the finish 
line of the New York City Marathon," she said. "I praised God and thanked Jesus 
for letting him die with his running shoes on." 
</P>
<P>
 Spangler collapsed Tuesday not far from his home during an early morning run, 
Coroner Don Hines said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that he died running is so supremely wonderful," Dr. Walter Bortz, a 
Stanford University gerontologist told Associated Press. Bortz last saw his 
friend two weekends ago at the school's Fifty-Plus Fitness Assn. run. 
</P>
<P>
 Spangler often appeared with Bortz, author of the fitness book "We Live Too 
Short and Die Too Long." 
</P>
<P>
 "Paul would always say, 'I'm the proof of what Bortz said,' " the author said. 
"Paul certainly didn't live too short or die too long, so he fulfilled my very 
best design." 
</P>
<P>
 Spangler was a 1923 graduate of Harvard Medical School and a Navy doctor for 
17 years. 
</P>
<P>
 He did not take up running until he was 67 and realized that "my peers, 
classmates, relatives, all were dying around me from heart attacks," he said in 
a 1992 interview with The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 He began jogging in the hills behind the California Men's Colony prison, where 
he worked for seven years as a surgeon until his second retirement in 1969 at 
age 70. 
</P>
<P>
 A longtime friend and neighbor, Don Patrick, said Spangler's training schedule 
called for running about seven miles a day three days a week. On odd days, he 
would lift weights and swim half a mile. 
</P>
<P>
 He watched his diet but did not deprive himself of red meat. He substituted 
yogurt for ice cream and baked his own bread. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, after doing less than his personal best in the New York City 
Marathon (nine hours as opposed to the four-hour marathons he ran at age 78), 
Spangler vowed to do better. He intended to run another marathon, he said, when 
he was 100. And after that? 
</P>
<P>
 "I actually think I have a good chance of making 110."

RAYMOND GEIGER; EDITOR OF FARMER'S ALMANAC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Raymond Geiger, 83, the editor who brought weather forecasts, gardening tips 
and quips to readers of the Farmer's Almanac for six decades. Geiger once 
estimated that he traveled about 5 million miles, delivered 3,500 speeches and 
gave 18,000 interviews to pitch the virtues of his almanac.He retired last fall 
after editing his 60th edition. Like those that preceded it, it was full of 
weather tips, planting and gardening advice, recipes and plenty of jokes. Among 
his editorial campaigns over the years was a successful one to restore place 
names on postmarks. The Postal Service had tried to replace the names with 
codes. Among unsuccessful campaigns: to extend daylight saving time, move 
Thanksgiving to October and replace the paper dollar with a coin. The almanac's 
New Hampshire-based rival, the Old Farmer's Almanac, was founded in 1792 and is 
sold in stores. The Farmer's Almanac came a quarter-century later and is sold 
in bulk to banks, insurance companies and others who imprint their names on it 
and give it away. In Lewiston, Me., on Friday.

F. SCHREIDER; EXPLORED WORLD BY LAND, SEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Frank Schreider, an intrepid explorer who circumnavigated the globe retracing 
the routes of ancient seamen, has died. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife and co-adventurer, Helen, said this week he had died aboard his sloop 
Sassafras off Crete. He had been midway through a three-year voyage sailing the 
Aegean and Crete seas on his 40-foot boat. 
</P>
<P>
 Helen Schreider said this week she was planning to fly to Greece from their 
home in Santa Fe, N.M. to accompany him on the remainder of the voyage when she 
received word of his death of a heart attack Jan. 21. He was 70. 
</P>
<P>
 Formerly of Los Angeles, the Schreiders for three decades had sailed from the 
Arctic Circle to the tip of Tierra del Fuego, emulated the conquering journeys 
of Alexander the Great and traversed the length of the Indonesian Archipelago. 
</P>
<P>
 They also walked, sailed, canoed, rafted and motored down the entire 4,000 
miles of the Amazon from its source in Peru. 
</P>
<P>
 From their travels came three books and countless articles in National 
Geographic, Saturday Evening Post and many other national and international 
publications. 
</P>
<P>
 To enable them to travel over water, Schreider made a floating jeep he called 
"La Tortuga" (The Turtle) from a World War II amphibious jeep. Sometimes 
traveling with their dogs, they made their way through jungles where there were 
no roads and motored across the surf of Panama to bridge the gaps in the Pan 
American Highway. They also passed into the Great Rift Valley of East Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Their 18-month journey across the Strait of Magellan to Tierra del Fuego 
resulted in their first book, "Twenty Thousand Miles South," serialized in the 
Post as "We Made the Impossible Trip." 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Schreider, the photographer of the team, also produced a documentary 
based on that journey. 
</P>
<P>
 Their other books included "The Drums of Tonkin," about their Indonesian 
venture and "Exploring the Amazon." The Amazon adventure earned the Schreiders 
a spot in the Guinness Book of World Records for the "longest navigable 
journey." 
</P>
<P>
 Schreider, a submariner in World War II, was a 1950 graduate of UCLA where he 
met his wife.

ROBERT DOISNEAU; PARISIAN PHOTOGRAPHER OF 'THE KISS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert Doisneau, 81, whose intimate, often poignant pictures of Parisians 
became some of the world's best-known photographs. Doisneau was noted for his 
pictures of Paris night life, of lovers and children, workers and circus 
performers.Even when posed, his black-and-white photos seemed to freeze a 
natural instant of anonymous real life. One of his most famous pictures, "The 
Kiss at City Hall," was the subject of a legal dispute last year. A retired 
couple was rebuffed by a court after claiming they were the young lovers 
immortalized stealing a kiss on a Paris street in 1950 while people pass by 
indifferently. They lost their case after Doisneau acknowledged he had paid two 
models to pose for the picture. In Paris on Friday after heart surgery.

TIRED LAKERS PLAY FOLLOW THE LEADER; PRO BASKETBALL: AFTER BARELY LOSING AT 
FIRST-PLACE SEATTLE, L.A. COMES BACK TO DEFEAT THE FIRST-PLACE ROCKETS, 101-88. 
</P>

 The Lakers were playing for the second night in a row, going from playing 
Pacific Division leader Seattle on the road Thursday to Midwest Division 
co-leader Houston at the Forum. So the game Friday was not supposed to be 
close. It wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Lakers 101, Rockets 88. 
</P>
<P>
 Before 15,316, the Lakers dominated the second half. Nick Van Exel had a 
game-high 31 points, including five three-pointers to tie the team 
single-season record with 106. The co-holder, Magic Johnson, has moved on to 
new frontiers. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just put it in our heads we could beat them," Van Exel said after the 
Lakers improved to 3-1 under Johnson, the lone loss a three-pointer to the 
SuperSonics. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Johnson: "We are making great strides. The defense was fabulous. I mean, 
to hold a first-place team to that many points, we're doing a great job." 
</P>
<P>
 Making Sedale Threatt part of the offense again was an early focus for the 
Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Always quick on the trigger, Threatt went in with only six, zero and two 
attempts in the first three games since Johnson replaced Randy Pfund. And, 
after averaging 18.4 points in 17 consecutive starts, he had scored only eight, 
zero and two points in those games, an obvious factor in the Lakers going from 
110 points against Milwaukee to 89 against Minnesota and then 92 against 
Seattle on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got to get Sedale back," Johnson said. "I kind of lost him. I said no 
more jump shots, so he's like, 'Where do I fit in?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson never actually prohibited outside shots, only encouraged the Lakers to 
get the ball inside more. The result has been a windfall for Elden Campbell -- 
a career-high 26 attempts against the Timberwolves -- but only a fall for 
Threatt. That was never more evident than in the first half Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Threatt had three attempts as the offense, with 32.7% shooting, continued to 
sputter, but what stood out was the one he didn't take. When he hesitated and 
then passed up a 15-footer with the shot clock at one, an almost unheard-of 
development, the result was a 24-second violation. The Lakers, who failed to 
get a shot in a critical situation in the three-point loss the night before at 
Seattle, committed the same turnover four possessions later to open the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 That was part of a stretch in which they went 5:38 without a point, the 
Rockets taking a 31-23 lead. From there, though, the Lakers regrouped to cut 
the deficit to 42-40 at halftime. The rally was capped by Vlade Divac banking 
in a straightaway three-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers needed one minute of the third quarter to take the lead, then 
didn't fall behind the rest of the period. When Houston pulled into a 53-53 
tie, Van Exel answered with back-to-back three-pointers from nearly the exact 
spot on the left side, in front of the Laker bench. 
</P>
<P>
 That was worth a 59-53 lead, before Van Exel handed the chores off to James 
Worthy. Starting with two free throws with 3:36 remaining, Worthy scored nine 
of the Lakers' next 11 points, good for a 70-61 lead. The lead went to double 
digits on James Edwards' free throw with 17 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Turns out the Lakers, looking to avoid being swept by the Rockets for the 
first time, were merely warming up. They took the momentum from the third 
quarter into the fourth to grab a 74-61 lead, when Tony Smith beat the shot 
clock with a three-pointer. With seven minutes remaining, the lead was 79-69. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers finished equally strong. 
</P>
<P>
 Threatt, however, still wasn't a factor, finishing with those three shots and 
no baskets in 19 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Divac had 16 points and 13 rebounds, Campbell 13 and 12. Hakeem Olajuwon had 
28 points, 12 rebounds and four blocks for the Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Exel also joined George Lynch, who had 30 points in Johnson's coaching 
debut, as the only Laker rookies to score 30 points since Johnson did it in 
1979-80.

NEWS IS BIG FOR DREIFORT AND PARK; BASEBALL: BOTH DODGER PITCHERS ARE TOLD THEY 
WILL START OUT IN THE MAJOR LEAGUES. THE ANGELS THEN SCORE A 2-0 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It was a historic moment for South Korea as well as the Dodgers, and this time 
Chan Ho Park needed no interpreter. In a room off a tunnel at Dodger Stadium, 
Park and Darren Dreifort looked out to a crush of reporters while the news was 
announced that both have made the team. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Dodgers, Dreifort became the first drafted player since Sandy Koufax 
to skip the minors since the amateur draft began in 1965. Dreifort and Park 
became the 17th and 18th players in baseball to skip the minors since '65. 
</P>
<P>
 It marks the first time a Korean has made it to the major leagues, and the 
usually animated Park was deeply humbled. When he and Dreifort were told the 
news before Friday night's 2-0 exhibition loss to the Angels, Park said he 
cried. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something has been achieved that has never been done before," Park said, 
speaking through his interpreter, Don Yi. "I believe that this event is going 
to give pride and hope to youngsters." 
</P>
<P>
 Dodger President Peter O'Malley remained in Vero Beach, Fla., after the team 
broke camp, but he couldn't have been more excited about Park. It was O'Malley 
who spearheaded signing Park in January, and the attention that Park brought to 
Dodgertown reminded O'Malley of the days of Fernando Valenzuela. Park was 
besieged during the spring by reporters, both American and Korean, a situation 
that probably will continue. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The spring) was a little difficult for me, but knowing that the people 
expect me and want me to achieve this, and the support they have given me has 
helped me," Park said. "And continuously I believe that all the encouragement 
and faith that the Korean people have toward me will guide me and lead me." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Park, 20, and Dreifort, 21, will start the season in the bullpen, 
primarily in long relief, but Park is expected to eventually become a starter. 
Dreifort is targeted as a closer. The two right-handers have vastly different 
personalities, with Dreifort very low-key and Park outgoing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we catch an equal amount of flack from people for being rookies, but 
I think that helps us out because we are in the same situation," Dreifort said. 
"We have become pretty good friends over the last six weeks -- the language 
barrier is a little bit of a problem, but Don Yi does a good job." 
</P>
<P>
 The cultural differences in baseball will be an obstacle for Park, who has 
already seen the rule that various hesitations he employed in his delivery were 
illegal. There is also a difference between rules here and in South Korea on 
what constitutes a balk, and Park was called for six during the spring. The 
rest of the Dodger staff had none. 
</P>
<P>
 The language barrier is further complicated because Park's interpreter will 
not be allowed to sit on the bench during the game or visit the mound. "I don't 
know how I'm going to talk with him, because I don't speak Korean," Mike Piazza 
said. "But he knows some English and what is going on. Chan Ho is smart, and it 
will work out." 
</P>
<P>
 The news was well received in the clubhouse, where many of the players had 
already predicted that Dreifort would become the new Pedro Martinez, who was 
traded to the Montreal Expos for Delino DeShields. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not big on the age thing, saying that a player needs to start at a lower 
level because he needs this or he needs that," said DeShields, who was 21 when 
he broke in with the Expos. "I went out and never looked back. Dreifort has 
already pitched before thousands (for Wichita State) in the College World 
Series. And with the way Chan Ho has been throwing, what more do you have to 
see?" 
</P>
<P>
 Park is known for his fastball -- clocked at 95 m.p.h. -- although he didn't 
throw it as much during the spring, instead relying more on his slider, 
curveball and forkball. The Dodgers have talked with him about using his 
fastball more. Dreifort throws a slider, curveball and sinker. But it was more 
than their pitches that convinced pitching coach Ron Perranoski they were ready 
for the majors.  
</P>
<P>
 "Both of them stand on the mound with no fear," Perranoski said. "Both of them 
got into jams out there during the spring, and they weren't fazed by it. They 
were able to not only make the pitches to get out of it, but they both made 
some great pitches to do it. They not only can pitch out, but they do it at 
another level." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers invested $2.5 million in them, signing Dreifort, their No. 1 draft 
pick last June, to a bonus of $1.3 million, and Park for $1.2 million. In 
addition, both will be paid $109,000 this season under a minimum major league 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not something that we have given to these two players, this is 
something they have earned with their ability, with their presence and 
everything they have done in spring training," said Fred Claire, executive vice 
president.  
</P>
<P>
 " . . . Can you predict that they will handle themselves in every way 
throughout the spring to win the job? History said that's a longshot. But these 
aren't the ordinary pitchers, these are the extraordinary pitchers."

A COLLISION WITH THE PAST; PARALYZED REGAZZONI RETURNS AS STREET RACER TO SITE 
OF TRAGEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The buzzing and squealing of a man chasing his past echo interminably across 
the high desert. Then suddenly, silence. 
</P>
<P>
 The modified Toyota Celica, alone amid the scrub brush and tumbleweeds of a 
scarred asphalt track, rolls to a wall. 
</P>
<P>
 The car stops. Driver Clay Regazzoni raises his hands. The noise has returned 
and this time it is him, shouting in Italian. 
</P>
<P>
 It is about a belt. He needs a belt. 
</P>
<P>
 Not a belt for the fan, or alternator, or power steering. 
</P>
<P>
 He needs a belt for his left leg. 
</P>
<P>
 He needs it to keep the useless limb from flopping on his equally useless 
right leg. 
</P>
<P>
 He can't move the leg back with his hands, because his hands do more than 
steer and shift. 
</P>
<P>
 His hands work the gas. And the brakes. And the clutch. 
</P>
<P>
 The rules for this once-great driver are different now. 
</P>
<P>
 But his will is not. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, after winning the inaugural event four years earlier, Regazzoni was 
in an accident in the Long Beach Grand Prix that left him paralyzed from the 
waist down. 
</P>
<P>
 In two weeks, Regazzoni will return to Long Beach for the first time since 
then to prove that legs were the only things lost. 
</P>
<P>
 In what could be the first instance in racing history of a paraplegic driver 
racing again on the site of his paralyzing crash, Regazzoni will compete with 
16 others April 16 in the Toyota Pro-Celebrity race. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually such events serve only as an entertaining preview to the main race -- 
watch your favorite sitcom star spin out at 110 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 But this year's pro-am, one day before the annual Indy car race at the same 
location, contains as many twists as the course. 
</P>
<P>
 Watch Regazzoni drive west down Shoreline Drive as he was doing on the 51st 
lap in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Watch him pass the spot where his brake pedal fell off. 
</P>
<P>
 Watch him drive past the dead-end escape road where his car hit stacks of old 
tires, then a concrete wall, at 160 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 Watch him drive past rescue workers, who took 22 minutes to cut him from 
wreckage that pinned his knees to his helmet. 
</P>
<P>
 Watch him chat with Chuck Jones, the Tustin businessman who was co-owner of 
the car that Regazzoni crashed. A man who will forever wonder if he shouldn't 
have used a different welding technique on that brake pedal. 
</P>
<P>
 Watch him see other old friends. Watch him revisit every old nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't expect to see Regazzoni sweat. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week while practicing here at Willow Springs in Rosamond, 
Regazzoni was shown a picture of the smoldering rubble from 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 He laughed. And he laughed. And he laughed. 
</P>
<P>
 Two co-workers saw this and shivered. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am cold, no?" Regazzoni said. "I am cold." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Regazzoni was on the verge of racing past several other Toyotas driven by 
celebrities during training this week when suddenly he backed off. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hmmm, guess he just stepped on the brake," a Toyota official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man paused before realizing his error. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, uh, I mean, I guess he just used the brake," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As stunning as any driving Regazzoni does these days is the sight of him 
climbing out of his car and into a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
 At 54, this Swiss-Italian with a substantial mustache and temper not only 
still drives with the speed and smarts of a former Formula One champion, but he 
acts the part. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want my life story? I give it to you two minutes!" he screamed at a 
reporter last week. "I do what I always did! I just do it differently!" 
</P>
<P>
 Willow Springs officials made him stop practice briefly last week, and not 
because he was endangering fellow racers. 
</P>
<P>
 It was because he was the only one on the course without a helmet. 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as the other racers finished, Regazzoni removed the helmet again. 
</P>
<P>
 "In these (roofed) cars, what do you need it for?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 His participation in the pro-celebrity race is indeed akin to Michael Jordan 
returning to basketball action in a charity game against sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Jones has lately reminded him, one rule will guide Regazzoni's return 
to Long Beach, even in a street stock car. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how fast he runs, acceptance will come slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, we just need to show people that it's OK, that challenged drivers 
can do it without their legs," said Jones, searching for sponsors for a 
disabled team including Regazzoni and local disabled driver Mitch Payton. 
"People need to realize that once on the course, all drivers are the same. They 
are all just helmets." 
</P>
<P>
 Regazzoni, who began driving within a year of his accident, has raced a 
variety of cars throughout Europe during the last 15 years, including in the 
Paris-Dakar rally. 
</P>
<P>
 He has also founded a disabled driving school in Rome. His influence with the 
government there has helped ease restrictions on the issuance of drivers 
licenses to disabled Italians. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the advancement of hand-control technology, last year he felt 
confident enough to return to his first love, street racing. In October, he 
drove a street stock in an International Motor Sports Assn. race at Sebring, 
Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, Payton had won three such races and the barriers were beginning to 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Regazzoni's car didn't finish, but he and Jones were confident enough to begin 
thinking that with a little publicity, money could be raised for a full-season 
attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Pook, president of the Grand Prix Assn. of Long Beach, says he talked to 
Jones and began thinking the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "As macabre as it may sound, I thought, 'If he needs publicity, he will get an 
incredible amount for returning here for the first time,' " Pook said. "The 
first winner competing in our 20th anniversary. It is an incredible story." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Jones, however, it was a story that Pook initially viewed with 
discomfort. 
</P>
<P>
 "I called Chris and said, 'Would you like to Clay to drive?' " Jones recalled. 
"He was like, 'Oh, yeah . . . but can he?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Pook's recollection of the story differs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am the one who asked Clay to come back," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever, Regazzoni is here, and there will be questions. 
</P>
<P>
 How does he drive? 
</P>
<P>
 He steers and shifts gears with his right hand -- the clutch is a 
touch-sensitive device on top of the shift lever. He works the brake and gas 
with his left hand. 
</P>
<P>
 To work the gas he pushes a ring that looks like a second steering wheel. To 
work the brake he pulls on a metal lever to the left of the steering wheel. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get used to it," Regazzoni said. "You don't even think about it. If you 
have to think about it, then you cannot race." 
</P>
<P>
 What happens if there is a crash and he needs to get out of the car? 
</P>
<P>
 Because these cars have doors, he can pull himself out and roll away. Disabled 
drivers would have more difficulty on the Indy car or Formula One circuit 
because those cars lack doors. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody, though, appears better than Regazzoni at emotionally rolling away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never connected my accident with Long Beach . . . I actually have good 
memories of Long Beach," he said. "Maybe I will have memories when I get on the 
course. But I don't think so. You go on, you know?" 
</P>
<P>
 Regazzoni was in fourth place when he began the 51st lap of the 80-lap Formula 
One race in 1980. But while going 160 m.p.h. on Shoreline Drive, his brake 
pedal fell off shortly before he got to the former Queen's Hairpin turn. 
</P>
<P>
 He steered his red, white and blue car toward the wall, hoping to scrub off 
some speed in a sideswipe, but couldn't because a disabled car driven by 
Ricardo Zunino was sitting there. 
</P>
<P>
 Regazzoni careened off that car, down the 100-yard escape road and into the 
concrete. What resulted was the worst injury in the history of the Sunday race. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "Three seconds, but I remember it like it was forever," Regazzoni said. "Three 
seconds, and in a book I wrote, I talked about it for two full pages." 
</P>
<P>
 What he remembers most is that, because of the sharp decline in speed required 
at that turn, he crashed on the most dangerous spot on the course. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any other corner, there was room to get out," he said. "But I picked the 
worst of all places." 
</P>
<P>
 He also remembers that his car flew down the worst of all escape roads. 
Although the Long Beach Grand Prix used, and still uses, sanctioning racing 
body standards for the length of its escape roads, Regazzoni remembers what 
they didn't use. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looked like they had blocked off a whole long stretch of empty road that 
could have been used," he said. "I wonder about that." 
</P>
<P>
 Regazzoni filed a $10-million suit against the Long Beach Grand Prix Assn. 
because, he claimed, he did not understand the importance of the waiver and 
releases he signed. The suit was dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 He also considered suing Swiss doctors who, he still claims, should not have 
moved him back to a Swiss hospital "just" 18 days after the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "I say I was not paralyzed by the race, I was paralyzed because of what 
doctors did," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that he ever thinks about it. At least, it didn't seem like he was 
thinking about it last week as he wheeled around barking orders. 
</P>
<P>
 "You cannot do what I do and think about the past," he growled, a man 
nonetheless preparing for a collision with it.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA MEN'S FINAL FOUR; REMAINING UP FRONT WITH HOPES FOR 
TITLE; GAME 2: DIFFERENT ROADS LEAD TO THE SAME DESTINATION FOR DUKE'S CHEROKEE 
PARKS AND FLORIDA'S ANDREW DECLERCQ.

<P>
 When last seen together three years ago, Cherokee Parks was the toast of 
Cameron Indoor Stadium and Andrew DeClercq was the afterthought, the seventh 
name on a Duke recruiting list of six. 
</P>
<P>
 Both played center. Both had chosen the evening of the Blue Devils' Blue-White 
game to make their official visit to the school. Both were eager for a 
scholarship offer. 
</P>
<P>
 As they sat there that night on the wooden bleachers of Cameron, the crowd 
began serenading the coveted Parks, who played at Huntington Beach's Marina 
High and was considered one of the finest low post prospects in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cher-o-kee!" yelled one side of the cramped arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parks!" yelled the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Back and forth it went for nearly five strange minutes until Parks turned to 
Mickie Krzyzewski, wife of Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski and said, "How do you 
make them stop?" 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to stand up and wave to the crowd," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 So Parks stood and waved, leaving the audience then to figure out what to do 
about the lesser-known recruit, DeClercq. 
</P>
<P>
 "My last name was a little more difficult than Parks," DeClercq recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd did what it could, but it wasn't the same. DeClercq didn't mind. He 
let them struggle for a few minutes and then took a quick bow. What the heck, 
right? Parks already had told him that he loved the place and planned to sign 
with the Blue Devils, leaving DeClercq to look elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks went off to Duke and earned a national championship ring his first year 
in a Blue Devil uniform. DeClercq went to basketball no-name Florida, where the 
Gators went to the NIT. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, on equal footing at last, Parks and DeClercq will play in the second 
game of the NCAA semifinals at the Charlotte Coliseum. Parks still will likely 
receive more applause -- after all, Charlotte is in the middle of Atlantic 
Coast Conference territory and only 2 1/2 hours from the Durham campus -- but 
that isn't really the point. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've worked really hard all year trying to get people to notice us playing 
basketball," DeClercq said. 
</P>
<P>
 And here's what the Gators, underdogs once more, have to show for it: their 
first Final Four game against a program that has been to seven of the last nine 
of these things. Along the way, Duke has won two of the last three national 
titles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to do the same thing and catch up to their standards," Florida 
point guard Dan Cross said. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, so good for the Gators. Consider the similarities between the two 
teams: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Krzyzewski stresses family and team concepts. Kruger does the same. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Krzyzewski considers defense the most important component of a team. Kruger 
does, too. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Krzyzewski once again has built his team around guards. The same goes for 
Kruger. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Krzyzewski has one of the top three players in the country in swingman 
Grant Hill and, in recent years, has had his pick of some of the best recruits 
available. Kruger, uh, has one of the top three heaviest players in the country 
in center/forward Dametri Hill, who has slimmed down from 350 to 290. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, don't count on a lopsided game. Florida's four other NCAA opponents 
figured on victories and look where it got them -- at home, wondering what if. 
</P>
<P>
 DeClercq used to do that. Last season, when the Gators were beaten in the 
first round of the NIT, DeClercq found himself watching the Blue Devils in the 
NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "You think about it," DeClercq said. "You say, 'What if I had gone there? 
Would I be playing or sitting on the bench?' " 
</P>
<P>
 And now? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy where I'm at," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 So are the Gators, who began the tournament as the No. 3 seed in the East 
Regional. But thanks to the backcourt of Cross and Craig Brown, the work ethic 
of DeClercq and the surprising play of Hill, who has made 31 of his last 49 
field goal attempts, Florida made it to Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it is one thing to have Dametri Hill and quite another to have Duke 
All-American Grant Hill, probably the most versatile and best defensive player 
in the country.  
</P>
<P>
 In the Southeast Regional final, freshman point guard Jeff Capel, forward 
Antonio Lang and Parks played brilliantly against Purdue as Hill was stuck on 
the bench for six minutes with foul trouble. Since then, Krzyzewski has said 
more responsibility will be placed on Capel and a little less on Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks will guard Dametri Hill at game's beginning, but eventually DeClercq 
will find himself matched against his former recruiting buddy. Parks said it 
will be an interesting reunion. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's extra intense," Parks said. "He's one of those players you hate to play 
against." 
</P>
<P>
 Funny how this all worked out. Cheers three years ago. Cheers again tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Parks: "It seems like we both made pretty good decisions."

MIKE DOWNEY: HE'S MEEK IN NAME ONLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The scar runs vertically up his calf, jagged as a needle line from a 
polygraph. Duke basketball player Erik Meek is inside the team's dressing room, 
doing some stretching before practice. Lifting his leg behind him and latching 
onto his ankle, he provides a closer look at a gash that must be at least eight 
inches long. A drunken driver gave it to him, and Erik wasn't even in a car. 
</P>
<P>
 In his own way, this resilient kid from Escondido represents a lot of what is 
good about college basketball. Maybe a lot about Duke basketball, too. He 
represents patience and persistence. Today will be the Blue Devil junior 
center's 90th college game. He has started only six. Never once has he started 
an NCAA tournament game and he is unlikely to start today's against Florida. 
Yet it took Erik Meek such a long, long time merely to come this far, the way 
he views it is, "I feel like a brand-new person." 
</P>
<P>
 The patience of the Duke program is being repaid. When an automobile ran down 
the 6-foot-10 senior from San Pasqual High from behind while he was out jogging 
in 1991, after he already had made his commitment to Duke, the coach there, 
Mike Krzyzewski, immediately made a long-distance call that Meek can remember 
virtually word for word. "Coach K said, 'Don't worry, your scholarship is still 
waiting for you here, whenever you're ready.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He now appears regularly as the backup center to Cherokee Parks, throwing 
around his 245 pounds. He surprised North Carolina three weeks ago with a dozen 
points. He came away from Georgia Tech with a double-double. A big man with a 
soft touch, Meek has taken 165 shots in his Duke career and has nailed 95 of 
them. All in all, he is the kind of center Duke keeps on its bench who could be 
in a whole lot of other schools' starting lineups. 
</P>
<P>
 Other schools don't interest him, though. Never really did. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to go to a school where basketball was big, and I mean big," Meek 
says. "I don't think basketball can get much bigger than it is at Duke. It 
didn't take me long to recognize that North Carolina isn't like other places. 
Basketball is like a religion here. You walk into a room, people are talking 
about basketball. You walk into a room, people automatically know who you are. 
It's like another world from California. People out in California are 
interested in a lot of things. People here in North Carolina are interested in 
basketball." 
</P>
<P>
 The coach was counting on two blue-chippers from California to pick up at 
center where Christian Laettner would leave off. The coming season, 1991-92, 
would be the one in which Krzyzewski would win his first national championship. 
It would also be the end of Laettner's career as a Blue Devil, leaving a gaping 
hole in the lane that no one little could fill. Parks was the big freshman with 
the big future. Meek was the insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks was the 6-foot-11 kid with sand in his shoes from Huntington Beach. He 
committed to the Durham, N.C., campus, one day after his visit. Parks 
remembers, "I fell in love with the place." 
</P>
<P>
 That first season, he really got an education at Duke, including an earful 
from Laettner. The upperclassman got on his case, on his game, on his garb. 
Whenever Parks did something right, Laettner said he had simply gotten lucky. 
It took Parks many weeks and many lectures before he came to realize that 
Laettner got on everyone that way, even Bobby Hurley, at one time or another. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it's Parks who feels comfortable getting on teammates' cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Grant Hill, the All-American who is rooming with him at the Final Four, 
had the sniffles here Friday because, he said, "Cherokee likes the room cold 
and I like it hot, and what he says goes. You know these big guys, they push 
you around." 
</P>
<P>
 Parks chuckled and said, "Call room service and have them bring up some extra 
blankets." 
</P>
<P>
 Back when he and Parks were freshmen, Meek missed out on some of the hazing. 
He was busy having scar tissue in his leg removed, or trying to regain his old 
form. His flexibility was greatly impaired. It took nearly two years, Meek 
believes, before he could fully concentrate on basketball without feeling some 
sort of twinge, some reminder of the accident, physically or mentally. 
</P>
<P>
 He told the Blue Devil Weekly school paper: "This year has definitely been the 
year when I've finally been able to put that completely behind me." 
</P>
<P>
 At times this season, he and Parks even share the floor together. Parks took 
his game farther outside, looking for long-range, Laettner-like shots. Meek 
camped underneath. Even in limited time, he is averaging 4.2 rebounds a game, 
many of them on offense. Coach K let him start against Michigan, then sat back 
and watched Meek rip down seven boards against the likes of Juwan Howard. 
</P>
<P>
 The player's perseverance has paid off. So has his hard work. Last summer was 
so crucial to not only his physical well-being but his future in basketball, 
Meek was willing to try anything. He even put on leather gloves and headgear 
and got into a boxing ring for a few lessons, immediately becoming one of the 
tallest pugilists this side of Too Tall Jones. He learned what it was like to 
develop quickness, to develop stamina. 
</P>
<P>
 "And how to take a punch," he says, touching the bridge of his nose. 
</P>
<P>
 After being struck by that car, the next thing Meek knew was that he was being 
lifted into an ambulance. He wasn't sure what would happen to him after that. 
The running, the lifting, the rehab, everything he endured thereafter prepared 
him for this season. Even the boxing. 
</P>
<P>
 He says now, "If you've never shadow-boxed or hit a heavy punching bag, well, 
you just don't realize what a real workout can be. I have a whole new regard 
for boxers now." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the world is ready for a 6-10 boxer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, no way," Meek says. "I'm just now enjoying what it is to be a basketball 
player again."

MORNING BRIEFING: DODGERS GIVEN PRAISE THAT IS VERY QUALIFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bruce Jenkins of the San Francisco Chronicle writes that the Dodgers are being 
written off as West Division contenders, but he expects them to "charge right 
back into contention, because they always do." 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, we're not picking the Dodgers this season, but only because we'd have to 
live with it all year.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's something you just don't do in Northern California, just as you don't do 
lunch, take a meeting, have a power breakfast or dress that doggie in a lovely 
pink shawl. 
</P>
<P>
 "Around my neighborhood, picking the Dodgers constitutes a distinct brand of 
local felony -- and some of these guys own chain saws." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Which state has produced the most NCAA basketball champions? 
</P>
<P>
 Rubbing it in: After Duke had beaten Purdue in the NCAA Southeast Regional 
final, a Blue Devil fan held up sign that read: 
</P>
<P>
 "Hi to everyone back home -- Mom, Dad . . . North Carolina." 
</P>
<P>
 Recognition: Duke center Cherokee Parks said that his mother once gave him a 
chance to change his name to something more conventional. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks declined and says now, "I like my name. Nobody has to say, 'Cherokee 
who?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Party time: What can law enforcement officials expect when the World Cup 
soccer matches are played in nine U.S. cities this summer? 
</P>
<P>
 "South Americans will rumba in the streets," Matthew Fordhal of the Associated 
Press writes. "Some Dutch men will down gallons of beer and don women's 
dresses. And a few Spanish fans might try to pack rockets with their musical 
instruments." 
</P>
<P>
 Chi Chi's world: Some wisdom from senior golfer Chi Chi Rodriguez: 
</P>
<P>
 On wind in Scotland: "The winds were blowing 50 m.p.h. and gusting to 70. I 
hit a par-three with my hat."  
</P>
<P>
 On aging: "The older you are, the longer you used to be." 
</P>
<P>
 On accent problems when coming from Puerto Rico: "I told the caddie I wanted a 
sand wedge and he brought me a ham on rye." 
</P>
<P>
 Cold: Steve Hummer of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution suggests the name for 
Tonya Harding's new book: "The Skates of Wrath." 
</P>
<P>
 Portrait: Frank Luksa in the Dallas Morning News on Dallas Cowboy owner Jerry 
Jones: 
</P>
<P>
 "He has an insatiable need for flattery. He thrives on being stroked as a 
figure of immense respect among NFL power brokers. As a man who knows princes 
and presidents. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is, in short and at heart, insecure and unstable. Thus his intense craving 
to be reassured by constant spotlight. And his rash fit against (Jimmy) Johnson 
when he felt crossed." 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, oh: After USC beat Barry Switzer's Oklahoma team in Norman in 1982, 12-0, 
a press box wag said, "Now I know what the O in Oklahoma stands for." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: California, 14. UCLA won 10 national championships, San 
Francisco two, and Stanford and Cal one each. 
</P>

anything like last year, I'll be looking forward to the strike." MAL FLORENCE

HERE'S A KING WHO DOESN'T POLISH HIS OWN CROWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What a joy and privilege to share the moment with "The Great One" after his 
record-breaking 802nd goal. 
</P>
<P>
 To those of us subjected to awards ceremonies weekly, who read and hear 
professionals tout their greatness daily, it is indeed refreshing to see one 
who is so willing to share. Once again we are reminded that the truly Great 
Ones don't need to remind everyone that "now I am the greatest," a la Rickey 
Henderson. Indeed, Gretzky was quite willing to share and thank all. He is, 
indeed, without equal, and a first class person.

IT WAS OK FOR MILLER TO READ AYRES' MAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Why is Cheryl Miller taking heat over a stupid mistake made by Debbie Ayres? 
If Ayres was dumb enough not to verify what hotel Pat Summit was staying at and 
to leave an envelope of valuable information unsealed, why should Miller be 
blamed for reading it? Who wouldn't do the same? 
</P>
<P>
 Cheryl Miller should be getting accolades, not the snide remarks made by some 
of her fellow coaches and the media. Miller is obviously a winner at whatever 
she does and there are a lot of petty people out there who are consumed by 
jealousy over this fact.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thank you for printing your annual State of the Straw article ("Subdued 
Strawberry, March 22). we were pleased to read that Darryl has undertaken his 
spring ritual of rededicating himself to his religion, his current wife, his 
latest child, his attitude and his team, not necessarily in that order. Of 
course, this rite has been the only consistency he has shown since joining the 
Dodgers.

JERRY JONES' DECISION SMACKS OF FRONTIERE, TEXAS-SIZE EGO TRIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

 Getting rid of Jimmy Johnson. Sounds like a move the Rams would make, like 
trading Eric Dickerson. Was Georgia (Frontiere) whispering in Jerry Jones' ear 
at the owners meeting?

 Obviously, California, "The Great Frontier," has lost some of its aggressive 
spirit. In Texas, we have not. Jimmy Johnson -- like everyone else in Texas -- 
knows that having more money than you can count is by no means any measure of a 
man. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Jerry Jones is on the verge of becoming -- if it hasn't happened 
already -- the most hated person in Texas, much like Jack Kent Cooke in 
Washington, D.C. Do you think Cooke endeared himself to anyone when he told 
reporters that even though Coach Gibbs had resigned, Cooke still owned him and 
Gibbs should not dare try to coach somewhere else? 
</P>
<P>
 All I have to say is that Jerry Jones is what Texans call a "Drugstore Cowboy" 
-- all hat and no cattle. Texas history is full of these guys trying to play 
with the big boys.

 You got divorced . . . . who cares! Now, divide up the wedding gifts, send 
thank-you notes, say goodby and hit the personal ads, or whatever it is those 
with super-egos do. After all, it's spring training and there's probably a 
relief pitcher somewhere who doesn't get along with his pool man . . . . and 
that's crying for some media attention.

UCLA SHOULD BE TAKING NOTE OF THE HEADLINES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Peter Dalis, a lesson to you in athletic administration: At the expense of his 
team and its program, Laker General Manager Jerry West was not willing to waste 
six years on Randy Pfund -- the NBA's equivalent of Jim Harrick.

 Maybe Peter Dalis will go to a bar late one night, have a few drinks and tell 
a couple of reporters (off the record) that just about any coach in America 
could have led the Bruins to another first-round loss in the NCAA tournament 
Come to think of it, Harrick would probably stay anyway.

A MAGIC MOVE BY LAKERS OR JUST ANOTHER TRICK? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Good move by the Lakers in bringing back Magic to coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't get fooled, though. This is just a marketing gimmick. Now the Lakers 
will be able to sell out all of their home games until the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 We hope that Magic comes back next year and really makes a go at it.

 I was surprised to hear Magic Johnson say at his news conference: "It's going 
to be my way. It's either that or have a seat." 
</P>
<P>

 Have Jerry Buss and Jerry West lost their senses?

<P>
 The Lakers are a team in transition. They are more successful in this 
rebuilding phase than other powerhouses of the 1980s like Detroit and Boston.

 Replacing the coach of a potential playoff team to see if Magic "likes to 
coach" is a huge mistake.

 Well, wasn't that nice of everyone to show up at the Laker game on Sunday. 
Finally a crowd bigger than one at a high school tennis match. 
</P>
<P>
 Just one question: Where were they the last 66 games? 
</P>
<P>
 My guess is that they were busy riding the bandwagon of the Dallas Cowboys and 
Toronto Blue Jays, except for the time they came by to see Shaq play. I bet 
that half of the people there, including some of the movie stars, didn't even 
recognize most of the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
 As much as I love to see a huge crowd, it bothers me to see such a phony one. 
Anyway, congratulations to Coach Magic.

SENIOR GOLF / THE TRADITION; GILBERT SEES FIVE-SHOT LEAD DISAPPEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For a time Friday, Gibby Gilbert threatened to make a runaway of The 
Tradition. That was before, in his words, his pants fell off. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert, who trailed by a shot after a six-under 66 in the first round at 
Desert Mountain, had taken a five-shot lead, knocking off seven more strokes in 
11 holes. 
</P>
<P>
 By losing four strokes to par in the next three holes, Gilbert came back to 
the pack, finished with a 69 and 135, nine under for 36 holes and tied with 
Raymond Floyd and Charles Coody for the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 One shot back were Dale Douglass, who had a 68, Jimmy Powell (69), Isao Aoki 
(69) and Jim Colbert, who tied Calvin Peete for the best round of the day, a 
66. Peete, seeking his first senior victory, is at five-under 139.  
</P>
<P>
 Dave Stockton, who was 10 shots behind early in the day, birdied the last two 
holes and is at 138, only three shots behind the leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gibby was throwing a no-hitter, but it got away from him," Stockton said. 
"I'll be right there at the finish." 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert, who birdied 18 Thursday, is a streak putter. After sinking 15- and 
20-footers for birdies on two and three, he barely missed on two more before 
sinking birdie putts of five and 10 feet, lipping out on a 20-footer and 
sinking a 20-footer to finish the front side with a five-under 31. He dropped 
10- and eight-foot putts to start the back nine and go to 13 under. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was fun," he said. "I was laughing and enjoying it. When my putter gets 
hot, it stays that way. Everything turned suddenly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hit a good drive on the par-five 12th, but it was a mediocre lie and 
ordinarily I would have played safe, but the adrenaline was flowing. I hit the 
shot into the desert, had an unplayable lie and bogeyed. On the next hole, the 
wind gusted, I landed short on the par three, didn't get the next one on and 
missed a six-footer for a double bogey." 
</P>
<P>
 He hit his approach over the green on 14 and the resulting bogey made it a 
wide-open tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really can't feel too bad," Gilbert said. "Despite the wheels coming off, I 
was in the 60s again. I feel at the end of the day my game was back. Tied at 
the halfway point isn't too bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Defending champion Tom Shaw lost all chance to repeat. He was three under 
going to the shortest hole on the course, the 136-yard 13th. He buried his tee 
shot in the trap, failed to get out until the third attempt and still wasn't 
on, then two-putted and wound up with a quadruple bogey. He shot a 78 and 
trails the leaders by 10 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Floyd could have broken it open. But he missed six putts of less than 10 feet 
and settled for a 70. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not accustomed to playing mountain courses," he said. "Until you get used 
to them, the greens are hard to read. This is my second time here and I have a 
problem. Yesterday, I guess I was lucky. Today they seemed to break the wrong 
way." 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert has figured out the breaks. "Just find where Pinnacle Peak is," he 
said. "Everything breaks toward it no matter how it looks." 
</P>
<P>
 Coody, who suffered a pinched nerve in his neck that threatened to end his 
career two years ago, had a 67, the best round for the leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglass has a winter home down the hill in Paradise Valley and is a neighbor 
of Tom Weiskopf, who is six under after a 70. 
</P>
<P>
 "I seem to play my best golf in the West," Douglass said. "Maybe it's because 
I like the West better than any other part of the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Jack Nicklaus at 141 isn't out of it. A few years ago, Nicklaus was 12 
back after 36 holes and won it. 
</P>
<P>
 No longer in contention is Don January. After an opening 67, January soared to 
a 77.

<P>
 Nashville Mayor Phil Bredesen and Gaylord Entertainment Co. said Friday they 
have offered $100 million to lure the Minnesota Timberwolves to Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaylord has offered $80 million for the team. The city would pay $20 million 
to the current owners and build a $100-million, 19,000-seat arena for the 
Timberwolves. 
</P>
<P>
 In a non-binding, intent-to-move letter filed Friday with the NBA executive 
offices in New York, the Timberwolves named Nashville as a possible alternative 
site for the 1994-95 season. 
</P>
<P>
 New Orleans and San Diego also tried to buy the Timberwolves. 
</P>
<P>
 Marvin Wolfenson and Harvey Ratner, who own the Target Center in Minneapolis 
and the Timberwolves, are trying to sell the arena and have talked about moving 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite drawing near-capacity crowds, they say they are losing money on the 
$105-million arena.

ROOKIE PAULSON SHOOTS RECORD 62 TO TAKE LEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dennis Paulson, a 31-year-old tour rookie, set a course record and tied the 
tournament record Friday with a 10-under 62 to take a one-stroke lead in the 
Freeport-McMorRan Golf Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 Paulson, who started the day at two over, capped his round with two eagles on 
the back nine to complete 36 holes at 136. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was only three under at the turn, then I knocked a wedge in on the next 
hole for an eagle. I said to my caddie, 'We're making some good shots here. 
Let's just make one good swing at a time,' " Paulson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paulson, from Palm Desert, broke the course record of 63 set Thursday by Jose 
Maria Olazabal of Spain. The tournament record of 62 was set by Bob Gilder in 
1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Paulson played in six tournaments since finishing 10th in the 1993 qualifying 
tournament, making three cuts, with a best finish of 12th at Pebble Beach. He 
has earned $31,242. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a long way to go," Paulson said. "They don't issue a trophy for 
yesterday or today. There are two more rounds before they do that, and I don't 
think I've ever shot like this and then come back and shot a good round the 
next day. It's tough to keep from thinking." 
</P>
<P>
 Olazabal had that problem Friday, following his 63 with a 74 that featured 
five bogeys. He shared second with Ben Crenshaw. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made a few mistakes. I didn't make my putts and I didn't make the right 
club selection sometimes," Olazabal said. "Thanks to what I did yesterday, I'm 
still on the leader board and I have two more days to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Olazabal three-putted the third hole from 21 feet, two-putted the seventh from 
five feet, missed a three-footer for par at the eighth, two-putted the 14th 
from 18 feet and two-putted the 15th from 15 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "My putting stroke just let me down today," Olazabal said. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw's 68 included six birdies and two bogeys. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hitting enough good shots to feel pretty good about next week," Crenshaw 
said of the upcoming Masters. "I played pretty well."

MIGHTY DUCKS NOTEBOOK / ROBYN NORWOOD; WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS TO HAVE LOCAL FACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The World Championships in Italy beginning late this month could be a 
convention of Mighty Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 As long as the Ducks don't pull off a miracle and make the playoffs, Ron 
Wilson is expected to coach the U.S. team, assistant coach Tim Army will aid 
him, and a few Duck players will probably be on the roster. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's exciting," Army said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides that, center Patrik Carnback will play for Sweden, goalie Mikhail 
Shtalenkov will play for Russia, and unsigned draft pick Paul Kariya will play 
for Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kariya will be over there and it will be a chance for the coaches to get to 
know him more," Army said. "He'll also get to see the kind of things Ron is 
trying to do." 
</P>
<P>
 General Manager Jack Ferreira will also be there, scouting players and hoping 
to break the stalemate in contract talks with Kariya's agent, Don Baizley. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, who has U.S. and Canadian citizenship, is honored to have the 
opportunity to coach the U.S. team -- a rare one for an NHL coach, because the 
World Championships coincide with the Stanley Cup playoffs and there are few 
U.S. citizens in the head coaching ranks, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Lou Nanne, the former Minnesota North Star general manager, is the general 
manager of the U.S. team, and he and Art Berglund, international program 
director for the U.S., will be at today's game against Toronto to look at 
players. Among the Ducks who are candidates for the U.S. team are forwards Joe 
Sacco, Tim Sweeney and John Lilley, defensemen Don McSween, Sean Hill and David 
Williams and goalie Guy Hebert. Bob Corkum would have been considered too, 
except his season was ended by an severed tendon in his right foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson wanted assistant coach Al Sims on his staff too, but Sims is a Canadian 
citizen and isn't eligible. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would have been really nice -- kind of special," Army said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Stu Grimson held out his battered right hand, the knuckles covered by 
helter-skelter stitches, the wound just now healing above a finger that was 
broken earlier in the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you hear about my modeling contract with Birk's jewelry?" he said. "They 
wanted me bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Grimson split open the knuckles in a fight during a game, then kept re-opening 
the wound almost every time he fought again until a doctor finally told him, 
"Enough." But even though he has sat out the last four games, Grimson keeps 
taking the warm-up skate, leaving the other team wondering if it needs to dress 
its tough guys. Then Grimson goes in and puts on a suit and heads up to watch 
the game from the press box, his duties as a decoy complete. 
</P>
<P>
 Did you say Decoy? As in the sequined skate dancers who entertain before the 
game and between periods? "I've got the legs for it," Grimson said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Maxim Bets, the newest Duck, grew up around the game. 
</P>
<P>
 His father, Nikolai, was a player for Traktor Chelyabinsk and now is an 
age-group hockey coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I consider him my first coach," said Bets, 20, the prospect acquired from St. 
Louis in the Alexei Kasatonov trade who has joined the Ducks now to get 
acclimated to the NHL. "He always urged me to shoot the puck more and not be 
afraid to hold onto the puck." 
</P>
<P>
 Bets found it difficult to compare his style to anyone else's, but counts 
Sergei Makarov -- a standout on the old Soviet Central Red Army teams of the 
1980s and now playing for the rival San Jose Sharks -- as one of his heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll see a lot of him," Ferreira said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bets didn't seem to get Ferreira's joke, but has a good sense of humor, 
according to his Calgary-based agent, Vlad Shushkovsky. 
</P>
<P>
 Bets, who is a bit shy, had a little fun with an NHL scout during an interview 
before last year's draft. 
</P>
<P>
 The scout said, "Max, you have to talk more. Let's say you have a hat trick 
one game. All the media will be trying to talk to you about what happened if 
you score three goals." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Bets: "Then I'll either score two or four goals."

NBA ROUNDUP; NO REST FOR DEFENSE AS SUNS DEFEAT HAWKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It wasn't as much fun as it could have been. Defense is work, after all, but 
it was necessary because the Suns' offense took a siesta Friday night in 
Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 The Suns scored only 35 points in the second half -- their worst effort of the 
season -- but the defense held the Atlanta Hawks to 18 points in the final 
quarter and the result was a 93-87 victory, the Suns' fourth in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Barkley led Phoenix with 25 points and 13 rebounds, but perhaps more 
important, he shut down Atlanta's Kevin Willis, who was averaging 19.3 points a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Willis scored 13 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had him locked up. I don't like to play defense, but I can," Barkley said. 
"What I was doing, the other thing, was making it difficult for them to get the 
ball into him, because they must have had close to 10 turnovers trying to get 
him the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawks had 21 turnovers, which angered Coach Lenny Wilkens. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the worst I've seen us," he said. "We fumbled it, stumbled around. We 
just gave them too much of an edge." 
</P>
<P>
 Cedric Ceballos scored 24 points for the Suns, 18 of them in the first half 
when Phoenix built a 58-44 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte 106, Dallas 104 -- Jamal Mashburn missed two free throws that would 
have tied the score with 2.5 seconds to play at Dallas, and the Hornets escaped 
with a victory that left the Mavericks with 16 consecutive defeats. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington 99, Boston 95 -- Don MacLean had 28 points and the Bullets 
outscored the Celtics, 18-4, in the final 6:16 at Boston to snap a nine-game 
losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami 101, Indiana 91 -- Glen Rice scored seven points and Harold Miner hit 
only his third three-pointer of the season in a 13-2 fourth-quarter run that 
enabled the Heat to win at Miami and snap a six-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Portland 111, Philadelphia 100 -- Rod Strickland tied his career high with 30 
points and Cliff Robinson also scored 30 for the Trail Blazers at Philadelphia 
as the 76ers lost their ninth in a row and 24th in 25 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando 98, New Jersey 96 -- Anfernee Hardaway scored 27 points and drove for 
the winning layup with 1.6 seconds to play as the Magic stopped New Jersey's 
home-court winning streak at eight games. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 102, Detroit 95 -- B.J. Armstrong scored 23 points and Horace Grant 22 
at Chicago as the Bulls dealt the Pistons their 50th loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden State 146, Minnesota 109 -- Chris Webber scored 21 points and Latrell 
Sprewell 20, leading eight Warriors in double figures at Oakland.

NHL ROUNDUP; ISLANDERS CLOSE IN ON PANTHERS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Florida was riding high. High in eighth place, that is, having crashed its way 
into a playoff spot as an expansion team unless something strange happened. 
</P>
<P>
 It happened Friday night on Long Island. That's where the Islanders got a goal 
and two assists each from Pierre Turgeon and Derek King in a 5-2 victory over 
the Montreal Canadiens. 
</P>
<P>
 That broke New York's three-game winless streak and moved the Islanders past 
Philadelphia and to within three points of the Panthers for the final Eastern 
playoff spot. Both teams have seven games to play. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the Islanders' fourth consecutive victory over Montreal, with a fifth 
possible tonight in Canada, and it did not sit well with the Canadiens. 
</P>
<P>
 After the game, they held a 25-minute, closed-door meeting. When Coach Jacques 
Demers emerged from the locker room, he was not happy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're making, right now, what I call mental mistakes," Demers said. "These 
are mistakes you can't make against anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Vancouver 5, Winnipeg 1 -- Jeff Brown scored once and set up two other goals 
for the Canucks at Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Rangers 3, Dallas 0 -- Goaltender Mike Richter won his 38th game, 
breaking Ed Giacomin's 25-year-old club record for victories in a season, as 
the Rangers won at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo 5, Boston 0 -- Grant Fuhr stopped 31 shots in his second shutout of 
the season, and the Sabre penalty-killers got a short-handed goal and shut out 
the Bruin power play in six chances. 
</P>
<P>
 Tampa Bay 4, St. Louis 3 -- Chris Joseph scored a goal and had two assists, 
and J.C. Bergeron had 26 saves for Tampa Bay in a victory at St. Petersburg, 
Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington 2, New Jersey 1 -- Kelly Miller's goal with 46 seconds to play 
lifted the Capitals at Landover, Md., and ended the Devils' seven-game unbeaten 
streak (6-0-1).

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; FINAL CUTS MADE; SNYDER PUT ON DL 
</P>

 The Dodgers made their final cuts Friday night to bring their opening day 
roster to 25 players. They will carry 11 pitchers -- including one left-handed 
reliever -- seven infielders, five outfielders and two catchers. Cory Snyder, 
who has been sidelined all spring with various injuries, was placed on the 
15-day disabled list, retroactive to March 25. 
</P>
<P>
 To make room for Darren Dreifort and Chan Ho Park, the Dodgers outrighted 
pitcher Kip Gross to triple-A Albuquerque, and pitcher Ricky Trlicek was 
claimed on waivers by the Boston Red Sox. Left-hander Gary Wayne made the club 
and Al Osuna, whom the Dodgers just acquired in a trade with the Houston 
Astros, was optioned to Albuquerque. Other remaining pitchers are starters 
Pedro Astacio, Tom Candiotti, Kevin Gross, Orel Hershiser and Ramon Martinez, 
and relievers Dreifort, Park, Jim Gott, Roger McDowell and Todd Worrell.  
</P>
<P>
 Backup infielders are Jeff Treadway and Rafael Bournigal. Mike Sharperson did 
not make it, but was asked to stay through Sunday's game. Other infielders are 
Delino DeShields, Dave Hansen, Eric Karros, Jose Offerman and Tim Wallach. 
Besides regular outfielders Darryl Strawberry, Brett Butler and Raul Mondesi, 
the team will carry Henry Rodriguez and Mitch Webster. The catchers are Mike 
Piazza and Carlos Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't take long for some of the crowd of 34,621 at Dodger Stadium Friday 
night to boo Strawberry. In the first inning of the Angels' 2-0 victory, 
Strawberry misplayed a double by Damion Easley, which allowed Chad Curtis to 
score. The boos continued throughout the night, as Strawberry went hitless in 
four at-bats. . . . DeShields, in his first appearance at Dodger Stadium, made 
some great plays at second base and Curtis leaped and reached over the wall in 
center field to rob Piazza of a home run. John Dopson got the victory and Joe 
Grahe the save. Orel Hershiser took the loss. The series moves to Anaheim 
Stadium for a 7 p.m. game tonight and a 1 p.m. game Sunday. MARYANN HUDSON

COLLEGE ROUNDUP; UC IRVINE UPSETS HARVARD IN TENNIS TOURNAMENT SEMIFINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 36th-ranked UC Irvine men's tennis team upset 20th-ranked Harvard, 5-2, 
Friday at the 15th annual UCI Tennis Classic at the UCI Tennis Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters, playing for the second consecutive day with only five singles 
players, won at No. 1 singles with Chris Tontz; No. 2, Marc-Andre Tardif; No. 
3, Julian Foxon; No. 4, Ken Cruz; and No. 5, Cameran Lindee. 
</P>
<P>
 Foxon extended his winning streak to nine, improving to 16-2. Tontz has won 
his past eight matches and is 11-7 in dual matches this season.

 UCI advanced to today's finals against South Alabama at 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>

in the early innings of both games, but home runs from Laura Espinoza and Jenny 
Dolan in the fourth and fifth innings in the second game and key doubles in the 
first game were too much for Fullerton (16-21). Arizona is 33-1.

PROVING 'EM ALL WRONG; DAWKINS, SPURNED BY ALL BUT USC, IS MAKING OPPOSING 
COACHES WISH THEY HAD HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some of that instant karma rocketed off Walter Dawkins' bat March 11. Three, 
count 'em, three home runs -- two in one inning -- against Kansas State. 
</P>
<P>
 A little more proof that good things come to those who work and wait. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time that third ball drifted over the fence, Dawkins was at a loss for 
words. He looked at his USC teammates and shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always figured I was a pretty good player, I just had to work hard," 
Dawkins said. "If I did, things would roll my way sooner or later." 
</P>
<P>
 Things are now rolling his way so fast, they gather no moss. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 Almost no one wanted Dawkins after he graduated from La Quinta High, at least 
not to play baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 The entire semester he spent in a court room, instead of a classroom, to get 
custody of his two-year old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 The summer and fall he worked to regain academic footing after a semester of 
straight F's. 
</P>
<P>
 Now consider this same guy doesn't have a care in the world. Dawkins grins 
from ear to ear knowing his sun-will-come-out-tomorrow philosophy has paid off. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the struggles and difficulties Walt has had and now to see him have this 
success just makes everyone one who knows him extremely happy," USC Coach Mike 
Gillespie said. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone, that is, but opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The most dangerous pitch you can throw in a USC game might be the first one. 
</P>
<P>
 Dawkins, a 5-10, 174-pound junior center fielder, leads off with a vengeance. 
He is hitting .317 this season, with a team-high 10 home runs. He has led off 
games with home runs three times this season, twice on the first pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "One game, Pepperdine had scored two runs in the top of the first and Walt 
came up and hit the first pitch out," Gillespie said. "That gave everyone a 
jolt." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the thunder comes lightning. Dawkins has stolen home three times in 
three seasons. Once, Gillespie sent him on a 3-2 pitch with two outs. 
</P>
<P>
 "With Walt, you can roll the dice," Gillespie said. "It's fun having a player 
with so much to offer." 
</P>
<P>
 These skills were not so apparent to coaches a few years ago. Gillespie was 
the only coach to offer a scholarship. He did so after a Connie Mack game in 
which Dawkins was five for five with two triples, and made three spectacular 
catches -- one after falling down. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Gillespie looks brilliant. No one disputes Dawkins' ability. He was named 
to the All-Central II Regional team last May. He was selected ahead of Cal 
State Fullerton's Dante Powell, considered a top prospect in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 That success carried over to this season. Dawkins is a big reason the Trojans 
are 26-8 and are in first place in the Pac-10 with a 12-5 record. They are 
ranked third in the nation by Baseball America and sixth by Collegiate 
Baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole thing has been wonderful," Dawkins said. "But I look back from 
where I came and, boy, has it been a long road trip." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dawkins story is a typical immigrant tale. When he was 10, his mother -- one 
of 14 children -- moved from Panama to Southern California seeking a better 
life. Hard work and determination could get them the American dream. 
</P>
<P>
 Yvonne Green, his mother, is now a nurse. She instilled in Dawkins a sense of 
responsibility that he has taken to heart. 
</P>
<P>
 During Dawkins' senior year, a La Quinta teammate was being hassled by a local 
gang. Dawkins, who knew the gang's leader, took it upon himself to solve the 
problem. All he did was ask the gang to stop. They did, out of respect for 
Dawkins. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember I came home from work one time and he had fixed me dinner," said 
Green, who divorced Dawkins' father when Walter was 3 and has since remarried. 
"It was only rice and eggs, but he was only 5 years old at the time." 
</P>
<P>
 It was his mother who channeled Dawkins' energy into sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was always finding trouble, so mom shipped me off to Little League," 
Dawkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Green: "Not just baseball, but football, basketball and every single 
thing I could find." 
</P>
<P>
 Dawkins played three sports in high school, but baseball was his strong suit. 
As a junior, he threw two no-hitters. He moved to the outfield as a senior and 
set a school record with nine home runs. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the best player I've coached here," said Dave Demarest, La Quinta's 
coach the past 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Others were not so impressed. Dawkins wasn't drafted and there were no 
scholarship offers, only a drawer full of letters from colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think now people are asking themselves: 'Why didn't I take him?' " Demarest 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillespie took him, then nearly lost him. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The little girl yelling, "Daddy Walter," at USC home games makes Dawkins beam. 
</P>
<P>
 "She even knows how to call me on the telephone," Dawkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 A proud, and determined, father. 
</P>
<P>
 His daughter Ashley lives with Green. Dawkins sees her frequently, as she 
attends most of Trojan home games. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent most of the fall of 1992 working to gain custody. Dawkins said 
Ashley's mother wanted to put her up for adoption. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ashley is part of me," Dawkins said. "I couldn't go on knowing that part of 
me was out there and I had nothing to do with her." 
</P>
<P>
 Dawkins won custody, but the price was high. It took him away from baseball 
during the fall months and, more importantly, took him away from his studies. 
He flunked every class. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillespie wasn't sure if Dawkins would play again. But then, he also knew 
Dawkins. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no question he was in quite a hole," Gillespie said. "It was going 
to take quite an effort, but Walter always gives quite an effort. He got tutors 
and took summer classes and made a genuine commitment." 
</P>
<P>
 Dawkins had erased every failing grade by the end of the 1993 fall semester. 
He is on track to graduate next year, which will make him the first in his 
family's generation -- which includes 64 children -- to graduate from college. 
</P>
<P>
 "He set a goal and reached it," Gillespie said. "I think dealing with life the 
last year was a turning point for him." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Life is a lot easier to deal with for Dawkins these days. 
</P>
<P>
 His daughter is near. His education is close. And his baseball career has 
taken off. 
</P>
<P>
 Dawkins hit .220 as a freshman and was struggling early last season. But 
things finally began to click when USC played California. 
</P>
<P>
 He was three for four with a couple doubles in the first game of a three-game 
sweep and was moved into the starting lineup for good. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt more comfortable after that," Dawkins said. "It carried over to the 
next series and the next series. It carried right into the regional." 
</P>
<P>
 Dawkins hit .313 in the regional, as the Trojans reached the final, where they 
lost to Texas. Dawkins finished with a .291 average with four home runs and 22 
RBIs for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Those numbers have risen sharply this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach told me I was going to have a big year," Dawkins said. "But I never 
expected this." 
</P>
<P>
 Who did? After all, Dawkins, who had only four home runs in his college 
career, has suddenly become the Trojans' muscle. 
</P>
<P>
 He hit two against rival Arizona State and went four for six with two home 
runs against Loyola Marymount. He drove in five runs with his three homers 
against Kansas State. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guys really teased after the Kansas State game," Dawkins said. "They were 
saying things like, 'You're out of your tree,' and 'No way you can do this, 
Walter.' I had to agree. After I hit that third home run, I was even asking 
myself, 'What the heck is going on.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Just some karma.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / DAILY REPORT; MEN'S FINAL FOUR; KEADY: ROBINSON STILL 
CONSIDERING NBA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Glenn Robinson has indicated that he will return for his senior season at 
Purdue, but his coach, Gene Keady, said Friday that Robinson might still 
declare for the NBA draft.  
</P>
<P>
 Keady, who accepted the Associated Press' player of the year award for 
Robinson at a Final Four press conference in Charlotte, N.C., said that 
Robinson still is undecided.  
</P>
<P>
 "He's going through a lot of soul searching now," Keady said of the 6-foot-8 
junior who passed on accepting the award in person because of academic 
commitments. "The only thing I know is that he said that if he was going to the 
NBA, he would have a press conference. So, if you hear of a press conference 
out of West Lafayette (Ind.) the next couple of days, you'll know that Gene 
Keady will be someplace crying." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, expected to arrive in Charlotte Sunday, was a runaway winner with 
218 votes. Donyell Marshall of Connecticut finished second with 21 votes, with 
Jason Kidd of Cal and Grant Hill of Duke tied for third with 16 each. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The day before the Final Four semifinals is always a circus for the teams 
involved as they arrange their practices around interview sessions. Each team 
worked out for an hour Friday in front of an estimated crowd of 12,000 at the 
Charlotte Coliseum and then answered reporters' questions. Some highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Most intense practice: Arkansas. The Razorbacks gave fans a show with 60 
minutes of fast-paced action that was capped off by five powerful dunks by 
reserve 6-6 forward Ken Biley. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Most organized practice: Florida. With sharp passing and shooting, the 
Gators displayed the type of teamwork that has made them the Cinderella team of 
the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Best dunker: Brian Thompson of Florida. The 6-6 sophomore guard from 
Atlanta brought the fans to their feet with several spectacular one-handed 
twisting dunks. Runner-up was Reggie Geary of Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Most composed player: Hill. The 6-8 senior handled Duke's news conference 
like the veteran he is, with three Final Four appearances in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Best answer: Geary, after talking about his role in Arizona's offense 
instead of replying to a question asked about the Wildcats' feelings as an 
underdog against Arkansas: "(That might not have been the answer you wanted), 
but that's the answer I'm giving." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Scalpers' tickets for today's games are at a premium. Courtside seats are 
priced as high as $6,000 a pair. To help stop illegal scalping, police have 
undercover officers walking around downtown Charlotte, trying to buy tickets. 
On Thursday, the first person arrested was an attorney from Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my 31 years of going to the Final Four, I can't remember a time when 
tickets were this hot," USC Coach George Raveling said. "The prices they are 
going for are astonishing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Hill speaks to his younger Duke teammates, they listen. So, when Hill saw 
sophomore Chris Collins and freshman Jeff Capel looking nervous before Friday's 
practice, he took them aside and gave them some advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to communicate with the younger guys about what to expect," Hill 
said. "You're going to be excited, anxious and nervous, but you have to relax 
and have fun. They have to maintain the tradition." LONNIE WHITE

SOUTHERN RHYTHM FAVORED IN JIM BEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four geldings will get a chance at Turfway Park today to earn a start in the 
Kentucky Derby, a race a gelding hasn't won since 1929. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of them, Polar Expedition and Powis Castle, are the second and third 
morning-line betting choices, respectively, for the 1 1/8-mile Jim Beam.The 
other two are longshots Dynafleet and Sir Walter Lyzalot. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3-1 early pick in the field of 11 3-year-olds, all of whom are nominated 
for the Triple Crown races, is the colt Southern Rhythm, winner of his three 
starts this year, including the 1-mile Southwest on March 12 at Oaklawn Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Canaveral, a highly regarded colt, will make his stakes debut Sunday in the 1 
1/8-mile Flamingo at Hialeah. The Derby nominee, unbeaten in three starts, all 
this year, will oppose nine other 3-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
 Polar Expedition will be trying to rebound in the Jim Beam from a third-place 
finish in the Southwest. That loss ended a streak of five stakes victories, 
four of them last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Powis Castle won the 6 1/2-furlong Turfway Park Prevue on Dec. 11 in his last 
start as a 2-year-old. In his only start this year, he finished second, a 
length behind Tabasco Cat, in the 1-mile San Rafael at Santa Anita on April 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Canaveral won a seven-furlong maiden race by 8 3/4 lengths at Gulfstream Park 
on Jan. 7. He then won two 1 1/16-mile allowance races at Gulfstream, by 1 3/4 
lengths on Feb. 9 and by 8 1/2 lengths on March 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Also today, Oaklawn's 1 1/16-mile Rebel drew a dozen 3-year-olds, nine of them 
nominated to the Triple Crown.

HORSE RACING / BILL CHRISTINE; BETTING PIONEER TOOK THE IRS TO COURT TO GAIN 
RESPECTABILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Another April 15 is approaching, and I am thinking of the late Bob Groetzinger 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 If there were a bettors' hall of fame, Groetzinger would have been a charter 
member. Not for the Pick Sixes he cashed -- and there were more than a few -- 
and not for the parlays he made, but for the nine-year battle he fought with 
the Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
 The house took him on, but Groetzinger wasn't intimidated, and in the end he 
showed that the house doesn't always win. His ultimate victory, after a review 
by the U.S. Supreme Court, was a watershed for professional parimutuel bettors. 
It legitimized their breed. Guys who play the horses for a living no longer 
need another life. They can fill out their 1040 forms without concern that the 
government will flag them simply because of their profession. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Groetzinger -- his friends called him Gretz -- used to live in Peoria, 
Ill. In 1978, having lost his job with a trucking company, he decided to try to 
make a living betting greyhound races. 
</P>
<P>
 He was no dilettante. In the 1960s, at a track in St. Petersburg, Fla., 
Groetzinger had picked the winners of seven consecutive races and collected 
$22,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In '78, Groetzinger spent part of the year at the greyhound tracks in Florida, 
the rest at the track in Denver, the Mile High Kennel Club.  
</P>
<P>
 The greyhounds throw a lot of races at their customers. There are day-night 
doubleheaders in Florida that pack in as many as 28 races. But Groetzinger was 
the consummate player; he didn't have to bet every race. He picked his spots 
and then hammered a play that he really liked. Few players have that kind of 
discipline.  
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the year, Groetzinger had cashed tickets worth $70,000. At least 
that's all the IRS wanted to know about. But his expenses, including losing 
tickets that he was able to document, ran to $72,032. 
</P>
<P>
 At the IRS, bells went off. They bounced Groetzinger's return, suggesting that 
no one could only be playing greyhounds for a living. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a dog gambler," Groetzinger told them. "I spend 60 to 80 hours a week 
playing the dogs. I play the dogs all over the country. Playing the dogs is my 
only business." 
</P>
<P>
 The case made its way through the courts, with Groetzinger prevailing but the 
IRS not giving up. It reached the Supreme Court in 1987. Groetzinger, who had 
refused to be outlasted, believed he was a 4-to-5 shot, and the vote was 6-3, 
in his favor. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Harry A. Blackmun, writing about the majority opinion, said: 
</P>
<P>
 "If a taxpayer devotes his full-time activity to gambling, and it is his 
intended livelihood source, it would seem that the basic concepts of fairness 
(if there be much of that in the income tax law) demand that his activity be 
regarded as a trade or business just as any other readily accepted activity. . 
. . Constant and large-scale effort on (Groetzinger's) part was made. Skill was 
required and was applied. He did what he did for a livelihood, though with a 
less than successful result. This was not a hobby or passing fancy." 
</P>
<P>
 For the guys who labor over the figures, for the chartists who stand for hours 
under the television monitors at the track, recording betting patterns, 
Blackmun was only saying what they had known all along. 
</P>
<P>
 Groetzinger had a right to be smug about the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured I might win," he said. "We won in the lower courts, so I thought 
the chances were good that we'd win in the Supreme Court, too. This was the 
only fair thing that could happen. Anything else and the full-time dog, horse 
or poker player would be unfairly discriminated against in a free-enterprise 
society. I have a right to choose what I want to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Groetzinger had more than a one-track mind. He had played basketball -- quite 
well, in fact -- at George Washington University. He had once owned and 
operated a contract bridge club in Denver. According to the American Contract 
Bridge Assn., he was once the youngest player to achieve life master status. 
</P>
<P>
 Gretz didn't have many years to enjoy his Supreme Court victory. He was 68 
when he died.  
</P>
<P>
 David Radley, a Peoria attorney and a friend, remembered the funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was an open casket," Radley said. "He had a copy of the Daily Racing 
Form in one hand, and his favorite putter was in the other. Instead of a 
handkerchief peeking out of his sport coat pocket, there was the ace of spades. 
A nice touch. Gretz had left instructions for that."

PREP SWIMMING ROUNDUP; CAPISTRANO VALLEY ROLLS PAST WOODBRIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It didn't bother Capistrano Valley swimmer Jake Yokota a bit that Woodbridge, 
the Cougars' opponent in Friday's dual meet, was missing one of its key 
performers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that 'He' was gone lifted our spirits," Yokota said after the Cougar 
boys soundly thumped powerhouse Woodbridge, 105-65, in a nonleague meet Friday 
at Saddleback College. 
</P>
<P>
 "He" referred to Woodbridge wonder Derya Buyukuncu, who was off meeting the 
prime minister of his homeland, Turkey. Without Buyukuncu and Sean Moore, who 
is competing at Senior Nationals, Capistrano Valley outswam the Warriors all 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars realized the handicap but didn't ease up. Instead, they left the 
blocks smoking. Several set personal records or posted season bests. 
</P>
<P>
 "You guys can give yourselves a hand, you had a great meet," Capistrano Valley 
Coach Don Cholodenko told his team after the meet, which the girls won, 96-74. 
Both Cougar teams improved to 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither school had all its personnel. Capistrano Valley's boys' team was 
intact, but its girls were without Cathy Carone, who is also at nationals. 
Woodbridge standout Jaimee Lindstrom was out sick and three Warrior girls were 
gone for other reasons, leaving Woodbridge Coach Dan Gaines wishing this meet 
had been held any other day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don told a while ago that this wasn't a good day to have this," he said. "Not 
to take anything away from them, but this wasn't the meet it was intended to 
be." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Cougars intended to accomplish something. Yokota, winner of the 
200-yard individual medley (1 minute, 59.44 seconds) and the 100 butterfly 
(59.13) swam personal records in those races and Dan Batten and Charles 
Wiersma, members of two winning relays, turned in season bests. 
</P>
<P>
 In nonleague boys' swimming: 
</P>
<P>
 El Toro 121.5, Fountain Valley 47.5 -- Jay Reaves won the 100 butterfly 
(57.00) and the 200 individual medley (2:00.64) for host El Toro (6-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo 99, Irvine 71 -- After losing in a heartbreaker to El Toro on 
Thursday, the Diablos came back, winning the 200 medley, 200 freestyle and the 
400 freestyle relays. 
</P>
<P>
 In nonleague girls' swimming: 
</P>
<P>
 El Toro 95, Fountain Valley 75 -- Christine Kennedy won the 200 individual 
medley (2:16.92) and the 500 freestyle (5:15.38) for host El Toro (7-0). 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine 89, Mission Viejo 81 -- Irvine's Wendy O'Brien was first in the 50 
(24.78) and the 100 freestyle (54.11) and was also on the winning 200 freestyle 
relay. Irvine improves to 5-2, 4-0.

PREP VOLLEYBALL ROUNDUP; HUNTINGTON BEACH STATES ITS CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fountain Valley entered Friday's Sunset League boys' volleyball match against 
fourth-ranked Huntington Beach with an unblemished record, but the Barons left 
with tire tracks across their backs. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Grave had 14 kills and Jeremy Bart added 11 to help the Oilers run over 
Fountain Valley, 15-7, 15-12, 15-8 at Huntington Beach High in a battle of the 
league's top teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Phil Domingo had 11 kills and six blocks and Ed Ratledge had 12 
kills, the Barons (7-1, 5-1 in league) came out tight and the Oilers (7-1, 6-0) 
made them pay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we were nervous early," Fountain Valley first-year Coach Lori Biller 
said. "We made a lot of errors we don't normally make, but Huntington Beach 
forced those. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a young team -- we start six juniors -- and this school hasn't won a 
league championship in 10 years. I think they have the talent to compete with 
Huntington Beach. I just have to convince them that they can." 
</P>
<P>
 While Fountain Valley's talent is green, Huntington Beach (7-1, 6-0) has an 
experienced group of returners. 
</P>
<P>
 Grave and Nick Ziegler, who had six kills and four blocks, both started for 
the Oilers last season, when they finished 23-0 and won the Southern Section 
Division I championship. Bart was also a key reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we still have the attitude that we can just show up and win," 
Huntington Beach Coach Rocky Ciarelli said. "The kids have to realize that they 
have to play hard all the time, or we're going to get beat." 
</P>
<P>
 After an easy victory in Game 1, the Oilers took an 11-5 lead in Game 2 and 
relaxed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Barons seized the opportunity and scored five consecutive points on 
Ratledge's serve. Blocks by Chris Kosty and Kurt Seckington helped Fountain 
Valley draw within one, 11-10. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley made one last run with Domingo blocking Grave to cut the lead 
to 14-12. But Grave answered with a spike from the left side for a side out 
then closed out the game with another from the right side. 
</P>
<P>
 Grave sat out most of Game 3, so Huntington Beach setter Josh Moss, who had 42 
assists, went to Bart for the key points. 
</P>
<P>
 Bart had six kills in Game 3, and scored the match-winning point by spiking 
off of an attempted block by Domingo and Ratledge.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to tell where we're at right now because we haven't been pushed in 
league yet," Ciarelli said. "But we've been playing hard in practice, so that's 
the key. Tough practices make the games easy."  
</P>
<P>
 In another league match: 
</P>
<P>
 Marina 3, Edison 2 -- Mike Wirthlin and Marc Aulen each had 23 kills and 
setter Steve Cavella had 80 assists for Marina, which beat Edison, 15-10, 
10-15, 14-16, 15-12, 15-12. Marina improves to 4-6, 4-1.

TRAVERS STEPS DOWN AS EL TORO BASKETBALL COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tim Travers has resigned as the boys' basketball coach at El Toro High, school 
officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Travers was the Chargers' coach for 14 seasons.His record was 175-172. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just time to move on," Travers said. "Basically I'm drained, 
emotionally and physically. I had a good run for 14 years." 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers finished 22-6 in 1990 and reached the semifinals of the Southern 
Section 5-A playoffs. They lost to eventual-champion Mater Dei, 80-55. 
</P>
<P>
 El Toro was South Coast League co-champion in 1987, reached the III-A 
quarterfinals in 1984 and finished 20-6 in 1988 -- the Chargers' second best 
record under Travers. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, however, the Chargers were 11-14, 3-10 in the South Coast League. 
</P>
<P>
 Travers will remain at the school as a history teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying I'll never coach again. It was just time to step away," 
Travers said.

 Lindsey Collins injured the pitcher, and later scored the winning run in 
Fountain Valley's 1-0 Sunset League victory over Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins, a freshman, hit a two-out line drive in the first inning that caught 
pitcher Stefanie Noffsinger in the face. 
</P>
<P>
 Noffsinger, who had given up two hits over the last four games, went down with 
a bad cut over her left eye. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could have been tragic," Fountain Valley Coach Cary Baker said. "If it had 
been her eye, or nose . . . it was just so quick."

 Noffsinger was taken to Hoag Hospital, where she was treated and released.

<P>
 Collins homered in the sixth inning for the game's only run. She has hit a 
home run in the Barons' last three league games.

 "Isn't she wild?" Baker said. "Physically, she looks about 20, but she's just 
a freshman. (The outfielders) thought they were deep enough."

<P>
 "I hope she takes up track," Huntington Beach Coach Julie Anderson said. "I 
hope she decides softball is too easy." 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach (7-2, 2-1) had a chance to score in the sixth. The Oilers 
loaded the bases with two outs, but Nicky Chavira grounded to pitcher Debroah 
Harrelson and was thrown out at first. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory put the Barons (7-5-1, 3-0) atop the Sunset League. 
</P>

 "Our kids needed it as a boost," Baker said. "It means everything. Now 
everybody's chasing us." HEATHER STEVENS

UNINSPIRED NORTHRIDGE WINS TWICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Asked what he thought of Cal State Northridge's play against Cal State 
Sacramento Friday, Coach Gary Torgeson used one word for every error the 
Matadors committed in the Western Athletic Conference softball doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played ugly and won," said Torgeson, after watching the Matadors sweep 
Sacramento, 3-2 in 12 innings and 2-0, despite a lackluster effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made more mental and physical mistakes today than we have made all year," 
Torgeson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixth-ranked Northridge (25-4, 4-0 in conference play), the defending WAC 
champion, made five throwing and fielding errors, but there were several other 
missed batting assignments and baserunning mistakes that kept the Matadors from 
taking any real pride in the victories. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge faces conference rival Fresno State today at 1:30 p.m. in Fresno to 
complete the Matadors' toughest road trip of the season. Northridge will have 
to clean up its act quickly if it hopes to beat the fifth-ranked Bulldogs, who 
won't soon forget their loss to the Matadors in last year's regional playoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Beth Calcante, who went three for five in the first game, hopes the 
Matadors' uninspired play improves in time to beat the Bulldogs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe this is rock bottom and we're gonna build up from here," Calcante said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors scored twice in the fifth inning of the first game on a 
run-scoring single by Calcante and a subsequent Hornet throwing error to take a 
2-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Hornets (17-13, 4-2) tied it, 2-2, in the sixth. With two out and 
runners at first and second, Tara Peterson knocked the ball out of first 
baseman Tamara Ivie's glove as she ran past the bag, trying to beat out a 
ground ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynn Lohmeier scored from second with the tying run on the error. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hornets went for the victory, sending home Threse Sheaman as well. Right 
fielder Terri Pearson picked up the loose ball in foul territory and nailed 
Sheaman at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors had stranded 12 runners after 11 innings. Calcante led off the 
12th with a single, stole second, advanced to third on Ivie's deep fly to right 
and scored on Scia Maumausolo's sacrifice fly to center. 
</P>
<P>
 After a combined 23 hits and eight errors, both teams knuckled down in the 
second game, which proved to be much more of a pitcher's duel. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Amy Windmiller (13-1), playing in her hometown for the first time as a 
Matador, pitched a four-hitter and struck out eight. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge wasted little time offensively, scoring Pearson in the first on a 
suicide squeeze by Ivie. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors added another run in the seventh when pinch-runner Shelby Wilcox 
scored on an error. 
</P>
<P>
 Windmiller, who didn't get to play in Sacramento last season because of rain, 
has not given up an earned run in 67 1/3 innings.

NET WORTH; RIVALS AND FRIENDS, CSUN SETTERS ACCEPT ROLES FOR GOOD OF TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The starter is quiet and down-to-earth, a big brother type. 
</P>
<P>
 The reserve shaves his head to a cue ball, directs pregame chants and exhorts 
his teammates to fashion turbans from towels and wear them as a show of 
solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Reznick and Chris McGee, setters on the Cal State Northridge volleyball 
team, possess contrasting styles and similar resumes. Both are fifth-year 
seniors who spent most of their college careers yearning to become a regular. 
</P>
<P>
 Theirs was an inevitable showdown, one that threatened to tear at the very 
fiber of a Matador team built on a little talent and a lot of camaraderie. 
</P>
<P>
 In the middle, their coach, John Price, found himself rooting for both and 
hoping the odd man out would be able to swallow pride and ego for the good of 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Reznick emerged as the victor, and leader of the offense. 
</P>
<P>
 McGee, again the backup, leads the cheers. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest winner of all: a young but talented Northridge team that appears 
poised to make a run at its second consecutive appearance in the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors (14-8) on Friday night won their fourth consecutive match, 
defeating UC San Diego, 15-5, 15-8, 15-3. Northridge has won six of its last 
seven and is surging behind the play of middle blocker Oliver Heitmann, a 
6-foot-7 German import who has established himself as one of college 
volleyball's top players. 
</P>
<P>
 Heitmann has 95 kills during the Matadors' winning streak, largely because his 
timing with Reznick on the quick-hit has improved with every match. 
</P>
<P>
 But equally important have been the contributions of McGee, who is the team's 
captain even though he is rarely in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen anyone else do it from the bench, but he says all the right 
things and does all the right things," Price said of McGee. "What he has added 
to this team is unbelievable, much more than anyone realizes. And he's played 
very little." 
</P>
<P>
 A reserve's popularity might cause a jealous snit on some teams, but Reznick 
seems genuinely pleased that his backup is given a star's share of the credit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chris is the captain of this team for a reason," Reznick said. "He's always 
put the team and winning and his friends and teammates above everything else. 
He's a special person, and a major reason why this team is on a roll." 
</P>
<P>
 Reznick and McGee have been friends for a decade, since they were teammates as 
seventh-graders on the Woodland Hills Cowboys basketball team. They were 
recruited by Price at the same time, for the same position, but for different 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 McGee was a Crespi High basketball and volleyball standout who Price believed 
might one day develop into a role player. Reznick, from Taft High, was brought 
in to push Matt Unger, the incumbent at setter, for a starting berth. 
</P>
<P>
 As it happened, Unger was academically ineligible in 1990 and Reznick became 
the starter in his first season. He helped guide Northridge to a 13-12 record 
-- its first winning season in eight years -- while McGee took a redshirt year. 
But the following season, Unger reclaimed his position and Reznick and McGee 
began a three-year tenure as rotating understudies. 
</P>
<P>
 In practice, the pair took turns challenging Unger and the other first-teamers 
during scrimmages. "We bonded together because we always were rooting for each 
other," McGee said. "It was kind of a second-team thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Last season when the Matadors advanced to the NCAA championship match, 
Northridge was the only team in the nation to have three setters on its 
traveling squad. Price said he brought along Reznick, who was using his 
redshirt year, "in case of emergency." 
</P>
<P>
 Having two veteran players competing for the same position in their final year 
was a situation Price met with both anticipation and dread. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew their competition would make them both better and therefore make the 
team better," Price said. "(But) in either case there was going to be a guy who 
wanted nothing more in the world then to start in his final year, and only one 
of them was going to do it. It was kind of good and kind of bad." 
</P>
<P>
 The two came out of fall drills in a dead heat and the competition still was 
too close to call after two weeks of practice in January. 
</P>
<P>
 As is his tradition before the start of a season, Price individually asked 
each Northridge player what his starting lineup would be were he the coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other spots were pretty solid choices," Price recalled. "But when we got 
around to the setter there was usually a long pause. I got a lot of 
I-don't-knows." 
</P>
<P>
 McGee, who at 6-feet-4 is two inches taller than Reznick, started the first 
game of Northridge's season-opener against Pepperdine in the Santa Barbara 
tournament. The Matadors lost. Reznick started in the second game, against 
Hawaii. The Matadors won. 
</P>
<P>
 Price's choice soon became obvious. In the practices that followed the 
tournament, Reznick started playing with the first team in two of every three 
rotations, then fulltime. 
</P>
<P>
 Consistency had prevailed.  
</P>
<P>
 "Chris actually does a nicer job in terms of choice and running a game plan," 
Price said. "But the No. 1 criteria for me has always been location, and Gary 
is just a little more consistent. Hitters seemed to hit his sets a little 
better. His mistakes were not as severe." 
</P>
<P>
 The coach's choice, coupled with the earthquake and sudden death of Crespi 
basketball Coach Paul Muff, threw the usually unflappable McGee into a weeklong 
funk. 
</P>
<P>
 "His enthusiasm, his personality, his fire, the things that make Chris Chris 
just weren't there," Price said. "You could tell something was bothering him 
and obviously that something was the fact that he wasn't playing on the 
first-team side of the net." 
</P>
<P>
 Price contemplated a confrontation but thought better of it. "I figured if I 
gave him a few days he would rebound, and he did," the coach said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of Unger and another former teammate, All-American middle 
blocker Coley Kyman, McGee conquered his depression. 
</P>
<P>
 After seeing how disappointed McGee was after not playing much in an early 
season match against USC, Unger offered words of encouragement and the 
prediction that he would soon "get his chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Kyman, who was rehabilitating an injured right leg at the U.S. Olympic 
Training Center in Colorado Springs, Colo., offered similar sentiments in a 
letter. 
</P>
<P>
 McGee had helped Kyman through the death of his mother in 1990. Kyman wrote to 
express what McGee's friendship and help had meant to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coley is a winner, bottom line, and what he said to me pumped me up," McGee 
said. "He told me I was a leader and that whether I was on the court or not, I 
was the guy people were going to look to. 
</P>
<P>
 "That made me think. I was so bummed because I wasn't playing I figured I had 
no role on this team. It made me realize what my role is, to bond this team 
together and teach these young guys what it takes to win." 
</P>
<P>
 In the ensuing weeks, McGee resumed the role of ringleader he shared with 
Kyman and Unger in previous seasons, bringing together teammates at every 
opportunity -- even if the assignment was to heckle the Northridge baseball 
team's latest opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great to have a leader off the floor that can help you on it," said 
Peter Piexoto, a sophomore who is a two-year starter at outside hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 McGee said the onus of being a career reserve still "stings a little," but he 
has accepted his assignment as a back-row defensive specialist and team 
spiritual leader. 
</P>
<P>
 He has appeared in every match and on two occasions has swung momentum in 
Northridge's favor after replacing Reznick at setter. 
</P>
<P>
 On the rare occasion McGee plays in his place, Reznick returns the support. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he goes in I want him to do great," Reznick said.  
</P>
<P>
 "If he comes in for me and plays well enough to stay in, then that means we're 
doing well as a team and we're probably going to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Price said both players are so unselfish that, had the roles been reversed, 
the results would have been the same.  
</P>
<P>
 "Gary would have struggled with it for a while, then accepted his role and 
done whatever was best for the team," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reznick wonders whether he would have been so gracious. "You ask yourself, 
what if it was the other way around? 
</P>
<P>
 "In any competition you love to win, but with Chris it really was a 
bittersweet feeling. I have so much respect for him as a player and a person. I 
love him like a brother. We've been through thick and thin together."

COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: CAL LUTHERAN UNDETERRED BY KERNEN'S TACTICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do, it seems. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge Coach Bill Kernen apologized after Wednesday's 2-1 loss to Cal 
Lutheran and said he hoped the Kingsmen didn't interpret his sweeping lineup 
changes as a slight. 
</P>
<P>
 Kernen, upset at his team's inability to play with sustained fire, benched 
several starters. Two pitchers were inserted into the lineup as position 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 Kernen didn't discuss his team's internal problems with the Cal Lutheran 
coaching staff beforehand, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran Coach Marty Slimak said Kernen's tactics had "no effect" on the 
Kingsmen. 
</P>
<P>
 All the Kingsmen knew was that they were facing a Northridge lineup that 
included five players who entered the game with a combined six at-bats. Not to 
mention the fact that Kernen didn't allow his players to wear jerseys. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is totally about us," Kernen said. "No disrespect was intended and I 
hope they didn't see it like that." 
</P>
<P>
 For the Kingsmen, a highly regarded NCAA Division III team, it was an 
important game against an annual area rival that has enjoyed great success in 
Division I. Kernen had a point to make, though, and Cal Lutheran settled for a 
narrow victory over a makeshift lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran was not disappointed. Starting pitcher Sam Arroyo, who did not 
allow an earned run in six innings, said he had been looking forward to the 
game all year. He was hit hard in an 11-4 loss to Northridge last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very surprised (at the lineup,)" Arroyo said. "But I still had to go 
out and redeem myself." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Is Kernen overreacting in light of the Matadors' respectable performance in 
Western Athletic Conference play? 
</P>
<P>
 Absolutely not, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the team has virtually no chance of qualifying for the regionals as an 
at-large team, winning the WAC title would earn the Matadors an automatic 
berth. Northridge is 6-3 and tied for first place in the WAC West Division with 
San Diego State (4-2). 
</P>
<P>
 Kernen pointed out that Northridge lost two of three at Cal State Sacramento 
last month. San Diego State swept a three-game series at Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Life at the top may not last long, he said. Northridge plays a three-game set 
at San Diego next weekend. Besides, Kernen feels he has bigger fences to mend. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking about something bigger than the WAC race in 1994," Kernen said. 
"This is an erosion of the heart of the program." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Marco Contreras, a senior in his second year at Northridge, has seen Kernen's 
fire-and-brimstone act before. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Kernen challenged the pitching staff for its season-long mediocrity 
before last weekend's series with Fresno State. It made Contreras angry, which 
undoubtedly was the response Kernen was seeking. 
</P>
<P>
 Contreras beat Fresno State, 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me before the Fresno series that I was basically (poor)," Contreras 
said. "I thought, 'I want to show this guy that I'm not soft.' " 
</P>
<P>
 After the coach blasted the pitchers, the reaction of Contreras' other mates 
perhaps underscores why Kernen says the team has little character. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were surprised I took it so hard," Contreras said. "But you've got to 
take it personal." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What can his players to get back in Kernen's good graces? 
</P>
<P>
 "Good question," Kernen said. "They'd better be creative." 
</P>
<P>
 The players seem stumped as well. The Matadors practiced for four hours 
Thursday, but haven't arrived on a plan to appease the coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "There aren't any magic solutions so far," first baseman Jason Shanahan said. 
"We had a pretty good workout today, one of our better ones in a while." 
</P>
<P>
 Shanahan said players will each wage a personal war to win back their 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm fighting for my life here," said Shanahan, a junior and a three-year 
letterman. "I think any person would take (this situation) and react like 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Kernen later said that in the past, teams that were in his doghouse might have 
considered practicing all day or sleeping in the clubhouse to prove their work 
ethic. 
</P>
<P>
 Shanahan characterized Thursday's practice as "a lot more serious" than 
normal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For what it's worth, Kernen has a degree in psychology. In fact, he graduated 
with honors from UC Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Second baseman Keyaan Cook continues to enjoy his greatest success in WAC 
competition. Last year, the Montclair Prep graduate ranked among the Matadors' 
best in conference play, and he has improved. 
</P>
<P>
 Entering the weekend, Cook led WAC West Division players in batting (.486), 
runs (11), doubles (five), hits (18) and on-base percentage (.558). He ranks 
third in slugging percentage (.703). CAL LUTHERAN 
</P>
<P>
 Check Their Numbers 
</P>
<P>
 For the second year in a row, reports of the Kingsmen's baseball game against 
Cal State Northridge included few details about the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season in a game won by Northridge, 11-4, news accounts centered around 
the perceived lack of respect Division III Cal Lutheran showed by vociferously 
ragging the Division I Matadors during the early innings. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, Kernen's tactics to reprimand his players stole the show. 
</P>
<P>
 All but ignored was Cal Lutheran's victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, we were there. We were the ones with the uniforms on," cracked Slimak, 
the Kingsmen's first-year coach.  
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran (16-4-1), ranked among the nation's best small-college teams, has 
won two of its last three games against Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Slimak pointed out that major-college pitchers are often also talented 
position players. In fact, pitchers Contreras and Jason Vargas each went one 
for three and John Najar played well at first base. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of those (pitchers) can play two positions," Slimak said. 
</P>
<P>
 Seldom-used reserves James Woods and Steve Moreno also had their first hits.

meetings.

practice ends May 6 with a scrimmage.

NORTHRIDGE ROLLS PAST UCSD, STRETCHES VOLLEYBALL STREAK TO 4 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Peter Piexoto had 14 kills and Oliver Heitmann added seven as Cal State 
Northridge defeated UC San Diego, 15-5, 15-8, 15-3, in a Mountain Pacific 
Sports Federation men's volleyball match Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was the fourth in a row for the Matadors (14-8, 10-6 in conference 
play) and their sixth in the last seven matches. 
</P>

ROUNDUP; REPRIEVED, NORDHOFF CASHES IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It took nine innings and a lot of luck, but Nordhoff High won its first 
Frontier League baseball game since 1991 with a 6-4 victory over host Santa 
Clara on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clara (3-4, 1-2 in league play) appeared to have won the game in the 
bottom of the seventh on what would have been a bases-loaded single by Fernando 
Garcia with the score tied, 4-4. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Saint baserunners on first and second were ruled out in an 
inning-ending double play because they didn't advance to the next bases, opting 
instead to join the celebration at home plate. 
</P>
<P>
 Nordhoff (4-4-1, 1-2) scored two runs in the ninth when Craig Pravata tripled 
to start the inning and scored on a single by Miles Robertson. One out later, 
Brian Roney doubled home Robertson. 
</P>
<P>
 Pravata and Robertson each had two hits, with Robertson scoring three runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Rio Mesa 2, Hueneme 1 -- Donald DiDomizio had a no-hitter for 4 2/3 innings 
before Richard Soliz came on to pick up the save in the Channel League game at 
Rio Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 DiDomizio (2-1) allowed one hit, walked one and struck out three in 4 2/3 
innings. Soliz gave up two hits and struck out one in 2 1/3 innings of relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Rio Mesa (7-4, 4-1) scored both its runs in the fourth. The first came on an 
RBI single by Erick Flores and the second scored on a bases-loaded walk to 
Marcus Yasutake. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spartans have won four in a row after a league-opening loss to Buena. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura 3, Santa Barbara 0 -- Robert Verstraeten (2-1) took just 86 pitches to 
shut out host Santa Barbara (7-4, 2-3) in a Channel League game. 
</P>
<P>
 The junior right-hander scattered four hits and struck out eight without 
giving up a walk, and threw his first pitch for a strike to 21 of 25 batters. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeremy Pierce was two for three for Ventura (3-6-1, 3-2), while Monte Moritz 
had a pair of run-scoring sacrifice flies. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar 7, Chatsworth 6 -- Chris Ruley's sacrifice fly drove home Art Diaz with 
the winning run in the bottom of the sixth in the second round of the Bishop 
Gorman tournament in Las Vegas. The game was called after the sixth because of 
a time limit. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior right-hander Carlos Velazco (4-1) went the distance for Sylmar (9-3), 
striking out one and walking five. Chatsworth's Bryan LaCour was two for three, 
including a solo home run and a run-scoring double, and drove in three runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Highland 7, Sahuaro (Ariz.) 6 -- With the bases loaded and one out in the 
bottom of the seventh, sophomore Ben Mia's bad-hop double over the head of the 
Sahuaro left fielder drove in two runs to win a pool-play game of the Bishop 
Gorman tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Joe Chavez (1-0) did not allow an earned run over 3 2/3 innings of 
two-hit relief to earn the victory for Highland (2-8). 
</P>
<P>
 Poly 4, San Gorgonio 1 -- Javier Sanchez (1-2) pitched a one-hitter to earn 
his first victory, leading Poly (6-2) to its third pool-play victory in the 
Bishop Gorman tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior right-hander retired the first 15 San Gorgonio batters before 
surrendering a sixth-inning triple to Wayne Caro, and finished with seven 
strikeouts while giving up one walk. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy 6, Highland (Utah) 3 -- George Kassis came in with a runner on third 
and nobody out in the sixth inning and retired the side to earn his third save 
for Kennedy (4-4-1) in a game shortened to six innings by darkness in the 
Bishop Gorman tournament.

California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference doubleheader at 
Claremont-Mudd-Scripps.

rule. WOMEN'S SWIMMING 
</P>

all but one event for an improbable victory. Martin and Barker each won three 
events.

JAZZ REVIEWS; SOLSONICS NEUTRALIZE THE 'ACID' LABEL; THE ENSEMBLE'S COACH HOUSE 
SHOW MAY NOT HAVE HERALDED A NEW DIRECTION, BUT IT DID OFFER SOME FRESH SOUNDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the few years since its inception, "acid jazz" has been championed as the 
badly needed new direction musicians have been seeking since the jazz-rock 
fusion revolution of the 1970s. But at the Coach House on Thursday, the 
nine-piece Solsonics (whose current CD is called "Jazz in the Present Tense") 
demonstrated that it's really the same old thing. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not to say that the group isn't good at what it does. The Solsonics are 
a tight, musically astute ensemble that embraces a bevy of genres. Blues, rock, 
reggae and rap all swirl into their jazzy mix, which is played with competence 
and a bit of flair. 
</P>
<P>
 The Solsonics are more musical and less reliant on sampling gimmicks than acid 
bands such as Jazz Hole. In fact, they're reminiscent of an old-style R & B 
road band that can take on any number of personae and present them 
convincingly. 
</P>
<P>
 But to credit them as champions of a new direction is a bit of a stretch. 
Their rhythmic experiments recall the work of '70s-edition Grover Washington 
Jr. or the funk bands of Herbie Hancock. Their most visible jazz cover, Freddie 
Hubbard's "Red Clay," is a tune that's been around for about 20 years, and, 
with the exception of some introductory vocal high jinks, the group does little 
to change it. Even the CD's title cut employs a riff straight out of Oliver 
Nelson's "Jeannine," a song that's older than most of the Solsonics themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, this is a band with a fresh sound and the skills to make things 
interesting. Their opening number, "Now This Is How We Do It," gave a view into 
their method: strong saxophone, flute and guitar solos that build on tough, 
snappy rhythms from drummer Willie McNeil. 
</P>
<P>
 All the featured soloists showed some character during their improvisations. 
Flutist Derrick Davis was fleet, agile and inventive on "Morning After 
Paradise," and guitarist Emile Poree played with some of the same electric 
intensity that John McLaughlin brought to drummer Tony Williams' heralded 
Lifetime trio a quarter century ago. Tenor saxophonist Jim Akimoto played with 
a considered cool but wasn't afraid to kick out the jams when it was called 
for. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of the unit is bassist Jez Colin, who works with drive and an 
insistent funkiness, and drummer McNeil, who rolled and rattled on a trap set 
that seemed almost child-size before his considerable frame. Together, they 
give the Solsonics the punch that overall made their set so rewarding. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Vocalist Mark Tunkara sang the beat-plea "Keep the Rhythm Strong" with a 
direct, no-gimmicks style; Kevin Williams took the vocal lead on "Blood 
Brother," delivering the call for peace with strength and conviction. The two 
singers often combined their voices, both in harmony and unison, in a way that 
didn't distract from what their band mates were playing in support. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas the Solsonics represented the more professional side of acid jazz, 
opening act Strangefruit sounded a bit amateurish and did not show the musical 
competence of the headliners.  
</P>
<P>
 The six-piece ensemble, which covers such jazz stalwarts as "All Blues" and 
"Afro-Blue" at their ongoing Wednesday engagement at 5th Street Dick's Coffee 
House in Los Angeles, used their Coach House appearance to concentrate on 
original hip-hop inspired material. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Such tunes as "No White Clouds," "To the East" and "Bohemian Negritude," 
despite their sincere, often enthusiastic delivery -- led by rapper-keyboardist 
Moorylien M. Jenkins -- continually fell short because of a lack of musical 
ability. 
</P>
<P>
 But the band has a good sense of drama and a particularly stimulating way of 
working up a frenzy, as drums and percussion build against garage-styled guitar 
licks from Maria Hobbs and alto sax noodlings from Ngozi Inyama meld into an 
onslaught of sound.  
</P>
<P>
 Time spent pulling their musical chops together would go a long way in helping 
Strangefruit get their promising material across.

PEOPLE DISCRIMINATE, BUT AIDS DOES NOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is in response to Sharon Biggers' March 26 letter regarding Tom Hanks' 
Oscar speech. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems she believes that the entire AIDS epidemic has contained itself 
within the entertainment and artistic community and that she, as part of the 
rest of the nation, should not be made to feel guilty or responsible for these 
individuals since it was their choices that led to the contraction of the 
disease. She went as far as equating AIDS to smoke-induced lung cancer or a 
drug overdose. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's put aside the fact that AIDS is the No. 3 cause of death in babies, or 
that the fastest growing risk group seems to be young adults from 12-17 who are 
experimenting with drugs and sex -- most while still under the care and 
tutelage of their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's forget the fact that the AIDS epidemic is spreading as quickly in women 
as it is in men and that every sexual partner you and your spouse-lover has had 
in the past 10 years can affect your life. Let's even scoff at the idea that a 
large and constantly growing number of doctors are saying that homosexuality is 
genetically predetermined. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's focus on the fact that this strong and compelling movie ("Philadelphia") 
was made to help open the public's eye to the way AIDS is dealt with in society 
today. Not only with the victims, their families and loved ones, but with the 
people they come in contact with daily. The movie shows the bigotry and 
ignorance they face, the pain, humiliation and fear they experience and the 
courage they possess when the disease wreaks havoc through the fragile thing we 
call a body. 
</P>
<P>
 I can only hope that Ms. Biggers will open her mind a bit and read about a 
disease she obviously knows little about. I know information is available -- 
even in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Or better yet, maybe she could push herself away from her table of 
self-righteousness and visit an AIDS ward or hospice. Maybe she can find the 
compassion she seems to have lost behind the face of a 5-month-old baby whose 
body is racked with convulsions. 
</P>
<P>
 She can counsel the mother of the 13-year-old with the fact that it was a 
predominantly behavior-related disease that killed her child. And as the man in 
the chair next to her mourns over pictures of his lover when he was a robust 
180 pounds, instead of the 70 pounds he is now, maybe she can ask him what part 
of the entertainment industry he's in. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Ms. Biggers, the entire nation should feel responsible -- if for nothing 
else than to teach our children that bigotry and ignorance are not acceptable 
in any form. And guilty for the fact that by our careless words, not their 
actions, we make people ashamed of who and what they are. 
</P>
<P>
 So, if you are concerned with the fact that the heavens are crowded with 
"angels" who have been lost to this deadly disease -- console yourself with the 
fact that the judgmental are rarely admitted.

STRONG SURGE OF NEW JOBS REPORTED; ECONOMY: GOVERNMENT FIGURES FOR MARCH LEAP 
TO A SIX-YEAR HIGH, SHOW MODEST GROWTH IN CALIFORNIA. THE NEWS RAISES FEARS OF 
INFLATION AMONG SOME INVESTORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT and STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. economy produced more jobs during March than in any month in more 
than six years, the Labor Department said Friday, but the good news for workers 
heightened inflation fears among investors already shaken by declines in the 
stock and bond markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Even California showed growth, with a modest increase of 5,800 new jobs 
helping to cut the unemployment rate to 8.6%, down from 9%, while Los Angeles 
County's rate fell to 9.4% from 9.7%. 
</P>
<P>
 March jobless figures for Orange County are not yet available. For February, 
however, the unemployment rate fell to 6.6%, down from 7.2% in the previous 
month, according to the state Department of Employment Development. There were 
6,700 jobs created in Orange County between January and February. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, according to the government's monthly survey of business payrolls, 
the number of working Americans soared by 456,000 in March, the largest gain 
since 556,000 in October, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the state's recovery -- despite increased construction spending for 
earthquake repairs -- remains relatively sluggish and tentative, lagging far 
behind the national expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 "We seem to be in a slow upturn," said Ted Gibson, chief economist for the 
state Department of Finance, noting that employment has risen for three 
straight months. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government's monthly survey of business payrolls showed that the 
number of working Americans soared by 456,000 last month, the largest gain 
since 556,000 in October, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 The national unemployment rate remained unchanged from February, at 6.5%, but 
that figure is based on a survey of households that recently was revised and 
still is considered much less reliable than the payroll survey. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Clinton Administration, Friday was a day of carefully measured 
responses, with officials trying to cheer the robust job-creation report while 
assuaging fears of anxious investors and traders. 
</P>
<P>
 "The economy is creating jobs at a good pace, but without the inflationary 
pressure from the labor market that could ultimately compromise future economic 
growth," said Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the President's chief economic adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the unexpectedly big gain in jobs adds to pressure on the Federal 
Reserve Board to boost interest rates further. The Fed has moved recently to 
nudge up rates in order to dampen potential inflation fears; those rate 
increases, in turn, are frightening investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Those fears were reflected in the bond market, open for an abbreviated Good 
Friday session. Prices fell sharply for the key 30-year Treasury bond, with its 
interest rate climbing to 7.26%, the highest level since January, 1993. The New 
York Stock Exchange was closed. 
</P>
<P>
 The sharp decline in bond prices was an overreaction by investors who fear 
that a booming job market will rekindle inflation, said Larry Kimbell, director 
of the UCLA Business Forecasting Project. 
</P>
<P>
 If the extraordinary job gains in March continue for several months, "that 
would be an outrageous boom and that could lead to a surge of inflation," 
Kimbell said. "You can make a case for that, but when I look at everything, it 
just doesn't add up." 
</P>
<P>
 For Orange County, "the recovery is finally here . . . and will continue," 
said Anil Puri, chairman of the economics department at Cal State Fullerton. 
"Orange County has shown signs of improvement in unemployment numbers and 
people with jobs during the first quarter of this year. We see this trend 
accelerating by the end of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 Puri noted that Orange County's unemployment rate has historically been 1 to 2 
percentage points below the national figure. At 6.6%, however, the county's 
rate is slightly higher than the U.S. average of 6.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite February's improvement, "it will be at least six months to a year 
before Orange County unemployment rates drop below the national average," Puri 
said. 
</P>

 Kimbell said inflation appears to be in check for reasons that include stable 
oil prices and strong national productivity figures. In addition, he noted that 
many long-discouraged unemployed workers are beginning to return to the job 
market, adding to competition for jobs and holding down pressure for higher 
wages. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, a separate report Friday noted that average hourly earnings rose only 
0.1% in March, and a scant 2.4% over the past 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Since last summer, the economy has been adding about 200,000 jobs a month. 
"March puts us back on track to where we would have been had we not lost so 
much ground in the bad weather during January," Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich 
said at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The recovery is being paced by consumer spending, which represents two-thirds 
of the nation's economic activity. It rose 1% in February, following a revised 
0.1% advance in January, for the 11th straight monthly increase, the Commerce 
Department said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Spending was helped by an advance in personal income, which rose 1.3% in 
February, the department said. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Friday's economic news demonstrates that there is a "a healthy, 
vibrant recovery, but it's probably not growing as rapidly as the figures at 
first blush suggest," said Robert D. Barr, deputy chief economist with the U.S. 
Chamber of Commerce.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's important to note, since the stock and bond markets, as well as the 
Federal Reserve, have been concerned over the past two months that too strong a 
recovery would push up the inflation rate later this year." 
</P>
<P>
 But the arguments of Barr, Kimbell and their fellow economists may have little 
effect on the fears that often accompany a slipping stock market. 
</P>
<P>
 The fear among various government officials, as well as some private 
economists, is that the decline in financial markets, fueled by speculation and 
worry, has a momentum all its own. 
</P>
<P>
 The securities markets "are not considering what's really happened over the 
last three quarters," said Audrey Freedman, a labor economist in New York. "If 
you don't have good judgment, there are overreactions," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the national labor market, there were more than 130 million people working 
last month, and 8.5 million without jobs, according to the federal household 
survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturing jobs rose again in March, increasing for the sixth straight 
month, and construction employment advanced as the weather improved. There were 
also job gains in such service industries as health care, restaurants and 
hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 California had 14.2 million working residents and 1.3 million unemployed.  
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson called the report "encouraging news," saying California "is 
coming back, and these numbers are an added boost to confidence as we continue 
our recovery," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 But while the survey of employer payrolls shows California gaining 29,000 jobs 
since December, that increase is dwarfed by the employment losses suffered in 
the state during the recession. Estimates put those jobs losses in the range of 
600,000 to 800,000.  
</P>
<P>
 Among the 11 big states whose jobless figures were reported Friday, 
California's rate remained the highest. Next came New York, at 8.1%. The lowest 
rate was posted by North Carolina, at 4.4%, followed by both Ohio and 
Massachusetts at 5.9%.

BRAZEN PIER AREA KILLER HAS HUNTINGTON SHAKEN; CRIME: RESIDENTS FEARFUL OF 
RISING VIOLENCE. MAN WHO CALMLY GUNNED DOWN TWO ON SIDEWALK REMAINS AT LARGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As police searched Friday for the killer of two young men found shot to death 
near the Huntington Beach Pier, fear and anger swept through the trendy 
downtown district that the city has spent millions of dollars to redevelop. 
</P>
<P>
 No one really is certain what spurred the deadly confrontation, but by about 
10:15 p.m. Thursday, Chen Cosmo Blanchard, 23, and Kenny Paul Summer, 23, both 
of Huntington Beach, were lying dead on the sidewalk on the southeastern corner 
of Main and Orange Streets, a few feet away from the entrance to Great Western 
Sanitary Supplies and just a few blocks away from the pier. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Friday that a long-haired man shot them without provocation, then 
walked away calmly. But some witnesses offered a different account, saying the 
gunman got into an argument with the two men and then shot each of them three 
times before fleeing in a car. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they do not believe that the shootings were gang-related, and one 
city official who did not want to be identified said it appeared that the 
shooter was upset at the two victims because he saw them urinating outside on a 
wall. They got into a shoving match, the official said, then the man left the 
scene only to return a short while later with a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 By Friday morning, the scene of the crime -- still cordoned off -- was the 
focal point of interest for bike riders, early morning strollers and other 
onlookers, as Huntington Beach residents struggled to piece together the 
night's unusually brazen violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Stephan, co-owner of the sanitary supplies store, watched from inside his 
business as people milled about outside, and he pondered what he believes are 
the root causes of the killing. "I could see it coming," he said. "At night, 
gangs come here from other areas and this gets ugly -- you wouldn't want to 
bring your family down here. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was surprised (this type of crime) didn't happen earlier," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His words were echoed by other residents who lamented the changes in the 
downtown area, worrying about the large crowds of youngsters who gather there 
in the evenings and about the crime and violence that they seem to attract near 
the pier. 
</P>
<P>
 While police said the crime rate in the downtown area appears to actually have 
fallen in recent years, some residents said their neighborhoods seem more 
threatening to them today. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm an old fart, I'm 51, but I've been coming down here since I was 4," said 
Charlotte Melson, who began summering in Huntington Beach in 1949 and moved 
there in 1976. "I've watched the town grow from oil city to the mess it is now. 
. . . I never in my life dreamed I'd have to worry about bullets flying 
downtown." 
</P>
<P>
 Melson and her husband stroll Main Street a couple times each week, walking 
their dogs, visiting the Native American crafts store and stopping for coffee 
at the new Starbuck's. But a few months ago their 27-year-old son was jumped a 
couple blocks from their home. More recently, she and her husband were sharing 
some sweets at the Sugar Shack when they witnessed a hit-and-run accident among 
the ubiquitous cruisers that clog Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The area "has become more popular, which is fine. We do need the business," 
said Melson. "The problem is I've noticed more hostility. Instead of people 
being nice, saying, 'Have a good day,' they're cussing you out. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "There are too many liquor licenses and too many bars. We've gotten too 
popular. We're drawing too many degenerates, gangs, bad elements, vagrants. We 
need solutions," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Police Sgt. Mike Corcoran said Thursday's brutal shootings "are nothing like 
the kind of things we are used to seeing or dealing with in our city. This is 
just a reflection of what's going on throughout our society." 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach Police Chief Ronald E. Lowenberg said the double slaying is 
very unusual for the city, which historically has had a low homicide rate.  
</P>
<P>
 "We only had three homicides throughout the city in 1993," he said. "A double 
homicide such as this is unusual in any part of the city, much less in the 
downtown area." 
</P>
<P>
 Lowenberg said he did not immediately have precise statistics, but he said 
that overall crime has been lower in the city's downtown area since 
redevelopment began about 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Huntington Beach Councilman Ralph Bauer said Friday that crime 
appears to have become less of a problem in the downtown area since 
redevelopment. Bauer said that prior to redevelopment, the city's downtown was 
a haven for drug users, prostitutes and runaways. 
</P>
<P>
 "Downtown is better than it used to be," he said. "The crime rate in the 
downtown is similar to, but certainly not worse, than any other area of the 
city." 
</P>
<P>
 Bauer, however, said that like some local residents, he too is concerned that 
there may be too many new bars in the city's redeveloped downtown. The 
shootings took place near a bar, and some city officials said the victims may 
have been inside the tavern just before the confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get some impression that the people affected (in the shooting) had been in 
one of the bars," Bauer said. "I frankly think the city should take a good hard 
look at the number of liquor licenses downtown. They may be a little excessive. 
I think this is something the city should get with the ABC (Alcoholic Beverage 
Control) people and discuss." 
</P>
<P>
 Some say the combination of a good-looking downtown area and bars are 
attracting a young but undesirable crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ever since they remodeled this area, a lot of young people have come here, 
many of them gang-types who just hang around, a lot of them at the bars, and 
that's a pretty bad mix," said Steve Chumley, who has lived in Huntington Beach 
for nine years and stopped by the scene of the shootings Friday on his bicycle 
route.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is crazy. This used to be a safe town," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many old-timers say they feel like the town is being overrun by gangs. That 
might have triggered widespread rumors Thursday that the victims were 
skinheads. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Lowenberg said it is "too early to tell" whether the shooting was 
gang related. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if the incident may involve so-called "skinheads," Lowenberg responded, 
"We have no hard evidence, but there is a bar close to the shooting area that 
has a reputation for that type of patrons." 
</P>
<P>
 "Skinheads" generally have shaved heads and profess white supremacy. Some 
so-called skinheads wear para-military clothing and carry Nazi emblems and 
memorabilia, and Huntington Beach has historically been a magnet for skinhead 
gatherings. 
</P>
<P>
 Corcoran of the Huntington Beach Police Department said the victims did wear 
"very short hair" and had tattoos emblazoned on their bodies, "but we can't say 
they're skinheads just because of that." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, police officers and members of the volunteer Search and 
Rescue Team of Huntington Beach distributed flyers throughout downtown with a 
drawing of the killer's likeness and a description. The flyers asked anyone 
with information on the case to contact detectives Chuck Thomas or Dale Mason 
at (714) 375-5066 or 536-5951. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are looking for a bespectacled, long-haired man with dark complexion, 
between 5-feet, 6-inches and 5-feet, 9-inches tall and wearing a dark-colored 
baseball cap and a knee-length dark coat. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While police say the deadly attack appeared unprovoked, businessman Jinx 
Varona, whose Taxi's bar is less than half a block from the scene of the 
shooting, said he was present when two young witnesses told police Friday that 
the man stepped down from a silver Saab Turbo 900 and walked toward two 
supposed "skinheads." 
</P>
<P>
 The bar owner said the young witnesses claimed an argument ensued and that the 
man from the Saab then shot the two "skinheads" and jumped back into the car, 
which was driven away by another man. 
</P>
<P>
 The city official, who asked not to be identified, appeared to corroborate 
parts of this version of events. 
</P>
<P>
 "This guy who is being sought walked by an outdoor area where two men were 
urinating against a wall," the official said. "The guy had his girlfriend with 
him, and he complained to the two men. They then got into a dispute, but the 
two guys finally went back into a bar, and the guy and his girlfriend walked 
on.  
</P>
<P>
 "But apparently this guy later waited for the two men to come out of the bar," 
the official said. "Forty-five minutes after the first sidewalk dispute, the 
two guys came out of the bar, and this man confronted them and shot them." 
</P>
<P>
 Loretta Wolfe, co-chair of the Downtown Residents Assn., said Friday that many 
downtowners say they remember seeing a man who resembles the police sketch of 
the suspect in the slaying. She said, however, that no one she knows had pinned 
a name to the face.

of nesting in a busy parking lot. But she couldn't have chosen a better one: 
It's at the Sea & Sage Audubon Society headquarters in Irvine. . . . The 
society's Trude Hurd has put up safety cones to protect the nest from traffic 
during a four-week incubation. "The mother and the father have been taking 
turns on the nest," Hurd says. "We hope we can keep their three eggs protected 
until they hatch."

CHILD KIDNAPING RUMORS FUEL ATTACKS ON AMERICANS; GUATEMALA: MILITARY MAY BE 
FOMENTING FEAR OF FOREIGNERS. HYSTERIA MAY INVITE HARD-LINER BACKLASH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A wave of hysteria fueled by rumors of child-snatching foreigners has 
victimized three Americans, triggered rioting in Guatemalan villages and 
threatens to provoke a backlash by government security forces. 
</P>
<P>
 An American woman was beaten nearly to death Tuesday in a remote Indian 
village and remained in a coma Friday. June Weinstock, 51, a journalist from 
Fairbanks, Alaska, suffered extensive injuries when a mob beat her with 
machetes, clubs and metal pipes while she was visiting San Cristobal Verapaz in 
northeastern Guatemala.  
</P>
<P>
 Villagers chased and attacked Weinstock under the mistaken impression that she 
had stolen a local child. The child later reappeared. An unidentified American 
man translating for Weinstock was also hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Another American woman was nearly lynched last month under similar 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors of Americans stealing children -- either to adopt or, in the more 
fantastic versions, to harvest their organs for transplants -- have long 
circulated in Guatemala and other Latin American nations. But the hysteria that 
has gripped Guatemala in recent weeks is unprecedented. 
</P>
<P>
 It builds on the local legend of Miculash, a Guatemalan bogyman who stole 
children to make soap out of them. But analysts said there may be a more 
carefully orchestrated ploy at work here.  
</P>
<P>
 Hard-line factions of the Guatemalan military are believed to be exploiting 
these visceral fears -- perhaps even encouraging them -- to undermine public 
security and to generate suspicion of foreigners.  
</P>
<P>
 The furor came as the Guatemalan army sought ways to maintain control of the 
domestic security apparatus in the face of a push by civilian authorities to 
diminish military influence.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In both the Weinstock beating and the riots that ensued after the arrest of a 
New Mexico woman -- also accused of nabbing a child -- in Santa Lucia 
Cotzumalguapa, the army was called in to restore order. Conservatives in the 
government of President Ramiro de Leon Carpio are hinting at a sudden need to 
take drastic actions to calm the country. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the attacks, U.S. officials are urging American tourists to 
avoid Guatemala and residents to use "utmost caution." 
</P>
<P>
 Graffiti declaring, "Gringo child-stealers, go home" has appeared in wealthy 
neighborhoods of the capital, and Guatemalan mothers have taken to shielding 
their children on the streets when they see a foreigner. 
</P>
<P>
 The collective psychosis has been stoked by inflammatory reports in the local 
press of sightings of long-haired foreigners, driving Jeeps with tinted 
windows, supposedly hunting for children in remote villages. Another rumor that 
made the rounds was that a child had been found with several organs removed and 
a wad of dollars stuffed in his body with a note stating: "Thank you for your 
collaboration." 
</P>
<P>
 Illegal adoptions are not uncommon in Guatemala, but there has never been 
evidence of the theft of body parts.  
</P>
<P>
 Weinstock was secluded in a private clinic in Guatemala City after being 
airlifted from northeastern Guatemala in a U.S. Southern Command helicopter on 
a training exercise in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 She suffered fractures to both arms, serious head injuries and is breathing 
with the aid of an artificial respirator. Doctors said they must wait until she 
regains consciousness before they can assess whether she has suffered permanent 
brain damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack came three weeks after a mob chanting "Kill her" sacked the Santa 
Lucia police station in southern Guatemala, following the arrest of Melissa 
Carol Larson, a tourist from New Mexico who had been accused by local residents 
of stealing a child. 
</P>
<P>
 Townspeople burned down the station and destroyed police vehicles after they 
were led to believe that the police had been bribed into releasing Larson. In 
fact, a police van had taken her to a jail in the municipal capital of 
Escuintla for her safety. She then spent two weeks in prison in Guatemala City 
until her release March 25. No evidence against her was found, nor was she 
formally charged. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of all the things to be accused of, this is the last thing I would have 
imagined," said Larson, 37, an architectural draftswoman who lives in an adobe 
hut in Taos and sells jewelry. "It's as far-fetched as it could ever get." 
</P>
<P>
 Larson said she had arrived in Santa Lucia to visit nearby archeological ruins 
during her vacation. She does not recall talking to children and she cannot 
fathom how her actions might have been misinterpreted. 
</P>
<P>
 In both the Larson and Weinstock incidents, the military took over the towns 
to restore order when local police appeared unable to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 "They drove in in their armored cars like white knights in shining armor," a 
human rights activist said. 
</P>
<P>
 Informed sources said two members of military intelligence had been seen 
inciting the crowd in Santa Lucia, while police suspect that professional 
agitators were involved in the San Cristobal riot. 
</P>
<P>
 The hysteria and instability, human rights activists fear, will provide an 
excuse for security forces to crack down. Hard-line Interior Minister Danilo 
Parrinello has hinted at declaring a state of emergency and using the army to 
enforce order throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "The army wants to appear as the savior for the people, but they are the chief 
accomplices," said Rosalina Tuyuc, an indigenous leader and longtime critic of 
the army. 
</P>
<P>
 Some fear that the xenophobia is also being whipped up to undermine the work 
of international human rights workers, diplomats and journalists, who have 
generally been critical of a military blamed for numerous human rights 
atrocities. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Parrinello, the interior minister, replaced Arnoldo Ortiz Moscoso, a respected 
former president of the Guatemalan college of lawyers, who quit in January 
complaining that the army was blocking his attempts to reduce the influence of 
military intelligence in the civilian police force. 
</P>
<P>
 A member of an extreme right-wing party, Parrinello was an adviser in the 
early 1970s to Mario Antonio Sandoval Alarcon, then president of Congress and 
reputedly the founder of several right-wing death squads. 
</P>
<P>
 Parrinello's appointment followed that of the former head of military 
intelligence, Col. Mario Alfredo Merida, to vice minister. Merida's 
appointment, in place of a civilian, has been viewed with alarm by diplomats 
and human rights workers, who see it as a setback to attempts to reduce the 
pervasive influence of the army.

KEY INVESTOR'S AGENTS SEIZE BIOSPHERE 2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LEE HOTZ and ADAM S. BAUMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 In the red desert north of Tucson, off-duty federal marshals acting on behalf 
of Texas billionaire Edward P. Bass seized the Biosphere 2 project Friday, 
ousting the managers who conceived and constructed the $150-million, 
state-of-the-art surrogate planet. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not an April Fool's joke," Biosphere public affairs director Chris 
Helms said. "It is a management dispute." 
</P>
<P>
 The marshals served a temporary restraining order that Bass, a major investor 
in the sprawling experimental enclosed ecosystem, obtained in U.S. District 
Court for the Northern District of Texas. The order was issued against the 
senior managers of Space Biospheres Ventures, which operates the 3.15-acre 
complex of interconnected geodesic domes, a glass pyramid and gift shops. 
</P>
<P>
 Bass also filed court papers to dissolve the joint venture between the 
Biosphere's managing partner, Decisions Team Inc., and its financial partner, 
Decisions Investment Corp.  
</P>
<P>
 He is asking that all assets, which include the most highly publicized and 
controversial experiment ever conducted in Earth ecology, be placed in 
temporary receivership, according to court papers. 
</P>
<P>
 Bass was not available Friday to discuss the reasons for the court action, but 
he recently indicated that it was time for the project to start turning a 
profit. 
</P>
<P>
 Terrel Lamb, his media relations specialist, said that Bass intends to 
maintain the crew now inside the Biosphere, continue its ecology experiments 
and keep it open as a tourist park. 
</P>
<P>
 In a written statement, Bass said: "I am firmly committed to the ongoing 
progress of Biosphere 2 and to the developing science biospherics. . . . I am 
convinced that Biosphere 2 will continue to build on its previous achievements 
once the management reorganization and financial restructuring are complete." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Biosphere was designed to demonstrate that people sealed within a replica 
of Earth's major habitats could be completely self-sufficient, generating their 
own oxygen, growing their own food and recycling all their waste in a perfect 
microcosm of Earth. The Biosphere contains its own rain forest, desert, 
savannah and ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 But almost from its inception, critics have raised questions about its 
management and the integrity of the research conducted there. The court action 
Friday was the most recent twist in a enterprise that some critics have said 
was more eco-entertainment than ecological science.  
</P>
<P>
 Since the early 1970s, the people behind Biosphere 2 -- John Allen, Margret 
Augustine, Mark Nelson and Bass -- have been building a worldwide network of 
environmentally aware businesses and research centers.  
</P>
<P>
 Their investments include a 300,000-acre cattle and horse ranch based in 
western Australia; a 5,000-acre ranch near Derby, Australia; the Institute of 
Ecotechnics, a private ecological think tank based in London, and the Hotel 
Vajra, an environmentally friendly earthquake-proof hotel in Katmandu, Nepal. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's action caught one founding director in Canada, another in Japan, and 
a third, who recently completed a two-year stint inside the Biosphere, on his 
way to class in Tucson.  
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for Bass said the restraining order was a precaution to keep 
anyone from damaging the project in reaction to the ouster.  
</P>
<P>
 The temporary restraining order served on employees Friday stated: "If the 
energy supplied to Biosphere 2 is cut, its doors are opened, or its computer 
systems are aborted, or other possible actions . . . are taken, much if not all 
of the scientific value of Biosphere 2 will be lost or impaired, and many 
assets of SBV will be destroyed, as well as loss of public goodwill which the 
venture will never recover."  
</P>
<P>
 The senior employees and director reacted angrily and vowed to fight the 
restraining order and regain control of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will fight the temporary restraining order as well as any other attempts 
to wrest control of Biosphere 2," said Augustine, president of Space Biospheres 
Ventures, who is now barred from the project. "This is a case of a billionaire 
who plays at environmental concerns, but is stuck in the '80s era of greed."  
</P>
<P>
 Allen, a second ousted director, said in a statement Friday: "Biosphere 2 
represents not only a financial investment but an unsurpassed investment of the 
world's intellectual capital. I'm not going to stand by and let the life's work 
of hundreds of creative people be stolen by a billionaire's takeover attempt to 
make super profits." 
</P>
<P>
 John B. Corliss, the Biosphere director of research, did not respond to 
requests for comment. Corliss, a respected scientist, left the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration last year to join the project in part to 
bolster its flagging scientific credibility after the project's scientific 
advisory board resigned en masse. 
</P>
<P>
 Helms said Corliss would continue to oversee the Biosphere research efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 The investment by Bass, heir to a legendary Texas oil fortune, was to sustain 
the project through the end of the century, according to Allen.  
</P>
<P>
 But Bass had made it clear that Biosphere must begin covering its operating 
costs -- and start down the path toward becoming a moneymaking venture. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the end of the capital investment era (of the project)," Allen told 
The Times last month. "Our focus switches dramatically to production and 
marketing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Introduced this month was the $300 "Airtron," a device camouflaged to look 
like a houseplant that traps and digests toxic air pollutants. Besides the 
Airtron -- which is being sold through the mail -- other planned spinoffs 
include the Wastetron, a system that uses aquatic plants to recycle human waste 
into a fertilizer. Space Biospheres Ventures, the entity that operates 
Biosphere 2, also expects to market a patented glazing method that allows glass 
to be tightly bonded onto a steel frame, creating a virtually airtight and 
watertight structure. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, 12 U.S. patents on technology and inventions arising from the 
construction and operation of Biosphere 2 have been issued; seven more have 
been applied for. 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial exploitation of environmental technology was just one part of the 
marketing plan that first sold Bass on the project a decade ago.  
</P>
<P>
 It also called for a visitors center, which offers guided tours of the grounds 
for $12.95 per adult (there were 220,000 visitors in 1993), a 27-room hotel, a 
restaurant, a snack bar and parking facilities that include tram service. Plans 
include an environmentally friendly golf course.

QUAKE AID REQUESTS NEAR HALF-MILLION MARK; RELIEF: DESPITE RECORD FIGURES, 
FUNDS WON'T RUN OUT, OFFICIALS SAY. THE MAY 17 DEADLINE MAY BE EXTENDED.

 Requests for government assistance stemming from the Northridge earthquake -- 
already at an all-time high for a U.S. disaster -- are expected to top 500,000 
by Monday, as applications pour in from a wide swath of the region. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Friday, government agencies had received 497,626 requests for 
assistance, and approved more than $1.4 billion in aid to businesses and 
individuals. Earthquake victims have received checks for everything from 
emergency housing to replacing lost dentures. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of requests -- shattering the record of 304,000 from Hurricane Hugo 
-- is larger than the population of some major cities, such as New Orleans and 
Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have as of this point 148,000 applications," said Bernard Kulik, assistant 
administrator for disaster assistance for the U.S. Small Business 
Administration. "That's a lot, almost as many as we had in Hurricane Andrew, 
the Midwest floods, Loma Prieta and Hurricane Hugo -- combined." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say they are in no danger of exhausting a federal allocation of $9.8 
billion in earthquake relief -- even with an expected $2.6 billion in requests 
from local and state governments for their emergency response costs and repairs 
to public facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Records and interviews show the vast scope of the relief effort: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Federal Emergency Management Agency has assisted 237,000 people, 
including 149,000 homeowners who needed repairs to make their dwellings "safe, 
secure and sanitary." The agency also paid rent for 88,000 renters and 
homeowners whose residences were rendered uninhabitable. 
</P>
<P>
 * Of the 148,000 applications received by the Small Business Administration 
for home, personal and business loans, 25,000 have been approved. 
</P>
<P>
 * The state Department of Social Services paid an average of $1,058 to 13,000 
earthquake victims who were unable to draw on any other resource -- public or 
private -- to pay for basic necessities. Funds were provided to allow 
earthquake victims to replace lost appliances, clothing and, in one case, a 
$10,000 electric wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
 * The federal Department of Housing and Urban Development has approved 
approximately 20,000 rent subsidies for low-income quake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Applications came from every corner of Los Angeles County, from Azusa and Long 
Beach, from Palmdale to Pacific Palisades, according to the state emergency 
officials. The vast majority were from Los Angeles, including more than 30,000 
from Northridge, 23,000 from Van Nuys and 20,000 from Canoga Park, 10,000 from 
Santa Monica and 4,200 from Hollywood. In Ventura County, more than 18,000 
applications came from Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The application deadline for most programs is May 17, but officials said it 
could be extended if the demand warrants. The total number of applications 
exceeds 500,000, because some individuals have applied for more than one form 
of aid. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that surprises us the most is that over two months after the 
earthquake, we're still seeing such a large number of people still coming in 
requesting assistance," said Richard Andrews, director of the state Office of 
Emergency Services. 
</P>
<P>
 But Andrews said there are no indications that fraud or other abuses are 
inflating the number of applications. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although the number of applications continues to rise, officials said the 
proportion of new applicants whose damage does not qualify for aid appears to 
be increasing. The main reason is that they suffered insufficient damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "As checks go out to people, they tell their buddies and they say, 'Hey, I'm 
going to call and apply too,' " said Peter Wessell, one of about 500 field 
inspectors working seven days a week to survey damage claimed by applicants.  
</P>
<P>
 He said that one day last week, he failed to find a single applicant who he 
thought qualified for aid. 
</P>
<P>
 About 80% of the applications completed by early this week had been judged 
eligible for some aid, but one official said that percentage could dip as low 
as 70% by the time agencies stop taking new requests. 
</P>
<P>
 Some late applicants have discovered more damage after they began tearing down 
walls or exposing foundations to make repairs. Some were property owners who 
suffered new damage in the strong aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Gonzalez, 41, a San Fernando homeowner, applied for aid last week only 
after a longtime friend who is a FEMA employee said he might be eligible. 
</P>
<P>
 With cracked walls and floor damage in his home, Gonzalez said he tried making 
the repairs himself. But he said last month's magnitude 5.3 aftershock worsened 
the damage and the roof began leaking during the recent rainstorms. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez said he did not apply earlier because he had assumed that most 
federal relief was available only through loans. "I didn't want more debts," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But in fact, he may be eligible for a FEMA cash grant for home repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Gonzalez, Jeannie Russell and Artie Parti of Van Nuys only recently 
applied for aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially they thought the damage to their townhouse was relatively minor 
compared to the buildings that had collapsed in other parts of the San Fernando 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the bills began adding up. One estimate put the cost of filling cracks 
and repainting at $9,500, with other repairs to cost thousands more. Although 
they had insurance, Russell, a chiropractor, and Parti, a children's party 
entertainer, still would be out at least $3,400. "There's a cap on what we can 
get from the insurance so we decided we needed a little bit more help," Parti 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wessell, the FEMA inspector who visited their townhouse, said he found 
that the damage was not enough to qualify them for aid. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's mostly . . . cosmetic cracks throughout and that is all it is, that 
is not a hazard," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason so many applications have been filed is that relief agencies have 
aggressively spread the word about the types of aid available.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're still finding pockets of people" who suffered losses and did not apply, 
for various reasons, said Fausto Recalde, an outreach worker serving central 
and southern Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Yelena Lerner, a Russian-speaking federal relief worker, found that little 
attention had been paid to the city's Russian immigrants, many of them elderly 
and living in the West Hollywood area. So she prepared a Russian-language 
flyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those drawn to FEMA centers by the handwritten flyer was 64-year-old 
Maria Lebedeva, who lost appliances, housewares and a television in the 
earthquake but did not know where to turn. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got (the flyer) from a friend," she said through an interpreter, after 
applying for a cash grant. "Before, we didn't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Some people have been frustrated by the aid process. 
</P>
<P>
 Joan Lampner, a hygienist whose Bel-Air condominium was declared unlivable, 
said she had to make repeated calls and visits to relief agencies trying to get 
a FEMA inspector to her home. "They'd say, 'We'll put a tracer on it,' " she 
said. "I must have had them put a tracer on it every day."  
</P>
<P>
 Nearly two months after applying for aid, and getting a relief supervisor to 
track her file down, Lampner finally met with an inspector at her condo and a 
few days later received her first $3,400 check for property repairs. With 
mortgage payments coming due, she is still waiting for a FEMA temporary housing 
grant.  
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's very caring here," she said last week at a FEMA center. "It's 
just very difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials acknowledge that there have been delays, glitches and some 
bottlenecks, notably problems with the software in a high-tech system of 
hand-held computers used in the field to file inspection reports verifying 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 But Frank Kishton, the federal coordinating officer for the relief effort in 
Los Angeles, said the overall response and distribution of aid has been quicker 
than after other disasters. On average, it has taken FEMA about three weeks to 
process a request and provide a check to an applicant for housing assistance, 
officials said. It has taken the Small Business Administration four to six 
weeks to approve loans to homeowners and businesses, although it can take 
longer to receive a check.  
</P>
<P>
 Officials said they are not finding much fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been only five arrests so far. Four people are accused of 
fraudulently obtaining money by claiming to have lived in the Northridge 
Meadows apartment building, which collapsed, killing 16. One person was 
arrested on charges of submitting a fraudulent SBA application for $1.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Assistant U.S. Atty. Nathan J. Hochman said more arrests and 
prosecutions will come soon. 
</P>
<P>
 People who obtained money improperly can probably avoid trouble by returning 
the checks, Hochman said. "We're trying to encourage people to give the money 
back before we have to go out and get it," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA spokesman Phil Cogan said some fraud occurs in every disaster and that 
the agency tries, through computer checks and inspectors' visits, to pursue 
those who improperly obtained money. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said, "By policy, we are in the business of providing assistance . . . 
not arresting people. If . . . it was an honest mistake, we don't prosecute."

COLUMN ONE; SINGAPORE: WHAT PRICE JUSTICE?; A CONVICTED VANDAL'S FLOGGING 
SENTENCE HAS BEEN LAUDED BY SOME CRIME-WEARY AMERICANS. OTHERS SAY THE NATION'S 
IMPRESSIVE SAFETY RECORD IS NOT WORTH THE LOSS IN CIVIL RIGHTS.

 "Singapore is one of the safest countries in the world," wrote Keith Kimball 
of Vallejo, Calif., in a letter to Secretary of State Warren Christopher. "We 
should have those tough kinds of punishment in America." 
</P>
<P>
 A Singapore court's decision to sentence an American teen-ager to a flogging 
for spray-painting cars has produced a predictable nod of approval from many 
Singaporeans, long accustomed to their government's firm hand. Perhaps more 
surprising is the wave of support that has emerged for its harsh legal system 
from Americans -- reinforcing opinion polls in the United States that show 
worry about crime now equals concern about the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 In Singapore and the United States, newspapers have been inundated by letters 
supporting the sentence handed down last month against Michael Fay, an 
18-year-old student. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans weary of crime increasingly favor stiffer penalties for criminals, 
such as the "three strikes" rule recently adopted to punish repeat offenders in 
California. According to one survey, 68% favor treating juvenile cases as 
severely as those involving adults. 
</P>
<P>
 In elevating Singapore's administration of justice to overnight celebrity, the 
Fay case seems to have prompted many Americans to ponder two fundamental 
questions: Could the tough approach in Singapore, which places order before 
law, serve as a model elsewhere? And what is the cost of its impressive crime 
statistics in terms of individual freedom? 
</P>
<P>
 Fay was sentenced to six strokes of the cane administered by a jailer trained 
in martial arts, four months in prison and a $2,230 fine after pleading guilty 
to two counts of vandalism, two counts of criminal mischief and one count of 
possessing stolen property. His appeal of the caning sentence was thrown out by 
the country's chief justice Thursday, and he was taken into custody. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting in the 1960s, when Singapore gained independence from Britain, the 
government imposed increasingly harsh penalties for a range of crimes, 
culminating in the last five years in laws against such offenses as armed 
robbery and drug trafficking, which carry a mandatory death penalty. Singapore 
has also jettisoned some traditional safeguards, such as jury trials, on 
grounds that guilty criminals were manipulating the system to walk free. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors are invariably impressed by the country's lack of graffiti and 
general feeling of safety. Women confidently stroll the streets late at night, 
the subway is clean, and muggings are rare. Gang warfare, a significant scourge 
in the 1950s, has been stamped out. 
</P>
<P>
 An opinion poll conducted for the government last year found that 82% of 
respondents believe that their country is "safe and secure." 
</P>
<P>
 Statistics comparing the small city-state of Singapore and Los Angeles, with 
its roughly equal population, provide a dramatic contrast. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, 58 murders, 80 rapes, 1,008 robberies and 3,162 car thefts were 
reported in Singapore. Los Angeles Police Department statistics for the same 
period show 1,100 homicides, 1,855 rapes, 39,227 robberies and 65,541 car 
thefts. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Singapore had three robberies that involved guns. It has had no 
kidnapings for the last three years. The crime statistics have barely changed 
in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have two kids, and I don't have to worry about their safety," said Davinder 
Singh, a lawyer and member of Parliament from the ruling People's Action Party. 
"I don't have to worry about them being exposed to drugs or alcohol. For me 
this is very important." 
</P>
<P>
 There are fewer than 3,757 full-time police officers in the country, and they 
are rarely visible on the street despite the nation's reputation as an 
authoritarian society. 
</P>
<P>
 All guns are outlawed, except those belonging to the police and armed forces. 
Gun possession carries a stiff prison term, and those who fire a gun during a 
crime face a mandatory death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Another difference with the United States is the makeup of the society itself: 
77% ethnic Chinese and 14% conservative Muslim Malays living in relative 
isolation on a small island. There is virtually no poverty -- 80% of the people 
own their homes -- and the family remains the backbone of society, with few 
divorces and children living at home until marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 As in many Asian societies, public shame, for the criminal and for his family, 
is a potent deterrent. 
</P>
<P>
 A more telling comparison might be drawn between Singapore and Hong Kong, 
whose residents are also Chinese but which imposes neither the death penalty 
nor caning. With a population nearly double that of Singapore, Hong Kong last 
year recorded 86 homicides, 103 rapes and 22 armed robberies involving 
firearms. Nonviolent crimes such as burglary were much more common than in 
Singapore, however. 
</P>
<P>
 The philosophical underpinnings of Singapore's tough approach were laid out by 
former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, who was trained in the law at Britain's 
prestigious Cambridge University. Lee remarked 30 years ago that "hard 
realities" meant that the phrase "law and order" had to be turned around so 
that order took precedence over the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a state of increasing disorder and defiance of authority cannot be 
checked by the rules then existing," Lee said, "new and sometimes drastic rules 
have to be forged to maintain order: so that the law can continue to govern 
human relations. The alternative is to surrender order to chaos and anarchy." 
</P>
<P>
 When Lee complained that justice was being thwarted on "pure technicalities," 
the government in 1969 abolished the jury system. All defendants now have their 
fate determined by a single judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Singapore imposes the death penalty for 20 offenses. It is mandatory in murder 
convictions, firearms offenses and drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone found in possession of at least half an ounce of heroin or an ounce of 
cocaine is presumed under the law to be a trafficker and faces execution upon 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Ministry of Home Affairs, between 1989 and 1993 the 
government hanged 47 convicts, of whom 22 were drug traffickers; 103 others are 
awaiting execution. 
</P>
<P>
 Singapore has long had a variant of the "three strikes" rule. When a criminal 
with three convictions is found guilty of a new offense, the judge must impose 
"preventive detention" of seven to 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Caning, the term for flogging done with a moistened, four-foot rattan cane, is 
imposed for rape, robbery and extortion, and for such nonviolent crimes as 
vandalism and employing illegal immigrants. People who are caned frequently go 
into shock and lose copious amounts of blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to charges that Fay was singled out because he is American, the 
government said that 14 youthful vandals have been caned in the last five years 
and that foreigners receive equal treatment under the law. But a police 
spokesman revealed that there were 1,416 acts of vandalism reported in 1992 
alone. Only 45 people were punished. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Singapore officials, sentences are intended not just as 
punishment but as a deterrent. A woman with a history of petty crime who was 
convicted in 1993 of shoplifting a $4 box of sanitary pads was sentenced to 
five months in jail and a $2,666 fine. She was so overcome by the severity of 
the sentence that she beat her head to a bloody pulp on the courtroom 
furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 When an 18-year-old man who is "educationally subnormal" repeatedly kissed a 
woman in an elevator, he was charged with molestation. A court sentenced him to 
six months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 When the man's lawyer appealed, Chief Justice Yong Pung How, saying "sentences 
have been too light; they are not having a deterrent effect," increased the 
punishment to include three whacks of the rattan cane. 
</P>
<P>
 According to judicial records, judges increased sentences in 19 of 170 appeals 
filed in the first half of last year. This practice, not permitted in the 
United States, has prompted criminal lawyers here to joke that they threaten 
their clients with an appeal if they do not pay legal fees promptly. 
</P>
<P>
 Khoo Boon Hui, a senior assistant commissioner of Singapore's police 
department, said in an interview that the country's death penalty has been an 
undisputed success in reducing violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed robberies, which he said had proliferated to more than 150 a year in the 
1970s, have been reduced to almost zero since the death penalty was adopted. 
Kidnapings have also been eliminated by the threat of execution, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The death penalty as a deterrent works when (the crime) involves planning," 
Khoo said. "We want a person to not even contemplate a crime like kidnaping." 
</P>
<P>
 But David Marshall, an attorney who was Singapore's first elected chief 
minister under British rule, disagreed. "I see every year an increase in the 
number of death sentences imposed, which suggests that it is not acting as a 
deterrent," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall said there is almost universal approval in Singapore for the way 
justice is administered, even among opponents of the government. Indeed, there 
are few people willing to publicly criticize the government's approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter Woon, a law professor at Singapore's National University, said he 
objects to the imposition of mandatory death sentences -- though not to the 
penalty itself, especially after being mugged by a gunman while visiting Disney 
World in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in favor of giving discretion to judges to tailor sentences to fit the 
crime," Woon said. He also expressed concern that as mandatory death sentences 
were used in an increasing number of crimes, criminals might be more likely to 
kill their victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Questions about the deterrent value of harsh sentences arise most often in 
narcotics. Not only are drug traffickers hanged, but the police can search for 
drugs without a warrant and can compel anyone suspected of drug use to take a 
urine test. If the test is positive, the user is forced to undergo "cold 
turkey" withdrawal and spend three months to three years in a drug 
rehabilitation center. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, there is no place in Singapore where young people can be seen 
loitering on the street waiting to sell drugs, as happens in many U.S. cities. 
But despite such stringent rules, Home Affairs Minister Wong Kan Seng admitted 
in Parliament last month that the number of hard-core addicts had risen from 
2,228 in 1990 to 2,992 in 1993. He said the government is considering imposing 
jail terms and caning to deter drug users. 
</P>
<P>
 One area where Singapore has been remarkably successful is with gangs. 
Singapore is the only Chinese community in the world where underworld societies 
commonly known as triads do not exist. 
</P>
<P>
 Arguing that gangs intimidate witnesses against testifying in open court, 
Singapore wields Draconian detention laws against secret societies. Police can 
detain people suspected of gang or serious drug crimes without trial or formal 
charges. The detention decision must be approved by an independent panel, 
though the accused is not allowed to present a defense. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Home Affairs Ministry, 277 members of secret societies are 
under detention without trial, as well as 409 drug traffickers and 39 people 
accused of other serious crimes. The detentions are for a renewable one-year 
period; one man has spent 13 years and 9 months in detention for gang activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line," said Lim Soo Ping, a deputy secretary in the Home Affairs 
Ministry, "is: Do you want these people on the streets or in the slammer? I 
want them in the slammer." 
</P>
<P>
 As the detention law illustrates, Singapore's attitude toward constitutional 
protection against abuse of state power is different from the West's. 
</P>
<P>
 As former minister Marshall noted in an interview: "There isn't the same 
respect for the individual in Chinese philosophy as there is in the 
Judeo-Christian philosophy of the West." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to abolishing jury trials, courts have ruled that accused people 
have no right to silence when being questioned by police, and a suspect who 
does not testify in his own defense at trial is warned by the judge that he 
will draw "inferences" from the failure to speak. 
</P>
<P>
 The courts have ruled that the right to legal counsel begins only after the 
police complete their investigation, which can take days. The right to counsel 
is also limited to those who can afford a lawyer, as the state does not provide 
lawyers to the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole emphasis has changed," said J.B. Jeyeratnem, a defense lawyer who 
is one of the few critics of the government in Singapore who is willing to be 
quoted by name. "There is a gradual erosion of the great principle that no one 
is to be presumed guilty until he is found guilty." 
</P>
<P>
 A group representing the Assn. of the Bar of the City of New York published a 
study of Singapore's justice system in 1991, saying that despite the trappings 
of the British justice system left from colonial days, "the rule of law in 
Singapore today has given way to empty legalism." 
</P>
<P>
 "In the British tradition, the Singapore government scrupulously applies the 
law on the books," the report said. "But that law no longer restrains 
government actions or protects individual rights." 
</P>
<P>
 Beatrice Frank, a law professor at New York University who was one of the 
authors of the report, said that because of restrictions on the legal 
profession and the judiciary, it is doubtful that an accused person can get a 
fair hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Another controversial aspect of Singapore's justice system is the extent to 
which coercion is used to extract confessions. Trials are relatively rare, with 
most accused people entering a guilty plea in hopes of winning a reduced 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 The government vehemently denies that coercion exists. Fay and two others 
accused in the vandalism case said they were slapped and threatened into making 
confessions, but police officials insisted that an independent investigation 
had found no abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 A civil case now being heard for malicious prosecution alleges that a police 
inspector held three men in prison for three years on a murder charge after one 
defendant was denied food, water and sleep for 24 hours and forced to stand on 
a chair and hold three telephone books at arm's length until he confessed. The 
police later admitted that they were holding the wrong men. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1993 U.S. government report on human rights in Singapore said "there have 
been credible reports of police mistreatment." 
</P>
<P>
 The government said such cases are rare, and errant officers are dealt with 
harshly. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the system to work," Khoo said, "the public must have confidence in the 
police."

THE TIMES POLL; RESIDENTS BALK WHEN ASKED TO PAY FOR '3 STRIKES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Californians overwhelmingly favor locking up more felons for longer terms, but 
many do not want to pay higher taxes or cut popular programs to raise the money 
needed to finance a prison building boom, a Los Angeles Times Poll has found. 
</P>
<P>
 State residents surveyed support the new "three strikes" sentencing law by 
nearly a 3-1 margin. But even with that law, which requires terms of 25 years 
to life in prison for many three-time offenders, more than half of the poll's 
respondents said California's criminal justice statutes remain too lenient. 
</P>
<P>
 One tough proposal that wins great favor: putting first-time rapists in prison 
for life without the possibility of parole. Stricter gun controls also have 
strong support among the public, the poll found. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times survey also produced evidence that the public's fears about crime 
may be influenced more by what they hear from podium-pounding politicians and 
sensational news accounts than by events in their own lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Although half cited crime as one of the state's two most important concerns, 
and a majority said their area has a serious crime problem, three out of four 
said they feel safe in their community. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something that's not driven by personal experience as much as by what 
people perceive is happening to others," said John Brennan, director of the 
Times Poll. "This is a media-generated set of concerns." 
</P>
<P>
 The poll surveyed 1,608 Californians, including 1,211 registered voters, over 
four days ending Tuesday. The margin of sampling error is 3 points in either 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey found that concerns about crime -- whatever may be driving them -- 
are at record highs, Brennan said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last year, the proportion of people who cite crime and gangs as the 
state's top problem has nearly tripled, from 10% in March, 1993, to 27% today. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly half of those surveyed in the most recent poll -- 49% -- said crime was 
one of the state's two most pressing concerns. The same number named the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The worry about crime was reflected in the huge majority that favored the 
"three strikes" sentencing law passed by the Legislature last month and signed 
by Gov. Pete Wilson. A nearly identical measure will appear on the November 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll asked Californians for their opinion about the law as a whole and 
about three of its parts. Respondents also were asked about the measure's 
potential costs and how to pay for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the poll found, the "three strikes" law is favored by 65% of state 
residents and opposed by 21%. Support for the statute is strong in all major 
demographic groups except for blacks. Among ethnic groups, 68% of whites favor 
the measure, 59% of Latinos support it and blacks are divided, with 45% in 
support and 42% opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 The most popular of the three provisions about which the poll inquired was a 
"truth in sentencing" element that will require inmates sentenced under the law 
to serve at least 80% of their terms. Before the law passed, inmates could cut 
their terms in half with credits earned for good behavior and for working in 
prison. By a margin of 85% to 12%, respondents favored curtailing those 
credits. 
</P>
<P>
 Also very popular, by a 73% to 22% margin, is the central element of the law, 
which requires those convicted of any felony after committing two serious or 
violent felonies to be sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Still popular, but slightly less so, is the provision to allow crimes 
committed by juveniles to count as strikes on their record even if the youths 
are tried without a jury in Juvenile Court. That provision is favored by 62% 
and opposed by 33%. 
</P>
<P>
 The overwhelming support for "three strikes" comes even though the public is 
well aware of its potential costs. Nearly three out of four people in the 
survey said they believed a "substantial amount of extra revenue" will be 
needed to build prisons to house the inmates for longer terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Questioned further, however, many supporters of the measure seemed to have 
second thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
 Although 68% said the law would be effective in reducing crime, only half of 
all respondents said the potential benefit was worth the added cost. About four 
in 10 said the money should be spent instead on other forms of crime 
prevention. 
</P>
<P>
 Even a sizable portion of those who said they supported the law -- more than 
one in four -- said the money needed for "three strikes" would be better spent 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There was no consensus on how to pay for the new prisons and the cost of 
operating them. About 25% chose bonds, or borrowing, while 21% chose tax 
increases and 21% cited cuts in social programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked more specifically about taxes, nearly half said they would be willing to 
pay higher levies to finance the sentencing law, but most of these people were 
willing to pay only a modest amount. Only about 9% would be willing to pay $200 
or more in additional annual taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 One program that has been cut deeply in the past few years and might suffer 
some more under the "three strikes" law -- higher education -- won big support 
from the public. More than seven in 10 respondents said they would be unwilling 
to cut higher education to pay for more prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 The public is ambivalent about the need to build more prisons. Although a 
large majority, through its support of the "three strikes" law, endorses the 
idea, fewer want a new prison built near them. Fewer than four in 10 
respondents said they would support a prison in their community; 57% were 
opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll also showed Californians are in no mood to quit tinkering with the 
crime laws simply because the strict new sentencing provisions are on the 
books. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half -- 55% -- said the state's laws are still too lenient. About 
one-third said they were adequate and only 6% said the laws were too tough. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll asked about a proposal to imprison first-time rapists and many child 
molesters for life without possibility of parole. That proposal, which has been 
pitched by Wilson with increasing fervor in recent days, was supported by 62% 
and opposed by 33%. 
</P>
<P>
 Two out of three -- 66% -- said California's gun control laws should be more 
strict, and only 7% said they should be less strict. About one-fourth (23%) 
said the gun laws were about right. 
</P>
<P>
 The political implications of this election-year sentiment for a crackdown on 
crime are not clear. Respondents were split on which major party was better 
suited to handle the crime issue -- 32% for Republicans, 30% for Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a large plurality of the voters polled said Wilson was the best 
qualified among the four major candidates to handle the issue, nearly half said 
his proposals on the issue have had no effect on their view of the governor. 
How the Poll Was Conducted 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll interviewed 1,608 California adults by telephone from March 26 
through Tuesday. Telephone numbers were chosen from a list of all exchanges in 
the state. Random-digit dialing techniques were used so that listed and 
non-listed numbers could be contacted. Interviewing was conducted in English 
and Spanish. Results were weighted slightly to conform with census figures for 
sex, race, age and education. The margin of sampling error for the total sample 
is plus or minus 3 percentage points. For certain other subgroups the error 
margin may vary. Poll results can also be affected by other factors such as 
question wording and the order in which questions are presented. THE TIMES 
POLL: Concern Over Crime Increases 
</P>
<P>
 Crime has surged as an issue with Californians, but most still feel safe in 
their own communities. The new "three strikes" law is popular, though support 
for the budget cuts, tax hikes and new prisons it may bring is limited. 
</P>
<P>

STRONG SURGE OF NEW JOBS REPORTED; ECONOMY: GOVERNMENT FIGURES FOR MARCH LEAP 
TO A SIX-YEAR HIGH AND SHOW MODEST GROWTH IN CALIFORNIA. THE NEWS RAISES FEARS 
OF INFLATION AMONG SOME INVESTORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. economy produced more jobs during March than in any month in more 
than six years, the Labor Department said Friday, but the good news for workers 
heightened inflation fears among investors already shaken by declines in the 
stock and bond markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Even California showed growth, with a modest increase of 5,800 new jobs 
helping to cut the unemployment rate to 8.6%, down from 9%, while Los Angeles 
County's rate fell to 9.4% from 9.7%. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the state's recovery -- despite increased construction spending for 
earthquake repairs -- remains relatively sluggish and tentative, lagging far 
behind the national expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 "We seem to be in a slow upturn," said Ted Gibson, chief economist for the 
state Department of Finance, noting that employment has risen for three 
straight months. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government's monthly survey of business payrolls showed that the 
number of working Americans soared by 456,000 last month, the largest gain 
since 556,000 in October, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 The national unemployment rate remained unchanged from February, at 6.5%, but 
that figure is based on a survey of households that recently was revised and 
still is considered much less reliable than the payroll survey. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Clinton Administration, Friday was a day of carefully measured 
responses, with officials trying to cheer the robust job-creation report while 
assuaging fears of anxious investors and traders. 
</P>
<P>
 "The economy is creating jobs at a good pace, but without the inflationary 
pressure from the labor market that could ultimately compromise future economic 
growth," said Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the President's chief economic adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the unexpectedly big gain in jobs adds to pressure on the Federal 
Reserve Board to boost interest rates further. The Fed has moved recently to 
nudge up rates in order to dampen potential inflation fears; those rate 
increases, in turn, are frightening investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Those fears were reflected in the bond market, open for an abbreviated Good 
Friday session. Prices fell sharply for the key 30-year Treasury bond, with its 
interest rate climbing to 7.26%, the highest level since January, 1993. The New 
York Stock Exchange was closed. 
</P>
<P>
 The sharp decline in bond prices was an overreaction by investors who fear 
that a booming job market will rekindle inflation, said Larry Kimbell, director 
of the UCLA Business Forecasting Project. 
</P>
<P>
 If the extraordinary job gains in March continue for several months, "that 
would be an outrageous boom and that could lead to a surge of inflation," 
Kimbell said. "You can make a case for that, but when I look at everything, it 
just doesn't add up." 
</P>
<P>
 Kimbell said inflation appears to be in check for reasons that include stable 
oil prices and strong national productivity figures. In addition, he noted that 
many long-discouraged unemployed workers are beginning to return to the job 
market, adding to competition for jobs and holding down pressure for higher 
wages. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, a separate report Friday noted that average hourly earnings rose only 
0.1% in March, and a scant 2.4% over the past 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Since last summer, the economy has been adding about 200,000 jobs a month. 
"March puts us back on track to where we would have been had we not lost so 
much ground in the bad weather during January," Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich 
said at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 The recovery is being paced by consumer spending, which represents two-thirds 
of the nation's economic activity. It rose 1% in February, following a revised 
0.1% advance in January, for the 11th straight monthly increase, the Commerce 
Department said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Spending was helped by an advance in personal income, which rose 1.3% in 
February, the department said. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Friday's economic news demonstrates that there is "a healthy, vibrant 
recovery, but it's probably not growing as rapidly as the figures at first 
blush suggest," said Robert D. Barr, deputy chief economist with the U.S. 
Chamber of Commerce.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's important to note, since the stock and bond markets, as well as the 
Federal Reserve, have been concerned over the past two months that too strong a 
recovery would push up the inflation rate later this year." 
</P>
<P>
 But the arguments of Barr, Kimbell and their fellow economists may have little 
effect on the fears that often accompany a slipping stock market. 
</P>
<P>
 The fear among various government officials, as well as some private 
economists, is that the decline in financial markets, fueled by speculation and 
worry, has a momentum all its own. 
</P>
<P>
 The securities markets "are not considering what's really happened over the 
last three quarters," said Audrey Freedman, a labor economist in New York. "If 
you don't have good judgment, there are overreactions," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the national labor market, there were more than 130 million people working 
last month, and 8.5 million without jobs, according to the federal household 
survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturing jobs rose again in March, increasing for the sixth straight 
month, and construction employment advanced as the weather improved. There were 
also job gains in such service industries as health care, restaurants and 
hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 California had 14.2 million working residents and 1.3 million unemployed.  
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson called the report "encouraging news," saying California "is 
coming back, and these numbers are an added boost to confidence as we continue 
our recovery," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 But while the survey of employer payrolls shows California gaining 29,000 jobs 
since December, that increase is dwarfed by the employment losses suffered in 
the state during the recession. Estimates put those jobs losses in the range of 
600,000 to 800,000, but the state economy began to pick up this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, "we had narrowed our big problems to two areas, defense-aerospace 
and construction, and now construction seems to be on an upswing," Gibson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the earthquake rebuilding, which is helping, and, additionally, there 
is a pickup in home-building activity." 
</P>
<P>
 But he said he is worried about rising interest rates. "Housing is key now, 
we're not going to get any help from aerospace. I don't want to see 
home-building cut off at the knees by the rise in interest rates." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County's 9.4% jobless rate reflected 413,000 people out of work, 
with 3.97 million employed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to jump for joy, but the numbers seem quite positive," said Jay 
D. Horowitz, labor market analyst for the California Employment Development 
Department, noting that employment in the county has risen by 70,000 in the 
first quarter of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 11 big states whose jobless figures were reported Friday, 
California's rate remained the highest. Next came New York, at 8.1%. The lowest 
rate was posted by North Carolina, at 4.4%, followed by both Ohio and 
Massachusetts at 5.9%.

WHERE FIELDS OF DREAMS ARE NIGHTMARES; MIDWEST: FLOODS LEFT FARMLAND BURIED IN 
SAND. REMOVING IT IS GIANT TASK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDY PASTERNAK, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Last summer's epic floods may have seemed like a Midwestern replay of the tale 
of Noah's Ark. But this spring, farmers along the Missouri River's banks feel 
as though they're wandering the desert. 
</P>
<P>
 In what was once a cornfield, then a lake, Maurice Glosemeyer now trudges, 
sinking with each step, across dunes piled as high as eight feet tall. His 
tracks fade quickly as a cold west wind scatters the sand. Grit crunches 
between his teeth and stings his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Ninety of the 123 acres in this field are covered with former Missouri 
riverbed, courtesy of the Pinckney Bottom levee break in July and a second 
flood in October. Both times, when the waters receded, the sand stayed behind, 
sealing off the fertile loam beneath. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene is repeated again and again throughout the Flood Belt, from Orrick, 
Mo., near Kansas City, to Columbia, Ill., southeast of St. Louis. "It's another 
disaster, for sure," said Steve Young, a biologist working for the U.S. Soil 
Conservation Service in Missouri, the most damaged state. 
</P>
<P>
 The river that snakes across its namesake state flowed faster and more 
furiously than the Mississippi during the prodigious rains; its steep bottom 
was more thoroughly scoured. Now 60% of its flood plain -- some 373,500 acres 
-- lies swathed in sand. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Pockets of Illinois and Iowa also resemble the Mojave, with sycamores and 
cottonwoods rather than cacti dotting the distant oases. But far less territory 
has been destroyed there. Four Illinois counties so far have reported 12,000 
sandy acres. Iowa has yet to tally its deposits, scattered mostly along the Des 
Moines, Skunk and Raccoon rivers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what they will do in Missouri, because we're having a devil of a 
time just with ours," said Lisa Manning, a federal program specialist based in 
Springfield, Ill., with the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Near Peers, about 60 miles west of St. Louis, Glosemeyer has spent the last 
two weeks trying to level out his land. He drives the bulldozer. His wife, 
Jayne, operates a tractor, for the first time in 24 years of marriage to a 
farmer, pulling an earth scoop behind. She's gotten it stuck more than once. 
</P>
<P>
 They hope that eventually they can spread the sand out enough to mix it into 
the soil. 
</P>
<P>
 They aren't sure, though, whether the field will ever come back. "I'm going to 
try and plant in beans here," said Glosemeyer, a third-generation grower. 
"They'll sprout. But I'm afraid that when they're just a few inches tall, the 
wind'll blow and they'll just shear right off." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To the east, Merlin Kopmann waves from a tractor, where he is duplicating the 
Glosemeyers' efforts on his own sandy stretch. To the west, another neighbor 
farms 156 acres. Every square inch of it is covered with sand. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the same all up and down the river," Glosemeyer said. Having latched 
onto a part-time federal job measuring the destruction in his county, he should 
know. The largest dune he's found so far rises 12 feet high. 
</P>
<P>
 Hauling the sand away is not an option. Even with federal soil rehabilitation 
subsidies, it's less expensive to go out and buy a new farm. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, "there's no place to take it," Manning said. The U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers used some sand for levee repair, but not nearly enough to make a dent 
in the supply. "Landfills don't want it. Concrete plants can only use so much, 
and there's so much wood and debris in the sand, they don't want to pick it 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 Time is a factor, too. Back in 1986, a flood dumped sand all over Leroy 
Preussner's farm nearby, though the quantities were nothing like this year. 
Preussner found an asphalt company willing to haul it away, and even pay 25 
cents a ton for the stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight years later, the trucks are still coming to Preussner's. The job is 
still not done. 
</P>
<P>
 Sand will hold neither water nor nutrients long enough to fuel crops' growth. 
So even mixing it into the underlying soil could be problematic. 
</P>
<P>
 That tactic is expensive as well. Brent Cook, a Columbia, Mo., livestock 
farmer decided in the floods' wake to start a deep-plowing business with his 
brother and father. He is charging his first client $150 an acre. But he 
expects his price to go up to $200 as he gains experience. (Farmland costs 
about $1,200 an acre in these parts.) 
</P>
<P>
 Most plowing penetrates just a few inches of dirt. Cook has been able to turn 
over as much as 40 inches of soil with a cylindrical 52-inch disc. "It's a 
monumental task," he said. "It's something that you learn as you go." 
</P>
<P>
 From 7 a.m. to 8 p.m., he braves the spring windstorms that send the sand 
swirling, biting into his skin and sometimes reducing visibility to fewer than 
50 yards. Because flood moisture is still trapped under the sand, he 
occasionally dips into a patch of what the locals call "blue muck." Then he has 
to stop to extricate his equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The sand's abrasiveness, he estimates, will cut the life of his $30,000 disc 
in half. After 400 acres, he figures, he'll have to replace it. He got a 
special tractor with extra-tough tires. Regular ones, he said, would just get 
eaten up. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the obstacles, federal soil scientist Kenneth Vogt said, it might be a 
better idea to plant cottonwood and plan to harvest pulp in a decade or so, or 
perhaps think about installing a constant irrigation system. 
</P>
<P>
 But Vogt's No. 1 recommendation, especially if the sand is more than six 
inches deep: "Abandon it." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the government's program to buy out some flood plains farmers won't 
accept these fields. The purchased tracts must be set aside as wetlands, and as 
Glosemeyer says, "Sand don't qualify because it ain't wet." 
</P>
<P>
 Owning wasteland is not an easy notion to accept. Glosemeyer, a bearded 
45-year-old with a prominent nose and two missing bottom teeth, has already 
built a life once. 
</P>
<P>
 He is proud of his progress over the years. As a newlywed, he lived in a faded 
green trailer near the family hog pen. A quarter of a mile down the road is his 
current quarters, the neat brick house he built for himself, his wife and his 
children, ages 8 to 21. The family's home place, as he calls it, has grown from 
a 60-acre farm to a 350-acre spread, along with another 300 acres that he 
rents. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We were debt-free once, for a month, about three years ago," he said, 
laughing, behind the wheel of a truck. "Then we bought more land." 
</P>
<P>
 With the sandy fields likely out of production, with the new tractor, scoop 
and dozer leased, the whole farm operation will technically break even this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 That means no income for the family, with two kids in college and another 
getting ready to start. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm personally worried about making it," said Jayne Glosemeyer quietly, 
huddling by the tractor. The wind whipped through her blonde-gray curls and she 
crossed her arms across her chest. "When you first started out, you didn't have 
to worry about your children, whether you'll leave them with debt or with 
something they can start out with." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after the Missouri pushed a hole through the levee about two miles away 
from their farm, the Glosemeyers knew they had a lot more than a flood on their 
hands. Surveying their property by boat, they kept dipping oars into the water 
only to bring up a paddle full of sand. 
</P>
<P>
 The autumn flood left another deposit, raising the dunes. 
</P>
<P>
 When the river returned to its banks, that first walk they took together over 
the sand was a quiet one. There was not much to say. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Jayne figured they ought to at least get some fun out of their 
strange land. She brought a bunch of the kids over. Her 19-year-old and a 
friend played around with a couple of all-terrain vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Jayne and the others had buckets and shovels and proceeded to attempt to build 
a castle. "We'd never been to the beach before," she said, "so we weren't sure 
what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Even now, she takes an odd sort of pleasure in the exotic landscape. Bits of 
glass glisten, the tops of rotted corn stalks peek out in straight lines -- 
they would have been plowed under months ago in other circumstances. Air 
currents dust the surface, arranging the fine grains into long undulating 
ripples. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's beautiful," she said. "It just doesn't belong here."

AS WILD SALMON FADE, NORTHWEST LOSING A SYMBOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With a growing sense of shame, if not surrender, the Pacific Northwest is 
watching its wild salmon dwindle into extinction. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the federal government will impose the strictest fishing limits in 
history, and it may go so far as to ban a salmon harvest in the ocean north of 
Ft. Bragg, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 But no one expects even extreme steps like this to bring the salmon back. That 
would require the Northwest to change the way it lives, or to have change 
imposed upon it. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise the wild salmon, the red-fleshed symbol of bountiful life in the 
Northwest, are likely to disappear except for "museum" or "cameo" runs in 
isolated areas, experts predict. And this could happen in just a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are at the brink, and we're looking down into the abyss," said Geoff 
Pampush, executive director of Oregon Trout, an environmental and sporting 
organization that is among those sounding the alarm. 
</P>
<P>
 The decline of the wild salmon can be told as a dense story of modern 
hydroelectric economics, overlapping governmental jurisdictions and foundations 
of growth and commerce 150 years in the making. Or it can be expressed in stark 
simplicity: too many people with too little regard for what seemed, and may 
still seem to some, to be a resource without end. 
</P>
<P>
 In historic terms, scientists guess that 100 million salmon a year once 
emerged from the rivers along the coasts of California, Oregon and Washington. 
Today, these fish are extinct in Southern California, and the remainder of the 
region produces perhaps 15 million a year -- most of them from hatcheries. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Looked at another way, 107 separate stocks of salmon have already become 
extinct in the Pacific states, and 89 others are "at high risk of extinction," 
according to Seattle-based Save Our Wild Salmon, a coalition representing 
environmental and fishing groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks, or runs, of salmon are those of a single species that emerge from the 
same freshwater spawning grounds, travel to the ocean together and return to 
spawn again at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 That means there can be hundreds of separate stocks, which the government 
typically regards as genetically distinctive creatures under the Endangered 
Species Act, even though there are only five actual species of salmon in the 
Pacific: chinook, sockeye, coho, pink and chum. Closely related and also 
suffering in the region are anadromous steelhead and sea-run cutthroat trout. 
</P>
<P>
 The decline of the Northwest salmon was decades in the making. By 1990, it had 
become a crisis the public could not ignore. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, the first stock was listed on the endangered species list: a 
winter run of chinook on the Sacramento River. Then came runs of chinook and 
sockeye from the Columbia-Snake river systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the plight of the fish has worsened. 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial and sport fishing seasons have been reduced along much of the 
coast, leaving fishing communities in the same economic distress as the logging 
towns of the region. 
</P>
<P>
 And the federal Pacific Fishery Management Council will meet Tuesday in 
Burlingame, Calif., to contemplate the ultimate step: A complete ban on ocean 
salmon fishing for 1994 in Washington, Oregon and Northern California to 35 
miles south of Ft. Bragg. At the very least, the council has signaled that it 
will allow less salmon fishing than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials typically follow the council's lead when it comes to fishing 
in state waters and rivers. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, government regulators acknowledged in this month's Fishery Council 
newsletter: "These strict harvest reductions may stop the decline . . . but 
they will do little to restore abundant stocks." 
</P>
<P>
 The fishing restrictions result chiefly from a precipitous decline in coho 
stocks from coastal streams. These coho numbered up to 400,000 in 1990, but 
only 74,000 now. The National Marine Fisheries Service will decide this summer 
whether to add some or all of these stocks to the endangered species list. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is that Sacramento River autumn-run chinook are robust enough to 
sustain fishing below Ft. Bragg for 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 To the north, the causes of the salmon decline are as simple to describe as 
they seem almost imponderably difficult to fix: 
</P>
<P>
 * Degradation of spawning streams that lace through the Northwest from the 
coast to 1,000 miles inland. Roads, development, agriculture, logging all share 
the blame. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dams and water diversions, particularly on the mighty Columbia River system, 
which today resembles less a river than a series of connected bathtubs. 
</P>
<P>
 * The worst possible combination of natural phenomenon: eight years of 
below-normal rainfall and sustained El Nino ocean conditions, which seem to 
reduce the availability of food for migrating salmon. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A favorable turn of nature could prevent a complete collapse of the coastal 
coho population for now. But virtually every credible source acknowledges that 
without a significant change in the way of life here, the Northwest will 
forfeit its bounty of wild salmon. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question is: Are we willing to adapt to the demands of biology?" said Tim 
Stearns, coordinator for Save Our Wild Salmon. "From the day white settlers 
first came, they have adapted the Northwest to their needs. Now, are we willing 
to adapt to the needs of the Northwest?" 
</P>
<P>
 The listing of salmon as threatened and endangered finally forced Northwest 
residents to acknowledge the problem. Years of political and social struggle 
over forests and northern spotted owls has left this region keenly aware of 
what happens when old ways of resource management come into conflict with 
modern preservation laws. 
</P>
<P>
 But the magnitude of change necessary to revitalize the salmon is so 
staggering as to test not just the region, but the nation. Even the optimists 
have their doubts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of these stocks we can save, and some are doubtful," said Ted Bottiger, 
chairman of the multi-state Northwest Power Planning Council. The government 
agency was created to watch over the complicated hydroelectric power system of 
the Northwest, and it is the first to bring forth a plan to rebuild salmon 
stocks on the Columbia River. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, more water is being allocated in the system for salmon, meaning a 
reduction in peak-time power generation and an overall hike in hydroelectric 
rates. Electricity is cheaper here than anywhere else in America, but even 
modest increases upset the regional economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Aluminum producers colonized the area because of its abundant, dirt-cheap 
electricity. Now the industry has begun layoffs and blames the rising rates -- 
and by implication, the salmon. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tens of thousands of other Northwest residents are being asked to change as 
well: farmers to change the way they irrigate, loggers to change the way they 
cut watersheds and silt streams, cities to change the way they zone for 
subdivisions and growth. And scientists can identify hundreds of millions of 
dollars in needed repairs to the natural landscape -- for instance, the 
relocation of road culverts that now block 30,000 miles of river tributaries. 
</P>
<P>
 As it is, the regional Bonneville Power Administration says it spends more 
than $200 million a year on hatcheries and other projects to try to keep the 
salmon going against the mighty concrete impoundments of the Columbia, the most 
heavily dammed major river in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Not just dams but the torpid waters behind them work against these migratory 
fish. How can the young swim downstream if there is no stream? If they do not 
reach salt water when their body clocks change them into ocean fish, they die. 
Today, tens of thousands of smolt are loaded into tanks and barged down the 
river. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists and fishing enthusiasts say the process is absurd and 
unsatisfactory. More water must be released on the schedule of the salmon, not 
according to electricity demands, they argue. Some go further and insist that 
the only way to save Columbia River salmon is to pull down some of the great 
dams. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Irrigators, shipping lines, the aluminum industry and other river users 
recently signaled that they were tired of being on the defensive. They struck 
back with an argument that may prove to be the weakest link in the 
preservationists' cause: There is no shortage of salmon for the dinner table. 
Even as the wild fish decline, farmed salmon from Norway, Chile and the United 
States keep markets around the world plentifully stocked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only in the Pacific Northwest can you buy an endangered species for $2 per 
pound," said a recent newspaper ad from the Columbia River Alliance, a group of 
river users based in Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
 The alliance is lobbying for an end to large-scale net fishing in the river. 
For their part, these netters have joined with environmentalists in blaming the 
dams and river users for the decline of the salmon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pessimistic," said fish scientist and consultant Jim Lichatowich of 
Sequim, Wash. "Some people are still in denial and understandably worried about 
the short-term consequences this is having on them. I don't see the long-term 
focus needed for salmon recovery." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps that will come later this summer. The National Marine Fisheries 
Service is expected to finalize its recovery plan for Columbia River salmon. 
Federal regulators have broad powers to protect endangered species, but there 
is only scant hope here that the government will offer enough to satisfy the 
environmentalists without asking too much of the river industries. 
</P>
<P>
 From the Northwest's experience with owls and forests, such a recovery plan is 
more likely to send all sides rushing to the federal courts, Congress and the 
Clinton Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Monday in Portland, U.S. District Judge Malcolm Marsh ruled that 1993 
federal approval of hydroelectric operations on the river failed to adequately 
protect salmon under the Endangered Species Act. 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from the court action, the Administration last month proposed a stopgap 
reduction of logging, grazing and development within 300 feet of salmon streams 
on all federal lands in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, the Administration said its goal was "to reverse the 
degradation of anadromous fish habitat on Forest Service and (other federally) 
administered lands in order to avoid the need for more listings under the 
Endangered Species Act." 
</P>
<P>
 And another battleground is likely to erupt. Native Americans along the river 
have treaty rights that they believe entitle them to a harvestable abundance of 
salmon. In the past, federal courts have shown a willingness to hold the 
government accountable for these native rights no matter the high cost to 
non-native immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "One lesson whites learned from the natives when we came here -- salmon are 
the Northwest," said Sierra Club Regional Director Bill Arthur. "No other 
animal weaves our culture, our economy and our environment like the salmon."

 THE WAITING GAME: Ten weeks after the quake, many small-business owners still 
don't know when they'll get help from the feds. The SBA has approved more than 
$600 million in low-interest loans, mostly for homeowners, but barely $2 
million has reached small-business owners (D1). . . . "We're still waiting," 
said Burbank real estate broker Don Ivone."Still waiting."

 UP WITH THE DAWN: The Valley has a rich history of Easter sunrise services, 
and there will be plenty of scenic sites to choose from (B11). . . . In 
Westlake Village, the Rev. Robert Bos, who will take part in his last Easter 
service before retiring, recalls that "in the first few years we would see deer 
and long-eared rabbits near the hill."

 LITTLE AMELIA: She's only 14, but already Tammy Dodd (above) has flown 
helicopters, gliders, balloons and aerobatic planes. Now you can add fighter 
jet to her resume (B2). . . . Tammy, accompanied by an ex-Vietnam fighter 
pilot, took off from Van Nuys Airport on Friday. . . . "I loved it," Tammy

 UNITED MATADORS: It threatened to tear apart the CSUN volleyball team. 
Instead, the showdown for a starting job between longtime pals Gary Reznick and 
Chris McGee has done just the opposite. Reznick won, and has played very well. 
McGee leads the cheers from the bench. . . . CSUN, which played UC San Diego 
Friday night, could make it back to the Final Four (C12).

 THE BARE FACTS: A Los Angeles group won permission from the state this week to 
collect signatures for a 1996 ballot measure allowing increased nudity by both 
sexes on public beaches and parks. "Wow, that's marvelous," said Ed Lange, 
executive director of Elysium Fields, a Topanga Canyon nudist resort that's 
been around since the late '60s. "We're 20 years behind Europe."

ASIA; 'FRESH IMAGE' OF JAPAN PREMIER WILTS AMID PROBE, PROBLEMS; ONCE THE 
SYMBOL OF REFORM, HOSOKAWA NOW RAISES EYEBROWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERESA WATANABE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once again, the Japanese prime minister stood in Parliament this week, facing 
relentless grilling from his political opposition over suspect loans and 
questionable stock deals. 
</P>
<P>
 What's wrong with this picture? 
</P>
<P>
 The target was not a leader of the Liberal Democratic Party, whose 
scandal-sullied past helped push it out of power last summer for the first time 
in 38 years. It was Morihiro Hosokawa, political aristocrat and founder of the 
Japan New Party, who sailed into office last August brimming with confidence, 
idealism and a fresh, clean image. 
</P>
<P>
 The politician who came to symbolize political reform was himself being 
grilled now over whether he lied about a deal involving 300 shares of Nippon 
Telegraph & Telephone Co. stock purchased in 1986 and about a loan from the 
Sagawa Kyubin Co., a scandal-tainted trucking firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public supported him as the standard-bearer of change and political 
reform," said Kojiro Shiraishi, an editorial writer specializing in politics 
for the Yomiuri newspaper. "But if he's just the same as the LDP, why did 
people support him? It's a matter of ethics, morality and credibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa claims that his father-in-law bought the stock, and that he himself 
had fully repaid the Sagawa loan in 1982. But his opponents -- and the business 
consultant involved -- charge that Hosokawa personally made the deal for 
himself. Opponents also say the Sagawa loan was actually an illegal political 
contribution. 
</P>
<P>
 Once hailed for his suave manner and brilliant public relations, Hosokawa lost 
his cool under the hostile questioning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Supposing it was my deal. What's wrong with that?" he retorted. His defiant 
answer threw the parliamentary committee into an uproar, halting proceedings 
for the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, other problems are piling up, from troubled U.S.-Japanese relations 
to completing the 1994 fiscal year budget to implementing an effective economic 
stimulus policy. Hosokawa's other initiatives, such as cutting red tape and 
shifting power back to the local governments, are going nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Serious cracks are rending Hosokawa's eight-party coalition, and 
decision-making is said to be in chaos. 
</P>
<P>
 His public support ratings are steadily declining -- from 69.6% last August to 
47.6% in a survey published Tuesday by the Nihon Keizai newspaper. The Yomiuri 
newspaper found a drop from 72.4% in January to 55.1% last week.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite Hosokawa's dynamic start, some people already are beginning to write 
his political obituary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hosokawa's fresh image was the biggest reason for his high public approval 
ratings, but they are being significantly affected by this personal scandal and 
the people's disappointment is spreading rapidly," said Minoru Morita, a 
political analyst. "It will be impossible for him to recover." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Hosokawa's decline signals a public willingness to bring back the 
Liberal Democrats. According to the Nihon Keizai poll, 42% of people surveyed 
would still vote for coalition candidates in an election held today -- compared 
to 22% for the LDP.  
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa himself seems to have become a man simply marking time. These days, 
he reportedly eats alone and holes up in his office. 
</P>
<P>
 "His body is stiff and his face is pale," the Nihon Keizai reported. 
"Bureaucrats who visit his office are surprised by the apathetic expression on 
his face."

CLINTON THREAT SUSPECT KILLS MOTHER, COMMITS SUICIDE

<P>
 A man suspected of writing a threatening letter to President Clinton killed 
his mother and himself Friday after wounding two deputies who were 
investigating the case, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Mower, 36, killed his 70-year-old mother, Rose, then himself inside a 
motel room where the two lived, Montgomery County Sheriff Gary Haines said. 
</P>
<P>
 The deputies, who were acting on behalf of the Secret Service, were being 
treated in a hospital emergency room where they were listed in good condition, 
said Dick Rathmell, special agent in charge of the Secret Service's Cincinnati 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 The two were shot as they tried to talk to Mower about the letter. 
</P>

 White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said: "We don't talk about specific

U.S. RELEASES NEW PAPERS ON KENNEDY ASSASSINATION; RECORDS: DOCUMENTS AT 
NATIONAL ARCHIVES OFFER INTERESTING GLIMPSES OF OSWALD, FBI. INFORMATION 
DOESN'T CHALLENGE LONE-GUNMAN CONCLUSION. 
</P>

<P>
 It's too soon to say for sure, but conspiracy fatigue may be setting in. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Archives prepared for Friday's release of a raft of new 
government documents relating to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy 
by assembling enough research guides and security officers to handle a 
full-scale rush on the stacks. But as the day wore on, the archivists often 
outnumbered the reporters and researchers who turned up to sift through the 
records. 
</P>
<P>
 Awaiting them were 80 cardboard boxes of declassified FBI records on Lee 
Harvey Oswald, along with four boxes of desk diaries and telephone records from 
Robert F. Kennedy's tenure as attorney general and five boxes of records from 
the mid-1970s Senate Select Committee that studied the intelligence community 
and its possible links to President Kennedy's assassination. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers won't assimilate all the material for months or years, if ever. 
National Archives officials who have paged through the documents say there is 
no stunning new fact that challenges the conclusion that Oswald, acting alone, 
shot the President on Nov. 22, 1963. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there also appears to be nothing in the papers to dissuade those 
who believe Oswald had help, or was the tool of Cubans, the CIA, the Mafia, or 
some combination of the three. 
</P>
<P>
 But the ocean of memos, documents and Teletypes offer tantalizing glimpses of 
the personality and behavior of Oswald, the FBI at work, the concerns of top 
government officials in the days after the assassination, and the endless 
collection of loose ends that have entangled conspiracy theorists ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Two memos, for instance, underscore the speed with which the FBI and the 
Justice Department appeared to have concluded that Oswald acted alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one day after the assassination, then-FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, in 
his first memo on the case to President Lyndon B. Johnson, appears to have 
foreclosed the possibility that others assisted Oswald. 
</P>
<P>
 In the five-page memo summarizing Oswald's background and the evidence against 
him, Hoover uses only singular -- never plural -- terms to describe the 
"assailant" and "the person responsible for this assassination." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Nov. 25, 1963, the day after Oswald was killed, Deputy Atty. Gen. Nicholas 
Katzenbach wrote Bill Moyers, then a top aide to Johnson, urging that the FBI 
make public "a complete and thorough report" on Oswald as soon as possible to 
discourage the emergence of conspiracy theories. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public must be satisfied that Oswald was the assassin; that he did not 
have confederates who are still at large; and that the evidence was such that 
he would have been convicted at trial," Katzenbach wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "Speculation about Oswald's motivation ought to be cut off, and we 
should have some basis for rebutting thought that this was a Communist 
conspiracy or (as the Iron Curtain press is saying) a right-wing conspiracy to 
blame it on the Communists." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, in December, 1963, the FBI turned over to the Justice Department a 
report, which was leaked to the press, that concluded Oswald acted alone. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as the documents released Friday illustrate, conspiracy theories about 
the murder proliferated anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 In one instance, FBI agents days after the murder responded to a memo sent to 
the bureau by a United States Information Agency official who attempted to 
implicate China. The agents assigned to review the submitted evidence concluded 
that the "document contains nothing but speculation. . . . It appears he was 
interested in getting his theory down on paper as quickly as possible and was 
attempting to attract some attention to himself." 
</P>
<P>
 More serious questions were raised by Petr. S. Derjabin, described in a Nov. 
26, 1963, memo as "an admitted former Soviet intelligence officer." Derjabin 
told the FBI he "does not believe the Soviet government had any knowledge of 
Oswald's plans to assassinate President Kennedy; however he does believe that 
Oswald and his wife had some connection with the Russian intelligence service." 
</P>
<P>
 Derjabin, the report continued, "feels that Oswald's departure from the Soviet 
Union was planned by the intelligence service." 
</P>
<P>
 Even members of the Communist Party of the United States had their own 
theories. According to an unnamed FBI informant, top party officials, at a 
meeting days after the assassination, indicated that they believed "someone 
else did the shooting but all the evidence was stacked against Oswald to point 
to him as the guilty person." 
</P>
<P>
 The portrait of Oswald that emerges from the papers is at once desolate and 
poignant. One of the most compelling documents is a psychiatric report ordered 
on Oswald by a New York City family court judge in 1953 after Oswald was 
brought in for excessive truancy. The psychiatrist describes Oswald, then 13, 
as "seriously detached, withdrawn . . . laconic and taciturn." 
</P>
<P>
 The report continues: "There is a rather pleasant, appealing quality about 
(this) emotionally starved, affectionless youngster. Grows as one speaks to 
him, and it seems fairly clear that he detached himself from the world around 
him because no (one) in it ever met any of his needs and love." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But, the psychiatrist added, Oswald "acknowledged fantasies about being 
powerful and sometimes hurting or killing people but refused to talk about the 
dreams, other than to admit that they sometimes contained violence." 
</P>
<P>
 Another memo suggests that Oswald had changed little along the tangled course 
that led him to the assassination in Dallas. A few days after the murder, a 
woman who described herself as a childhood acquaintance of Oswald recounted to 
the FBI a conversation she had with him and his Russian wife, Marina, in New 
Orleans in July, 1963.  
</P>
<P>
 The woman asked Oswald's wife how she liked the United States. "Me like 
America," Marina Oswald responded, according to the memo. "Lee no like Russia. 
Lee no like America. Lee like moon."

LEADING CHINESE DISSIDENT WEI JINGSHENG AGAIN DETAINED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 China's leading dissident was detained by police Friday as he returned to 
Beijing from nearly a month traveling in the northeast, his secretary said. 
</P>
<P>
 The detention of Wei Jingsheng may complicate efforts by the United States and 
China to prevent relations from deteriorating further over human rights 
differences. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration is threatening to revoke China's low-tariff trading 
privileges in June unless Beijing improves its human rights record. Former 
Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance met with China's foreign minister Tuesday, 
but Vance refused to say afterward whether he carried any new messages from the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
 In a mildly worded statement, the United States said Friday that it regretted 
the renewed detention of Wei. 
</P>
<P>
 "If true, we regret that the Chinese government has taken this further step to 
harass Wei and urge that he be released," a State Department spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 A caravan of at least seven police cars carrying about 20 officers stopped 
Wei's car as it neared Beijing on the highway from the nearby port city of 
Tianjin, according to Wei's secretary, Tong Yi. 
</P>
<P>
 Police showed the dissident a "detention and interrogation warrant," placed 
him in a police car and drove toward Beijing, according to Tong, who said she 
was with Wei at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she did not read the summons and did not know why he was taken away. 
</P>
<P>
 Wei was released from prison on parole last September after serving all but 
six months of his 15-year sentence for his activism. He has continued his 
campaign to promote democracy and human rights in Communist China.

ARMY SERGEANT WHO DECAPITATED WIFE'S LOVER FOUND GUILTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A U.S. Army sergeant who decapitated his wife's lover and brought the head to 
her hospital bedside was found guilty of premeditated murder by a military 
court Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 A jury of four officers and three non-commissioned officers deliberated less 
than two hours before reaching the guilty verdict on Sgt. Stephen Schap, 26, of 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 Schap, who faces a mandatory life sentence under U.S. military justice, sat 
ramrod straight and showed little emotion as the court martial's verdict was 
read. 
</P>
<P>
 In early December, Schap figured out that his wife, Diane, was pregnant by his 
best friend, Spec. Gregory Glover, 21, of Phoenix. He found Glover, and stabbed 
and beheaded him with an eight-inch military knife. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses testified that he kicked the head several times to sever it 
completely from Glover's body, then picked it up and said: "This is what you 
get for adultery." 
</P>
<P>
 Schap then carried the bloodied head in a sports bag emblazoned with the logo 
"Head" to a hospital where his 26-year-old wife was undergoing emergency 
gynecological treatment, prosecutors told the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Diane Schap, who confirmed that she is pregnant by Glover, said in halting 
testimony earlier this week that her husband entered her hospital room, set the 
head on a bedside table and said, "Look Diane, Glover's here. He'll sleep with 
you every night, only you won't sleep at night." 
</P>
<P>
 From the outset of the trial, Schap had admitted the killing, but he denied 
that he had planned the attack and pleaded not guilty to premeditated murder. 
</P>
<P>
 The Schaps were in the process of separating when Glover was killed.

RABIN TELLS RIGHTISTS HE WON'T REMOVE SETTLERS; ISRAEL: BUT PREMIER APPEARS TO 
LEAVE OPEN POSSIBILITY OF EVACUATING HEBRON'S 415 JEWS IN THE FUTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin told opposition leaders Friday that his 
government has no intention of evacuating Jewish settlers from the occupied 
West Bank town of Hebron, a key Palestinian demand after the Feb. 25 massacre 
of about 30 Arab worshipers in Hebron's Cave of the Patriarchs. 
</P>
<P>
 In a meeting meant to diffuse a torrent of criticism from Israel's political 
right of Thursday's unprecedented agreement to permit armed, international 
observers in Hebron, the prime minister stressed that "at this stage" of peace 
negotiations with the Palestine Liberation Organization, the government has 
dropped the issue of Hebron's settlers from the agenda, according to opposition 
leaders and Rabin's aides. 
</P>
<P>
 That wording appeared to leave open the possibility of removing the 415 
settlers in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin's assurance, which met with mixed reviews from Israel's political right, 
came as the potentially explosive issue began to tear into the state's very 
foundations. Senior Israeli officials indicated Friday that the government's 
decision to permit foreign troops in the occupied lands for the first time in a 
quarter of a century was not only a compromise to persuade the PLO to return to 
talks on permanent Palestinian autonomy, but also an attempt to compromise on 
an internal Israeli debate on the settlements issue. 
</P>
<P>
 One member of Rabin's government publicly linked the two issues Friday. In an 
interview on Israel Radio, Economics Minister Shimon Shetreet declared that he 
hopes the agreement to permit the armed observer force will end the debate over 
the settlers.  
</P>
<P>
 "I hope that the fact that there are international observers, that all those 
who suggest moving out the Jewish residents of Hebron will stop talking about 
it," said Shetreet, who is considered one of the most conservative members of 
Rabin's Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is enough," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Brooklyn-born physician Baruch Goldstein's attack on praying 
Palestinians in the mosque at the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron, the PLO 
demanded that the government remove the settlers from Hebron. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports followed that the government was weighing plans either to evacuate or 
consolidate the handful of small settlements in the heart of a city with more 
than 100,000 angry Palestinians -- a situation that Rabin had called "a 
potential time bomb." 
</P>
<P>
 The political opposition warned that such action against the settlers, who 
assert that their right to live on land that Israel occupied during the 1967 
Arab-Israeli War is grounded in the biblical references to Hebron as the first 
Israelite community in Canaan, could polarize the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Debate over the issue took a dire turn Wednesday when a right-wing religious 
party, the National Religious Party, released a ruling by three influential 
rabbis instructing Israeli soldiers to disobey any direct order to forcibly 
remove Jews from Hebron. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin's response to the rabbinical ruling was swift and angry. In a news 
conference Thursday night, he called it "irresponsibility unprecedented since 
the creation of the state of Israel."  
</P>
<P>
 Senior military commanders, leaders of Rabin's Labor Party and members of his 
leftist coalition government sought to isolate the rabbis and the religious 
party that follows their rulings. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor Party General Secretary Nissim Zvili called the three religious leaders, 
among them one of Israel's former chief rabbis, "an example of rabbis who have 
lost their way. They are extremists who are led by unbalanced marginal forces, 
and their rulings could result in civil war." 
</P>
<P>
 But the government clearly was concerned about the implications of their 
ruling at a time when it is involved in delicate negotiations with a former 
sworn enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Defense Minister Mordechai Gur met with one of the rabbis, former 
Israeli Chief Rabbi Avraham Shapira, in an unsuccessful effort to get him to 
withdraw it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to make clear to him the potential dangers and possible consequences 
of a call to a soldier to disobey orders . . . a decision that could bring 
about the collapse of Israeli society," Gur said after meeting with Shapira on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 A poll published by the Hebrew daily Yediot Aharonot on Friday found that 81% 
of Israeli citizens interviewed said they would disapprove if Israeli soldiers 
obeyed the rabbis and refused direct orders from their commanders to remove the 
settlers. But the question put another way yielded a partially contradictory 
result: One in five Israelis would endorse military disobedience based on 
religious commands. 
</P>
<P>
 Several right-wing opposition leaders also appeared to endorse the rabbinical 
decision. And it was praised by many speakers at a rally Thursday of thousands 
of settlers celebrating the 26-year-old Hebron settlements, which revived a 
Jewish community that had fled after 67 Jews were massacred there in a series 
of Arab uprisings in 1929. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlers' demonstration took place at Kiryat Arba, which was home to 
Goldstein. Some of the settlers who spoke at the rally praised the man who had 
fired more than 100 bullets into the crowded Ibrahim Mosque inside the 
traditional burial place of Abraham. 
</P>
<P>
 It was against that backdrop that Rabin's government agreed Thursday to the 
international observer force as a concession to the PLO. In exchange, PLO 
Chairman Yasser Arafat appeared to drop his demand that the Jewish settlers be 
removed from Hebron immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 It remained unclear after Rabin's meeting with the opposition Friday whether 
the Israeli-PLO agreement, which had triggered another round of angry 
condemnations from the political right on Thursday, would end the debate over 
the rabbinical ruling.

UNITED STATES, UNITED NATIONS STUMBLE OVER ROCKY RELATIONSHIP; DIPLOMACY: 
TESTINESS MARKS PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CLASHES. AT ISSUE, AIDES SAY, ARE TWO 
DISTINCT CONCEPTS OF THE SECRETARY GENERAL'S JOB. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 U.N. diplomats and officials are alarmed by the sometimes acrimonious and 
often exasperated feelings that have marred relations between Secretary General 
Boutros Boutros-Ghali and the Clinton Administration in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 The troubles surfaced at the end of February, when the press attache for U.N. 
Ambassador Madeleine Albright rebuked the secretary general for writing a 
letter to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin suggesting " some kind of United 
Nations presence" in the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not think the secretary general's suggestion is particularly helpful or 
useful," said James P. Rubin, the attache, in a rare public reprimand. 
</P>
<P>
 This testiness was a manifestation of an even more profound conflict in 
private. 
</P>
<P>
 Relations have fallen to such depths, reports an ambassador on the Security 
Council, that a diplomat from the U.S. mission to the United Nations vowed 
recently that "we will destroy" the secretary general if he dares to stand in 
the way of any North Atlantic Treaty Organization air strikes in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are they talking about?" the ambassador asked. "Is this Nikita 
Khrushchev trying to destroy Dag Hammarskjold? The secretary general cannot be 
anyone's puppet. He must represent the United Nations. And, in the case of the 
bombing, his approach was the correct one. . . . All this fighting is no good 
for the U.N. We cannot have the U.N. and the United States opposed to each 
other." 
</P>
<P>
 A good deal of hyperbole infused the supposed threat of the U.S. diplomat: 
There is, for example, no mechanism for members of the United Nations to remove 
a secretary general from office. A U.S. official, in fact, denies that members 
of the U.S. mission to the United Nations use that kind of language about the 
secretary general. But there is no doubt that U.S. diplomats have berated 
Boutros-Ghali in private for issuing statements that smacked of a reluctance to 
order air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Boutros-Ghali makes a show of brushing off criticism, he knows that 
he has much to lose from a sour relationship with the most powerful member of 
the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need the United States," he said in a speech in Washington in late October. 
"The United Nations needs the United States. Finding the right relationship 
between the U.N. and the U.S. may be one of the most important tasks of our 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is only partly personal. The secretary general can be stubborn and 
arrogant and contemptuous. But he can also be charming and courtly in private, 
and both sides insist that -- despite some angry exchanges over Somalia last 
fall -- he and Albright now deal with each other with warmth and good-natured 
banter. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue, U.N. and U.S. aides said, are two distinct concepts of the job of 
secretary general. 
</P>
<P>
 Boutros-Ghali, 71, a former professor and deputy foreign minister in Egypt, 
conceives of an active role for himself, one of an international political 
leader offering a host of peace initiatives, his power moored in the moral 
force of an organization representing 184 governments. 
</P>
<P>
 His aides said his authority was established in Article 99 of the U.N. 
Charter, which states, in its entirety, that "the secretary general may bring 
to the attention of the Security Council any matter which in his opinion may 
threaten the maintenance of international peace and security." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials believe that Boutros-Ghali is reading too much into this 
sentence. In the prevailing view among U.S. officials, he is an international 
civil servant charged with carrying out policy, not making it. 
</P>
<P>
 Albright has said that Boutros-Ghali should regard himself as "a chief 
administrative officer" serving the Security Council as if it were his board of 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The secretary general often oversteps his role," a U.S. official said, "and 
some of the things he does are counterproductive." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only does this complicate delicate international problems, the official 
said, but "it gives critics like Sen. (Robert) Dole an opportunity to lambaste 
the United Nations and hurt the constituency for the U.N. in the United 
States." 
</P>
<P>
 Dole, the Senate Republican leader who likes to pronounce the secretary 
general's unusual name in mocking tones, regularly admonishes the White House 
against letting Boutros-Ghali set U.S. foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the sharpest rhetoric leveled at Boutros-Ghali has come from two 
Reagan Administration officials who share the view that he is trying to usurp 
power: former U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick, who derides Boutros-Ghali as a 
would-be "commander in chief of the world," and former Assistant Secretary of 
State Richard Armitage, who claims that the secretary general acts as though he 
were "chief executive officer of the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton Administration officials believe that Boutros-Ghali sets himself up 
for such attacks by stretching the limits of his office beyond political 
bounds. 
</P>
<P>
 But Edward Luck, president of the U.N. Assn. of the United States, a citizen 
group that supports the United Nations, said the real problem lies in the 
conflict between the activism of the secretary general and the minimalist 
approach of President Clinton to foreign affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The United Nations has become a symbol of activist internationalism at a time 
when the United States would like the world to go away," Luck said in a recent 
interview. "The secretary general is trying to expand his role at a time when 
the United States would like him to be quiet. He has become the nagging voice 
in the middle of the night." 
</P>
<P>
 Luck believes that Boutros-Ghali should rein in this nagging voice. 
</P>
<P>
 "The secretary general has thought more about his role than any other 
secretary general," he said. "He has a pretty coherent idea of what he wants to 
do. But he shouldn't preach about it. He pays too little attention to the 
political nuances of how and when something is said." 
</P>
<P>
 But Luck also believes that the problem is exacerbated by the narrow goals of 
Clinton's foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's as if the stars are crossed," he said. "We have an activist secretary 
general with a lot of ideas and an Administration with a minimalist foreign 
policy that does not want to be reminded about what goes on in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 The fiasco in Somalia in early October that left 18 U.S. soldiers dead badly 
bruised relations. Boutros-Ghali felt betrayed when Clinton announced a March 
31 withdrawal of all U.S. troops after the soldiers died in a battle with the 
militia of Gen. Mohammed Farah Aidid. 
</P>
<P>
 From the secretary general's point of view, the operation had been fashioned 
to U.S. specifications. 
</P>
<P>
 The Americans had handpicked the key U.N. staff for Somalia, including retired 
U.S. Adm. Jonathan Howe as the civilian chief. They had persuaded Boutros-Ghali 
to appoint an American favorite, Kofi Annan of Ghana, as the undersecretary 
general in charge of peacekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
 The Americans even demanded and won the right to keep the Rangers and other 
U.S. combat troops under U.S. rather than U.N. command. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of this, U.S. officials had pledged full support to Boutros-Ghali's 
plan to disarm the warring factions of Somalia and, after an ambush of 
Pakistani peacekeepers, to hunt down Aidid as a criminal. 
</P>
<P>
 All this changed after the October deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials, from Clinton downward, led the public to believe that the 
Americans had been ordered into battle by the United Nations and Boutros-Ghali. 
</P>
<P>
 In a televised address, Clinton announced that, in preparation for eventual 
withdrawal, he was immediately dispatching reinforcements to Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 "These forces will be under American command," he said, leaving unspoken the 
false implication that the others had been under U.N. command. 
</P>
<P>
 Boutros-Ghali believed that the U.S. had made him the scapegoat for the 
October debacle and had undercut his goal of aggressive U.N. peace enforcement 
in crippled lands such as Somalia. And Boutros-Ghali was infuriated when 
Clinton then sent Ambassador Robert Oakley -- an antagonist of the secretary 
general during the Bush Administration's Somalia expedition involving 28,500 
Marines -- back to Somalia to assuage Aidid and straighten out the political 
mess. 
</P>
<P>
 The view of U.S. officials is far different. 
</P>
<P>
 They believe that the secretary general's hatred for Aidid -- first honed, 
they said, in his Egyptian Foreign Ministry days -- had misled the U.S. Rangers 
into the manhunt. Boutros-Ghali's theories about aggressive peacekeeping may 
look persuasive on paper, U.S. officials said, but a U.S. President cannot 
afford to shed the blood of his troops on a distant and remote adventure. 
</P>
<P>
 Some U.S. officials acknowledged that the Administration was unfair in heaping 
so much public blame on Boutros-Ghali. A Pentagon official called it 
"shameless." But they nevertheless resented Boutros-Ghali's whining about it. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials believed that it was unseemly for an international civil 
servant to so blatantly attack the most powerful member of his board of 
directors in public. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar misunderstandings confuse the conflict over air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, the Security Council authorized NATO, "subject to close coordination 
with the secretary general," to use air power to protect U.N. peacekeepers and 
deter aggression in Sarajevo and other besieged towns of Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 Boutros-Ghali interpreted the resolution as granting him the final say on any 
use of NATO air power in Bosnia. But his comments implied that he feared the 
consequences of air strikes and would approve them only with great reluctance. 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomatic admirers believe that his reluctance reflected his reading of the 
mood in NATO: The United States and its West European allies were not ready for 
air strikes. Boutros-Ghali sensed a change in that mood after the deadly Feb. 5 
missile attack on the marketplace in Sarajevo. He then called on NATO to 
prepare for air strikes and delegated his authority to launch them to U.N. and 
NATO officials on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 In the view of his admirers, Boutros-Ghali diverted public anger over inaction 
in Bosnia from the United States and Western Europe to the United Nations for 
six months and then, when the time was ripe, galvanized NATO into action. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials see the situation differently. They believe that, no matter 
what the legal mooring of the resolution, the secretary general should not have 
asserted his power to decide what was really a military matter. Military 
expertise is a hallmark of neither his experience nor his office. Even more 
important, the Americans believe that he made himself an obstacle to air 
strikes by his obvious reluctance to use them. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Americans see it, Boutros-Ghali relented, changed his mind about the 
need for air strikes and transferred authority to his officials on the scene 
only after he was pressured to do so by U.S. diplomats.

BOSNIAN SERBS INSTIGATED NEW ATTACKS, U.N. SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a new wave of terror in Bosnia, attackers apparently backed by Bosnian 
Serbs have murdered at least 17 Muslims and two Croats in a Serbian-held 
northern area, a report that has prompted aid agencies to consider mass 
evacuations of non-Serb minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. and Red Cross officials said Friday that they accepted claims by the 
Muslim organization Merhamet that the killings had been committed during the 
last three days in and around the town of Prijedor, 110 miles northwest of 
Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 The Serbian police in Prijedor denied charges that the incidents were an 
intensification of "ethnic cleansing" and said they were investigating only 
seven deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Kessler, spokesman at the U.N. relief office in Zagreb, Croatia, said 
grenades were lobbed into homes of many of the victims, who were then robbed 
and executed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Apparently, these attacks are going forward with permission or even military 
assistance of the Bosnian Serb militia," he said, adding that there were rumors 
the killings were in retaliation for the deaths of three Serbian soldiers whose 
bodies were taken to Prijedor. 
</P>
<P>
 The murders followed a grim pattern of using terror to scare off rival ethnic 
groups in Bosnia's 2-year-old war. All three warring factions have been accused 
of the practice, but Serbs have been blamed for the worst excesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington, responding harshly to the reports, called for those guilty of war 
crimes to be brought to justice. 
</P>
<P>
 "The United States condemns in the strongest possible language the 
continuation of Bosnian Serb 'ethnic cleansing' campaigns" in Prijedor and the 
nearby town of Banja Luka, State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said. 
</P>
<P>
 In another setback for recent peace efforts, fighting intensified around 
Gorazde, a U.N. "safe haven" 35 miles southeast of Sarajevo that is held by 
troops of Bosnia's Muslim-led government and surrounded by Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations said it will send 800 troops to the city, where the fourth 
consecutive day of fighting left five people dead and 17 injured Friday.

U.S., SEOUL DELAY MILITARY EXERCISES; DEFENSE: DECISION ON TEAM SPIRIT 
MANEUVERS IS POSTPONED TO GIVE N. KOREA TIME TO COMPLY WITH NUCLEAR 
INSPECTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States and South Korea on Friday postponed any decision on reviving 
their joint military exercises to give North Korea time to respond to a new 
U.N. Security Council statement urging it to allow full inspection of its 
nuclear plants. 
</P>
<P>
 The postponement was announced in a news conference by Han Sung Joo, South 
Korea's foreign minister, following meetings with Defense Secretary William J. 
Perry and other top U.S. policy-makers. U.S. officials later confirmed the 
postponement. 
</P>
<P>
 The action is largely symbolic, since the annual exercises are not considered 
essential to allied military operations. But strategists hope the delay will 
give North Korea, which has made the exercises a visible bargaining chip in the 
dispute, a face-saving way to comply. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Pentagon officials said they are proceeding with plans to 
send six batteries of advanced Patriot air-defense missiles to South Korea to 
help protect U.S. military bases there. Ships carrying the Patriots already 
have left for South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 The Security Council statement, drafted by China and issued by the 15-member 
body late Thursday, is non-binding; it urged North Korea to comply with 
inspections of its nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The action, which required no formal vote by the council, fell short of the 
formal resolution that the United States initially had sought, which would have 
mandated North Korea's compliance. 
</P>
<P>
 But Han and U.S. officials asserted Friday that the fact that China had been 
intimately involved in the effort was likely to intensify pressure on North 
Korea to go along with the U.N. urging. The Chinese have been the North Korean 
government's sole ally in the inspections dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Friday's compromise by Washington and Seoul, the North Koreans reacted 
negatively. 
</P>
<P>
 Pak Gil Yon, North Korea's U.N. ambassador, told reporters that the Security 
Council action "will not help the solution" of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have nothing more to show the (international) inspectors at this time," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Han -- in a view that was shared by top U.S. officials -- all but 
predicted that the government in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang 
eventually will come around and permit the inspections, particularly after 
prodding from China. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't expect North Korea to suddenly accept it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said Washington decided to go along with the Chinese proposal 
after it became clear that the United States would not be able to push through 
a stronger resolution, which would have paved the way for the imposition of 
sanctions if Pyongyang balked. 
</P>
<P>
 However, U.S. strategists argued Friday that, having acceded to the lower-key 
approach, they will be in a stronger position to win Security Council approval 
for sanctions if North Korea continues to bar the international weapons 
inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the statement issued Thursday warns that "further Security Council 
consideration will take place if necessary in order to achieve full 
implementation" of the demands for resumption of inspections -- a veiled threat 
of possible sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute stems from North Korea's abrupt refusal in March to allow monitors 
from the IAEA to inspect two key nuclear weapons plants to verify whether 
Pyongyang is building a nuclear weapon, as Western intelligence agencies 
suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the IAEA declared that, with North Korea unwilling to permit 
inspections, it was unable to guarantee that Pyongyang is not manufacturing 
plutonium, the main ingredient for nuclear weapons. The agency referred the 
issue to the Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
 With North Korea's rhetoric at a fever pitch, U.S. officials have been trying 
to walk a diplomatic tightrope, calling for a last-ditch effort at negotiations 
while at the same time quietly bolstering U.S. military strength should 
hostilities break out. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the military exercises -- known as Team Spirit -- and the plan to ship 
Patriot air-defense missile batteries to South Korea have become major 
bargaining chips in the dispute over the last few months. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said Friday that they hoped Pyongyang will accept the new 
deferral of a decision on the Team Spirit exercises as a goodwill gesture and 
not continue to protest the shipment of Patriots, which they said clearly are 
defensive weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials conceded privately that the postponement will force the allies to 
cut the exercises back sharply, to avoid interfering with the South Korean 
planting season.

 A pair of radio broadcasts intended as April Fools' Day jokes failed to 
produce any yuks when listeners took them seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 In Jerusalem, an army radio broadcast was interrupted by a report claiming a 
lost tribe of black Jews from Gabon had been secretly airlifted to Israel as 
part of "Operation Elijah." 
</P>
<P>
 The claim was even backed up by several Israeli mayors and the head of the 
group coordinating immigration to Israel. They debated the pros and cons of 
allowing the Gabonese in. 
</P>
<P>
 The report's one problem -- Gabon has only a tiny Jewish community, mostly 
expatriate Israeli business people, and none had been airlifted to Israel. But 
few in Jerusalem seemed to know that: The immigration desk at Ben Gurion 
Airport was flooded with telephone calls from the media and others offering 
help, the Itim news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
 In Cameroon on Friday, panic swept through the capital, Yaounde, when a radio 
station warned a lion was on the rampage on the city outskirts. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents pulled their children indoors and locked windows after Yaounde FM 94 
said the lion was closing in on the densely populated Cite Verte suburb. A 
truckload of gendarmes was seen driving through the area, looking for the 
beast. 
</P>
<P>
 By evening, most people realized the lion tale was a hoax.

 South African soldiers rolled into the Zulu stronghold of Natal, a day after 
President Frederik W. de Klerk declared a state of emergency amid unrest 
threatening this month's all-race election.The troubled province appeared tense 
but was relatively quiet. Five deaths were reported from black factional 
fighting, fewer than the average daily toll in recent weeks, police said. But 
Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi, whose Inkatha Freedom Party is 
boycotting the April 26-28 ballot, said the emergency order could lead to civil 
war in KwaZulu, the Zulus' self-governed homeland in Natal.

CRUCIFIXIONS, PAPAL TRADITIONS MARK GOOD FRIDAY WORLDWIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pilgrims retraced the last steps of Jesus Christ through old Jerusalem's 
narrow alleys in observance of Good Friday, while at the Vatican, the Pope 
followed his tradition of hearing confessions before Easter Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Observances elsewhere around the world included voluntary crucifixions in the 
Philippines and a ban on entertainment in Cologne, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Rain-drenched pilgrims chanting "Jesus loves you" marched through the 
cobblestone streets of old Jerusalem. About 5,000 people showed up instead of 
the usual tens of thousands, because of the weather and heightened tensions. 
</P>
<P>
 The holiday that commemorates the crucifixion of Christ came five weeks after 
a Jewish settler massacred about 30 Muslim worshipers in a mosque in the West 
Bank town of Hebron, sparking violence in the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
 In Vatican City, Pope John Paul II heard confessions from 13 Roman Catholics 
chosen from a crowd of thousands in St. Peter's Basilica. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, John Paul spoke to tens of thousands gathered outside the Roman 
Colosseum, where the pontiff marked the final sufferings and crucifixion of 
Christ in a Good Friday procession. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Philippines, Asia's only Roman Catholic country, at least 19 people 
were voluntarily crucified in rituals re-enacting Christ's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Godolieve Rombaut, 54, a Belgian, fainted after spending two minutes nailed to 
a cross under a broiling sun in the village of San Pedro Cutud. In another 
village, a 53-year-old grandmother underwent her eighth crucifixion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Roman Catholic hierarchy officially frowns on Good Friday crucifixions. 
But the events are so popular in rural areas that the church makes little 
effort to discourage them. 
</P>
<P>
 In Cologne, Germany, officials in the heavily Roman Catholic area enforced a 
law banning entertainment on Good Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Franz-Josef Antwerpes, head of the Cologne regional government, said there 
would be no theater, opera, discos or bars.

 Far-right leader Gianfranco Fini, whose party is poised to share power in 
Italy's next government, hailed fascist dictator Benito Mussolini as "the

his attempts during the campaign to play down his party's fascist past. The

 Two rightists armed with a pistol and a traditional Japanese sword stormed the 
Tokyo offices of a liberal newspaper and took two employees hostage for hours 
before surrendering peaceably to police. No one was hurt in the nearly six-hour 
ordeal, during which the men called for more "soul" in economic development and 
criticized the Asahi Shimbun for accepting overseas criticism of Japan's role 
in World War II. The neatly dressed men bowed, thanked police for their efforts 
and quietly stepped into police vehicles after agreeing to surrender.

DEFENDANT IN N.Y. BOMB PLOT CASE PLEADS GUILTY TO A LESSER CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of 15 people charged in a conspiracy to bomb the United Nations and other 
landmarks pleaded guilty Friday to a lesser charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Earl Gant, also known as Abdur Rasheed or Abu Jaleel, pleaded guilty to one 
count of conspiracy to transport explosives across state lines knowing they 
would be used to commit violent or destructive acts. 
</P>
<P>
 Gant pleaded guilty to discussing the purchase of explosive powder with 
another defendant, Siddig Ibrahim Siddig Ali. The powder was not obtained. 
</P>
<P>
 The charge carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison and $250,000 in 
fines. Gant is to be sentenced June 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Indictments said Gant's role in the alleged conspiracy was limited to the 
charge to which he pleaded guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it (the explosives) was to be used for training and acts of 
violence against persons," Gant told U.S. District Judge Michael Mukasey during 
the plea hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 At a hearing in October when Gant was released on bail, his lawyer had argued 
that his client became involved with the other defendants in the case because 
he thought he was being recruited to help fight for Muslims in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Ali and 13 other men remain accused of conspiring to bomb the United Nations, 
two tunnels that connect New York and New Jersey and to commit other terrorist 
acts. Their trial is scheduled for September. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said the alleged plot included the Feb. 26, 1993, World Trade 
Center bombing that killed six people and injured about 1,000 others.

PENTAGON IS SCALING BACK ITS DRUG-FIGHTING ACTIVITIES; MILITARY: THE MOVE IS 
THE RESULT OF SHARP BUDGET CUTS, AS WELL AS THE ADMINISTRATION'S NEW FOCUS ON 
DISCOURAGING DOMESTIC NARCOTICS USE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Pentagon, which entered the war on drugs with fanfare in 1989, is cutting 
spending and changing its role in fighting narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
 The move comes partly because of recent sharp cuts in the military budget and 
partly because of a high-level Clinton Administration review that has changed 
the emphasis of federal drug enforcement efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new Clinton plan, the government will be devoting more of its time 
and resources to discouraging drug use at home rather than attempting to stop 
drug trafficking from the Caribbean and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee P. Brown, director of the White House Office of National Drug Control 
Policy, said in a speech earlier this year that relying largely on intercepting 
drug traffic from foreign sources had proved expensive and not very effective. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said that while some interdiction efforts would continue, including most 
of those that have been carried on or aided by U.S. military units, "our 
national goal must be the reduction of the overall demand for drugs in 
America." 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration has begun aiming more of its drug enforcement efforts at 
home, with programs designed to decrease the use of narcotics by teen-agers and 
college students.  
</P>
<P>
 As a result, with the approval of Congress, the Pentagon has eliminated 24 of 
its 170 counter-narcotics programs and cut its spending on anti-drug operations 
by $273 million -- a reduction of nearly one-fourth from the high of $1.2 
billion in fiscal 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The military also has begun rechanneling its efforts from trying to stop drug 
traffickers on the high seas to helping the military and police organizations 
in such drug-growing countries as Bolivia, Peru and Colombia stamp out drug 
cartels. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The changes have drawn some protests, primarily from law enforcement officials 
in states such as Florida and Texas, who fear that the cutbacks will undermine 
their ability to stop drugs at the border. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brian Sheridan, deputy assistant secretary of defense for drug 
enforcement, insists that the changes will not affect the military's ability to 
help local law enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not backing away -- what we are doing is fine-tuning the whole 
effort," Sheridan says. "We had a program that was fat, that was unfocused and 
that had no major goals or objectives. Now, it's lean and can be more effective 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon's appetite for getting involved in the nation's drug enforcement 
effort has been constantly changing. 
</P>
<P>
 Before 1989, military leaders were strongly opposed to using the armed forces 
for counter-narcotics missions, contending that it would distract from their 
war-fighting readiness. 
</P>
<P>
 But the George Bush Administration pushed the services into the fray, 
promoting drug enforcement as a reason to keep a strong military despite the 
breakup of the Soviet Union. Then-Defense Secretary Dick Cheney called drugs "a 
direct threat" to U.S. sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Today, hit by demands for a U.S. military presence in Bosnia and other global 
hot spots and pinched by White House and congressional spending cutbacks, the 
military again has lost its enthusiasm for diverting resources to the drug war. 
</P>
<P>
 While insisting that the military will continue some interdiction efforts, 
Sheridan argues that Americans "need to develop realistic expectations of what 
the Defense Department is equipped to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somewhere along the line, people began to think that if the military gets 
into the act, we will stop the flow of drugs into the United States flatly," 
Sheridan says. "That is not going to happen. We can help law enforcement 
agencies. But demand for drugs is too high." 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials say privately that the Pentagon's changes probably 
will not make much difference, partly because much of what the Defense 
Department labeled as new programs in the drug war actually were not new. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, one federal official points out, the military always had some 
ground troops conducting training exercises in the Southwest. In 1989, these 
units were renamed as part of "Joint Task Force Six," and the exercises were 
counted as counter-narcotics efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of this was little more than an accounting effort," one official says. 
</P>
<P>
 Experienced drug enforcement officials say the military's efforts over the 
last few years have made a "modest contribution" to the anti-drug war, forcing 
traffickers to change their routes or send goods by ship. But they have not 
reduced the total flow of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 They say the military's most effective contribution has been to provide 
intelligence about aircraft and ships, as well as communications equipment for 
other enforcement efforts. "We're dealing mainly at the margin here," a drug 
enforcement officer says. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials insist that most of the 24 programs they have cut were 
modest -- such as a runway sensor device that had proved ineffective in 
detecting landings or a blimp-based radar-tracking program that could be run 
less expensively by land. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most controversial cuts involved trimming the drug enforcement 
budget of the National Guard by $30 million -- a move that officials concede 
most likely will leave fewer helicopters available for eradicating marijuana 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration also took $17 million out of the Defense Mapping Agency's 
$25-million budget for making special counter-narcotics maps. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, officials say such efforts have not proved crucial, and the military 
is pushing to use the money elsewhere. "How many anti-drug maps can you make?" 
a Defense Department official asks. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials also point to new operations that they say will continue or improve 
the previous drug-tracking efforts at less expense. For example, the Navy has 
begun using over-the-horizon radar units that can cover the entire Caribbean at 
a fraction of the cost of patrol ships.

CHRISTIE BRINKLEY HURT IN COLORADO HELICOPTER CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Model Christie Brinkley and five others were plucked from 12,800 feet up a 
mountain by helicopter Friday after the copter they were riding in crashed. 
Brinkley suffered minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The group was trapped on the mountain in heavy winds and snow for five hours 
after their helicopter went down near Ophir, about six miles south of 
Telluride. The cause of the crash was not known. 
</P>
<P>
 A rescue helicopter had to make several trips to the site, braving 50-m.p.h. 
winds. Its crew hoisted members of Brinkley's group off the mountain by cable, 
said Jim Arbaugh of High Country Helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
 A man in the group who wasn't identified was flown to St. Mary's Hospital in 
Grand Junction. His condition wasn't immediately released. Brinkley suffered 
minor injuries, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The helicopter was carrying four skiers, a guide and the pilot on a 
heli-skiing outing. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the skiers were Brinkley and Sandra Carradine, the ex-wife of actor 
Keith Carradine.

'84 CLINTON CAMPAIGN LISTED IN RTC PROBE; WHITEWATER: INVESTIGATORS HAD NAMED 
THE GUBERNATORIAL REELECTION COMMITTEE AS A SUSPECT IN THEIR INQUIRY INTO 
MADISON GUARANTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN SCHMIDT, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Investigators for the Resolution Trust Corp. last year named the 1984 Clinton 
gubernatorial campaign committee as a suspect in their criminal probe of 
Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan. They cited evidence in a detailed referral 
that the campaign may have conspired to illegally benefit from depositor funds, 
according to a source familiar with the case. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the RTC's 10 "criminal referrals" on Madison, which have been forwarded 
to special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr., seeks further investigation into 
whether $60,500 in Madison funds was diverted to the campaign with the 
knowledge of campaign officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigators' interest centered on an April 4, 1985, fund-raiser held by 
Madison owner James B. McDougal at Bill Clinton's request to help the 
then-governor pay off a $50,000 personal loan used for the 1984 campaign. They 
also noted that some contributions exceeded legal limits and urged further 
investigation of $10,500 in Madison funds that may have ended up in the Clinton 
campaign after passing through Madison accounts. One of those was in the name 
of the Clintons' Whitewater real estate venture. 
</P>
<P>
 The RTC referrals have been widely reported, but their contents have not been 
known. The disclosure of the language used in describing the campaign's 
activities is the first indication of a specific allegation of possible 
wrongdoing involving the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The referral names Hillary Rodham Clinton as a possible witness, citing the 
close timing of the fund-raiser with her legal representation of Madison before 
state regulators appointed by her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons were partners with McDougal and his wife in Whitewater, and 
McDougal has said he paid Hillary Clinton's law firm $2,000 a month to help him 
win state regulatory approval for a novel stock plan. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton and the First Lady have said they did nothing wrong in 
connection with Madison. They described her legal work for the thrift as 
minimal, and former Clinton aides have said he had no involvement with handling 
proceeds from the 1985 fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House said Friday it could not comment. "The special counsel's 
looking into it," Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said. "We don't know what's in 
the referral." 
</P>
<P>
 Betsey Wright, Clinton's chief of staff as Arkansas governor and manager of 
the 1984 campaign, said Friday she was unaware that the campaign committee was 
named as a suspect. She declined to say if she had received a subpoena from 
Fiske but said she is furnishing campaign records at his request. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wright and other Clinton aides have said that records documenting 
contributions from the 1985 fund-raiser cannot be located. 
</P>
<P>
 A second RTC criminal referral that mentions the Clintons said it appears 
Madison funds were diverted to the Whitewater Development Corp. and describes 
the Clintons as "potential beneficiaries" but not criminal suspects. Whitewater 
was an Arkansas real estate venture. 
</P>
<P>
 The RTC, the federal agency charged with disposing of failed S&Ls, routinely 
investigates the thrifts for potential civil claims that could help recoup some 
of the cleanup cost. The agency also looks into suspected criminal wrongdoing 
and refers evidence it develops to the FBI and federal prosecutors.

POLICE OFFER REWARD IN D.C. MARKET SHOOTINGS

<TEXT>
<P>
 A $10,000 reward was offered by police on Friday for information on two gunmen 
who opened fire at a market, killing one person and wounding eight others. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have an unprecedented number of persons shot here, and we're pulling out 
all the stops to bring this case to a successful conclusion," said District of 
Columbia Police Chief Fred Thomas."I commit to the residents that we will have 
a police presence here." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the gunmen sprayed the market with more than 30 9-millimeter 
rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The deceased victim, identified as Duwan A'Vant, 15, lived just one block from 
where he was shot. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother, Karen, is a secretary in the homicide branch of the police 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the three female and six male victims were two FBI security guards who 
were having dinner at a restaurant in the market. The youngest hit in the 
gunfire was an infant girl; the oldest a 63-year-old woman. None of the wounded 
had life-threatening injuries.

FISH HARVESTS IN PUGET SOUND AT LOWEST LEVEL IN 55 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG CONNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Salmon are not the only troubled fish in the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
 An analysis prepared last month for a joint U.S.-Canadian scientific panel on 
the health of fish stocks declared bluntly that "fish resources in Puget Sound 
have seriously declined, and harvests are at their lowest level in over 55 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 Where once commercial and sport fishermen annually hauled over 26 million 
pounds of fish out of these waters, the 1993 catch was a paltry 3.6 million 
pounds. Pacific cod, hake and pollock populations have been especially hard 
hit, according to Cyreis Schmitt, a biologist for the state of Washington and a 
co-author of the report. "Essentially the fisheries have pretty much ceased for 
these three stocks," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Six of the eight most important non-salmon species in Puget Sound now rate as 
"low" or "very low" in abundance, but the authors said they could only guess at 
the cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of these depressed species have been off limits to fishing for years, yet 
returns to historic population levels are overdue. The report blames everything 
from unusually warm water in the sound to an increase in predators to the 
disappearance of marshland. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the salmon, some of these fish live for decades. That means a longer 
wait before scientists can accurately assess the stock's status or recommend 
what to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "So many questions remain about how to do it right," Schmitt said. "It takes 
more knowledge than we now have. The problems may or may not be man-made, but 
we need to adjust to them. We need to be aware and account for them."

FEMA ANSWERS EARTHQUAKE DISASTER WITH A BLIZZARD OF AID CHECKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD LEE COLVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The way governments show disaster victims they care is to write checks. And in 
response to the Northridge earthquake, FEMA officials have issued nearly a 
quarter-million of them and are continuing to crank out thousands more each 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 Administering that dose of concern requires linking telephone operators in 
Texas and Virginia to a vast computer network cobbled together in a leased 
Redwood City office building. The system relies on powerful hand-held computers 
and on damage inspectors who earn more the faster they work. It tries to sort 
out the greedy without discouraging the truly needy. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven weeks after the most expensive disaster in U.S. history, more than 
2,000 FEMA workers continue working long days, processing the requests of those 
who were displaced, those who need help in making repairs -- and some who 
officials say are merely angling for a sliver of the multibillion-dollar aid 
pie. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the area affected by the quake have turned to the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency for help about half a million times, with 
three-quarters of those applicants seeking some type of temporary housing or 
emergency repair assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Although not the most costly, the housing programs are the most vast and reach 
by far the most victims. Aid applications have continued to pour in by the 
thousands. 
</P>
<P>
 Although officials said the percentage of applications deemed eligible is 
declining, the system is growing in order to process appeals and complaints and 
to file the mounting stacks of paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very costly to the government to continue to keep these facilities open 
and yet we don't turn our backs on people if they need assistance," said FEMA 
spokesman Phil Cogan. "But there comes a time when it ceases to be 
cost-effective." 
</P>
<P>
 Telephoned applications are typed directly into the computer system, but 
applications completed at the 10 centers still open in Los Angeles and Ventura 
counties are shipped nightly by Federal Express. 
</P>
<P>
 They are sent to the temporary processing center that occupies leased space in 
the Redwood City office building, costing the government $120,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Although things have slowed down considerably, the pace of work for the 
hundreds of clerks and computer operators and envelope stuffers here still is 
frenetic at times. 
</P>
<P>
 "Initially, people were working seven days a week and we had shifts around the 
clock," said Michael Polny, the FEMA official in charge of the processing 
operation. "Now, no one is working more than 12 hours a day and they are taking 
at least one day off a week." 
</P>
<P>
 Once applications are entered into the rows and rows of computer terminals, 
the highly automated system takes over. Workers check addresses and the award 
amounts for accuracy several times, but field inspectors are the ones who 
usually determine whether losses are sufficient to make a claimant eligible. 
</P>
<P>
 Using their hand-held computers, the army of about 600 inspectors still 
working seven days a week retrieves a list of aid applicants from an electronic 
mailbox on the Compuserve information network, and then makes inspection 
appointments. 
</P>
<P>
 The key to the outcome, said Peter Wessell, an inspector with one of two FEMA 
subcontractors, is whether repairs are necessary to make a dwelling "safe, 
secure and sanitary." Inspectors enter the scope and type of damage into the 
hand-held computer, which is programmed to automatically calculate the cost of 
repairs. The inspector then must decide whether the damage is sufficient to 
require federal help to make the repairs or to mandate alternative housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's mostly . . . cosmetic cracks throughout and that is all it is, that 
is not a hazard," he said. "It's just something that has to be dealt with." 
</P>
<P>
 Wessell does as many 20 inspections a day, for which he is paid $24 each. His 
inspections cover the FEMA housing assistance program as well as the state-run, 
low-income grant program to replace essential personal property, such as 
appliances and clothing. He said most, but not all, of the inspections he is 
conducting now result in rejections. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA officials said the inspectors, who are supposed to have three years of 
construction experience, usually determine the outcome of a request. "The 
inspector is the key person," Polny said. "If the inspector hits the 
insufficient damage button . . . that would automatically generate an 
'ineligible' letter." 
</P>
<P>
 The completed inspections are shipped back to the Compuserve mailbox nightly, 
from which they are retrieved by computers in Redwood City. Inspectors can flag 
some reports for review by someone more experienced with FEMA aid programs, but 
the vast majority are merely checked for completeness and the computer 
determines the amount of aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, the computer prints out letters to be sent to those eligible for aid. 
Separately, documents authorizing the payment are sent electronically to the 
U.S Treasury Department in San Francisco. Checks go out the same day, usually 
about three weeks after the original receipt of an application. 
</P>
<P>
 Chal Overdorff, the FEMA official in charge of certifying which checks to 
issue, said the work is satisfying. "What we're doing is getting a check to 
individuals who need it," he said. "It's a nice feeling."

KILLINGS HEIGHTEN FEARS IN HUNTINGTON BEACH; VIOLENCE: A DOUBLE HOMICIDE NEAR 
PIER IN THE CITY'S REDEVELOPED DOWNTOWN REFLECTS ENCROACHING PROBLEMS, 
RESIDENTS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As police searched Friday for the killer of two young men who were found dead 
near the Huntington Beach Pier, fear and anger swept through the trendy 
downtown district that the city has spent millions of dollars to redevelop. 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows what spurred the deadly confrontation Thursday but by about 10:15 
p.m., Chen Cosmo Blanchard, 23, and Kenny Paul Summer, 23, both of Huntington 
Beach, were dead on the sidewalk at Main and Orange streets, a few feet from 
the entrance to Great Western Sanitary Supplies and just a few blocks from the 
pier. 
</P>
<P>
 A long-haired man shot them without provocation, then walked away, police 
said. But some witnesses said there may have been more to the shooting, saying 
that the gunman got into an argument with the two men, then shot each of them 
three times before fleeing in a car. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they do not believe the shootings were gang-related, and one city 
official who did not want to be identified said it appeared that the gunman was 
upset at the two victims because he saw them urinating on a public wall. They 
got into a shoving match, the official said, then the man left and returned a 
short while later with a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 By Friday morning, the scene of the crime -- still cordoned off -- was a focal 
point for bike riders and passersby. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Stephan, co-owner of the sanitary supplies store, watched as people 
milled about outside, and he pondered what he believes are the root causes of 
the killing. "I could see it coming," he said. "At night, gangs come here from 
other areas and this gets ugly." 
</P>
<P>
 His words were echoed by other residents who lamented the changes in the 
downtown area, worrying about the large crowds of youngsters who gather in the 
evenings and about the crime and violence that they seem to attract near the 
pier. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been coming down here since I was 4," said Charlotte Melson, who began 
summering in Huntington Beach in 1949 and moved here in 1976. "I've watched the 
town grow from oil city to the mess it is now. . . . I never in my life dreamed 
I'd have to worry about bullets flying downtown." 
</P>
<P>
 Melson and her husband stroll Main Street a couple of times each week, walking 
their dogs, visiting a crafts store and stopping for coffee at the new 
Starbuck's. But a few months ago, their 27-year-old son was jumped a couple of 
blocks from their home. More recently, she and her husband were at the Sugar 
Shack when they saw a hit-and-run accident among the cruising cars that often 
clog Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Sgt. Mike Corcoran said Thursday's shootings "are nothing like the kind 
of things we are used to seeing or dealing with in our city. This is just a 
reflection of what's going on throughout our society." 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach Police Chief Ronald E. Lowenberg said the double slaying is 
very unusual. "We only had three homicides throughout the city in 1993." 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach Councilman Ralph Bauer said Friday that crime appears to have 
become less of a problem in the downtown area since redevelopment. Bauer said 
that before, the downtown was a haven for drug users, prostitutes and runaways. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Bauer said he is concerned that there may be too many new bars in 
downtown.

N. CALIFORNIA SAFEWAY STORES SETTLE SEX-DISCRIMINATION SUIT FOR $5 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A sex-discrimination suit against Safeway's 216 Northern California stores has 
been settled for $5 million, Safeway and lawyers for a group of women announced 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement also requires Safeway to set goals for increasing the number of 
female managers and to change the salary structure that encouraged women to 
stay in predominantly female departments, said attorney Jack Lee. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement is subject to a federal judge's approval. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Sacramento in 1991, covers about 
20,000 women who have worked for Safeway at some time since January, 1989. But 
Lee said the money in the settlement would be divided among a smaller number, 
those who had worked in certain jobs and claimed to have been harmed by the 
policies challenged in the suit. The five women who filed the suit will get 
$25,000 each, Lee said.

SUIT CHARGES BIAS IN DISTRICT'S REFUSAL TO GIVE IQ TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Laguna Hills mother whose 7-year-old daughter was denied an intelligence 
test because she is African American filed a federal civil rights lawsuit 
Friday accusing an Orange County school district of discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute stems from a landmark 1979 federal court ruling that prohibits 
California public schools from giving standardized intelligence tests to 
African American children to determine mental retardation. The ruling, which 
found that the tests were racially and culturally biased, was expanded in 1986 
to prohibit IQ tests for all African American children who are candidates for 
special education and other remedial classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Students of other races are not included in the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 In the lawsuit filed Friday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, Wendy 
Strong alleges that the Saddleback Valley Unified School District has failed to 
provide adequate and fair testing for her daughter, Brianna Combash, because of 
her race. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is that Brianna hasn't been getting a proper education," said 
Strong, whose daughter is struggling in school. "The school district is going 
to have to put together comparable and efficient testing for African American 
students, so no other parent or child has to go through this." 
</P>
<P>
 District officials denied the allegations of discrimination, but would not 
comment further, citing policy that prohibits them from talking about pending 
lawsuits or individual student matters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The district is working closely with the state Department of Education 
regarding this case," spokeswoman Elaine Carter said. "As a district, we must 
comply with both state and federal mandates, including the federal court order 
dealing with IQ testing." 
</P>
<P>
 Strong said she was shocked last month to learn that the 15-year-old federal 
court ruling prevented Brianna from taking an IQ test that might help identify 
possible learning problems, such as attention deficit disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a law might protect some children, Strong conceded, but not her daughter. 
Brianna, a second-grader, has grown up in a middle-class Laguna Hills 
neighborhood. Her father is African American and Strong is white. 
</P>
<P>
 Strong said she was even more upset when she learned of her options: Brianna 
could be given an alternative test that does not involve intelligence quotients 
or she could be reclassified as white, which would make her instantly eligible 
for an IQ test. 
</P>
<P>
 Strong said she believes the alternative test was inferior and inconclusive, 
and that changing Brianna's ethnic classification would be morally wrong. A 
single mother with two children, Strong said she cannot afford the estimated 
$700 for a private IQ test, nor should she have to pay for something that other 
children get free. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Brianna has complained that she feels "branded . . . and inferior," 
according to the suit, which also names Brianna's principal and a school 
psychologist as defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 Strong's lawyer, R. Brian Oxman, described the policy of allowing the change 
in racial classification as a form of "ethnic cleansing which was designed to 
force black children to abandon their racial heritage and change their race to 
white in order to get an education." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxman argued that the school district, as well as other education agencies in 
the state, has had enough time to develop fair tests for all children. 
</P>
<P>
 "This controversy has been going on since 1979," he said. "You would think in 
all these years somebody would come up with a test that is not culturally 
biased."

CONFLICTING RULING ON REFUGEE INMATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A refugee from the 1980 Mariel boatlift -- when Fidel Castro sent 125,000 
Cubans to Florida -- cannot be held in federal prison indefinitely, a federal 
appeals court has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our society, no person may be imprisoned for many years without prospect 
of termination," said the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in the case of a 
Cuban who has spent more than eight years in various federal prisons since 
completing a sentence on state charges in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2-1 ruling Thursday conflicts with decisions by at least three other 
federal appeals courts allowing the continued imprisonment of Cubans whom the 
U.S. government considers to be dangerous, although they have been charged with 
no federal crimes. A lawyer in the case said there may be 3,000 to 5,000 such 
prisoners nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those sent to Florida by Castro in 1980 were prisoners or mental 
patients, but their number remains in dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. authorities released nearly all of the Cubans, but later revoked the 
freedom of many who committed new crimes. Unable to deport them to Cuba, the 
government put them into federal prisons.

 Five women who charged acting Clovis schools chief Kent Bishop with sexual 
harassment have dropped their claims for fear that their names will become 
public. The five were among eight women who alleged anonymously after Bishop 
was appointed in December that he had harassed them individually at various 
times over the years.The Clovis school board retained a San Francisco mediator, 
Vivien Williamson, to obtain statements from the women. However, their lawyer, 
Katherine Hart, announced Thursday that they are unwilling to sign statements 
made to the mediator because that could lead to disclosure of their names. 
"They are afraid of retaliation, reprisal, a loss of privacy and don't want to 
open themselves to legal liability," Hart said. Bishop has denied all 
allegations of sexual harassment. The status of allegations against him by 
three other women was unclear.

 A judge from outside Modoc County was assigned Friday to hear the county's 
lawsuit aimed at barring parole of serial rapist Melvin Carter in the area. 
Modoc County Superior Court Judge Guy Martin Young denied the state's attempt 
to have the case moved out of Modoc County but ordered assignment of another 
judge to hear the lawsuit, court officials said.Carter was paroled in Modoc 
County last month after serving a sentence for 23 crimes, including rape, 
assault and burglary. He has confessed to about 100 rapes to law officers. 
Modoc County Dist. Atty. Ruth Sorensen, who filed the suit to bar parole of 
Carter in the county, said the state Judicial Council selected a retired 
Siskiyou County judge, James E. Kleaver, to hear the case. "That way we won't 
have to take a traveling road show someplace," Sorensen said. Denise Davis, of 
the state attorney general's office, said state law provides for a neutral 
judge to be assigned under these circumstances.

HANDGUN SAFETY LAW TAKES EFFECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 People buying handguns in California now have to take a course, look at a 
video or take a test. 
</P>
<P>
 The new law, which went into effect Friday, is called the Basic Firearms 
Safety Certificate program.It was approved by the Legislature and signed by 
Gov. Pete Wilson last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The law requires handgun buyers to either pass a written firearms safety test 
at the gun store, watch a two-hour instructional video or complete a 
state-certified firearms safety course. 
</P>
<P>
 The law exempts active or retired police officers, current or former military 
personnel, and licensed hunters who have had formal firearms training. It 
applies only to handguns. 
</P>
<P>
 The certificate costs $10, and dealers can charge another $10 to administer 
the test, which is based on a firearms safety workbook.

TIME SPRINGS FORWARD IN ANNUAL RITE; DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME MEANS AN EXTRA HOUR 
OF SUNLIGHT FOR MANY, BUT ONE OF FOUR PEOPLE'S SLEEP PATTERNS CAN BE DISRUPTED 
</P>

 A simple spring ritual to most people, Daylight Saving Time for watch store 
manager Gary Elias is a serious headache.  
</P>
<P>
 While most of us take a few moments to adjust bedside alarm clocks and 
wristwatches, Elias and his six-member crew spend two days and a lot of 
overtime resetting 3,000 timepieces in their South Coast Plaza watch store. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not an easy task to get done. We spend a lot of time and effort so 
every watch is accurate," said Elias, manager at Tourneau, where watches range 
from a $40 Swatch to a $120,000 Jump Hour Repeater from Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 After twisting, pulling and adjusting the tiny watch stems, Elias said, he and 
his salesmen often suffer chipped finger nails, numb fingertips and tired eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 But for most Orange County residents, the time change is welcome for the 
additional hour of sunlight it brings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I absolutely love it because I like to be outside, and there's more light to 
do things when I get home," said Kimberly Jenson, a court clerk in Santa Ana 
who works 9 to 5. "Soon, I'll be able to go bike riding or take walks or work 
in my garden." 
</P>
<P>
 For Steve Medina, 23, a customer service representative at a Costa Mesa bank, 
the time change recharges him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have more energy when I get home. When it gets dark early, all I wanna do 
is go inside and watch TV," Medina said. With more light, he said, "I don't 
feel like my job has eaten up my entire day." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. first adopted Daylight Saving Time in 1918 as a way to save energy. 
Congress repealed the law a year later, but many cities continued to use it. 
Then during World War II, the United States officially observed daylight time 
nationwide to conserve energy for the war effort. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1967, Congress passed the Uniform Time Act, making daylight saving time 
official in most states. Several states such as Hawaii, Arizona and parts of 
Indiana were exempt because they are split by time zones. 
</P>
<P>
 During the energy crisis in the early 1970s, Congress passed a bill which kept 
most of the nation on year-round Daylight Saving Time for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 But while some people enjoy the added daylight, others find it troublesome, 
particularly when it comes to sleeping. 
</P>
<P>
 "One out of four people will have a significant sleep adjustment," said Dr. 
Paul Selecky, medical director of the Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian Sleep 
Disorder Center. Older people and insomniacs, he said, tend to have the most 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 It starts, he said, when a person is unable to fall asleep because he is going 
to bed an hour earlier than before the time change. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is you get poor quality of sleep and insufficient sleep 
initially," Selecky said. "Come morning, your body is used to still sleeping 
another hour and the alarm clock goes off." 
</P>
<P>
 It is easier to adjust to dropping back to standard time in the fall, Selecky 
said, because it is rarely difficult to fall asleep when you stay up an hour 
later than normal. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of sleep lost in the time change, he said, people may feel 
lethargic and irritable and experience difficulty concentrating during the day. 
"But that should disappear as your body adjusts to the new schedule," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Another problem for many will be forgetting to reset clocks. 
</P>
<P>
 According to an American Airlines spokeswoman, travelers every year arrive at 
the airport an hour late, startled to find that their flights left.  
</P>
<P>
 "We do what we can to accommodate these people," said Leeann Paganini, a 
reservations manager from American Airlines. "But we basically rely on people 
to be responsible adults and change their alarm clocks."

SUIT FILED OVER DENIAL OF IQ TEST TO BLACK GIRL; SCHOOLS: MOTHER'S CIVIL RIGHTS 
FILING CHARGES SADDLEBACK VALLEY SCHOOL DISTRICT WITH DISCRIMINATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A Laguna Hills mother whose 7-year-old daughter was denied an intelligence 
test because she is African American filed a federal civil rights lawsuit 
Friday charging a local school district with discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute stems from a landmark 1979 federal court ruling that prohibits 
California public schools from giving standardized intelligence tests to 
African American children to determine mental retardation. The ruling, which 
found the tests were racially and culturally biased, was expanded in 1986 to 
prohibit IQ tests for all African American children who are candidates for 
special education and other remedial classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Students of other races are not included in the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 In the lawsuit filed Friday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, Wendy 
Strong alleges that the Saddleback Valley Unified School District has failed to 
provide adequate and fair testing for her daughter, Brianna Combash, because of 
her race. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is that Brianna hasn't been getting a proper education," said 
Strong, whose daughter is struggling in school. "The school district is going 
to have to put together comparable and efficient testing for African American 
students, so no other parent or child has to go through this." 
</P>
<P>
 District officials denied the allegations of discrimination, but could not 
comment further, citing policy that prohibits them from talking about pending 
lawsuits or individual student matters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The district is working closely with the state Department of Education 
regarding this case," spokeswoman Elaine Carter said. "As a district, we must 
comply with both state and federal mandates, including the federal court order 
dealing with IQ testing. We're interested in working cooperatively with all the 
parties involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Added district lawyer Dave Larsen: "The district has consistently and properly 
complied with state and federal court directives in this matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Strong said she was shocked last month to learn that the 15-year-old federal 
court ruling prevented Brianna from taking an IQ test that might help identify 
possible learning problems, such as attention deficit disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 While Strong said she could understand how such a law might protect some 
children, she doesn't believe it should apply to her daughter. Brianna, a 
second-grader at Linda Vista Elementary School in Mission Viejo, has grown up 
in a middle-class Laguna Hills neighborhood. Her father is African American and 
Strong is white. 
</P>
<P>
 Strong said she was even more upset when she learned of her options in dealing 
with the situation: Brianna could be given an alternative test that does not 
involve intelligence quotients or she could be reclassified as white, which 
would make her instantly eligible for an IQ test.  
</P>
<P>
 Strong said she believed the alternative test was inferior and inconclusive, 
and that changing Brianna's ethnic classification would be morally wrong. A 
single mother with two children, Strong said she couldn't afford the estimated 
$700 for a private IQ test, nor should she have to pay for something that other 
children get free. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Brianna has complained that she feels "branded, as though she could 
not win, and inferior," according to the lawsuit, which also names Brianna's 
principal and a school psychologist as defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 Strong's lawyer, R. Brian Oxman, described the policy of allowing the change 
in racial classification as a form of "ethnic cleansing which was designed to 
force black children to abandon their racial heritage and change their race to 
white in order to get an education." 
</P>
<P>
 "No child should be forced to change their racial heritage," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the school district, as well as others in the state, have had enough 
time to develop fair tests for all children. 
</P>
<P>
 "This controversy has been going on since 1979," he said. "You would think in 
all these years somebody would come up with a test that is not culturally 
biased." 
</P>
<P>
 District officials have said alternative testing methods that do not rely on 
intelligence quotients are more difficult and time-consuming to use, but have 
been used before locally with success. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no state or federal law requiring the use of IQ tests, although they 
are used commonly throughout the state as tools to help place children in 
special education classes. They also are used to place students, including 
African Americans, in programs for the gifted. 
</P>
<P>
 State education officials, however, have urged school districts to stop using 
IQ tests for any child. Some urban districts, such as Los Angeles and San 
Francisco, have eliminated IQ tests to determine placement in special education 
classes.

DINOSAUR STUDIES AREN'T EXTINCT; SCIENCE: PALEONTOLOGIST TELLS TEACHERS OF A 
TIME WHEN THE CREATURES RULED. IN MANY CLASSROOMS, THEY STILL DO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 They came by the thousands to see him, many just to get his autograph. No, 
he's not a blockbuster film director or a baseball superstar. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Bakker is a paleontologist. He's gained national recognition among 
dinosaur fanatics by just doing what he's loved since he was 9 -- learning 
about those huge creatures who haven't been around for a few million years but 
who still kindle the human imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakker looks every bit the dinosaur-lover a la "Jurassic Park," in jeans, bush 
hat, long beard and waist-length ponytail of frizzy, brown hair. He inspired 
and entertained about 5,000 people at the National Science Teachers Assn. 
conference here Friday morning with his maverick theory that dinosaurs actually 
resembled warm-blooded chickens, not the cold-blooded lizards they were named 
after. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakker, known as Dr. Bob to his fans, described dinosaurs as "10,000-pound 
road runners from hell" and "10,000-pound turkeys with attitude."  
</P>
<P>
 "Once you get it in your mind that the dinosaur is like a chicken, it does 
look like a chicken," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His bird argument, based on evaluations of body parts such as toe joints and 
air chambers, isn't new to his legions of followers. Many had heard it before, 
had read his book "Dinosaur Heresies."  
</P>
<P>
 But members of the crowd still vied for front-row seats and applauded warmly 
when he offered his strong opinions on subjects such as cutting the salaries of 
lawyers and the theory of evolution.  
</P>
<P>
 "He looks at so-called truths and says, 'Where's the data to support it?' " 
said Lori Gillam, a middle-school science teacher from Anchorage, Alaska. "And 
a lot of times there isn't data to support it." 
</P>
<P>
 She said she has read and reread "Dinosaur Heresies," which stunned the 
paleontology world when it came out in 1986 and has now been translated into 
Norwegian and Japanese. She was crushed when she missed hearing him speak at a 
previous NSTA conference, and so she made sure not to miss this address at the 
Anaheim Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillam said children of all ages are interested in learning about the 
brontosaurus and Tyrannosaurus rex. That includes her son, Colin, 11, who was 
thrilled when Bakker drew a dinosaur on the back of his T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I want to be a popular teacher, all I have to do is teach a dinosaur class 
and they'll come flocking," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Admirers swarmed Bakker after the lecture, wanting him to explain how to 
estimate a dinosaur's speed from foot and stride measurements -- he referred 
them to a free World Book Inc. handout -- and asked his opinion on whether 
governments are spending enough money on science museums. (He said no.) 
</P>
<P>
 Many paleontologists dismiss his arguments that dinosaurs weren't sluggish and 
cold-blooded as an extreme view not supported by hard research. But Bakker, an 
associate professor at the University of Colorado, says his theory is based on 
forgotten scientific lore from the late 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
 The free handout, "Dr. Bob's Guide to Teaching Dino Science," is a bright 
orange-and-yellow booklet detailing how to dissect a whole chicken in the 
classroom, an exercise that he says shows how the feet, heart and muscles are 
similar to a dinosaur's. The booklet has become popular with science teachers, 
who are always searching for ways to interest kids in science. 
</P>
<P>
 Science teacher Anne Younce of St. Catherine school in Laguna Beach said: "I

WOMAN TESTIFIES ON LIFE'S ROLE IN PALIMONY CASE; COURTS: COMPANION OF 23 YEARS 
ALWAYS ASSURED HER SHE CO-OWNED COMPANY AND INTRODUCED HER AS HIS WIFE, CLAIRE 
MAGLICA SAYS. 
</P>

<P>
 Claire Maglica broke down on the witness stand Friday, tearfully remembering 
the day when the flashlight magnate who was her companion of 23 years told her 
she was neither his wife nor his business partner, but merely his "employee."  
</P>
<P>
 After returning from a business trip in January, 1992, Claire Maglica said, 
she inadvertently learned that Anthony Maglica was trying to transfer company 
stock to his children from a previous marriage.  
</P>
<P>
 Claire Maglica, who contends that Anthony Maglica always assured her she was 
co-owner of the 600-employee Mag Industries Inc., confronted him about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'What business is it of yours?' " Claire Maglica, her voice hoarse 
and breaking, recounted for jurors Friday during the couple's palimony trial. 
"I said, 'I'm your wife,' and he said to me, 'You got a piece of paper to prove 
it?' " 
</P>
<P>
 She said that when she asked him, "If I'm not your wife, then what am I?" he 
retorted, "You're my employee."  
</P>
<P>
 Claire Maglica, 60, took her former lover to trial this week, alleging he 
broke an oral contract they made when they met in 1971 to live out of "one 
pocket" and share everything. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Maglica, 64, counters that the two signed a "separate property 
agreement" in 1977 vowing never to merge their assets. Burned once by divorce, 
he says he was always clear about wanting full control of the company assets, 
along with the many houses they purchased, all of them in his name. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple never married, but lived together for 23 years. She is seeking at 
least $150 million, or what she estimates are half of the assets the wildly 
successful company has accrued during the couple's years together. 
</P>
<P>
 Claire Maglica is executive vice president of the company and Anthony Maglica 
is president. The couple, who lived together in their Anaheim Hills home until 
only last week, are known in Orange County for their contributions to the 
Republican Party and the generosity they showered on a boy blinded by shrapnel 
who they rescued last year from Bosnia. Anthony Maglica spent most of his youth 
in Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 The bulk of Claire's testimony Friday centered on her duties at the 
Ontario-based Mag Industries, where the pair had twin desks in the executive 
office. According to her testimony and Mag Industry letters and memos presented 
to the jury Friday, the couple were the only ones who had the authority to make 
sensitive company decisions, including matters involving patents, trademarks 
and purchasing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, there was nothing done at Mag without my direction and counsel," 
Claire Maglica told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they never married, she also testified that Anthony Maglica always 
introduced her as his wife and that the media showered them with attention for 
starting a "Mom and Pop" empire. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Maglica has filed a cross-complaint alleging she embezzled more than 
$380,000 from him by secretly setting up a joint bank account, pilfering his 
checks from the household mail and forging his signature to deposit them in the 
account. She then used the money to buy clothing and jewelry for herself and 
gifts for her children and grandchildren, also from a previous marriage, 
according to his attorney, Dennis M. Wasser. 
</P>
<P>
 Years ago, Claire took on Anthony Maglica's name and the couple was known -- 
by presidents from here to Croatia, socialites and politicians -- as Mr. and 
Mrs. Maglica. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Maglica never corrected anyone for referring to Claire as his wife or 
co-owner of Mag and, in fact, did so himself, said her attorney, John W. Keker. 
</P>
<P>
 Claire Maglica said Anthony never mentioned the 1977 written agreement until 
after their relationship began deteriorating in 1992. She said she signed a 
document in 1977, but believed it said they would be legally married at some 
point. 
</P>
<P>
 Common-law marriage is not recognized in California, but palimony cases have 
been decided on the basis of whether a contract or agreement between the couple 
existed and was not honored. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial resumes Monday before Orange County Superior Court Judge Robert J. 
Polis and is being shown live on Courtroom Television Network.

ONE YOUTH CHARGED IN MURDER OF STUDENTS; CRIME: RAYMOND BUTLER COULD FACE THE 
DEATH PENALTY IN SLAYING OF TWO JAPANESE TEEN-AGERS. OFFICIALS SAY ALBERTO 
REYGOZA'S INVOLVEMENT IS LESS THAN AT FIRST BELIEVED.

<P>
 Murder charges that carry a possible death penalty were filed Friday against a 
suspect in the killings of two college students from Japan. Another man, whose 
involvement in the case is said to be less than originally thought, was charged 
as an accessory after the fact. 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond Oscar Butler, 18, is accused of shooting the two students to death -- 
charged by the Los Angeles County district attorney's office with two counts of 
murder, two counts of robbery and two counts of carjacking. 
</P>
<P>
 The possible death penalty stems from special circumstance allegations that 
last week's fatal shootings of Takuma Ito and Go Matsuura, both 19, occurred 
during a robbery and constituted a multiple murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Alberto Vasquez Reygoza, 20, is charged with one count of being an accessory 
after the fact and one count of receiving stolen property. Each count carries a 
maximum penalty of three years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The appearance of the two men in court Friday was their first since their 
arrests Wednesday night. Their arraignment -- during which they would enter 
pleas -- had been scheduled, but it was continued until April 12 to give 
defense attorneys more time to prepare cases. 
</P>
<P>
 For Friday's brief proceedings, Butler was represented by Deputy Public 
Defender Stanley Perlo and Reygoza was represented by court-appointed attorney 
John B. Schmocker. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge James B. Pierce ordered Butler held without bail. Bail 
for Reygoza was set at $45,000. 
</P>
<P>
 During a short news conference after Friday's court appearances, Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Janet Moore and the two defense attorneys declined to reveal details of 
the attack or to discuss the roles of each defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore, who will prosecute the case, said Butler was not alone when the attack 
took place. Schmocker said it "is a fair assumption" that Reygoza was not 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 Reygoza's involvement was "much less than was originally suspected," Moore 
said. "In order to charge Mr. Reygoza with murder he would have to have been 
either a perpetrator or an accomplice. The evidence does not support either of 
those determinations." 
</P>
<P>
 Count 7 of the eight-count complaint filed Friday states that Reygoza "did 
harbor, conceal and aid" Butler "with the intent that he might avoid and escape 
. . . arrest, trial, conviction and punishment." 
</P>
<P>
 Count 8 accuses Reygoza of receiving stolen property, including a "camera, car 
radio installation, clothing and miscellaneous personal items." 
</P>
<P>
 Moore declined to comment on whether Reygoza will testify against Butler. Los 
Angeles police say Ito and Matsuura were shot in the head at close range about 
11 p.m. March 25 as they got out of a car in the parking lot of a Ralphs 
supermarket in San Pedro. Police say the suspects planned to rob the students 
and took the car on impulse. 
</P>
<P>
 Declared brain-dead soon after the attack, the young men -- students at 
Marymount College in Rancho Palos Verdes -- were taken off life-support systems 
at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center and pronounced dead Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The attack reinforced a growing perception overseas that Los Angeles is a 
hotbed of violence, and the crime generated headlines in newspapers, lead 
stories on television, concern among Japanese officials and reassurances from 
U.S. dignitaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Sunday, acting on a tip, police found the stolen car -- stripped of its 
stereo system -- near where the students were shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives said evidence from the car and information from witnesses led them 
to the two suspects, who were kept under 24-hour surveillance for two days as 
investigators continued to build the case against them. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler and Reygoza, both said by police to be gang members, were arrested late 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 At midmorning Friday, detectives placed the two handcuffed suspects into 
unmarked police cars at the LAPD's Parker Center headquarters for the trip to 
the courthouse in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler, who wore a blue T-shirt and baggy black shorts, stared at the ground 
as a dozen TV news cameras photographed the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He ignored questions shouted by reporters asking whether he had killed the 
students. But as he sat in the car, he told reporters through an open window: 
"Go easy on my parents, all right?" 
</P>
<P>
 Reygoza, who followed Butler down the ramp and into another car, shook his 
head "no" to questions from reporters asking whether he committed the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The two young men showed up in Long Beach Superior Court shortly after 1:30 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Reygoza saw several familiar faces in the audience and smiled at them. Butler 
scanned the crowd but did not react. 
</P>
<P>
 After Pierce granted Perlo's request for a continuance, the judge asked the 
defendants if that was all right with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, sir," each of them replied before being led out of the courtroom.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; RIPLEY'S BUYS MAN'S HINDENBURG MODEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A scale model of the ill-fated German zeppelin, the Hindenburg, built in the 
garage of a man here is being purchased by Ripley's Believe It or Not! museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Vern Koenig spent about 3,000 hours building the model. What "started out as a 
challenge" ended up as a labor of love that took four years, the 50-year-old 
Koenig said. 
</P>
<P>
 The professional model-maker and aviation enthusiast said he became fascinated 
with the Hindenburg's past as one of the largest luxury airships ever flown. 
Built in 1935, the blimp crashed May 6, 1937, at a naval air station in 
Lakehurst, N.J., killing 36 people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of all the airships, the Hindenburg had the prettiest line. She was a 
draftsman's delight because of her curvatures," said Koenig, who built the 
model in his Norwalk garage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a beautiful piece of work," said Mark Edwards, general manager of 
Ripley's and the Movieland Wax Museum. "There's not another one like it." 
</P>
<P>
 The scale model, which is 16 feet, 9 inches long, has a 32-inch diameter and 
weighs 175 pounds, will be unveiled today in a noon ceremony at Movieland Wax 
Museum, 7711 Beach Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 The actual Hindenburg was 852 feet long, more than 14 stories tall and carried 
about 100 passengers, Koenig said. Koenig will be presented a check for $20,000 
at the ceremony, Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
 The unveiling is part of daylong festivities at Movieland to kick off the 
local tourist season. Also featured will be an exotic car show, knights and 
Indian dancers. The event will be held from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. in the parking 
lot and is free to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Koenig said he didn't start out building the model in 1987 -- the 50th 
anniversary of the Hindenburg disaster -- with an intention to sell it. He had 
hoped to donate it to an aviation museum. But when Ripley's was interested, 
Koenig was thrilled. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, it's a feather in my cap to be recognized by Ripley's," he said, 
adding that he is a fan of the famed museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards said the scale model will be on exhibit at the Buena Park museum until 
mid-April. Then plans are to fly the model to Thailand to display at Ripley's 
newest museum there, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hindenburg model is expected to make the rounds to other Ripley's museums 
worldwide, he said. DEBRA CANOS BELIEVE IT OR NOT! MUSEUM.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; NOISE-LOWERING PLAN FOR SHOPPING CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rossmoor Center officials hope to complete renovations to the shopping plaza's 
back parking lot by the summer in an effort to reduce noise that is bothering 
nearby residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The shopping center plans to add landscaping and traffic islands to the 
blacktop lot, which is located near the SuperSaver 7 movie theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents who live in nearby condominiums have long complained that noisy 
theater patrons talk loudly and honk their horns in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials hope the new design will reduce noise levels by making it more 
difficult for patrons to drive through the lot without having to make stops or 
turns. 
</P>
<P>
 "It kind of channels traffic and keeps it away from the condos," said Lee 
Whittenberg, Seal Beach's planning director. 
</P>
<P>
 The new design, including the addition of trees and grass, will mean the loss 
of about 70 parking spaces, Whittenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 The planning department is expected to approve the center's plans within the 
next few weeks. Construction could begin in May and be completed by June. 
</P>
<P>
 Several ideas have been discussed for reducing noise. One suggestion -- to 
erect fiberglass panels between the condos and the parking lot -- was rejected 
because it would cost too much. 
</P>
<P>
 Rossmoor Center management has tried to reduce noise by posting security 
guards in the back lot. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; TRAILER STIRS INTEREST IN ARCHEOLOGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Inside a 60-foot trailer decorated to resemble a typical Southern California 
canyon, Liz Lamarre, 12, plunged her plastic trowel into a small plot of earth 
and began looking for historic artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
 After rooting around unsuccessfully for a few moments, she cried out, "Oh, I 
did find something!" and pulled out an abalone shell. 
</P>
<P>
 Liz was one of about 30 students at Frank N. Eastwood Elementary School who 
became amateur archeologists on Friday as part of a program run by the Los 
Angeles County Natural History Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the "Earth Mobile," which was decorated with artificial rocky terrain, 
mounted coyotes, rabbits and other native fauna, students used magnifying 
glasses, tape measures and scales to study and catalogue their finds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found an arrowhead and a gopher's jaw," said Ryan Fussell, 12. "It was fun 
because we were experimenting and learning about new stuff we've never seen 
before." 
</P>
<P>
 Since Monday, about 600 students have gone through the program, which 
Principal Ed Kissee praised as an excellent teaching tool. 
</P>
<P>
 "My theory is that if children get their hands dirty, they learn a little 
more," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Abraham, a museum educator who visits schools with the trailer, said the 
program is an ideal way to reach students and motivate them to learn. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all hands-on, so it's very exciting for them. When they leave, they all 
want to be archeologists or scientists," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that the trailer also provides a great way for schools to offer fun, 
educational activities for their students without having to leave the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Schools have had so much money cut from their budgets they really can't 
afford field trips to the museum, so we bring the museum to them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a good way to get people interested" in a subject some people 
consider dull, said Colin Popadiuk, 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Colin said he's thinking about archeology as a career because history is 
interesting. He added, "It would really be nice to make an amazing discovery 
that people didn't know before about the past." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelley King, 11, who had just dug up an animal vertebra, said, "I think this 
is exciting." 
</P>
<P>
 Archeology is more fun than she expected, she said. "When you read about it in 
a book, it seems so boring, (but this) whole thing is really cool," she 
said.JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; AFFORDABLE HOUSING AID ON CITY AGENDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council on Monday will consider giving financial aid to the owner of 
an apartment complex on Utica Avenue so that housing units can be rented solely 
to low-income families. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal calls for the city to provide a $100,000 grant for landscaping, 
security lighting and reconstructing carports.In addition, the city would 
extend a $466,000 rehabilitation loan to the complex's owner, Associates Nine. 
</P>
<P>
 The apartment complex is at 725-733 Utica Ave. It consists of 36 two-bedroom 
rental units. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed agreement, the owner would be obligated to keep the rents 
affordable to low-income families for the next 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 For several years, the city has been under pressure of state law to add more 
low-cost housing. State law requires cities using redevelopment funds to set 
aside certain percentages of land and money for low-cost housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the city has authorized redevelopment in various areas, it is obligated 
to create more affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say that the financial aid to the apartment complex owner would 
also help in the rehabilitation of the formerly crime-plagued Florida-Utica 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Adams, the city's director of special projects, said in a recent memo to 
the City Council that the Florida-Utica area is on the upswing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The area has been steadily improving during the past two years due to the 
cooperative efforts of several city departments," Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A planned street improvement project will begin throughout the area within 45 
days, further adding to the enhancement effort," he said. "Rehabilitation of 
725 Utica will dramatically change the character of this neighborhood and at 
the same time contribute to the (city's low-cost) housing obligation."BILL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; NEIGHBOR SUED OVER VIDEOTAPE OF WOMAN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A woman filed a lawsuit this week against her neighbor, alleging he stood at 
his window and secretly videotaped her while she was undressed in the living 
room of her townhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephanie Saltikov is seeking unspecified monetary damages from Marvin 
Summers, contending that he invaded her privacy and intentionally and 
negligently caused her "severe mental anguish and emotional and physical 
distress." 
</P>
<P>
 Her lawyer, Mitchell F. Kaufman of Sherman Oaks, said it was too early to 
comment on the lawsuit, filed Wednesday in Orange County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Summers could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The allegations came to the attention of police detectives in January when 
Summers' wife brought them the offending videotape, Lt. Chuck Poe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives turned the case over to prosecutors in the district attorney's 
office, who declined to press criminal charges since Summers apparently made 
the videotape from his own home, Poe said. 
</P>
<P>
 A person would have to be trespassing on private property for a misdemeanor 
count of disorderly conduct involving peeping to be filed, according to the 
district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendant's wife, Cathi, declined to talk about her neighbor's lawsuit, 
except to say she had brought the videotape to police in the hopes of getting 
her husband help. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our system messed up big time," she said.ANNA CEKOLA

<P>
 The Planning Commission has approved a plan to bulldoze 20 homes, two 
businesses and a church to realign McFadden Avenue at Main Street, an area that 
suffers severe rush-hour congestion. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission approved the $6-million plan unanimously at its regular meeting 
this week. The City Council will consider the plan on April 18. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff proposed the plan to improve traffic flow and pedestrian safety 
through the intersection. Without the realignment, increased traffic would 
create gridlock -- with cars unable to move in any direction through the 
intersection -- during peak hours by 2005, said project manager David 
Biondolillo. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to push traffic to the arterials and keep it off the residential 
streets. We're getting pretty extreme congestion on those streets at the peak 
hours," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The streets of most intersections are perpendicular, allowing cars to travel 
straight across an intersecting street. But the intersection of McFadden Avenue 
and Main Street is dog-legged. 
</P>
<P>
 To cross the intersection, cars traveling east or west along McFadden must 
turn onto Main Street for a short distance before turning back onto McFadden. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed plan, a diagonal segment of road would be built to connect 
the two stretches of McFadden. That way, cars traveling along McFadden would be 
able to cross Main Street without interruption. 
</P>
<P>
 They could then continue along McFadden as it bends toward the southeast to 
connect with the current intersection of Orange Avenue and McFadden. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the project is going to be a great benefit to the community. Without 
the project, we know that the (intersection) will be dysfunctional by the year 
2005" because cars backing up at the left turn pockets on Main will choke off 
traffic in all directions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city would have to acquire about 20 homes, two businesses and the Iglesia 
de Jesucristo Church at 307 E. McFadden Ave. for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (the project) is a good idea," said Robert Moreno, 32, who rents a 
home on Cypress Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he said, some of his neighbors "are very upset. They put a lot of 
money into their homes and the city just tells them to leave. My neighbor just 
put a new roof on his house." 
</P>
<P>
 Javier Carrasco, 24, who owns his home on Cypress, said he opposed the project 
but could accept it if the city offers appropriate compensation for moving. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they're going to do it, they should give you a reasonable price" and help 
move displaced residents to comparable homes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the City Council approves it, the project would take about three years to 
complete. JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; RABBITS ARE NOT FOR PET-HOPPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tabby likes to kiss his owner's nose and toes, snuggle up with Ethel the cat 
and hop up and down the stairs of his Santa Ana home. The lop-eared, calico 
rabbit, like many pet rabbits, uses a litter box and lives inside the house -- 
not in a back-yard hutch. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're wonderful, very sociable animals," said Tabby's owner, Karen Lanigan. 
"He gives so much back." 
</P>
<P>
 When Lanigan got Tabby a year ago, she said she made a commitment to make him 
a permanent member of the family. She is not alone. Other members of the Orange 
County chapter of House Rabbit Society said owning these domesticated animals 
is not a short-term commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the House Rabbit Society, which educates people about the proper 
care of rabbits and rescues abandoned rabbits, say that at Easter people buy 
bunnies without realizing that they will grow up to be adult rabbits that need 
love, care and patience like any other house pet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Often they decide later that Fluffy is no longer cute then they dump them in 
a park or a shopping center and abandon them or they take them to a shelter," 
said Laura Shortall, manager of the local chapter. 
</P>
<P>
 People usually do not realize that they can train rabbits to use a litter box 
and can spay or neuter them, and that they make good companions, said Laurie 
Gigous, the assistant chapter manager who lives in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Marie Hulett-Curtner, spokeswoman for Orange County animal control, said 
people often impulsively buy not only rabbits, but also chicks and ducklings at 
this time of year. "If you're going out (and buying) on impulse for the 
holidays, just get a stuffed animal instead, because we're talking about a 
living creature," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She also said stores that do not sell rabbits, chicks and ducklings all year 
may not legally sell them at Easter. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine prohibits the sale of these animals at any time, said Carl Pagano, 
superintendent for Irvine Animal Services. The city's animal shelter also will 
not make rabbits available for adoption from March 20 to April 8. 
</P>
<P>
 House Rabbit Society members also said that people who want a rabbit should 
consider getting an adult animal, since younger ones can be mischievous while 
going through the teen-age years (from about 3 months old to 1 1/2 years). 
</P>
<P>
 The local House Rabbit Society has about 50 rabbits in foster homes available 
for adoption. For a $45 donation, new owners, who are screened, get a healthy, 
litter box-trained rabbit that has been spayed or neutered. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason we screen is we've raised these rabbits and they live in our 
houses and we've come to love them," Gigous said. "It's almost like giving up a 
child. We want them to have the best home." Caring for Rabbits 
</P>
<P>
 * Food: Limit to only fresh rabbit food pellets, fresh water and alfalfa, oats 
or barley. Only give small quantities of treats, vegetables (carrot tops, 
broccoli, mint), fruits (apples and bananas) and grains (rolled oats), to 
rabbits 3 months and older. 
</P>
<P>
 * Litter: Do not use cedar or pine shavings in litter box or cage, since such 
materials can cause liver disease. Only use dust-free, organic litter. 
</P>
<P>
 * Neutering: Male rabbits should be neutered at 3 1/2 months old; females at 4 
months of age. 
</P>
<P>
 * Grooming: Groom rabbits with a flea comb and brush away excess hair. Rabbits 
shed their coats four times a year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cage: If using a cage, make sure it is roomy and cover part of the cage 
floor with cardboard, wood or carpet for comfort. 
</P>
<P>
 * Privacy: Offer a quiet, safe retreat for rabbits to hide in and to be alone, 
such as a cardboard box or untreated wooden box.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; CITY TO HELP UPGRADE POLICE RADIO SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has agreed to pay the city's share of a project that will 
upgrade the police radio dispatch system in South County, put more deputies on 
the street and continue a successful anti-graffiti law enforcement program. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Sheriff's Lt. Randy Blair said the current system slows down the 
number of calls for deputies; the new equipment will mean quicker response 
times.Having more air time will also allow the city to put more police on the 
street, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members strongly back spending $113,000 for the first year of what 
will be a three-year upgrade project. The next two years, expenses are expected 
to be about $61,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can throw all kinds of bodies at a problem, but if you don't have the 
equipment to man, the situation won't be solved," said Councilman Joseph D. 
Lowe, who is a captain in the Orange County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the project will cost about $281,000 in the first year, which will 
include the hiring of 10 dispatchers to cover the South County area. The 
Sheriff's Department has contracts to provide police service in all of South 
County with the exception of Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also agreed to spend $200,000 to hire more deputies and continue a 
successful anti-graffiti program.FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; MORE STUDY ORDERED ON MAUSOLEUM PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents of Spyglass Hill and surrounding neighborhoods fear their 
picturesque ocean vistas will be marred if a nearby cemetery is allowed to 
expand. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific View Memorial Park wants to build a new chapel, offices, a funeral 
home and six mausoleums on the site. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 50 residents protested the proposal at this week's City Council 
meeting. The council sent the proposal back to the Planning Department for 
further study but it is unlikely the expansion plan will be adopted as 
presently proposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the city's general plan, the cemetery is allowed to build up to 50,000 
square feet of floor space. The expansion proposal would exceed that limit, 
said James D. Hewicker, Newport Beach's planning director. 
</P>
<P>
 The council directed planners to prepare an amendment to the general plan. The 
amendment would further restrict where cemetery structures could be built as 
well as create new height limits and setback requirements, Hewicker said. The 
new amendment would continue to restrict the park to 50,000 square feet of 
floor space. 
</P>
<P>
 City planners are expected to take two months to complete the amendment, which 
then must be approved by the Planning Commission and City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents were disappointed by the council's action and hoped the 
cemetery's plan would have been rejected on Monday. Council members stressed 
that their decision does not mean that they endorse the cemetery's plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of Spyglass Hill, Seaview and Spyglass Ridge are concerned that the 
proposed expansion would detract from their views and hurt property values. 
Some residents also fear the mausoleums would be erected too close to their 
back yards.SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; SWEEP AT APARTMENT RESULTS IN 27 ARRESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Police raided a westside apartment complex this week and arrested 27 people 
from 17 units primarily on charges of selling cocaine and methamphetamine from 
their residences, officers said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 During Thursday's raid of the El Fortin Garden Apartments at 201 S. Magnolia 
Ave., six people were arrested on charges of selling drugs, 15 on suspicion of 
possession of drugs with the intent to sell, two on charges of possession of 
drug paraphernalia, two on charges of parole violations, one on a charge of 
auto theft and one was charged with forgery, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The complex has been a source of neighborhood complaints about drug dealing, 
officers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to send a message to the people of the complex that we are going to 
aggressively fight any criminal activity that occurs there," said Lt. Stephen. 
</P>
<P>
 H. Sain, head of the vice/narcotics bureau. "We are going to take back the 
complex." 
</P>
<P>
 The building's owner, Lyman David Wright, 44, of Laguna Beach, refused to 
comment at length Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want any bad publicity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the problems, Sain said, is that the residents allow relatives to take 
a room in order to pay the rent. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the problems are not caused by the people who live there," Sain 
said. "Sometimes the problems are caused by people who just stayed over the 
night before. In many of the cases, the tenant is a single mother who is 
letting a cousin take a room, and it is the cousin who is committing the 
crimes." TERRY SPENCER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; 13 PEOPLE ARRESTED IN RAID AT COASTAL INN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Police arrested 13 people this week in a raid at a local motel, taking them 
into custody over suspected drug, weapons and warrant violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa Police Sgt. Matt Collett said a monthlong investigation of the 
Coastal Inn was initiated because of complaints from residents about the motel 
at 2374 Newport Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 Collett said 23 officers took part in the Wednesday evening raid, circling the 
motel about 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 A part-time manager at the motel said Friday said she was not allowed to talk 
about the arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office on Friday charged Laura Arredondo, 32, of Costa 
Mesa and Terri Rauch, 44, of Costa Mesa with the alleged sale of narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
 Charges have not yet been filed against the other people arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Lee Howe, 36, of Costa Mesa was arrested on suspicion of possession of 
illegal needles. Miles Crossen, 38, of Costa Mesa was arrested on suspicion of 
possession of a sawed-off shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
 Catherine Herbert, 31, of Huntington Beach and Sandra Christensen, 45, of 
Costa Mesa was arrested on suspicion of possession of narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrested on outstanding warrants were Shelli Firsich, 32, of Santa Ana and 
Matthew Depiano, 40, Gary Hall, 40, James Cobb, 25, James Zugay, 44, Joan

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; AIRPORT BACKERS GATHERING PETITIONS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With $100,000 pledged for the first phase of their campaign, supporters of a 
commercial airport at El Toro Marine Corps Air Station began circulating 
petitions Friday to place the issue on the Nov. 8 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The airport proponents have until June 1 to collect 66,703 valid signatures -- 
a task that they say is formidable because of the short time frame allowed to 
qualify the initiative for a countywide vote. 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents say they are worried that enough signatures will be gathered 
because the campaign is backed by some of Orange County's most powerful 
business leaders, including Newport Beach businessman George L. Argyros and 
Marion Knott, a partner in Knott's Berry Farm. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a special-interest campaign, and there's no question that the special 
interests are very well-funded," Laguna Hills Councilman Randal J. Bressette 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Bressette said he believes Orange County voters will study the 
proposed initiative and reject it in favor of the more methodical county 
planning process now underway to determine the best use for the 4,700-acre 
base, which is scheduled to close by 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot believe that our friends in Leisure World (of Laguna Hills) are 
going to take this initiative process quietly or lightly," Bressette said. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills Councilwoman Melody Carruth said airport opponents in South 
County who live closest to the base probably would not organize to stymie the 
petition-gathering campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that our energy may best be spent during the actual campaign" before 
the November election, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove Councilman Mark Leyes, who will be involved in the pro-airport 
campaign, said that pro-airport volunteers would also seek signatures from 
South County voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Political consultant Dave Ellis said about a dozen volunteers will be 
stationed at retail centers in Costa Mesa, Huntington Beach and Newport Beach 
this weekend, while about 20 paid workers will fan out across other areas of 
the county in search of signatures. GEBE MARTINEZ

FREEBIES ARE FEW NOW FOR SUPERVISORS; REFORM: FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FROM BOARD 
MEMBERS SHOW DRAMATIC DROP IN NUMBER OF GIFTS AS THE RESULT OF A TOUGH NEW 
COUNTY ORDINANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County supervisors ate fewer free meals, played much less golf and 
accepted far fewer tokens of appreciation after the county adopted its strict 
gift ordinance last June, according to financial statements filed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The statements, which traditionally have provided a curious snapshot of 
off-stage political influence peddling, were much abbreviated this year. No 
tickets to the Rams or Angels. No bottles of champagne. 
</P>
<P>
 And noticeably absent were the names of the high-powered lobbyists whose 
annual displays of generosity used to fill pages of gift lists in years past. 
</P>
<P>
 Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley accepted more in meals and gifts 
-- $1,595.32 -- than any of his colleagues, yet all but $301 worth were amassed 
before the county's gift restrictions took effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the other supervisors, Harriett M. Wieder reported a total of $640 in 
gifts, with $500 accepted before the gift law; Gaddi H. Vasquez, $529 in gifts 
and $1,200 in honorariums for college commencement speeches (of those totals, 
$138 in gifts and all of the speech fees were accepted before the new 
ordinance); William G. Steiner, $50, all accepted prior to the new law; and 
Roger R. Stanton reported no gifts for the entire year. 
</P>
<P>
 With only limited exceptions, Orange County's gift ordinance bans all gifts 
from companies or individuals that have had business before the county in the 
past year or have attempted to influence a county decision during that time. 
</P>
<P>
 The law provides for criminal misdemeanor penalties for violations by either 
public officials or gift givers. 
</P>
<P>
 The law is the legacy of former Supervisor Don R. Roth, who was convicted on 
state ethics violations last year. He failed to report thousands of dollars in 
gifts of home landscaping, meals and other favors from those who did business 
with the county. 
</P>
<P>
 In Riley's case, at least half of the amount accepted after the law took 
effect came while he was hospitalized late last year with a foot ailment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a few flowers and some things while I was in the hospital," Riley said. 
"I don't see any problems. I wouldn't have accepted them if I did." 
</P>
<P>
 Shirley Grindle, a local political reform activist who helped write the new 
law, said the supervisors' gift statements reflect a "dramatic change in 
political lifestyles." 
</P>
<P>
 "I would be interested in knowing if they are losing any weight," Grindle 
said. "Nothing can stop them from going to dinner, but these days they pretty 
much have to pick up their own tabs. I would imagine you're seeing some slimmer

</P>
<P>
 The apparent reform movement seems to have spread to Anaheim, where city 
officials and City Council members in past years routinely accepted thousands 
of dollars in free tickets to Disneyland. Last year, relatively few gifts from 
the theme park or other sources were accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 One notable exception, however, was Public Utility General Manager Edward K. 
Aghjayan. He accepted 14 golf outings worth $1,010. Half the rounds were played 
during weekday hours. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the rounds, which were generally paid for by investment bankers and 
electrical consultants, were "all business-related" and many occurred during 
business conferences.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's an opportunity for them to make a pitch or introduce themselves," he 
said. "I'd rather meet with them on a golf course than in some office where 
they're pointing to a blackboard." 
</P>
<P>
 Since all contracts are competitively bid in the city, he said he did not 
think his golfing partners were buying any undo influence. 
</P>
<P>
 "They know they're not going to buy you for $50," said Aghjayan, who plays to 
a 16 handicap. "I'm not giving them any favoritism."

CHAPMAN WINS REVERSAL OF $1.15-MILLION WRONGFUL TERMINATION SUIT; RULING: 
APPEALS COURT FINDS UNIVERSITY NOT GUILTY OF SEXUAL DISCRIMINATION AND OTHER 
ALLEGATIONS STEMMING FROM THE FIRING OF A FACULTY MEMBER.

<P>
 The 4th District Court of Appeal has reversed a jury's decision to award $1.15 
million to a former faculty member at Chapman University who accused the 
institution of sexual discrimination and wrongful termination. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's court decision found that Chapman was not guilty of numerous 
allegations, including sexual discrimination and violating the California 
Constitution, when it fired Margaret Murphy in 1986 after contract negotiations 
with the sports medicine professor faltered. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy, who holds a doctorate in exercise physiology and taught sports 
medicine at Chapman, alleged that the school backed out of a contract at the 
last moment. A jury agreed, and awarded her the money in 1992. Chapman appealed 
the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy said the school wanted to oust her for her outspokenness on campus on 
behalf of faculty issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's ruling found Chapman guilty of breach of contract. The court also 
ruled that the private university in Orange owed Murphy the amount of the 
five-year contract, plus other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger H. Schnapp, a trustee of Chapman and an employment law attorney, said 
the new award has yet to be calculated and could be somewhere around $100,000 
or less, partly because Murphy found a higher paying job after leaving Chapman. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an overwhelming victory for Chapman," Schnapp said. "We are very 
satisfied." 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy, who is director of occupational medicine at Parkview Hospital in 
Riverside, said, "I'm incensed. For the appeals court to overturn what 13 
jurors unanimously agreed upon bothers me a lot. What's the point of a jury 
trial if an appeal court, working in the sanctity of their chambers, can wipe 
out a jury's decision?" 
</P>
<P>
 James L. Doti, president of Chapman, was also pleased with the court decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a great day for Chapman University. It's a great relief to have that 
million-dollar verdict which was a real cloud over our heads removed," Doti 
said.

5 MEMBERS OF GANG HELD IN FATAL STABBING

 Five members of a Placentia gang have been arrested in connection with the 
fatal stabbing of a Fullerton gang member during a brawl Thursday afternoon, 
police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ricky Michaels, 18, of Placentia was stabbed several times in the chest during 
the fight which broke out about 4:45 p.m. in the courtyard of an apartment 
complex in the 3100 block of Pearl Drive, said Sgt. Danny Becerra. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrested at their homes in Placentia late Thursday night and Friday afternoon 
were: Rene Ramon Castro, 26, Johnny Richard Martinez, 18, Jose Luis Villanueva, 
19, Trinidad Villanueva, 24, and a 17-year-old male. 
</P>
<P>
 The adults were arrested without incident and taken to Fullerton city jail. 
The 17-year-old was taken to Orange County Juvenile Hall. All are being held on 
suspicion of murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Words had been exchanged between the two gangs at the apartment complex 
earlier in the day, police said. The Placentia gang left but returned and began 
a fistfight a short time later. Three people were stabbed during the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Michaels died about 45 minutes after being taken to the hospital. Charles 
Ernest Matthews, 20, of Placentia and a 17-year-old male from Anaheim were 
stabbed in the torso, but their injuries are not life-threatening. All are 
admitted gang members, Becerra said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These particular street gangs have not demonstrated hostility toward each 
other in the past," Becerra said. "They all seemed to get along because they 
live in the same area."MURDERS

TRUCK CRASHES INTO BREA RESTAURANT; ACCIDENT: EATERY WAS SHOWERED WITH GLASS 
AND A PREGNANT CUSTOMER WAS AMONG THE INJURED. DRIVER SAID VEHICLE'S THROTTLE

 A truck crashed into a fast-food restaurant on Friday, dumping a shower of 
glass on customers and seriously injuring a pregnant woman, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver, Harry Tien, 39, of Alhambra, told police his truck's throttle 
became stuck as he tried to turn at the intersection of Puente and Central 
avenues at 5:30 p.m.  
</P>
<P>
 His truck went over the curb, up a small embankment and then slammed into 
John's Place at 1201 W. Central Ave., police said. 
</P>
<P>
 A pregnant woman, identified only as Shelly Duncan, was eating at the 
restaurant and was struck in the head by a tire, according to Nancy Rohmberg , 
spokeswoman at UCI Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Duncan was airlifted to the medical center and is listed in guarded but stable 
condition in the labor and delivery ward. Rohmberg said she will remain 
overnight for observation. 
</P>
<P>
 Five other customers received minor cuts from glass and were treated by 
paramedics at the scene, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Nativo, a frequent customer of the restaurant, said he had just come in 
through a back door when he heard a loud bang. 
</P>
<P>
 "I come up front and looked and there's a car sitting on top of the booth," 
Nativo said. He said he and others immediately evacuated people from the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were really surprised but stayed pretty calm. Everyone left calmly and 
orderly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nativo said the driver seemed "shook up" and mentioned a "mechanical failure" 
with his car. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's real lucky this didn't happen an hour later," Nativo said. "This place 
would have been a lot more crowded, and more people would've been hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 Police did not arrest the driver.

METROLINK USE PLUMMETS AS FREE RIDES END; TRANSPORTATION: THE DROP IN RIDERS 
WAS EXPECTED, OFFICIALS SAY, AND THE NUMBERS WHO STAYED TO PAY EXCEEDED 
EXPECTATIONS.

 The free ride is over. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink fares went into effect on commuter rides between Los Angeles and 
Orange County on Friday and ridership nose-dived. 
</P>
<P>
 The free rides had been offered since Monday, when Metrolink launched the 
Orange County line, to attract riders and let them "test-ride our trains, see 
what it's all about, risk-free," said Francisco Oaxaca, a Metrolink spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Some 4,750 people rode each day, but once riders had to pay an average of $12 
per round trip at Orange County stations in San Juan Capistrano, Irvine, Santa 
Ana, Orange, Anaheim and Fullerton, ridership dropped by about half. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, 1,318 people took the train in the morning, and about as many rode 
it again at night, said Metrolink spokesman Peter Hidalgo. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the numbers exceeded expectations that about a third of the 
passengers who rode free would continue riding when they had to pay.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're extremely encouraged by the results, that more people came back than we 
expected," Hidalgo said. Those who don't come back are often just exploring the 
new rail line, Oaxaca said. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers also are encouraging because Fridays are usually slow days, and 
this Friday some people may have stayed home to observe Good Friday, Hidalgo 
added.  
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink retained twice as many passengers on the Orange County line when the 
free rides were over as it did when it launched its line last June in the less 
populous Riverside area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We attribute this to the fact that Orange County is familiar with rail 
travel," having had the service of the Orange County Transportation Authority's 
line, Hidalgo said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Metrolink took over OCTA's service, which averaged 400 passengers 
on its once-daily run from San Juan Capistrano to Los Angeles. The takeover 
project cost $218 million, which included purchasing the track and other 
equipment and improving upon what was already there, Oaxaca said. 
</P>
<P>
 Train service runs roughly parallel to the Santa Ana Freeway for 87 miles from 
Oceanside to Los Angeles only during rush hour, but officials say the schedule 
eventually may include midday and evening trains.

STARSHIPPER LANDS ON HIS FEET ON 'HIGHWAY'; POP MUSIC: CRAIG CHAQUICO, WHO 
PLAYS THE COACH HOUSE TONIGHT, TOOK OFF WITH GRACE SLICK AND FRIENDS. NOW HE'S 
ON A NEW AGE ROAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A few years ago, after spending virtually his entire adult life in one job, 
Craig Chaquico found himself looking for a new career direction. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1974 to 1990, Chaquico had a lucrative and secure gig as lead guitarist 
for Jefferson Starship (later just Starship). The Bay Area band, which began as 
an offshoot of the '60s countercultural icon Jefferson Airplane, scored 13 gold 
and platinum albums during a tenure marked by stylistic shifts and frequent 
personnel shake-ups. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaquico (the name is of Portuguese derivation) had joined the band when he 
was in his teens and was the only member who played on every Starship record. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, he left Starship, which had spent the '80s as a popular, if 
critically derided, exponent of the slick, metal-tinged style that came to be 
labeled "corporate rock." 
</P>
<P>
 Chaquico's first instinct was to try more of the same. He launched another 
hard- rock band, Big Bad Wolf, but found that record labels weren't interested. 
Then his wife, Kimberly, became pregnant, and Chaquico decided it was time to 
tone it down. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in many years, he set aside the electric guitar and started 
plucking an acoustic around the house because, as the cheerful rocker put it 
over the phone recently from his home in Marin County, "it seemed like the 
natural thing. You got the vibe that the acoustic guitar was more conducive to 
the pregnancy." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time his wife gave birth in 1991 to their first child, a son named 
Kyle, Chaquico had his new direction. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is his first solo album, "Acoustic Highway," an all-instrumental 
record that has done well on the New Age charts since its release last fall. 
Chaquico and his three-member band will play tonight at the Coach House in San 
Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaquico, an enthusiastic, upbeat talker, said he didn't have to go far to 
find inspiration for the album's nine compositions, most of them evocations of 
scenes and feelings that unfold in the day-trips he loves to take through 
Northern California on a Harley-Davidson motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
 The music places a premium on lyrical melodies, active rhythms and the 
rippling, glistening, fluid tones that Chaquico and his collaborator, Ozzie 
Ahlers, got by processing his steel-string acoustic guitar through electronic 
effects. 
</P>
<P>
 The lead-off track, "Mountain in the Mist," gives his musical impression of 
Mt. Tamalpais, the Marin County landmark whose peak he can see from the window 
of his home studio in Mill Valley. (Looking in another direction, Chaquico can 
see Sammy Hagar's house, a vista that, perhaps fortunately, has not inspired 
any music to date.) 
</P>
<P>
 Another song, "Angel Tears," began when a thunderstorm broke out and 
frightened his infant son. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grabbed a guitar and started playing happy music so he would see it was OK, 
and it soothed him," Chaquico said. "I said to myself, 'Whatever it was, I want 
to use it as a song.' " The dancing, glistening theme he developed evokes the 
onset and passing of a delightful shower. 
</P>
<P>
 The nature-conscious album's most somber moment is an elegiac piece called 
"Summer's End." 
</P>
<P>
 "It came from a real sad place," Chaquico said. "At the end of summer (while 
he was working on the album), my mom and dad had real severe heart attacks 
within three weeks of each other. My guitar became my best friend, and it got 
me through this challenging time. Since then, knock on wood, my mom and dad are 
doing great." 
</P>
<P>
 Chaquico, 39, doubts that he could have come up with as evocative an album if 
he hadn't gone through experiences such as the birth of a child and the severe 
illness of his parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had tried to do a solo album 10 years ago, it wouldn't have had the 
feeling I put into this record, and it wouldn't have touched people as much. To 
play with feeling and emotion, you have to have had these feelings. Unless 
you've laughed through it and cried through it, I don't think you can put it in 
your music." 
</P>
<P>
 Chaquico grew up on a dairy farm outside Sacramento, the son of a mother who 
played piano and organ in church and a father who had been a professional jazz 
musician in his youth. 
</P>
<P>
 He took up the guitar at 10 and in the late '60s fell under the spell of Jimi 
Hendrix, Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd. He joined his first band at 14 in a way 
perhaps unique in rock annals: He was inducted into the band by his high-school 
English teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'We need a lead guitar player in my rock band,' and I ended up being 
in a band with all these guys 15 years older." 
</P>
<P>
 Chaquico's stage gear included paste-on whiskers: "Back then, you had to be 21 
(to perform in a drinking establishment). I had long hair (hiding) my face, and 
I'd wear a fake mustache and play four sets a night. I thought I was in the big 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, he was. 
</P>
<P>
 The band, Steelwind, began getting gigs in the Bay Area, and members of the 
Jefferson Airplane became fans. Airplane singer Grace Slick invited Chaquico to 
play on one of her solo albums, and his 16th birthday also marked his first 
professional recording session. 
</P>
<P>
 When Jefferson Starship formed, fronted by Slick and fellow Airplane alumni 
Paul Kantner and Marty Balin, Chaquico was drafted into the band. He was 18 
when he first toured with them. 
</P>
<P>
 As Balin, then Kantner and finally Slick departed, Chaquico remained with the 
band, playing guitar and contributing to the songwriting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always was a team player, and I got along with everybody," he said, 
pointing to the lawsuit in which Kantner stripped the band of the right to the 
"Jefferson" half of the name as the only "tense" moment of his tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no hard feelings, especially (toward) Grace. For someone who was a 
big star, she never had that kind of attitude of 'I'm the lead singer, the 
prima donna, and you guys are just in the band.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Chaquico said he became disenchanted enough to leave in 1990 when Mickey 
Thomas, the lead singer who joined in 1979, began planning with the band's 
management to rely heavily on session players in the studio. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was becoming a little too fabricated; it wasn't like a group." 
</P>
<P>
 In reinventing himself for the New Age market, Chaquico says he is unconcerned 
about being perceived as a rocker who has put himself out to a mellow pasture. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I'm doing now is more challenging. It's all new territory, so I don't 
have to compare myself to what I did before." 
</P>
<P>
 As to the possibility that he'd be dismissed as an aging rocker grown too 
mellow to rock 'n' roll, he said: "I was a little nervous about that, but I'm 
not worried about that any more. The music I was playing made me laugh in the 
right places and cry in the right places and was giving me goose bumps. I could 
tell it was emotionally valid." 
</P>
<P>
 Fronting a band with a drummer, keyboards player and electric bassist, 
Chaquico has played his "Acoustic Highway" songs at motorcycle events and at a 
recent San Francisco show in which he opened for Hagar, the high-decibel rocker 
who fronts Van Halen. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole crowd was into it," he said. "It just goes to show that people are 
ready to hear acoustic music, even if they're total headbangers." 
</P>
<P>
 Chaquico has been bolstered by his victory last month in the annual BAMMY (Bay 
Area Music Awards) ceremonies. "Acoustic Highway" was named outstanding 
independent album, besting a field that included a collaboration between Jerry 
Garcia and David Grisman. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he is working on a follow-up to "Acoustic Highway" that he hopes to 
release this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a chance that Chaquico will also be heard blazing away with an 
electric guitar in the near future, on the soundtrack of a feature film, still 
in production, that stars the animated clay character Gumby.  
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago, Chaquico was recruited to play along to a scene in which an 
electric guitar-toting Gumby rocks out in a park. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gumby shreds, man," Chaquico said. "He sounds like a cross between ZZ Top, 
Van Halen and Lynyrd Skynyrd." 
</P>
<P>

Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. Naked to the World opens. $13.50. (714)

UN-CAT-EGORIZABLE; POP MUSIC: THE ACOUSTICATS WILL RETURN TO SAN JUAN 
CAPISTRANO WITH THEIR ECLECTIC BLEND OF BLUEGRASS, ROCK AND OTHER INFLUENCES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Acousticats set can range all over the map, from the Allman Brothers to 
Benny Goodman, from an old coal-mining ballad or two to soaring instrumental 
workouts. 
</P>
<P>
 If you have to call this five-piece acoustic band something, you can call it 
progressive folk-bluegrass. Cyrus Clarke, the group's guitarist and songwriter, 
would just as soon leave categories out of it. 
</P>
<P>
 That eclectic approach flows naturally from the group's influences, Clarke 
said by phone from his home in Santa Barbara. "I didn't learn my music at my 
grandpappy's knee, I learned it from the radio dial." 
</P>
<P>
 So, although the group's music has a rural bent, "We're all rockers. I love 
bluegrass, but I grew up listening to rock 'n' roll." 
</P>
<P>
 The Acousticats play two sets tonight at the San Juan Capistrano Library, a 
return engagement that comes one year after their Orange County debut there. 
Their strategy is to conquer California, piece by piece, before making an 
all-out effort for a national audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things about California is that it's so large, we're gonna spend 
the next five years checking it out," Clarke said. "If it takes us four or five 
years to build an audience in Orange County, so be it." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of that careful approach comes from acknowledgment of the fact that the 
Acousticats' music must compete for attention with more commercial brands of 
pop, so group members make a point of doing personal appearances at record 
stores and radio stations when they come for a performance. "It's not enough 
for us to come in and play and say, 'I'll see you later,' " Clarke said. 
</P>
<P>
 Group members believe that once they draw someone in to a concert, be it a 
festival or at a club show, that person will be hooked. 
</P>
<P>
 "We seem to hit a nerve with a lot of people," Clarke said. Audience members 
can range from young grunge fans to older bluegrass aficionados, and that's 
just great by him. "One of the things we don't do is we don't create barriers. 
I think people do that because of marketing." 
</P>
<P>
 The Acousticats' hallmark is a twin-fiddle attack led by Phil Salazar and 
Charl Ann Gastineau. Rounding out the band with Clarke are bassist Rick Borella 
and mandolin player Tom Corbett. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the band is relatively new -- it was formed in 1990 -- all are 
veteran musicians. Clarke spent 13 years in an acoustic band called the Cache 
Valley Drifters, which broke up in 1985. Some of the members of that group 
joined up with members of the Phil Salazar Band to create the Acousticats. 
</P>
<P>
 The band has one album out on Flying Fish Records, but members parted ways 
with the company after its founder died last year. They have since recorded a 
new album and are negotiating with another independent label for its release. 
If that doesn't work out, they may put it out themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking such a home-grown approach is becoming a trend among artists who fall 
outside the commercial mainstream. Knowing how to produce an album, and even to 
market and distribute it, are aspects of the business that everyone needs to 
know these days, Clarke said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mom was a nightclub singer, and she would just sing and do nothing else," 
he said. "These days, in order to compete and survive, you need to know the 
whole thing. There are just too many great players and producers." 
</P>
<P>
 That means keeping up with all the new digital recording technology, even for 
all-acoustic outfits such as the Acousticats. "One of these days I'm going to 
write the 'Silicon Valley Breakdown,' " Clarke joked. 
</P>
<P>
 Clarke does most of the band's writing, although Corbett has penned some tunes 
since joining the group early last year. "I do love songwriting more than 
everything else. . . . It's been a great outlet for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, he said, a second songwriter has been a welcome addition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a more folk, poetic (feel) in my writing. I'll spend weeks and weeks 
on a verse to make it just right. I don't want to waste a syllable." Corbett, 
he said, "is more pop-oriented." 
</P>
<P>
 Together, "it gives us depth," he said. "It's like traveling: You get to visit 
other people's cultures. We don't have a competition thing going on. We are 
very careful about that." 
</P>
<P>
 The confluence of styles and influences is part of a larger trend in American 
music in which styles blend and meld and create new form. As acoustic music 
evolves, also, it attracts more trained musicians, and the level of playing 
continues to rise. Both Salazar and Gastineau, for instance, are classically 
trained. 
</P>
<P>
 Clarke likens it to the early days of the jazz era, when most musicians were 
self-taught. 
</P>
<P>
 "As jazz became popular, it attracted trained musicians," Clarke said. "It 
looks like acoustic music is starting to undergo the same sort of process. A 
lot of bluegrass and old-time country music came from the hills" but has since 
moved beyond those sources. 
</P>
<P>
 California, with its multiplicity of styles and influences, is one place where 
acoustic music is changing dynamically, and it is those changes that are 
fueling the Acousticats. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a very strong sense of time and place: The time is now and the place 
is California," Clarke said. "We feel that if we're able to succeed regionally, 
we'll be able to succeed nationally." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Acousticats play tonight at 7 and 9 at the San Juan Capistrano Library, 
La Sala Auditorium, 31495 El Camino Real, San Juan Capistrano. $3. (714)

JAZZ REVIEWS; BASSIST BOBBY HAYNES MAKES A FEW REQUESTS OF HIS OWN; THE QUARTET 
LEADER PROVIDES A FUN, RELAXED SETTING FOR THE SPAGHETTINI AUDIENCE WITHOUT 
COMPROMISING PROFESSIONALISM.

 The fine art of the lounge band seldom is appreciated. Playing in tight 
quarters under noisy circumstances while servers hustle back and forth with 
drinks and food, the group often becomes part of the atmosphere, like the 
lighting or wall decorations, rather than the focus of the room. 
</P>
<P>
 It must be tempting for the musicians to treat their music as decoration as 
well: They can't play too loud. Yet they have to be heard over the din of 
conversation and tinkling drink glasses. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the requests from the patrons for this song or that, tunes more 
likely than not missing from the repertoire and a far cry from the music the 
band specializes in. 
</P>
<P>
 The symbol that marks this kind of engagement, a large brandy snifter for tips 
in which a couple of dollar bills swim like goldfish, sits atop the piano. You 
can almost here someone saying, "Play it again, Sam." 
</P>
<P>
 So credit Bobby Haynes with making the best of a less-than-perfect situation. 
The bassist's quartet, playing at Spaghettini last weekend, didn't take their 
task lightly, yet they managed to have a good time.  
</P>
<P>
 You've got requests? Haynes is glad to take them. You want to hear some 
serious music while the room's activities swirl around you? These guys deliver. 
</P>
<P>
 Haynes has plenty of experience with the big time, having worked with everyone 
from Percy Mayfield and John Mayall to Chico Hamilton and Dexter Gordon. So it 
figures that his presentation, even in these relaxed circumstances, will be 
professional. 
</P>
<P>
 With him was veteran drummer Roscoe Riley, and well-seasoned saxophonist 
Clarence Webb, whose credits include singer Jimmy Witherspoon and the big band 
of Gerald Wilson. Pianist Rick Olson rounded out the foursome, and together 
they bring an extra touch of class to the comfortable surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 The band signaled that it was out to have fun -- without making musical 
compromises -- in their opening number, "On Green Dolphin Street."  
</P>
<P>
 Webb blew a relaxed, Dexter Gordon-styled improvisation that ended on a series 
of sky-high whistling tones. Olson explored the tune's melodic content, before 
Haynes exploded into his solo, stringing together fleet strings of notes that 
roamed the entire range of his upright. Then the band joined in to take the 
tune out, with Webb adding lines from Dizzy Gillespie's "Manteca" for good 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
 And so it went with a handful of standards, including "Summertime," "Autumn 
Nocturne," and Herbie Hancock's "Cantaloupe Island." 
</P>
<P>
 Someone in the crowd asked for some John Coltrane, and the quartet responded 
with a deliberate version of "Equinox." Webb brought a brisk, rough-edged sound 
to his improv during the modal workout, while throwing in some Coltrane-esque 
overtones as well. Olson played accompaniment on the acoustic piano, but soloed 
on the electric set atop it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another request came in, this time for "Moonglow." Haynes and company resisted 
the temptation to play to the tune's cornier side, instead treating it with 
moody respect. The bassist, still on upright (he also brings his electric bass 
to the gig), took advantage to deliver his most thoughtful, melodic solo. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Haynes brought out singer Jita Holsey, and she crooned in fine lounge 
style, "Teach Me Tonight" and "Since I Fell for You." Jita (she prefers to use 
only her first name) is a nicely toned, competent vocalist who sings in direct 
fashion with a minimum of stylistic flourishes. 
</P>
<P>
 And she also knows how to work an audience, singing directly to various males 
at the front tables during "Since I Fell" while not offending their dates in 
the process. 
</P>
<P>
 Not every tune was as successful as these. Vince Guaraldi's "Charlie Brown 
Theme" was played at an excruciatingly slow pace and without the bounce and 
spirit of the original. But this kind of uncertain delivery was the exception, 
not the rule. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Bobby Haynes Quartet, with vocalist Jita, continues tonight at 8 p.m. 
and every Saturday this month at Spaghettini, 3005 Old Ranch Parkway, Seal 
Beach. Free. (310) 596-2199.

IRVINE FINE ARTS CENTER DIRECTOR IS TRANSFERRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amy Aspell, director of the Irvine Fine Arts Center since 1987, has been 
transferred to Citizens Assistance (another division of Irvine Community 
Services) as part of a fresh wave of restructuring caused by city budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Toni Pang, former superintendent of cultural affairs -- a position that was 
eliminated in the reshuffling -- will become director of the center when she 
returns from maternity leave in May.Tim Jahns, the center's educational 
coordinator, is serving as provisional director. Last June, the City Council 
axed the position of cultural affairs manager, held by former Santa Monica Arts 
Commission director Henry Korn, as part of a streamlining that eliminated 33 
city positions. The current reshuffling is not anticipated to affect 
programming, according to Jahns, one of three full-time program staff members 
at the center. 
</P>
<P>
 The others are Dorrit Fitzgerald Rawlins, curator of exhibitions, and Lisa 
Cone, resource development coordinator. The center's 1993-94 operating budget 
is $600,000, the same as for the past few years. CATHY CURTIS

BUS COLLIDES WITH TRUCK, INJURING 25; SYLMAR: POLICE SAY THE MTA DRIVER SWERVED 
WHEN THE OTHER VEHICLE TURNED IN FRONT OF HIM. THE CRASH CAUSED A POWER OUTAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 An MTA bus collided with a light truck, jumped a curb and rammed a utility 
pole Friday, injuring 25 people -- one seriously -- and causing a widespread 
power outage, authorities reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the truck, Charlesetta Wiley, 35, was listed in serious 
condition at Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The other victims, including two pregnant women, were passengers on the bus. 
Fifteen were taken to San Fernando Valley hospitals with minor injuries. Others 
were treated at the scene, said Bob Collis, spokesman for the Los Angeles Fire 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident also left about 800 nearby residents and businesses without power 
for several hours, said Dorothy Jensen, spokeswoman for the Department of Water 
and Power. 
</P>
<P>
 The collision occurred shortly after noon at the intersection of Glenoaks 
Boulevard and Roxford Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The bus, carrying 30 passengers, was traveling west on Roxford when a light 
truck headed east on Roxford made a left turn in front of the bus, Los Angeles 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said the bus driver began swerving to the right, apparently in an 
attempt to avoid a more direct impact. 
</P>
<P>
 "The driver of the vehicle was at fault," said Sgt. Monte Houze of the LAPD's 
Valley Traffic Division. "She tried to beat the light." 
</P>
<P>
 After colliding with the vehicle, a Mazda Navajo, the bus went over the curb, 
struck a utility pole, then went partially over a three-foot retaining wall in 
front of a shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 Martha Aguilar, 43, and her mother, Maria, 66, were seated near the front of 
the bus when they felt a sudden impact, first of the crash, then of bodies 
falling forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "I fell on top of my mother and other people fell on top of me," Aguilar said. 
</P>
<P>
 Flying glass from broken windows showered passengers as the force of the crash 
threw them to the floor of the bus. Witnesses said at least five small children 
were among the passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a lot of people crying and yelling," Aguilar said. Martha and 
Maria Aguilar were headed home after a visit to Olive View Medical Center, 
where Maria saw a doctor for her heart condition. "I couldn't scream because my 
daughter was on top of me," Maria Aguilar said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gregorio Garcia, 64, of Mission Hills said he saw nothing, but felt the driver 
swerving to the right before the crash, a move he said helped prevent a sharper 
collision and possibly more serious injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank God nobody died," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aguilars and Garcia were treated at Northridge Hospital Medical Center for 
minor injuries and released. 
</P>
<P>
 A woman who was nine months pregnant was taken to Olive View Medical Center 
after complaining of abdominal pain. The woman, whose name was not released, 
was in stable condition later Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearby merchants at Garrett Plaza, the collision was a close call.  
</P>
<P>
 "It sounded like (the bus) was coming right through the store, and then there 
were bright lights like fireworks in the daytime," said Tony Lewis, 43, of 
Valencia, who owns El Rancho Plaza Market. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen an accident this bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Passersby assisted bus passengers and the driver of the Mazda until police and 
fire officials arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both doors of the bus were jammed and there were all of these women and 
children and some older people inside," said Ricardo Sepulveda, 28, of North 
Hollywood. "We pulled it open and there was a child who looked like he had a 
broken arm." 
</P>
<P>
 Postal carrier Steve Garfinkel, who stopped to help, said the Mazda driver 
spoke to him as he tried to free her from the wreckage. "She asked me to hold 
her and she asked me if I was Jesus," said Garfinkel, who has a beard. 
</P>
<P>
 Garfinkel said he also directed traffic around live power lines that fell into 
the street when the utility pole was hit. 
</P>
<P>
 The bus -- on the No. 94 line from Los Angeles to San Fernando and Sylmar -- 
was driven by William Thomas Liddell, of Pacoima, said MTA spokeswoman Andrea 
Greene. He was uninjured, witnesses said. 
</P>

and special correspondent Jeff Schnaufer contributed to this story.

SAN FERNANDO FINDS QUAKE LOSSES WORSE THAN BELIEVED; AFTERMATH: A NEW 
ASSESSMENT SAYS 53 STRUCTURES NEED TO BE DEMOLISHED AT A COST OF ABOUT $47 
MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 San Fernando city officials have found that 53 structures need to be 
demolished, at a cost of about $47 million, because of unexpectedly heavy 
damage from aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 The updated assessment, which more than doubles earlier loss estimates, 
includes 30 businesses, or about 4% of those in the city, and 87 residential 
units, about 1% of the total. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more than I had anticipated based on the initial assessments that were 
made," San Fernando Mayor Dan Acuna said Friday. "We knew there would be a 
substantial loss, but we didn't expect this. This is going to be extremely 
costly." 
</P>
<P>
 The initial estimates, done in mid-February, found only 21 structures -- 
mainly commercial buildings -- needed to be demolished. Inspections are not yet 
complete, and another update is due in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the main reasons the number of buildings that must be razed has changed 
so drastically is the 5.3 aftershock of March 20, according to Jim Eldridge, 
director of building services for DGA Consultants, Inc., the firm contracted to 
perform the assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 "This aftershock that we had has significantly affected our analysis," 
Eldridge said. "Some (yellow-tagged buildings) are now red, and some red-tagged 
buildings that were salvageable before will now have to be demolished." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the report, inspections of 2,075 structures in the tiny 
2.4-square-mile city revealed: 
</P>
<P>
 * 158 structures are unsafe. Of those red-tagged structures, 105 are 
residential buildings containing 204 housing units, and 53 are commercial 
structures housing 54 businesses.  
</P>
<P>
 * 147 have been posted as restricted to limited entry. The yellow-tagged 
structures include 120 residential buildings containing 221 housing units, and 
27 commercial buildings containing 36 businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 * 53 have already been destroyed or are scheduled for demolition. 
</P>
<P>
 There are about 650 commercial and 5,700 residential units in San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 Alicia's Beauty Salon on San Fernando Road, originally yellow-tagged, was 
red-tagged after a recent inspection. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The initial inspector didn't notice the amount of damage," said Jim 
Rodriguez, the store's manager. "One of our other stores, a beauty supply store 
down the street, has already been demolished." One of the cornerstones of San 
Fernando's popular pedestrian mall, a 1920s masonry building at San Fernando 
Road and Maclay Avenue, was recently demolished, forcing the five store owners 
there to find new locations. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter Rueff Auto Center on San Fernando Road, which has been in business 
since the 1930s, sustained about $1 million in structural damage during the 
quake, according to co-owner Mike Rueff. Although many of the center's 
buildings are yellow- and red-tagged, the business is still in operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've already had several of our buildings demolished, and numerous walls," 
Rueff said. "Our Buick showroom suffered quite a bit of damage." 
</P>
<P>
 The city's largest severely damaged structure, a 17,000-square-foot office 
building at 451 Brand Blvd. has already been demolished. Northeast Valley 
Health Corporation, a health care provider that also has offices in Van Nuys, 
was the building's main tenant. 
</P>
<P>
 Acuna said he is not concerned about businesses leaving town. But the costs of 
rebuilding -- and the large loss of revenue to the city -- worry him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The single largest source of revenue in San Fernando is sales tax," Acuna 
said. "This is very definitely going to affect us heavily."  
</P>
<P>
 Among the buildings red-tagged is the San Fernando Superior Courthouse. Many 
of the city's businesses have reported being severely hurt by the courthouse's 
closure, Acuna said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To speed up the rebuilding process, the San Fernando City Council voted last 
month to waive all construction permit fees for repairs that began within 45 
days after Jan. 17, half of the fees for work undertaken between 46 and 90 
days, and one-fourth of the fees for work that starts within 120 days. 
</P>
<P>
 The updated assessment due in two weeks is expected to find more buildings 
that will need to be demolished, Eldridge said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the city of Los Angeles, about 11,000 structures sustained enough damage to 
warrant immediate repair, city records show. About 9,000 of those were posted 
with yellow notices, and 2,000 were marked with red tags. Commercial buildings 
account for about 1,000 of the yellow-tagged structures and about 500 of the 
red, according to David Keim, principal inspector for the Department of 
Building and Safety.

SUSPECT CHARGED IN CARJACK-SLAYING OF JAPANESE STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN and ERIC MALNIC, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Murder charges that carry a possible death penalty were filed Friday against a 
suspect in the killings of two college students from Japan. Another man, whose 
involvement in the case is said to be less than originally thought, was charged 
as an accessory after the fact. 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond Oscar Butler, 18, is accused of shooting the two students to death -- 
charged by the Los Angeles County district attorney's office with two counts of 
murder, two counts of robbery and two counts of carjacking. The possible death 
penalty stems from special circumstance allegations that last week's fatal 
shootings of Takuma Ito and Go Matsuura, both 19, occurred during a robbery and 
constituted a multiple murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Alberto Vasquez Reygoza, 20, is charged with one count of being an accessory 
after the fact and one count of receiving stolen property. Each count carries a 
maximum penalty of three years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The appearance of the two men in court Friday was their first since their 
arrests Wednesday night. Their arraignment -- during which they would enter 
pleas -- had been scheduled, but it was continued until April 12 to give 
defense attorneys more time to prepare cases. 
</P>
<P>
 For Friday's brief proceedings, Butler was represented by Deputy Public 
Defender Stanley Perlo and Reygoza was represented by court-appointed attorney 
John B. Schmocker. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge James B. Pierce ordered Butler held without bail. Bail 
for Reygoza was set at $45,000. 
</P>
<P>
 During a short news conference after Friday's court appearances, Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Janet Moore and the two defense attorneys declined to reveal details of 
the attack or to discuss the roles of each defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore, who will prosecute the case, said Butler was not alone when the attack 
took place. Schmocker said it "is a fair assumption" that Reygoza was not 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 Reygoza's involvement was "much less than was originally suspected," Moore 
said. "In order to charge Mr. Reygoza with murder he would have to have been 
either a perpetrator or an accomplice. The evidence does not support either of 
those determinations." 
</P>
<P>
 Count 7 of the eight-count complaint filed Friday states that Reygoza "did 
harbor, conceal and aid" Butler "with the intent that he might avoid and escape 
. . . arrest, trial, conviction and punishment." 
</P>
<P>
 Count 8 accuses Reygoza of receiving stolen property, including a "camera, car 
radio installation, clothing and miscellaneous personal items." 
</P>
<P>
 Moore declined to comment on whether Reygoza will testify against Butler. Los 
Angeles police say Ito and Matsuura were shot in the head at close range about 
11 p.m. March 25 as they got out of a car in the parking lot of a Ralphs 
supermarket in San Pedro. Police say the suspects planned to rob the students 
and took the car on impulse. 
</P>
<P>
 Declared brain-dead soon after the attack, the young men -- students at 
Marymount College in Rancho Palos Verdes -- were taken off life-support systems 
at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center and pronounced dead Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack reinforced a growing perception overseas that Los Angeles is a 
hotbed of violence, and the crime generated headlines in newspapers, lead 
stories on television, concern among Japanese officials and reassurances from 
U.S. dignitaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Sunday, acting on a tip, police found the stolen car -- stripped of its 
stereo system -- near where the students were shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives said evidence from the car and information from witnesses led them 
to the two suspects, who were kept under 24-hour surveillance for two days as 
investigators continued to build the case against them. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler and Reygoza, both said by police to be gang members, were arrested late 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 At midmorning Friday, detectives placed the two handcuffed suspects into 
unmarked police cars at the Los Angeles Police Department's Parker Center 
headquarters for the trip to the courthouse in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler, who wore a blue T-shirt and baggy black shorts, stared at the ground 
as a dozen TV news cameras photographed the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 He ignored questions shouted by reporters asking whether he had killed the 
students. But as he sat in the car, he told reporters through an open window: 
"Go easy on my parents, all right?" 
</P>
<P>
 Reygoza, who followed Butler down the ramp and into another car, shook his 
head "no" to questions from reporters asking whether he committed the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The two young men showed up in Long Beach Superior Court shortly after 1:30 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Reygoza saw several familiar faces in the audience and smiled at them. Butler 
scanned the crowd but did not react. 
</P>
<P>
 After Pierce granted Perlo's request for a continuance, the judge asked the

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; MAN CHARGED OVER DAYLONG CRIME SPREE

<P>
 A Van Nuys man who was flushed from an apartment with tear gas lobbed by a Los 
Angeles Police Department SWAT team was charged Friday with the murder of an 
acquaintance during a daylong crime spree. 
</P>
<P>
 Hector Rodolfo Mejia, 36, faces five felony counts stemming from three Sunday 
incidents in Van Nuys.He pleaded not guilty to all charges Friday in Van Nuys 
Municipal Court and remains in county jail in lieu of $1.1 million bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Mejia, an unemployed laborer, is charged with killing Jose Napoleon Orellana, 
29, at about 7:30 a.m. Sunday in the 6700 block of Havyenhurst Avenue. Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Robert L. Cohen said the two men got into a fight, Mejia pulled out 
a gun and started shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said there may have been a lingering dispute over money, one that 
started several weeks earlier when the pair ate together at a restaurant and 
Mejia left without paying. 
</P>
<P>
 Just after midnight Sunday, Mejia allegedly abducted his estranged girlfriend 
from her Van Nuys apartment in the same block where Orellana was later shot. He 
is charged with forcing 37-year-old Natividad Romero into his pickup truck and 
driving her to a motel on Sepulveda Boulevard, where he allegedly beat her for 
two hours. He was charged with kidnaping, assault and spousal abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Mejia is also charged with robbery for allegedly using a .38-caliber handgun 
to obtain $200 from Teresa Gomez, a woman who authorities said charged Mejia 
$75 a month to sleep on her couch. Authorities said the robbery occurred about 
12 hours after Orellana was gunned down. THOM MROZEK

<P>
 A dozen people received minor injuries when a hit-and-run driver plowed into a 
car and triggered two separate collisions involving eight vehicles on the 
Golden State Freeway in Sylmar, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of a white pickup truck was traveling south on the Golden State 
Freeway near the Balboa Boulevard off-ramp when he could not stop in time and 
struck the rear of a sport utility vehicle, which crashed into the car in front 
of it, a California Highway Patrol officer said. 
</P>
<P>
 After losing control, the utility truck careened into the center divider. When 
it swerved back into traffic, it was rear-ended by a fourth car. 
</P>
<P>
 Five minutes after the 10:06 p.m. collision on Thursday, a van driver who saw 
the pileup made a sudden stop and was struck from behind by another car. That 
accident caused another chain of crashes. 
</P>
<P>
 All motorists injured in the accidents were taken to various hospitals. CHAU

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: QUAKE COUNSELING GROUPS SEEK FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nineteen social-service agencies based in the San Fernando and Santa Clarita 
valleys have applied for $2.6 million in federal grant money to continue the 
free counseling services they have been providing to earthquake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors will decide whether to 
approve contracts with the agencies -- many of them community-based groups -- 
to provide individual counseling, support groups, training seminars for mental 
health professionals, earthquake literature and community outreach. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency has allocated $11.6 million to the 
county Department of Mental Health, 6.3 million of which will go to private 
social-service organizations to provide counseling countywide. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley agencies that have submitted the largest wish lists include: the San 
Fernando Valley Partnership Against Substance Abuse -- which includes 17 
agencies -- $1.1 million; Hermanidad Mexicana Nacional, $737,000, and the San 
Fernando Valley Community Medical Health Center, $100,000.  
</P>
<P>
 Some of the money would go toward reimbursing agencies for expenses they have 
already incurred in treating earthquake victims, while other funds would be 
used for longer-term counseling.  
</P>
<P>
 The list of hopeful contractors has been approved by Project Rebound, a 
program created by the county Department of Mental Health in 1992 to help 
disaster victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "We look for agencies that have already established community linkages with 
key organizations and leaders, because that will allow us a quick entry to 
serving the community's needs," said Project Rebound's Patricia Mendoza. 
</P>
<P>
 Augusto del Rio, director of Sherman Oaks-based SEPA Psychological Services, 
which is asking for $81,000, said his agency has provided counseling to more 
than 400 earthquake victims since Jan. 17. KAY HWANGBO

 Tammy Dodd has The Right Stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 The 14-year-old pilot from Illinois, who has flown gliders, helicopters, 
balloons and aerobatic planes, added a fighter jet to the list Friday after 
taking off from Van Nuys Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodd, who has flown for nearly three years, is part of the Young Eagles, a 
project sponsored by the Experimental Aircraft Assn. to interest youths in 
aviation. 
</P>
<P>
 Young Eagles, started in August, 1992, aims to introduce 1 million children to 
aviation by the year 2003 by giving them free rides and demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
 By showing youngsters opportunities in aviation, the project gives children 
goals and recruits workers and participants for the aviation industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Tammy is already hooked. The daughter of a drywall worker from Woodstock, an 
hour's drive from Chicago, wants to perform in air shows and fly private jets 
for a living. 
</P>
<P>
 She already has her license to fly solo in gliders. She can't get licensed to 
fly powered aircraft until she is 16. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a real positive role model for kids," said Joe Coulson, Tammy's flight 
instructor who travels with her to schools and air shows. 
</P>
<P>
 When children see what Tammy has accomplished, they understand their goals are 
attainable, Coulson said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Friday, there were no crowds, no audience of children. Just a blue, white 
and gray Hawker-Siddley Gnat, a British fighter plane used from the mid-1960s 
to the 1980s, and the open sky. 
</P>
<P>
 Skip Holm, a Vietnam fighter pilot who has performed stunts in movies 
including "The Right Stuff," accompanied Tammy on her half-hour flight in the 
jet he also flew in "Hot Shots." 
</P>
<P>
 Tammy's face was stern as she strapped on her red helmet and oxygen mask and 
climbed into the two-man cockpit. She waved to photographers as the jet taxied 
to the runway, its engine emitting a high-pitched scream. 
</P>
<P>
 She was waving again as the jet taxied back a half-hour later. 
</P>
<P>
 "I loved it!" she said, breathless, as she took off her helmet and stood in 
the cockpit. "We did some rolls! I've never felt that many Gs." REBECCA BRYANT

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; ROBERTI OPPONENTS ALLEGE POWER ABUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIVIEN LOU CHEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Supporters of the attempt to recall state Sen. David Roberti charged the 
politician with abuse of power Friday, after a flyer was distributed at the 
state Capitol entreating volunteers to walk the 20th District for Roberti's 
camp next weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 During a visit to an earthquake-damaged pharmacy in Northridge, Roberti (D-Van 
Nuys) dismissed the claim, saying he had never seen the flyer before and had 
nothing to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's news to me. They probably put the fax together themselves," the senator 
said as he was flanked by a group of local business supporters outside 
Northridge Pharmacy. "There are a lot of people who are interested in the race, 
on both sides." 
</P>
<P>
 For $50, the flyer says, people can get get van rides to and from the San 
Fernando Valley, food and a cot to sleep on between April 8 and 10. 
</P>
<P>
 The flyer was printed by Steve Hopcraft, who runs a Sacramento consulting firm 
that represents a coalition of renters grateful for Roberti's help in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 About 150 copies were handed out -- without Roberti's involvement -- to 
legislative staffers at the Capitol, as well as a number of public-interest 
groups, Hopcraft said. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the senator's opponents, such as the Coalition to Restore Government 
Integrity, the flyer smacks of impropriety. California state law does not make 
it illegal to approach government staffers for work on political campaigns, but 
the federal Hatch Act does. 
</P>
<P>
 "It isn't right and this sort of abuse is why we have the Hatch Act at the 
federal level," Russ Howard, executive director of the coalition, told 
reporters gathered at the Van Nuys campaign headquarters for Roberti's 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard said he spoke to a state government worker who claimed to have been 
pressured into joining Roberti's effort, but he could not offer any details on 
what he said was an anonymous phone call. VIVIEN LOU CHEN

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: $318,306 QUAKE RELIEF GIVEN BY UNITED WAY

<P>
 United Way of Greater Los Angeles made earthquake-relief grants totaling 
$318,306 last week to 31 agencies in the San Fernando, Santa Clarita and 
Antelope valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 The grants were the second wave of such distributions from the United Way's 
Earthquake Relief Fund since the Jan. 17 Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, the fund distributed $624,618 to 45 organizations that have 
provided services to earthquake victims or community-service agencies that had 
quake-related damage themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 One of last week's largest grants was $13,000 to El Nido Family Centers based 
in Van Nuys. The centers will use the money to provide counseling services and 
manage cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Grants of $10,000 each also went to Boy's & Girl's Club of Santa Clarita 
Valley, Girl Scouts of San Fernando Valley, and Woodcraft Rangers in Van Nuys.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; HUNDREDS BEAM UP TO SCI FI CONVENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Fandom is a way of life. 
</P>
<P>
 Just ask the hundreds of dreamers who wandered through displays of movie props 
and fantasy paintings at the Burbank Convention Center Friday and the hundreds 
more expected over the weekend for the science fiction, fantasy and horror 
convention being held at the center. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very family thing," said convention manager Roxanne Smith. "I'm odd, 
you're odd. We can all be odd together." 
</P>
<P>
 Fandom is everything from science fiction movie props to comic books to 
paperback horror stories to model spaceships. It's the Viking hat with a 
propeller taped on it that computer programmer Keith Thompson wore while 
flipping through books. It's also the white face paint and Dracula fangs 
Kristine Cherry donned before heading to the convention from South Gate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mostly I go for the parties," said Jonathon Hammar, 32, who drove to the 
convention from San Jose. "You do a lot of drawing, swap sketches and watch 
cartoons." 
</P>
<P>
 Phil and Ed's Excellent Convention is named for the two aerospace engineers 
who created it: Phil Broad and Ed Zamora. According to Zamora, there are at 
least two such conventions in the country every weekend. Science fiction and 
fantasy buffs traveled to Burbank from as far away as Germany to see the masks 
from "Planet of the Apes," play Dungeons and Dragons for hours, and meet such 
stars as Yvonne Craig, who played Batgirl Barbara Gordon in the 1960s 
television series "Batman." 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't even know about (science fiction) conventions four years ago," said 
Craig, almost unrecognizable without her bat costume. "But I went to one in 
Georgia and it was the best experience, it was just amazing." 
</P>
<P>
 For a $40 weekend pass, the convention-goer can chose seminars from subjects 
ranging from "The Changing Faces of Fandom" to "Sex in Space." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday afternoon, dozens of people, some dressed in medieval costume, some 
in jeans, others in flowery dresses, browsed through movie stills, soundtracks 
and jewelry between seminars. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson said he made the trip from San Diego for the people he would meet. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a normal bell curve with the middle missing," he said. "It's full of 
people who understand my humor." SUSAN BYRNES

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; 2 HURT, 2 ARRESTED DURING GANG BRAWL

<P>
 Fistfights between an Armenian gang from Glendale and a Latino gang from 
Burbank and Hollywood resulted in injuries to two youths and the arrests of two 
others, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two teen-agers received minor injuries Thursday after the rival gangs brawled 
with one another in front of Hoover High School, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested a 17-year-old student from Hollywood's Fairfax High School for 
battery and a 17-year-old Allan F. Daily High School student for assault with a 
deadly weapon in the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fairfax student was released to his mother's custody late Thursday; the 
other student was sent to Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall, Glendale Police Officer 
Rodney Brooks said. Police are searching for a third teen-age suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 gang members mingled with Hoover High students in front of the school 
prior to the fight around 3 p.m., police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fistfights broke out between the Latino and Armenian gang members after Latino 
gang members drove in front of Hoover High and taunted the Armenians with 
racial slurs, police spokesman Sgt. Lief Nicolaisen. said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Latino gang member was arrested for assault with a deadly weapon after he 
chased a 17-year-old Armenian gang member and started hitting him with a broken 
crutch, police said. The Armenian student was taken to Glendale Adventist 
Medical Center, treated for cuts and bruises and released. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fairfax High teen-ager was arrested for battery after he opened the door 
to a police car where the first suspect was sitting and started kicking him, 
Nicolaisen said.  
</P>
<P>
 The second teen-ager injured in the incident did not require treatment for 
bruises received when Latino gang members chased him down Glenwood Road and 
struck him several times on the back, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said these rival gang members tangle because the Latino gang claims 
specific city blocks as its own while Armenian gang members regard the city of 
Glendale as theirs. JENNIFER OLDHAMASSAULTS

<P>
 Caltrans officials announced that bridge retrofitting work in Encino will 
begin in early June. 
</P>
<P>
 Five bridges, including a pedestrian crossing at Encino Avenue, will be 
retrofitted as part of a statewide retrofit program that began in 1989, said 
Russell Snyder, a Caltrans spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction work will begin in early June and is expected to continue for 
about one year, he said. The cost of the retrofit program is $287,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the work is expected to be done at night and during off hours, but 
Snyder warned that lane closures may be necessary from time to time during 
construction. All lane closures will be announced beforehand by the agency, he 
said. CHIP JOHNSON

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS; SANTA MONICAS HIT SPRINGTIME PEAK 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Spring birds and blossoms have brought abundant reasons to escape the urban 
grid, if only for a few hours, into the Santa Monica Mountains for hikes and 
seminars coordinated by the National Park Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of free nature walks, birding expeditions and other events are offered 
in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area between April 1 and June 
30, in the National Park Service's most activity-packed calendar ever. 
</P>
<P>
 The pamphlet lists a hike or event nearly every day, with as many as 10 
activities offered some Sundays. Many hikes are led by park rangers, while 
other events are put on by organizations such as the Sierra Club, TreePeople 
and the California Native Plant Society. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the most popular, said Ranger Ted Stout, are the tours of Paramount 
Ranch -- where the "Adventures of Marco Polo," "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer," 
"The Cisco Kid" and other movies were filmed -- and the hike to Sandstone Peak, 
the highest spot in the Santa Monicas. 
</P>
<P>
 On a clear day, Stout said, the view from Sandstone Peak takes in Santa 
Catalina Island and the San Gabriel Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the favorite hikes added this year is called "Life After Fire," a trek 
through areas recovering from the ravages of the wildfires last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "The blackened oaks that you would have thought were dead are now blooming 
with brilliant foliage," Stout said. "There are all kinds of rebirth and 
wildflowers sticking out of the ground too. It's really quite heartening." 
</P>
<P>
 Other events include a banjo and fiddle contest, a search for edible and 
poisonous plants and a geology field trip. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Park Service has published the free listing of events quarterly 
for about 10 years, during which time the number of participating organizations 
has grown to 31, said spokeswoman Catherine Saunders. 
</P>
<P>
 The pamphlets, entitled OUTDOORS, come with maps and directions to park sites. 
They are available from the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area 
headquarters, 30401 Agoura Road, Suite 100, Agoura Hills, Calif., 91301; or by 
calling (818) 597-9192. KURT PITZER

 A Granada Hills businessman has been sentenced to 18 months in prison on six 
counts of tax evasion stemming from a scheme to avoid paying $2 million in 
federal excise taxes on the sale of diesel fuel, according to the U.S. 
Attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Meyer, 63, also was ordered by U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer 
to serve five years probation after pleading guilty to charges arising from a 
failure to pay the required 15 cents a gallon excise tax on sales of 14 million 
gallons of diesel fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1986 through 1988, Meyer owned several front companies that operated at 
least 16 gas stations in Southern and Central California, according to 
Assistant U.S. Atty. Jeffrey C. Eglash. The front companies were Baloy Garcia 
Texaco, which operated service stations in Venice and North Hollywood; Karin's 
Korner, which operated a station in the Central California community of 
Earlimart; and Lovely Lady Oil, which operated stations in Long Beach and 
Rialto. 
</P>
<P>
 The government charged that Meyer used third parties -- his wife, two sons, a 
daughter-in-law and a 13-year-old stepson -- to conceal his ownership of the 
companies, Eglash said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyer's son, Michael Goldberg, previously pleaded guilty to two counts of 
filing a false tax return and was sentenced to eight months in custody, 
including four months of home detention. Steven Goldberg pleaded guilty to two 
counts of failing to file tax returns and was sentenced to three months of home 
confinement. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Goldberg's ex-wife, Pamela Anderson, entered a similar plea and was 
placed on three years probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Eglash called Meyer's sentence a "significant penalty in a tax case."

<P>
 Calling the shooting legal, prosecutors declined to file charges Friday 
against a North Hollywood market clerk who shot and killed a man who stole 
beer. 
</P>
<P>
 Eeli Jabiel Ismael, a 23-year-old Glendale man, was struggling with one of the 
alleged thieves when his gun discharged, sending a bullet into the man's neck, 
which severed his spinal cord, causing instant death, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tragedy this had to occur," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert L. Cohen, 
who reviewed the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Killed in the March 25 incident at B.V. Food Mart in the 11000 block of 
Burbank Boulevard was Mariano Chaidez, a 23-year-old North Hollywood man who 
police said was on parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaidez and a 17-year-old entered the market about 10:45 p.m. They each 
selected an 18-can carton of Budweiser, authorities said. When it appeared they 
were not going to pay for the merchandise, Ismael confronted them and demanded 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 The juvenile allegedly threw his box of beer at Ismael, striking the clerk in 
the face, according to Los Angeles Police Detective Gil Uribe. Chaidez, still 
carrying an 18-pack of beer, and his brother then left the store. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with a handgun, Ismael went outside the store and confronted the 
brothers, who were accompanied by three friends. When verbal threats were made, 
according to Uribe, Ismael fired a warning shot into the air, causing the men 
to scatter. 
</P>
<P>
 Ismael gave chase, firing another warning shot that inadvertently struck the 
17-year-old in the lower back. The youth suffered minor injuries, Uribe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ismael eventually caught up to Chaidez, who also threw a carton of beer at the 
clerk and then attempted to wrestle the gun away. The gun went off during that 
struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 The juvenile, whose name was withheld because of his name, has been charged 
with robbery.

TEXAS MAN DIES IN FREEWAY CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man sleeping in the cab of a truck was killed Friday when the driver fell 
asleep and plowed into another large truck on the Golden State Freeway near 
Fort Tejon, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Killed in the early morning crash was a 30-year-old man from Cotulla, 
Tex.Police declined to identify him until family members were notified.  
</P>
<P>
 The driver, Robert Eugene Smith, also 30, was taken to a local hospital with a 
head wound. Authorities said the San Antonio, Tex., man will be charged with 
vehicular manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the second truck, which was carrying hazardous waste materials, 
was treated at the scene and released. A few drops of the solid waste mixed 
with water that leaked when the crash severed a drain plug in the rear of the 
truck, California Highway Patrol Officer Joe Sandoval said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both trucks were traveling north on the Golden State Freeway near the Fort 
Tejon exit. Just before the collision, Smith veered left to avoid the crash but 
struck the second truck from the rear. 
</P>
<P>
 Two lanes of traffic on the freeway were closed for more than three hours.

2 TEEN-AGERS HOSPITALIZED IN GANG SHOOTING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two West Covina teen-agers were hospitalized after a shooting outside Six 
Flags Magic Mountain that authorities suggest was gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
 One youth, 17, is in serious condition at Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital 
in Valencia from a bullet wound to the torso that cut his liver.The other boy, 
14, was shot in the wrist and taken to Queen of Angels-Hollywood Presbyterian 
Medical Center. His condition was unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities declined to identify the two teen-agers because of their ages. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident occurred shortly after 9:30 p.m. Thursday. Witnesses said two 
Asian male juveniles armed with handguns shot "numerous times" at the 
teen-agers, who were in a car near the intersection of Magic Mountain Parkway 
and The Old Road, according to a sheriff's report. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects ran from the sidewalk in front of the Chevron gas station at the 
intersection's southwest corner, crossing The Old Road, to a car in the Wendy's 
restaurant parking lot to the northeast. They drove south on the Golden State 
Freeway, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities at the Santa Clarita Valley sheriff's station said they believe 
the shooting may be gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects and victims are believed to have encountered each other earlier 
in the evening at the amusement park.

WATER DISTRICT GETS NEW GENERAL MANAGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON MOESER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A longtime public works director has been hired as the new general manager of 
the Palmdale Water District, effective Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 David W. Hansen will replace outgoing manager Hal Fones, who is retiring after 
four years as manager of the district, which provides water to more than 70,000 
residents in the Palmdale area. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palmdale Water District board of directors earlier this week approved a 
two-year employment agreement with Hansen that provides him an annual salary of 
$85,000 his first year and a minimum pay increase of 5%. Fones earned about 
$105,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Hansen's benefits include medical, dental and vision care, retirement coverage 
through the Public Employees' Retirement System, holiday and sick time, 15 days 
vacation each year and an automobile for business-related use and limited 
personal use. The district will also pay Hansen's relocation expenses, up to 
$2,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Water district Director John Sidwell said Hansen was chosen from a pool of 
about 30 candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were quite pleased," Sidwell said. "We had a lot of very qualified 
applicants. We had a lot of people that had a lot of good public agency 
background and a lot of water agency experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Hansen comes to the district with the experience of operating a Riverside 
consulting business, nine years as head engineer for a Riverside area water 
district and a decade of service as director of public works and engineering 
for a small California city. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a lot of experience in public agencies," Sidwell said. "The district 
has been very progressive, and I think this gentleman will stay on top of 
everything we've got going."

RELIGION / JOHN DART; WESTLAKE MINISTER MARKS 26TH SUNRISE SERVICE BEFORE 
RETIRING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Westlake Village began to take shape in 1968, the first minister to form a 
congregation in that planned community held his first service on Palm Sunday, 
then led an Easter sunrise service the following Sunday atop a cemetery hill. 
</P>
<P>
 By holding outdoor Easter rites for about 65 people and a few long-eared 
rabbits scampering nearby, the Rev. Robert Bos of Westlake Village was 
introducing a venerable Southern California tradition to its newest housing 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 This Sunday, one month before Bos retires as pastor of Westminster 
Presbyterian Church, the 26th Easter sunrise service at 6 a.m. at Valley Oaks 
Memorial Park in Westlake Village will bring together about 1,200 worshipers 
from seven participating churches in Westlake Village and Agoura Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 From Mt. McGroarty in the Verdugo Mountains to Porter Ridge Park and Vasquez 
Rocks, sunrise services will recall the first Easter as described in all four 
Gospels. In those accounts, women followers of the crucified Jesus went to his 
tomb in the early dawn, at the beginning of the week, and found it empty -- 
signaling the Resurrection that is a pillar of the Christian faith. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowds that assemble at chilly dawn services in the San Fernando Valley 
area are tiny compared to the tens of thousands who attend services at more 
comfortable morning hours inside churches. 
</P>
<P>
 And with the change to daylight-saving time scheduled for 2 a.m. Sunday, there 
is the chance that sunrise service crowds will be even smaller because of 
reduced sleeping time. Yet, it wouldn't be the first Easter that potential 
worshipers were challenged to remember the changeover and adjust accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 The oldest sunrise service in the Valley is the 69th annual Mt. McGroarty 
service in which about 400 seats are set up on that peak not far from a 20-foot 
cross. The service will begin at 6 a.m., but worshipers are advised to arrive 
much earlier at Foothill Boulevard and Hill Haven Avenue in Sunland, where vans 
will take people up the mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Curtis Arne of the Church of the Open Bible will give the sermon. 
Clergy in the Sunland-Tujunga area run the service and the local Kiwanis Club 
takes care of other arrangements, according to Kiwanis spokesman Jerry 
Friedman, the event's unofficial historian. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm Jewish, although I haven't been active in a synagogue for years, but I've 
been helping with the service for 17 years because it's a club project and I 
enjoy it," Friedman said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the 18th annual sunrise service at 6 a.m. Sunday at Forest Lawn 
Memorial-Park, Hollywood Hills, Capt. Cathryn Russell, commanding officer of 
the Salvation Army Corps in Burbank, will become the first woman to deliver the 
sermon in that observance. 
</P>
<P>
 About 2,000 people are expected at the Hollywood Hills service conducted each 
year by the interdenominational Burbank Ministerial Assn. The choir of the 
First Baptist Church of La Crescenta will provide the music. 
</P>
<P>
 Russell, a 15-year veteran of Salvation Army posts, was assigned to the 
Burbank congregation of about 150 members in January, 1992. Her sermon topic, 
alluding to the Easter story of Jesus' raising from the dead, is "How to Cancel 
a Funeral." 
</P>
<P>
 The service will be held near the cemetery's Birth of Liberty Mosaic wall. 
Early arrivals at 6300 Forest Lawn Drive will be served free coffee and 
doughnuts by members of the Burbank Kiwanis Club. 
</P>
<P>
 At Forest Lawn Memorial-Park, Glendale, a standing-room crowd of 1,100 
Spanish-speaking worshipers is expected for a 6 a.m. service inside the Hall of 
the Crucifixion-Resurrection. The speaker will be the Rev. Camilo Gonzalez, 
president of the sponsoring Hispanic Baptist Churches of the Southwest. The 
service will include a narration in Spanish of Jan Styka's "The Crucifixion," 
in which portions of the 195-foot-long painting are spotlighted in the darkened 
room as the story unfolds. When the biblical story says that an earthquake 
occurs at Jesus' moment of death, those seated in the room feel sound-wave 
vibrations to simulate the temblor -- "something that's not too popular these 
days," an official admitted. 
</P>
<P>
 At the best-known sunrise rites, the 74th Hollywood Bowl Easter service will 
include a sermon by the Rev. Ignacio Castuera of First United Methodist Church 
of Hollywood and a performance by the Tarzana-based Bel Canto Symphony 
Orchestra of the fourth movement of Felix Mendelsohn's Symphony No. 5. The 
service runs from 5:30 to 7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaller services located far from densely populated areas include one at Val 
Verde Park, starting at 6 a.m. and sponsored by the Val Verde Civic Assn., and 
another in Lake Los Angeles, at the intersection of 178th Street East and 
Queensglen in the Antelope Valley, starting at 6:30 a.m. and sponsored by St. 
Barnabas in the Desert Lutheran Church. 
</P>
<P>
 At Vasquez Rocks Park near Agua Dulce, a service sponsored by the Kiwanis Club 
of Newhall-Saugus will commence at 6:45 a.m. The speaker will be the Rev. Ron 
McCoy of the Santa Clarita Church of Religious Science. 
</P>
<P>
 Other sunrise rites organized by single congregations and to be held on public 
parkland include the following: 
</P>
<P>
 * 6 a.m., Porter Ridge Park with the Rev. Christine Beitzel of First 
Presbyterian Church of Granada Hills speaking; 
</P>
<P>
 * 6:30 a.m., at the Crystal Springs area of Griffith Park with the Rev. 
Marlene Morris of Burbank-Toluca Lake First Church of Religious Science 
speaking; 
</P>
<P>
 * 7 a.m., in the garden area of Casa Verdugo de San Rafael Park in Glendale 
with the Rev. Alan Strout of Glendale First United Methodist Church speaking. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Protestant churches will hold early services Sunday on their own grounds 
or in their chapels. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the more unusual will be a bilingual, joint service of Valley Korean 
Presbyterian Church and St. Paul's United Methodist at 6:30 a.m. in the patio 
of the latter church at 5619 Lindley Ave., Tarzana. A continental breakfast 
will be served after the service. 
</P>
<P>
 At Westlake Village, the ecumenical sunrise service at Valley Oaks Memorial 
Park, which is on Lindero Canyon Road, has changed as the crowds grew larger 
through the years. 
</P>
<P>
 The gathering is no longer held on the hilltop near the statue of a kneeling 
Christ, but in the parking lot of the Pierce Brothers-owned cemetery. The 
seated participants can still see the hilltop statue and in recent years the 
cemetery management has brought in sheep to graze on the hill. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it's a distraction watching the shepherd dog working the sheep," 
Bos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning for the service rotates each year among the Methodist, Lutheran, 
Presbyterian, Congregational, Episcopal and two Catholic churches in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Maximilian Kolbe Catholic Church has the assignment this year and its 
pastor, Msgr. Peter O'Reilly, will deliver the Easter message. 
</P>
<P>
 Bos, who is 65 and hopes to serve in interim pastor posts during his 
retirement, will do one of the Scripture readings and will call for the 
offering.

CITY COUNCIL PUTS TATTOO STUDIO ON HOLD; CLAREMONT: PARLOR, WHICH HAS RELOCATED 
NEAR CITY HALL, IS PROHIBITED FROM OPENING FOR FOUR MONTHS. LACK OF HEALTH 
REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE INDUSTRY CITED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE CARLSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A tattoo studio has gotten under the skin of the Claremont City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Claremont Tattoo operated with no complaints for 18 months out of a store on 
Foothill Boulevard. But then the business moved to 225 Yale Ave. in the heart 
of The Village, a shopping district a block from City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The relocation put the needle to council members and other Village merchants, 
who feel a tattoo studio would attract an unsavory crowd and spoil the shopping 
area's family atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 So the council, citing a lack of health regulations governing the tattoo 
industry, approved an urgency ordinance that prohibits the studio from opening 
for four months. During that time, the city will investigate the risks of 
spreading disease via the use and disposal of the needles used in tattooing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Such an action is authorized under a state Government Code section that allows 
the council to adopt, by a four-fifths majority, an urgency ordinance necessary 
for "the immediate preservation of the public peace, health or safety." The 
measure passed, 4-1, with Councilman Nicholas L. Presecan the sole dissenter. 
</P>
<P>
 The March 22 decision, which came a day after the studio opened, left the 
shop's owners shaking their heads. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're looking for something to throw us out on and they haven't (found it), 
so they've come up with this," said co-manager Leah Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
 "They feel they're too uppity to have a tattoo shop in their city," said 
Pierce, who runs the family-owned studio with her brother, Buddy Tanner. She 
emphasized that the shop, which already has a retail sales license and sells 
incense, silver jewelry and temporary tattoos as well as permanent ones, never 
had any problems from the city at its old location. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "My brother tattooed over 25 Pomona police officers, some teachers and some 
housewives. We get a lot of students. It's not your 'Hell's Angels-type' 
clientele. We use disposable needles and have a hazardous-waste company come 
pick them up," Pierce said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just blatant discrimination," she said. 'We were closer to Pomona at our 
last location, and they must have figured we were far enough away. Now that 
we're one block from City Hall, we're just too close to them," said Pierce, who 
said she is researching the possibility of filing a lawsuit against the city. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials say public safety, not location, is the major reason for 
the four-month wait. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are lots of needles in this process and no (legal) regulations as to 
how they can be disposed. There seems to be a real void in health regulations 
here," City Manager Glenn D. Southard said. 
</P>
<P>
 A city report on the proposed tattoo studio quotes a study by the Centers for 
Disease Control that describes tattooing as "a process by which blood-borne 
pathogens, including . . . hepatitis B virus and HIV, may be transmitted to or 
from customers and employees."

SUIT FILED OVER CLUB'S DISPOSAL OF HORSE MANURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN WOODWARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Horse manure studded with barbed wire was dumped on a neighbor's property in 
Rolling Hills Estates over a span of several years and accumulated into a 
50-foot-tall pile, according to a suit filed in Torrance Superior Court.  
</P>
<P>
 The Chandler Land Trust is asking the court to force the Empty Saddle Club to 
remove the waste, which it says rests on land the trust recently sold for a 
nature preserve. 
</P>
<P>
 For decades, the club disposed of manure in a small canyon on its property. In 
early 1990, the manure spontaneously exploded, prompting the club to smother it 
with dirt to avoid further fires.

 All the activity alerted the owners of the trust, which had land on Buckskin 
Lane adjacent to saddle club property. Since the suit was filed, the trust sold 
its 28-acre parcel of open land to the Palos Verdes Peninsula Land Conservancy 
and the city of Rolling Hills Estates.

SMALL FISH MAY PLAY BIG ROLE IN FATE OF LAGOON; ENVIRONMENT: ACTIVISTS PREDICT 
THE GOBY'S INCLUSION ON ENDANGERED SPECIES LIST WILL PROVIDE IMPETUS TO CLEAN 
UP THE WATER NEAR MALIBU CREEK.

 It is a tiny, unremarkable fish that feeds off microorganisms at the bottom of 
estuaries. But the unsung goby, environmentalists predict, just might provide 
the impetus for a solution to the decade-long controversy over how to clean up 
and restore Malibu Lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
 In the month since the goby was added to the federal endangered species list, 
residents, surfers, environmentalists and government agencies have been waiting 
to see how the U.S. Department of Fish and Wildlife plans to ensure the 
survival of the two-inch-long fish, which lives and breeds in the brackish, 
polluted lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
 To maintain the goby's habitat, the state Department of Parks and Recreation 
is expected to adopt the Fish and Wildlife Department's guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan is expected to call for strict regulation of mechanical breaching of 
a sandy berm that separates the lagoon from the ocean. State parks department 
employees bulldoze sections of the berm when the lagoon water reaches the brim 
so that septic tanks that feed into the lagoon do not back up. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But breaching the berm can harm the goby because the practice upsets the 
balance of salt and fresh water in the lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The guidelines, due in a few months, probably won't include recommendations to 
eliminate the lagoon's bacteria and disease-causing microorganisms because such 
pathogens have been found not to harm the goby. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists nevertheless are optimistic that the goby may indirectly 
help the movement to clean up the lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
 If closely regulated breaching can be achieved to protect the goby, the 
thinking goes, then clearing the bureaucratic wrangling among government 
agencies that has blocked the cleaning up of the lagoon can't be far behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the (federal endangered species) listing is going to be the driving 
force and catalyst to get restoration going," said Mark Gold, scientist for 
Heal the Bay. "Hopefully it will also get us off the dime to clean up the storm 
drain runoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The goby has disappeared from half of California's few remaining wetlands and 
has been listed as a "state species of special concern" by the state Fish and 
Game Department for more than five years. Tidewater goby live in estuaries from 
Humboldt to San Diego counties, where, according to Cat Brown, a wildlife 
biologist with the U.S. Department of Fish and Wildlife, they are in imminent 
danger of extinction. 
</P>
<P>
 The goby died off in the lagoon in the 1960s when the dredging of Malibu Creek 
and bulldozing of the upper lagoon for flood control covered the course, sandy 
bottom of the lagoon with sediment, destroying the goby's nesting area, said 
Sean Manion, an ecologist with the Topanga-Las Virgenes Resource Conservation 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, 1991, Manion, using an $18,000 state parks department grant, 
reintroduced 52 goby to the Malibu Lagoon. They have reproduced to 500. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say, 'What is so special about the goby?' " Manion said. "It's just 
one more cog in the wheel of biodiversity interconnected to all other species 
ecologically, including man. The fear ecologists have is that you take a 
species out and there will be an environmental ripple effect or a cascade of 
extinctions to follow." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The lagoon, located at the mouth of Malibu Creek at Surfrider Beach, has been 
polluted by treated sewage flowing in from the Tapia Water Reclamation Plant 
along the creek as well as pesticides and human and animal waste from 
communities upstream. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the pollutants have had little effect on the goby, whose worst threat 
is the rapid increase of water salinity brought on by breaching. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks employees began bulldozing the berm in 1983 after Malibu residents 
complained that their septic tanks were backing up. The berm is breached 
whenever the water level of the lagoon reaches 3.5 feet above the average low 
tide, Manion said. 
</P>
<P>
 Surfers, or "the shovel brigade," as they have been nicknamed, dig out their 
own break to avoid natural breaching, which occurs in the middle of Surfrider 
Beach's long wave break. 
</P>
<P>
 Some environmentalists believe surfers pose the greatest threat to the goby. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a bad situation," said Rainer Hoenecke, a scientist for the Santa Monica 
Bay Restoration Project. "You are going to have to keep an officer posted there 
to keep surfers from shoveling out breaks." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said she is confident that surfers, who are generally environmentally 
conscious, will curb their breaching of the berm for the sake of the goby once 
they learn more about the fish. 
</P>
<P>
 The second greatest threat to the goby, Manion said, is runoff from soil 
tilling, which disturbs the course, sandy bottom of the lagoon that the goby 
depends on for nesting and breeding.

VOLUNTEERS LET LIBRARY ADD A DAY; BOOKS: THE PROGRAM AT THE LOMITA BRANCH IS 
THE FIRST COUNTY-RUN FACILITY THAT COMMITS ITS SIX AIDES TO A FIXED NUMBER OF 
HOURS A WEEK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Patrons of the Lomita Library were up in arms about cutbacks. Now, some of 
them are getting down to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a program started last month, six volunteers are working regular 
schedules to perform some of the library's most basic tasks. The Lomita branch 
is the first county-run library to try the program, which has allowed it to 
stay open three days a week instead of two. 
</P>
<P>
 "Putting books back on the shelves may not seem like a big deal," said Linda 
Shimane, library manager in Lomita. "But having volunteers do some of this work 
has allowed us to add an extra day of service to the community." 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteers, most of them retired, shelve books, organize magazine racks 
and examine materials for damage. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although the county has long used volunteers for such duties, library 
officials said the Lomita program is the first in which volunteers follow a 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers donating their time must sign an agreement committing them to a fixed 
number of hours, generally four or five a week. In addition, city officials 
must agree to recruit enough volunteers to keep the library open for a third 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big responsibility to recruit people to work on a regular basis," said 
Sandra Reuben, the county's head librarian. "It can be hard to find someone 
who's willing to put in the time every week." 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange, Reuben said, the county pays for the extra time spent by 
librarians and other workers on the third day the library is open. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in Hawthorne and Bellflower have expressed interest in bringing the 
program to their cities, Reuben said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 However, budget problems may bring an end to the program before many libraries 
have a chance to adopt it. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said they may temporarily close up to 49 of the county's 87 
libraries because of a potential $9-million shortfall. The closures could come 
as early as July. Small libraries, such as the branch in Lomita, will probably 
be the first victims, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lomita is borderline because of its location and its size," Reuben said. 
"It's not nearly as large as the library in Carson, which is about six miles 
away." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to talk about what will happen in July," said volunteer Kathe 
Hull, a homemaker. "This program has been going wonderfully. It's been a real 
boon to this community to have the library open an extra day. But it will go 
for nothing if the library closes." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The fear that Lomita might lose its library has prompted some council members 
and candidates in April's election to suggest buying it from the county. 
</P>
<P>
 However, some have said such proposals overlook the advantages of belonging to 
a county system that gives them access to more than 5 million books. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the real bonus to the way it is now with the county system," Mayor 
Charles Belba said. "We haven't done a study on taking over the library. When 
it gets down to hard-core discussion, we have to look at where the money would 
come from." 
</P>
<P>
 Another plan to save the library is tied to the city's movement to secede from 
the Los Angeles Unified School District. If the city forms its own school 
district, it might be able to pay for an independent library with education 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 "But those are a lot of ifs, " said Barbara Learnard, vice president of the 
Friends of Lomita Library.

EDISON SAYS FEAR OF QUAKE LIQUEFACTION UNFOUNDED; PREPAREDNESS: UTILITY TELLS 
CONCERNED REDONDO RESIDENTS ANY DAMAGE WOULD BE CONFINED TO THE PLANT. BUT SOME 
CITY OFFICIALS ARE NOT CONVINCED. 
</P>

 After the Northridge earthquake turned the soil under a King Harbor Marina 
parking lot to car-swallowing, goopy muck, some Redondo Beach residents gazed 
across Harbor Drive at the Southern California Edison electrical generating 
plant and wondered if a bigger earthquake might cause the plant to collapse -- 
with catastrophic results for surrounding residents and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, a delegation of Edison representatives appeared before the city 
Environmental and Public Utilities Commission to provide information on 
earthquake risk assessment at the generating plant. The Edison representatives' 
conclusion: 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing to worry about. 
</P>
<P>
 Probably. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a worst-case scenario . . . we believe any problems would be confined to 
the plant itself and not pose a danger to the community," generating station 
manager Jerry Berquist told the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 A major concern centers on "liquefaction," the phenomenon in which loose, wet 
soil can suddenly turn into a jelly-like substance when subjected to the 
violent shaking of an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Jan. 17 quake, Redondo Beach, though 28 miles from the epicenter, 
incurred at least $2.5 million in damage at King Harbor Marina when a parking 
lot built on a sandy spit collapsed, and about a dozen parked cars sank 6 feet 
into a mucky chasm. The collapse was attributed to liquefaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Ostrom, an Edison engineer and earthquake specialist, told the 
commission that while the plant rests atop soil that could be subject to 
liquefaction, it is supported by pilings driven 30 to 50 feet into the ground, 
below the potential liquefaction area. By contrast, the earthquake-damaged 
marina area was slabs of asphalt and concrete supported only by the underlying 
soil. 
</P>
<P>
 Ostrom said before the meeting that he was not aware of any liquefaction under 
the plant as a result of the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our plants have been exposed to earthquakes in the past," Ostrom told the 
commission. "They've been exposed to liquefaction. So far there has been no 
consequence of liquefaction. . . . Certainly there has been no danger to people 
outside the facility." 
</P>
<P>
 Ostrom added that generating plants "are known for being low-risk facilities." 
</P>
<P>
 But not everyone was convinced. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Tom O'Leary, who makes no secret of his opposition to having the 
power plant in Redondo Beach, earthquakes or no earthquakes, said the Edison 
representatives were basing their assurances on faulty assumptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "What has happened up to now has no bearing on what could happen in the 
future," O'Leary said. "We have facing us the danger of stronger earthquakes."  
</P>
<P>
 Although Edison representatives said the nearest known major fault line, the 
Newport-Inglewood fault, lies about 2.5 miles away, O'Leary said the Northridge 
earthquake showed earthquakes can occur in areas where scientists never 
expected them. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Leary and other commission members wanted to know what would happen if a 
huge earthquake, say an 8.0, occurred near the plant. Would natural gas or 
electrical fires erupt? Underground ammonia tanks burst? Power lines collapse? 
</P>
<P>
 Liquefaction could occur under the plant with a nearby 7.5 quake, the Edison 
representatives said, and there could be fires and pipe ruptures. But again, 
Berquist insisted, any danger would be confined to the plant site. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Cal Ed guys' presentation was incomplete and unconvincing," O'Leary said 
after the meeting. "All they said was, 'As far as we can tell, everything will 
be all right.' "  
</P>
<P>
 "A power plant is a very dangerous industrial application," said Redondo Beach 
resident John Dancy, a retired aerospace engineer who attended the meeting. 
"You got the feeling (from the Edison presentation) that everything is flying 
on automatic pilot, that they just hope and pray nothing will happen." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Leary said an informal group of residents intends to analyze the Edison 
presentation and may have more questions.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA MEN'S FINAL FOUR; REMAINING UP FRONT WITH HOPES FOR 
TITLE; GAME 1: ARKANSAS HAS THE ADVANTAGE IN SIZE, BUT ARIZONA SAYS IT WON'T BE 
INTIMIDATED, EVEN WITH THE PRESIDENT WATCHING.

 How big is it? 
</P>
<P>
 It's so big President Clinton is going to quit rafting Whitewater long enough 
to be here. 
</P>
<P>
 It's bigger than Darnell Robinson's jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 It's bigger than the initials tattooed on Joseph Blair's belly. 
</P>
<P>
 It's showdown time here in the Queen City, where fast and beefy Arkansas meets 
even faster but less beefy Arizona in what is expected to be a bump-and-run 
semifinal in the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, it's probably going to be physical, especially because the only things 
higher than the Razorbacks are the prices at the souvenir stands. 
</P>
<P>
 But Arizona's 6-foot-8, 240-pound Blair said the Wildcats have come too far to 
back down now. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to punk out or anything," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 You have Arizona's three-point shooting guards and Arkansas' three-point 
shooting forwards, the subdued Lute Olson and the volatile Nolan Richardson, 
Arkansas' bulk and depth and . . . well, Arizona doesn't have either of those. 
</P>
<P>
 That should be enough to tilt the game in the Razorbacks' favor; they feature 
players who spend their free time blotting out the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief among them is 6-7, 245-pound Corliss Williamson, who sounded an ominous 
note Friday at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just looking forward to a real physical basketball game," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He is not the only Razorback with that idea. Also hoping that the style of 
game is reminiscent of a compound fracture are the 6-11, 260-pound Robinson, 
6-8, 260-pound Dwight Stewart and 6-11, 250-pound Lee Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time anything so big and so fast was in the same place, it was a 
tractor pull. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats have tried their best to put up a brave front, but they know the 
score. They simply are outnumbered. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Arizona's gunners. Guards Khalid Reeves and Damon Stoudamire scored 53 of 
Arizona's 92 points against Missouri in the West Regional final. Meanwhile, 
Richardson can go nine deep into his Razorback trough. 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie Geary said the game will be won defensively, but the Wildcat guard 
added that the Arizona players are outnumbered offensively. 
</P>
<P>
 "We only have two ways to score," he said. "They have about 10, so that's 
going to make our job a little more difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 Stoudamire broke Arizona's task down into two parts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key for us is to stop their outside game and their inside game," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Arkansas to lose, it generally is conceded that the Razorbacks must wilt 
under Arizona's defensive pressure, shoot poorly and get into foul trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 For all three to happen probably is a stretch, but that's the hope to which 
Arizona clings. Blair said that the Wildcats are not going to be intimidated by 
Arkansas' size and strength, not to mention their bald heads. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, it's Final Four time and I didn't come this far to go back home 
chillin'," he said. "I'll push you out of my way. Even if I have to push two at 
a time, I'll do it. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have been comin' up to me on the streets and telling me, 'Arkansas is 
going to kick your butts,' and when I hear something like that, well, that's 
about what you hear just before you get into a fight." 
</P>
<P>
 It might not be a fair fight. Arkansas can throw 6-foot-7 three-point bomber 
Scotty Thurman at the Wildcats, who can't match him with anyone up front. 
Arizona's guards have an edge, but when big Razorbacks start firing from long 
distance and assert their influence inside, too, the Wildcats might be in 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Thurman gave Arizona credit, sort of. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have the best offensive backcourt in the country and we feel we have the 
best defensive backcourt in the country," he said. "We'll see who has the 
better night." 
</P>
<P>
 Thurman said he hasn't seen Arizona's kind of quickness since the last 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't faced a team with that much quickness in a game," Thurman said. 
"In practice, we face that much quickness every day." MATCHUPS, STATISTICS

EUROPE; EU HAS CHANGE OF HEART TOWARD NATIONS TO EAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TYLER MARSHALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During the massive street protests that accompanied Eastern Europe's 
anti-Communist revolutions during the fall of 1989, demonstrators frequently 
carried with them a blue flag bearing a circle of 12 gold stars. 
</P>
<P>
 The flag -- that of the 12-nation European Union, formerly the European 
Community -- symbolized the aspirations of those from the long-oppressed East, 
not just to partake of the affluence that has come to characterize the social 
democracies of Western Europe but also to embrace the values of a union built 
on free-market economics, political consensus and social justice. 
</P>
<P>
 The hard realities that have followed in the years since have been tough to 
digest even for the most optimistic Eastern Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
 The EU quickly restricted access to its own markets by the struggling new 
democracies, slapping protective tariffs on key products such as steel and 
agricultural goods and generally treating its newly free eastern neighbors as 
poor, unexpected relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, the union has been the largest single aid donor to the former 
Soviet satellite states, giving them $24 billion through last June. It has 
entered into formal "association" agreements with five countries to intensify 
economic cooperation and political dialogue. And 17 months ago, the 
organization accepted the principle of eventual full membership for Poland, 
Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia -- although the commitment seemed 
halfhearted and the timing vague. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, however, the EU's attitude has changed -- dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 Spurred mainly by growing fears about the future stability of Russia and 
nudged firmly by the union's most ardent expansionist, German Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl, the EU is launching a drive to lock the east in a secure embrace and bury 
the continent's old East-West divide. 
</P>
<P>
 The sense of urgency in the recently completed negotiations to admit Sweden, 
Norway, Finland and Austria stems in part from the belief that the addition of 
the four rich states is essential to counterbalance the impact of the EU's next 
enlargement -- certain to include at least some of the struggling eastern 
democracies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must move more quickly," declared EU Executive Commission President 
Jacques Delors, referring to the union's relations with the new eastern 
democracies. "We have to demonstrate that we take them seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference in Bonn last week, Kohl added, "It would be intolerable 
for us to adopt an attitude that we wanted to create some sort of closed shop." 
</P>
<P>
 Kohl's remarks came on the same day the EU's 17 commissioners came together 
here in a special half-day meeting to review a detailed proposal for forging 
closer ties with six eastern countries -- Bulgaria, Romania and the four 
nations expected to join first -- all once part of the Soviet Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, which includes a sharp rollback of the EU's trade restrictions, 
an end to EU subsidies for agricultural products exported to the east, an 
$8-billion, five-year aid program aimed mainly at improving roads and other 
communications links with Western Europe, and a much closer political dialogue, 
is expected to form an important part of the union's work when Germany takes 
over the rotating presidency in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Germany is the nation most committed to the EU's swift enlargement to the 
east. Indeed, Kohl last week indicated that he would like to see Polish, Czech, 
Hungarian and Slovak leaders attending the EU's semiannual summit meetings in 
an observer status. 
</P>
<P>
 But most heartening of all for the eastern countries is the shift in tone 
within the EU on full membership. Instead of loosely worded references to 
"around the turn of the century," EU leaders now talk in more concrete terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "The union (should) fix a date -- 1997 seems reasonable -- to review progress 
toward membership," commented EU External Affairs Commissioner Hans van den 
Broek in a speech last month. 
</P>
<P>
 For some, even this timetable is slow. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting beside Delors at a news conference here last month, Czech Prime 
Minister Vaclav Klaus demanded his country be included immediately in a 
free-trade zone with the EU. 
</P>
<P>
 As if to echo this urgency, Hungary formally applied for EU membership on 
Friday, and Poland is expected to follow later this month.

TURMOIL FOR INVESTORS; SELL? HOLD? SOME ANSWERS FOR THE EDGY; Q & A 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF and TOM PETRUNO, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Will the plunge resume when financial markets reopen Monday? That's what 
investors are wondering. And if it does, what's an investor to do? Sell -- and 
risk losing a fortune in a market panic? Or hold on -- knowing that the value 
of your securities might drop in the short run? 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone's situation -- and portfolio -- is different. But here are some 
questions and answers to guide your thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q I'm worried that my stock and bond mutual funds are dropping in price. What 
should I do? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Think about why you bought the funds in the first place. Did you buy them 
for short-term appreciation, for annual income or for long-term growth? If your 
answer falls into one of the two latter categories, your best bet is probably 
to sit tight. It may hurt to watch, but temporary market upheaval shouldn't 
change your plans. 
</P>
<P>
 If you bought for short-term appreciation, you are a speculator and ought to 
get used to sickening bumps. Trying to earn high short-term returns is a risky 
game. Markets like these underscore the point. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q If this is a bear market -- where stocks continue to slide for a long period 
-- wouldn't it be smarter to sell now and buy back in later? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Absolutely. But no one really knows whether a bear market has begun, or 
whether this is a typical market "correction" of 10% to 15%. There's a chance 
that you'd sell now and end up having to repurchase your shares at a higher 
price, if the market quickly rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q I bought a bond fund for the high yield it pays, but now I'm worried about 
my principal value. What should I do? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A If your goal is to obtain regular income, you shouldn't do anything. The 
fact is, regardless of what happens to your fund's share price, you will still 
get interest earnings on your bonds. But it is true that if you bought the bond 
fund fairly recently -- within the last year -- it is very likely that your 
principal value has declined. If you bought the fund several years ago, when 
interest rates were higher, it's possible that you've still got a net gain on 
your investment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q What if the market crashes on Monday? I'm tempted to call my fund company 
this weekend and tell them to cash me out now. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Unfortunately, that won't save you from any losses generated by trading 
Monday. Generally speaking, you would get the net-asset-value price as of the 
close of business on the day you call or on the following business day. In this 
case, that means Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q Am I assured that I can get my money out of a fund, even if the market 
plunges? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yes. However, funds are legally allowed five business days to process your 
redemption request -- which means they may not send your check until Monday, 
April 11, if you make a redemption this coming Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, if you are redeeming securities worth $250,000 or more, there is 
an obscure Securities and Exchange Commission rule that gives funds the right 
to pay you in securities -- the stocks or bonds that you invested in through 
the fund -- rather than cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, this has never happened -- and is not likely to happen in the 
future, says Malin Jennings, a spokeswoman for the Investment Company 
Institute. It's simply a fail-safe clause designed to deal with the possibility 
that a fund, facing the equivalent of a run on the bank, would not have enough 
cash to pay all investors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q Couldn't that happen if the market falls sharply enough Monday? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Conceivably, yes. However, when the stock market fell 508 points on Oct. 19, 
1987 -- the worst single-day decline since the Great Depression -- only 2% of 
mutual fund investors cashed in their shares. Funds had cash reserves equal to 
10% of their assets and generally had no trouble paying shareholders. 
Currently, funds have about 8.5% of their assets in cash on average, Jennings 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q If people have a lot of time before they need their money, it's fine to tell 
them to remain calm. But I'm only a few years from retirement; I can't risk a 
major loss right now. What am I supposed to do? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A If you need your money soon, you should cash out at least a portion now, 
some advisers say. But if you've got a few years to go, you ought to keep cool 
-- even if the market craters Monday. By selling into a panic, you may be 
assured the lowest possible price. Securities prices -- in good times or bad -- 
bounce around a lot. If you've have the time and the constitution for it, you 
can wait for a bounce. 
</P>
<P>
 You may still lose some of your principal, but probably not as much as you 
would have lost if you had sold into a panic. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q Q: I've got a lot of time before I need my money, so I'm not so worried 
about one day's trading. But I am wondering whether I should continue making my 
regular investments. Does it make sense to stop investing for a while while I 
try to figure out which way the wind is blowing? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Sure. Given the uncertain direction of stock and bond prices, you might want 
to wait a while before pouring a lot of money into stock and bond funds. But if 
you've set up a regular investment program -- where you're buying small amounts 
of stock or bond funds monthly or quarterly -- you shouldn't tinker with it; as 
the market drops, you'll be picking up more shares. In the long run, this 
"dollar-cost-averaging" approach generally works well for small investors who 
don't want to time the market. T-Bond Yields Soar 
</P>
<P>
 Long-term Treasury bond yeilds rocketed in Friday's shortened trading session 
to 7.26% from 7.08% on Thursday, as bond investors reacted with horror to the 
government's report of massive new job creation in March. Investors fear an 
overheated economy will reignite inflation.

BORROWING TROUBLE; SMALL-FIRM OWNERS STILL AWAITING SBA QUAKE RELIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To hear some small businesses tell it, the Northridge earthquake was only the 
first jolt. The aftershocks began when they turned to the Small Business 
Administration for help. 
</P>
<P>
 Most small-business owners are still waiting for assistance as the SBA doles 
out the money at a snail's pace -- and with homeowners at the front of the 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 The now-familiar list of destruction from the Jan. 17 temblor -- at least 57 
dead, up to $20 billion in losses, six freeways mangled, more than 4,300 
buildings damaged -- includes losses for at least 100,000 small companies, most 
of which had no earthquake insurance to cover the blow to buildings, inventory, 
equipment and revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the SBA has approved more than $700 million in low-interest loans, but 
mostly for homeowners. Barely $2.6 million has reached business owners. 
</P>
<P>
 The demand for disaster assistance seems to have overwhelmed the agency. But 
beyond the gargantuan snags, the hard truth is that many businesses -- already 
in hock to the hilt or teetering from the effects of the long Southland 
recession -- simply can't qualify for SBA loans. 
</P>
<P>
 And for the businesses that can't qualify, there is not much help available. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really angry, because they give you this big BS scenario about $8.6 
billion to help repair earthquake damage. Well, where is it?" complained one 
Santa Monica retailer, who asked that her name not be used so customers and 
suppliers won't discover the financial mess that the earthquake has left her 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman said she applied for a $20,000 loan from the SBA to cover damage to 
her store's contents as well as loss of business. Weeks later, the SBA could 
not tell her whether additional paperwork she sent had arrived safely. 
</P>
<P>
 Several blocks away, in one of Santa Monica's hardest-hit retail areas, the 
quake bounced Jason Douglas-Hiley out of his hair salon, the Yellow Balloon, 
which caters to children. Only the hospitality of a nearby beauty shop owner 
allowed him to stay in business until he was allowed back into his own salon 
two weeks ago. The SBA has been decidedly less helpful, he said, misplacing his 
request for business and home loan applications for more than a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very frustrating," said Douglas-Hiley, who has yet to see an SBA damage 
"verifier" at his business. A verifier finally appeared at his damaged 
Northridge home on March 24, "so at least I'm starting to feel like there's 
some movement." He and his wife, Denise, have spent hours on the phone and in 
disaster assistance centers to straighten out the problem, in between tending 
for their infant daughter, born one week after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have 12 employees," Douglas-Hiley said as he passed out balloons and hand 
stamps to his squirming clientele. "Those people have to make a living. 
Southern California is not in great shape anyway."

 Similar tales abound of endlessly busy phone lines, misplaced paperwork, 
delays, verifiers who don't show and questions on loan forms that can't be 
answered. Small Business Administration officials acknowledge that there have 
been problems but insist that they are attacking them and improving the 
agency's performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly not all the reviews have been bad. The SBA has received praise for 
its quick response and flexibility in the early days after the earthquake, 
including an on-the-spot decision by SBA chief Erskine B. Bowles during a 
Southern California tour of destruction to raise the $1.5-million loan limit 
for individual loans to some small and medium-size companies. Victims have 
lauded the kindness and patience of SBA and Federal Emergency Management Agency 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 But many small companies that turned to the SBA for help now are finding that 
the agency is severely backlogged, with loan applications stacked up more than 
two months after the costliest natural disaster it has ever faced. 
</P>
<P>
 Others who had sought aid said they simply gave up when confronted with the 
rigorous paperwork requirements to get an SBA business disaster or economic 
injury loan. And these are the new, simpler loan applications developed after 
last year's Midwest floods. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, bashing the SBA and FEMA, its partner in disaster relief, is always 
a favorite post-cataclysm sport. FEMA, the umbrella agency for emergency 
assistance, was reorganized last year after damning evaluations of its 
performance following the 1992 Los Angeles riots, Northern California's Loma 
Prieta earthquake, Hurricane Andrew in Florida and Hurricane Iniki in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 The SBA, which hands out government low-interest loans to homeowners and 
businesses after a disaster, also did some program tinkering last year. The 
paperwork requirements for business loans were cut in half. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, part of the grousing stems from the sheer magnitude of the 
disaster. In addition, Clinton Administration officials who promised speedy 
help right after the shaking stopped have acknowledged that they may have 
raised victims' hopes unrealistically. 
</P>
<P>
 But underneath all the growing frustration is a kind of innocence lost as, one 
by one, business owners discover an ugly fact about disasters: Damage to your 
home is bad, but damage to your business is worse. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because most disaster relief historically has been geared toward 
middle-class homeowners. Entrepreneurs, including owners of commercial 
apartment buildings, come in a distant second, said Mary Comerio, a UC Berkeley 
architecture professor who studied FEMA and SBA response to housing problems 
after the Loma Prieta earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the government's relief programs were developed for rural areas where 
there was less need to help apartment or business owners, she said. There is no 
equivalent of FEMA housing vouchers or grants for private enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are lots of misperceptions around in the public mind," Comerio said. 
"One is that the government will help you after a disaster. Another is that it 
all will be OK soon. In reality, rebuilding takes a tremendous amount of time." 
</P>
<P>
 Don Ivone has already figured that out. The Burbank real estate broker 
suffered $50,000 worth of broken windows, wall cracks and water damage when a 
pipe in his office's ceiling burst during the quake. He applied for an SBA loan 
two months ago and can't find out where his application stands. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've made several phone calls and we've been left in Muzak limbo forever, 
and it just becomes cost prohibitive for us to stay on the phone," said Ivone, 
president of California Real Estate Services. "We're like the Energizer bunny. 
We're still waiting, still waiting." 
</P>
<P>
 For the SBA, responding to the Northridge earthquake has been akin to setting 
up a Fortune 500 company almost overnight. What's more, this instant 
organization must deal with complicated financial documents and a crush of 
customers who have just been through one of the worst experiences of their 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, we've had many opportunities to get better and better at it," 
said Tom MacKenzie, Sacramento-based assistant administrator for the SBA's 
sprawling Western region. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, that meant jumping within a few weeks from 300 to more than 2,500 
employees handling disaster response in the region. More than half were new, 
untrained hires. Telephone lines and nearly 100 operators were added. 
Facilities were rented and furnished. 
</P>
<P>
 Raining down on them was an unexpected torrent of loan applications from 
homeowners and businesses. In the two and a half months since the quake, the 
SBA already has received more applications for earthquake-related disaster 
loans than it collected after any other disaster -- even months later, when it 
came time to close the books. Even so, the SBA is averaging more than $20 
million in loan approvals a day; agency officials used to consider $5 million 
in approvals a good day. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the agency has won many fans with its initial fancy footwork. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the most impressive response I've ever seen from a government agency," 
said John J. Rooney, president of the Valley Economic Development Center, a 
nonprofit organization that estimates it has helped more than 5,000 companies 
fill out earthquake disaster loan applications. "My hat is off to them." 
</P>
<P>
 In the first month alone, the SBA issued nearly 300,000 applications and got 
back slightly more than 46,000. By comparison, applications issued after 
Hurricane Andrew -- the previous record-holder in the disaster derby -- reached 
nearly 48,000 in the first month; 5,700 were sent back completed. 
</P>
<P>
 The SBA shuffled more paper (5,715 applications processed) and approved more 
money ($93.3 million in home and business loans) in the first month after the 
quake than ever before. But despite that pace, the proportion of applications 
processed actually was much smaller than in previous disasters, because the 
demand was so huge. About 40,000 applications sat unprocessed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big challenge for them is, because they're going to have an unprecedented 
number of applications filed, getting them processed," Rooney said. "They have 
such a big bubble to swallow." 
</P>
<P>
 Bernard Kulik has been running the SBA's disaster assistance program for 12 
years -- long enough to earn the nickname "Master of Disaster." Kulik defends 
has agency's response while acknowledging that there have been problems in 
getting loan applications through the system. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're knocking ourselves out to do it. We're attacking it tooth and nail," 
Kulik said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, we're not doing it as fast as we would like," he said. "Whatever 
delay we're dealing with is because of the volume. The numbers are enormous." 
</P>
<P>
 On average, it is taking the SBA two to three weeks to process home loan 
applications to the point of approval or rejection and four to six weeks for 
business loans. Businesses can receive loans for actual damages as well as for 
"economic injury" suffered because they were closed for a time or because 
revenues dropped after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 As of March 31, the SBA had approved 1,319 business and economic injury loans 
totaling $75.9 million and 23,724 home loans totaling $664 million. But of 
those totals, the agency had actually issued only 238 checks to businesses for 
a total of $2.6 million. Homeowners had been issued 4,215 checks totaling $40.7 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners have been getting a bigger chunk of the cash primarily because such 
loans are easier to process, Kulik said, adding that the SBA has no formal 
policy putting homeowners ahead of business owners after a disaster. The amount 
of money actually in the hands of business owners so far appears relatively 
small partly because the SBA pays out in installments and because the agency 
cannot control how quickly applicants return their closing documents, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But here's another fact that upsets many entrepreneurs: Of the 50,000 or so 
companies that are expected to apply for SBA loans, 15,000 to 25,000 of them 
will never see a dime. 
</P>
<P>
 Plenty of homeowners will be rejected, too, but the turn-down rate on those 
loans is lower; homeowners generally have been in better shape financially than 
businesses and can more easily qualify for the income-based loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses have a harder time demonstrating that they are credit-worthy. Many 
earthquake-damaged companies had already been slapped around by the recession 
and the restructuring of the aerospace and financial services industries. To 
them, credit was a foreign word even before the earthquake struck. 
</P>
<P>
 "So many of these businesses were just hanging on by their fingernails, and 
they're just not going to qualify," said Jack Kyser, economist for the Economic 
Development Corp. of Los Angeles County, a nonprofit jobs promotion agency. 
"The SBA is being a prudent lender. These are loans, not grants." 
</P>
<P>
 The SBA's Kulik said the disaster loan program was not set up to help with 
pre-existing economic problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a lending organization, but by law we have to find a reasonable 
ability to repay," Kulik said. "We don't make loans if the only way we can 
collect is to foreclose." 
</P>
<P>
 If a homeowner is denied a loan, that person is referred to a grant program 
administered by FEMA and the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, there is no safety net for business. There is no grant program 
that underpins business," Kulik said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many businesses damaged in the 1992 riots found FEMA and SBA unresponsive. The 
overall rejection rate was 50% to 60% for loan and grant programs to homeowners 
and businesses after the disturbances, studies found at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 After the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake, few businesses in the severely 
damaged Whittier business district saw any SBA loan money for nearly a year, 
according to a National Science Foundation-funded study conducted by Robert 
Bolin, a professor at New Mexico State University. Between the slow funding and 
local redevelopment controversies, little rebuilding occurred in that time, 
Bolin found. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing such experiences, disaster relief expert Richard Walden had once wanted 
to see FEMA abolished, though he now thinks the agency is doing a better job. 
Still, he would like to see the SBA ease up even more on its lending 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 "These little mom-and-pop businesses find it almost impossible to convince the 
SBA that they are viable," said Walden, president of Operation USA, an 
international, nonprofit, disaster relief and development organization. "In a 
post-disaster scenario, lending standards should be easier." 
</P>
<P>
 Walden also suggests that the government give the disaster loan money to 
private banks and allow them to administer the programs. "At least the banks 
are already set up to do it," he said. Outside of disasters, the SBA makes few 
direct loans, instead guaranteeing loans made by private lending institutions 
to small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 At Big Valley Music in Northridge, the windows advertise "Big Shakedown Sale." 
But Carol Ozanian, president of the company, has decided that the biggest 
shakedown of all has been disaster relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reality is, there is no Santa Claus," said Ozanian, who expects to spend 
several thousand dollars to repair her roof and replace inventory. Ozanian is 
going it alone because she thinks the SBA would turn her down after finding out 
she already has two SBA-guaranteed loans. 
</P>
<P>
 "The paperwork is horrendous," she said. "It takes a tremendous amount of 
effort to fill them out. . . . I didn't want to go through the whole process, 
only to be turned down." Choked Pipeline The Small Business Administration's 
disaster assistance loan program is a primary source of funds for business and 
apartment owners trying to repair and rebuild after the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
Many seeking loans complain that the SBA bureaucracy is moving slowly, though 
agency officials say they are moving as quickly and responsibly as possible, 
given an unprecedented volume of applications. Here are the numbers as of March 
31. * Applications issued: 412,270 Homeowners: 294,307 Businesses, apartments: 
117,963 * Applications completed: 148,251 Homeowners: 116,985 Businesses, 
apartments: 31,266 * Loan decisions (approvals and denials): 41,739 Homeowners: 
39,178 Businesses, apartments: 2,561 * Loan approvals: 25,043 totaling $739.9 
million Homeowners: 23,724 totaling $664 million Businesses, apartments: 1,319 
totaling $75.9 million * Funds disbursed: $43.4 million Homeowners: 4,215 
checks totaling $40.7 million Businesses, apartments: 238 checks totaling $2.6
