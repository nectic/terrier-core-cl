FIXATIONS: STEEPED IN TRADITION; PAUL SHELLEY, BUTLER AT THE DANA POINT RESORT, 
BLENDS GUESTS WITH HIGH AND LOW AFTERNOON TEAS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "You must experience the tea," Paul Shelley reminds his customers, as his 
white-gloved hands pour his own special brew from a cozy-covered teapot into 
their floral-patterned Villeroy & Boch china cups. "The first thing you do is 
check the bouquet; next, taste it and make a judgment whether we need to add 
milk or sugar or lemon. But check it out first, because this is a tea you 
haven't had before." 
</P>
<P>
 You can say that again, and not just of Shelley's proprietary blend of teas, 
which he calls "The Butler's Brew," but the whole shebang of the afternoon tea 
service he presides over at the Dana Point Resort every Friday, Saturday and 
Sunday. The Resort's Lantern Bay Lounge may be distinctly Southern Californian 
in its Pacific view and clean-swept lack of personality, but under Shelley's 
guidance it becomes an outpost of upper-crust England, where everything stops 
for tea. 
</P>
<P>
 Tea may be the wan cousin of coffee locally, since gourmet coffee shops have 
been cropping up like slugs after a Seattle storm, but it is tea that is the 
most popular beverage in the world; tea that has a history reaching back 
thousands of years; tea that has been the maker of financial empires, the cause 
of two intercontinental wars, the root of the opium trade in China and one of 
the brewing causes of the American Revolution, leading colonists to turn Boston 
Harbor into the world's largest teapot in December 1773. It was tea, I tell 
you. Tea! Tea!! TEA!!! 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry, I don't know what came over me, except that after spending a while with 
Shelley, you start thinking about tea a tad. 
</P>
<P>
 The 50-ish Shelley isn't British, but he might as well be, with his devotion 
to tea and his adherence to the distinctly British way of putting oneself at 
the service of others. He doesn't need the badge he wears reading Butler to 
define his role. Even when having an off-duty chat with him, if you start to 
take off your jacket, he immediately leaps to his feet and helps. Suggest that 
he relax and just be a normal human for a while, and he responds, "This is the 
way I always am. What you see is what you get. This is how I am in my own 
house." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Shelley said a tradition of service just comes naturally to those raised in 
Boston, not that I've ever had Ted Kennedy help me with my jacket. He also said 
tea was a part of life while growing up there, a twice-a-day tradition in his 
home since he had his first sip at age 5. It set his young mind to musing. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a child I was raised with milk and sugar in tea, and in England many 
people add the milk before they even pour the tea. I was interested in why ? 
Why do we put milk in? Why not take it in its original form, namely tea, black? 
Why do I have to put milk in tea? Do you put it in some, not in others? What 
does it do to the tea? In my childhood I would ask, why do you put milk in it?" 
</P>
<P>
 So, Paul, why do people put milk in tea? 
</P>
<P>
 "Some say it enhances the flavor of it, but from the information I have 
learned, and from my experience and listening to a lot of guests from different 
countries, you know, the cultures vary. In England, for example, they'll say, 
'Who'll be mum?' But in Australia it's 'Who'll pour?' 
</P>
<P>
 "But to get back to why milk is placed in tea: Historically, the china was 
very delicate, and if you put hot, scalding, boiling water into the cup, it 
might crack. So what they did was, they would put cold milk in it first," 
Shelley concluded. Remember, you heard it here first. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Between sips, he attended the New England Conservatory of Music and Boston 
Conservatory of Music. He has taught music at both the college and elementary 
school level, but cutbacks, which always slash the arts first, left him 
available three years ago to create the position of butler at the resort, 
originating and managing the afternoon tea. 
</P>
<P>
 He stresses, "Here we serve afternoon tea as opposed to high tea. 
Historically, high tea was for the commoner. It was more in the early evening, 
and they would have lots of hot foods, bacon, sausage, crumpets and the like. 
Afternoon tea was for the aristocrats and the affluent." 
</P>
<P>
 In practice, that means afternoon tea isn't the place to pig out, though one 
doesn't exactly go hungry either. Shelley offers a choice of the $6.25 spread 
-- a pot of tea, a splendid scone, cream, jam and berries -- or the $11.25 one, 
which has the aforementioned goodies along with finger sandwiches and two 
dessert pastries, which, like the scone, are skillfully made in-house. There is 
a choice of several teas, along with Shelley's Butler's Brew, a balanced 
full-bodied tea with no aftertaste. 
</P>
<P>
 However good he might be at blending tea leaves, Shelley's true skill lies in 
getting people to mix.  
</P>
<P>
 "Historically, tea was a time when ladies and gentlemen would get together and 
they would share gossip. What we try to do here is set the theme of gossip in a 
friendly way. My philosophy in the tearoom is whatever you share with us, if 
it's dull we spice it up, and then we talk about you." 
</P>
<P>
 Usually what passes for gossip there is stultifyingly innocuous. On this 
particular afternoon, three sweet elderly ladies visiting from the Midwest 
shared that they were planning to drive to Hearst Castle and wanted to know how 
long it would take. One tea drinker told them it might take three hours, while 
another said six, proving, if nothing else, that sobriety isn't all it's 
cracked up to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelley said most of the "gossip" was like that, friendly tips on where to 
shop or what to eat, or light tales from customers' work day. There have been 
exceptions, though, such as the time he set a group of female ministers to 
gabbing. "The gossip got so heated I had to leave. I'm amazed at what comes out 
of the mouths of women," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He started the gossip policy shortly after he began the tea service at the 
resort. "I'd noticed a pair of guests sitting alone had been at the resort for 
a week. I reasoned that, like anyone who spends a lot of time together, they 
must eventually run out of things to say. Every time I'd come over, they'd 
start talking, and when I'd leave there would be silence. So I started getting 
the guests to talk to each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "We give the guests the option to either share or keep a low profile. I'm 
sensitive to the needs of the guest. If they want solitude, so be it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paul gets people interested in talking to each other, like a tour director, 
blending people," says regular customer Kathy Martino of Dana Point, who was 
taking tea with her mother. "Paul's wonderful. He takes an interest in the 
people who come in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd gone to tea at the Ritz (Carlton), and it was real stiff. They wouldn't 
let me in wearing shorts, and everyone was sitting up real prim and proper. 
It's not relaxing. Coming here is just like coming home, but being treated 
well. It gives a little bit of specialness to your everyday life." 
</P>
<P>
 Shelley said that's his goal. "When people come in here I want them to 
experience tea. Traditional tea is a time to relax, to read a book by yourself 
or to share with others. When I see someone come in who's having a bad day, I 
try to turn them around, to help them leave feeling more positive than when 
they came in. Tea in parts of Europe was something set aside from the day that 
no one interfered with. At tea time everything stopped, and people sat down and 
relaxed. I'd like to see that happen again here."

ROBIN ABCARIAN: TAKING DISASTER DOWN TO BASICS: HELPING GRANDMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The usual brown air hung over the Valley. Everything but the traffic seemed 
normal. Monday morning, as I drove north on the wide, empty San Diego Freeway, 
I had misgivings. Maybe I was making too big a deal of it. Maybe I didn't need 
to drive out to Mission Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until I was forced off the freeway at Devonshire, then headed north 
on Sepulveda, that the magnitude of destruction began to show itself. Masonry 
and glass, in piles all over the sidewalks. A cinder-block parking structure 
folded like a piece of paper. The metal frames of the windows in a new, 
four-story building twisted out of their squares, bent as easily as paper 
clips. 
</P>
<P>
 The sign on Holy Cross Hospital was dispiriting; it had collapsed into a V. 
Staffers stood at the end of the driveway next to gurneys, waiting for 
patients. My anxiety cranked up a few levels. 
</P>
<P>
 I was headed for a place on the hill just behind the hospital, a magnificent, 
peach-colored old folks' home. As I pulled up its steep driveway, I practically 
held my breath. 
</P>
<P>
 The complex looked as if it had come through the quake unscathed. Inside was 
another story. 
</P>
<P>
 In the big dining room, a curtain of water -- burst pipes -- fell steadily 
from the ceiling. Men with brooms and mops were doing their best to keep the 
flood at bay. 
</P>
<P>
 In the lobby, a sea of aged men and women sat in eerie silence. Nearly five 
hours after Mother Nature had viciously shaken them from their slumber, they 
sat, perhaps 70 of them, quiet, fatigued, confused. 
</P>
<P>
 I saw her as soon as I walked in. 
</P>
<P>
 Turquoise velour robe. Short white hair. Coke-bottle glasses. 
</P>
<P>
 My grandma, pushing 90. 
</P>
<P>
 She seemed a little disoriented when I reached down from behind her chair and 
wrapped my arms around her. Then she recognized my voice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh," she said, almost crying. "It's you!" 
</P>
<P>
 How could I have thought I was making too big a deal of it? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Miraculously, no one at Ararat Home was hurt. When the three-story building 
had stopped lurching, the residents filed slowly and calmly down the 
stairwells. They are, after all, Armenians, and Armenians are used to hardship. 
An earthquake was not going to devastate this group. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, I wasn't scared," Grandma said. "I was lying in bed and just watched my 
wall come toward me and go back. I thought, 'Oh good, they got good beams in 
there.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Down in the lobby, the old people sat, hungry and thirsty. Some asked for 
water, some asked for help to the toilets, a few were escorted by flashlight up 
the darkened stairwell to retrieve pills or eyeglasses. Mostly, though, they 
just waited. 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed as if there were no particular plan in motion. I couldn't even find 
Bob Shamlian, the home administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 But in truth, all sorts of people were at work, turning off gas and water 
mains, repairing lines that would allow the emergency generators to kick in, 
phoning relatives to come evacuate their loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
 And Shamlian, was, in fact, taking care of the most important thing under the 
circumstances: lunch. He walked in around 11:30 a.m., having bought out a 
bakery's entire supply of lamajoun -- Armenian pizza. Shamlian was followed by 
Evieny Janbazian, a tall, handsome woman married to the man my grandma calls 
"the big shot" -- the home's minister. Janbazian cheerfully announced that food 
would be served next door in the one-story (presumably safer) convalescent 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 You never saw old people move so fast. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 My grandmother's second-floor room was a mess. Ransacked by the hand of God. 
Dressers and night stands flung over. Drawers splayed. Plaster lamps in pieces. 
Cracked walls, broken mirrors. And everywhere photos, jewelry, knickknacks, 
candy, crackers, shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 For Grandma, the last six years have been a time of paring down. She has 
contracted her life into what fits in the room she shares with a friend. Still, 
I was astonished by the mountains of her stuff unleashed by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 I grabbed what I could for her: some clothes, some toiletries. 
</P>
<P>
 On our way to my father's house in Venice, I told her I was surprised by the 
mess. 
</P>
<P>
 She laughed and told me about the time her roommate had asked, "Why do you 
have so many things, Annie?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I have nine grandchildren," my grandmother replied (somewhat boastfully). "I 
keep all their pictures, and all their children's pictures. And when they send 
me cards, I like to keep them. I don't like to throw anything away too soon." 
</P>
<P>
 For her, this is the bare bones; she has parted with all that she's going to. 
</P>
<P>
 By Tuesday, my grandmother was already anxious to get back to Mission Hills, 
back to her things: "If I can get back," she said, "I want to get back there." 
</P>
<P>
 "Why?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, why not?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When disaster hits, we act like people who have been in a car accident, 
patting themselves, asking: Is my arm where it's supposed to be? My leg? 
</P>
<P>
 The day of the quake, we were reaching for our kids, our parents, our friends. 
We needed to know that they were safe. More than that, we needed to connect, to 
share the moment. And when we know we are whole, we can upright the furniture, 
pick up the pieces and get on with the rest.

 The CableACE Awards aren't the Oscars, but the highly touted information 
superhighway helped give the show something to be cocky about. 
</P>
<P>
 The Scene: The 15th annual National CableACE Awards Sunday at the Pantages 
theater, followed by a tented party at a parking lot across the street. To put 
the award in perspective, an ACE is to an Oscar what a Home Shopping Network 
zirconia brooch is to a Tiffany necklace. As with all award shows, though, it's 
a chance for show-business types to have their egos detailed. 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: Among the 1,200 at the show (and maybe at the party) were Ted 
Turner and Jane Fonda, the royal family of cable; lesser mortals included 
Kiefer Sutherland, Martin Mull, Larry King, Garry Shandling, Melissa Gilbert, 
Bruce Boxleitner, Forest Whitaker, Stockard Channing, Eric Roberts, James 
Woods, Paula Poundstone, Harry Connick Jr., Brian Dennehy, Patricia Arquette, 
Decker Anstrom and HBO's Michael Fuchs, who received the governor's award. 
</P>
<P>
 Local Color: As the limos detoured around the funky side streets near Yucca 
Street, the prostitutes yelled, "Hey, baby, come on over here!" 
</P>
<P>
 The Setting: The show and party had spectacular locales. Lit in turquoise, 
magenta and gold, the Baroque interior of the Pantages never looked better. The 
party was held in a dramatic 23,000-square-foot white tent hung with muslin 
canopies and done in an Art Deco motif. Other touches included dozens of queen 
palms, strolling musicians, huge floral arrangements of lilies and gardenias, 
plus a 12-piece band playing Motown hits. 
</P>
<P>
 The Attitude: OK, so we're the 
</P>
<P>
 Rodney Dangerfield of award shows. We get no respect. Go ahead, make fun of 
us. We're taking over the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Dress Mode: Black tie, or rather a black tide, since most of the women wore 
black as well. A standout exception was Penelope Ann Miller in a silver, 
floor-length strapless Vera Wang gown partly done in sequins. 
</P>
<P>
 Joke Beaten Into the Ground: The information superhighway. Co-host Sinbad had 
the best line early in the evening: "We're all going to be road kill if we 
don't get hip to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Chow: Massive buffet from Along Came Mary of smoked salmon served on griddle 
cakes, black and white ravioli, rack of lamb and coq au vin . 
</P>
<P>
 Tag Line: Matthew Modine, presenter of the evening's final award: "I don't 
have any television in my life. The best reason not to is the advertising, 
which is so terribly insulting. And for my children, I want them to read 
books."

BOOK REVIEW / FICTION; A 50-YEAR NIGHTMARE OF CARNAL AND POLITICAL BETRAYAL; 
BONE TO THE BONE, BY NATHAN SHAHAM TRANSLATED BY DALYA BILU , GROVE PRESS 
$19.95, 352 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN KIRSCH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Avigdor Berkov, the afflicted hero of "Bone to the Bone," is a kind of 
20th-Century Rip Van Winkle. 
</P>
<P>
 According to novelist Nathan Shaham, Berkov was born in Ukraine before the 
Bolshevik Revolution, emigrated to Palestine in the '20s, then returned to the 
Soviet Union. By the time we encounter him in the pages of "Bone to the Bone," 
Berkov is back in Israel, an old man who has awakened from a half-century-long 
nightmare to find himself among strangers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're willing to take me back into the bosom of the happy family that was 
immune to the revolutionary germ," he says of the family that he left behind in 
Israel, "on the condition that I give up any claim to being an honest man." 
</P>
<P>
 But truth telling is the whole point of "Bone to the Bone," which takes the 
form of an extended memoir by Berkov, who describes himself as "a bankrupt 
Party member, a father who betrayed his trust, an old pioneer whose world is in 
ruins." And Berkov's story is told in the sharp, clear, insistent voice of a 
man who holds himself and the world accountable for every failing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Testimony, summing up, the moral of my story, bits of history, reflection," 
Berkov says in describing his memoir, "an indictment of the people who 
distorted the revolution." 
</P>
<P>
 "Bone to the Bone" is an oblique and ironic love story, and Berkov gives us 
glimpses of Vera, the woman he loved and lost in Palestine, and Nina, the woman 
he loved and lost in the Soviet Union. Berkov seeks out the two women -- and 
the children he fathered with each of them -- on his return to Israel, and it 
is the encounter with his old lovers that drags him out of a bitter reverie and 
forces him to confront an uncomforting reality. 
</P>
<P>
 "I go over and over her words in my head, like a boy after a first lovers' 
meeting," he writes of his reunion with Nina. "Every word with its secret 
signals. What she really wanted to say. What had prevented her from saying it." 
</P>
<P>
 But "Bone to the Bone" also tells us another kind of love story -- the "tragic 
love of the revolution" that manifested itself in both Palestine and the Soviet 
Union. We see Berkov as an idealistic young man who yearns for the pure and 
elevating experience of true revolution -- and we see too how his heart is 
broken as he comes to realize how the revolution was betrayed, corrupted and 
degraded by the very men who served in its vanguard. 
</P>
<P>
 At one chilling moment in "Bone to the Bone," these two parallel love stories 
collide with each other, and suddenly Berkov's eyes are opened to the depth of 
the betrayal, which turns out to be both carnal and political. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many mysteries were illuminated," Berkov declares, forcing himself to 
confront the ugliest truth of all. "A new light was shed on acts, gestures, 
words. And everything connected up in one web." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaham is a distinguished Israeli novelist, and "Bone to the Bone" has been 
expertly translated from the original Hebrew by Dalya Bilu. But, significantly, 
Berkov finds himself ill at ease in the modern Jewish state; he is very much a 
creature of the Old World, haunted by the ghosts of history, aching with the 
pain of old wounds and compelled to confess all of his failings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was Turgenev who said that the Russians are a nation of liars who 
spend their lives yearning for the absolute truth," Berkov reflects. "In this 
respect, I am a true Russian." 
</P>
<P>
 Like many honest seekers after social revolution in the Soviet Union under 
Stalin, Berkov ended up in the Gulag. Torture and slave labor, as we discover, 
left him not only emotionally scarred but almost literally deformed. He still 
seeks a kind of redemption in love and memory, but he simply cannot forget what 
he has experienced and survived. 
</P>
<P>
 "I . . . like to look at the faces of passersby," he writes of himself. "I 
think this hobby would annoy them if they knew what I was looking for. I try to 
guess how they would behave under stress, in conditions of hunger or torture. 
This is a bitter and unpleasant habit that I cannot break." 
</P>
<P>
 One who has been tortured, a Holocaust survivor once wrote, remains tortured. 
And "Bone to the Bone," in a quiet and compelling way, shows us exactly what he 
meant.

ANN CONWAY: 'BRIGHTER' BENEFIT IS A STARLESS NIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN CONWAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They called the event "For Brighter Stars," and the 230 guests who anted up 
$150 each for the Laguna Beach Unified School District benefit probably thought 
Dustin Hoffman and Bette Midler would attend. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, their names were listed on the invitations as honorary 
chairpersons. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as benefit-goers are beginning to find out, "honorary" is often 
synonymous with "in-name-only" when it comes to celebs. 
</P>
<P>
 And that was the case at Sunday's dinner held at Five Feet restaurant and its 
next-door neighbor, the Engman International Gallery in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 How did the Divine Miss M and Hoffman come to have their monikers on the 
event? 
</P>
<P>
 It goes something like this: Hoffman's wife, Lisa, is a pal of Joe Gelber, a 
business partner of Five Feet owner Michael Kang. During the October 
firestorms, words of concern were exchanged between the two pals. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, chef Kang was aching to whip up a benefit to help fire victims. 
Gelber jumped in, got Hoffman's support and Hoffman asked Midler (a part-time 
Laguna Beach resident) for hers. 
</P>
<P>
 Having their famous faces at the event for two seconds would have shot this 
benefit into the fund-raising stratosphere. But Hoffman had an early stage call 
the next day, explained a committee member. And Midler, well, she was busy too. 
</P>
<P>
 Guests found solace in bidding on T-shirts and baseball caps signed by the 
super novas. 
</P>
<P>
 The food wasn't bad either. Mingling al fresco in the Engman Sculpture Garden, 
guests sipped fine wines as they sampled mouthwatering appetizers from local 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 After the event's major donors -- including Taco Bell and Rockwell Corp. -- 
were honored with commemorative posters, guests filed into Five Feet and the 
Engman gallery for a feast prepared by chefs from Five Feet, Bombay Duck, Cedar 
Creek Inn, Claes Seafood, Partners Restaurant, Renaissance Cafe and the 
Sorrento Grille. 
</P>
<P>
 On the menu: smoked sea bass with mango salsa; exotic greens with Stilton 
cheese, pears and hazelnuts; and lamb sirloin with white potato puree and a 
bouquet of garden herbs.

 L.A. -- AT ITS VERY BEST WHEN NATURE IS AT ITS ABSOLUTE WORST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angelenos have had lots of experience -- way too much, really -- in dealing 
with disaster these last few years. Floods were followed by riots, which were 
followed by wildfires, which -- some would say inevitably -- were followed by a 
major earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe that's why people throughout the region reacted so valiantly, stoically, 
communally to Monday morning's devastating temblors. The heroes of the day 
ranged from emergency personnel who quickly got to where they were needed to 
countless Southern Californians who went far out of their way -- some even 
risking their lives -- to help neighbors. But we would like to think there is 
another reason: that all of these terrible tests have steeled us to do our best 
in those moments when nature, or some human force, does its worst. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, Los Angeles is coming through with resiliency. We will need that 
resiliency in the months ahead as we struggle to rebuild both a badly fractured 
transportation system and to find homes for the thousands whose residences were 
destroyed or made uninhabitable by the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 FIXING THE FREEWAYS: Even as many commuters stayed home for a second day, it 
was clear that the greatest challenge will be getting people to and from work 
-- or just around town -- until the severe damage to several major freeways is 
repaired. It was reassuring to see that state highway crews, even before dusk 
Monday, already were demolishing a collapsed portion of the Santa Monica 
Freeway, perhaps the nation's busiest, so it could be cleared away and 
replaced. But even with such prompt work, it is expected to take many months to 
get this highway and the Golden State, Antelope Valley and Simi Valley freeways 
back in operation. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also reassuring that Clinton Administration officials and members of 
Congress are promising immediate federal emergency help. But with a repair 
price tag of more than $100 million -- not to mention the continuing need to 
retrofit 12,000 freeway bridges all over California to make them 
earthquake-safe -- the necessity of much more federal aid is obvious. Given the 
importance of California's freeways to the regional and national economy, this 
funding must now become a budget priority, in Washington as well as in 
Sacramento. Thus we applaud President Clinton's decision to visit Los Angeles 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 THE MASS TRANSIT OPTION: In the short term, however, a challenge for local 
officials will be to make car-pooling and other forms of group transportation 
as widely available, and user-friendly, as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The region's new Metrolink rail service proved its worth Tuesday, bringing 
commuters in from the Santa Clarita Valley, which had no access to freeways 
because of quake damage to the highways. If damage to railroad tracks can be 
repaired, Metrolink trains today will offer an alternative for Simi Valley 
commuters as well. Local transportation officials must do all they can -- 
cutting red tape, allocating extra money -- to get more commuter trains 
running, perhaps even extending their routes. Why not run Simi Valley trains 
all the way to Oxnard, for example, to relieve Ventura Freeway traffic? 
</P>
<P>
 Trains are not the only alternative, of course. The Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority and other bus agencies must get more buses into 
service all over town, with longer operating hours and sufficient security to 
make them attractive to people perhaps unaccustomed to leaving their 
automobiles at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, some Angelenos will have to continue using their cars because they 
have no other option. Car-pooling or working flexible schedules might help 
them. And traffic engineers in Los Angeles and other cities along the damaged 
freeways must coordinate to keep streets open and traffic running smoothly -- 
through timed traffic signals, temporary one-way streets and other short-term 
solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Housing officials, too, will have to be creative, finding ways to quickly 
retrofit or rebuild damaged apartments and houses. This region already had a 
problem in providing decent housing for the poor and even for middle-income 
families such as some of the San Fernando Valley apartment dwellers made 
homeless by Monday's quake. 
</P>
<P>
 THE COMMUNITY OPTION: That adversity can help bring together total strangers 
is of course a cliche; and that Los Angeles, with its great distances and 
spread-out communities, is a metropolis of strangers is another. But sometimes 
when two cliches collide a new truth is born. And the truth of these past 48 
hours is that, notwithstanding some exceptions, Los Angeles once again appears 
to be taking adversity's measure by working together as a community of common 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
 That an earthquake would serve to cement this sense of unity -- developing out 
of the 1992 riots, the court trials that followed and rampaging wildfires -- is 
no tribute to earthquakes. They are indeed awful. But the people who survive 
them can find redeeming value in themselves, in their sense of common purpose 
and communal ties. That is what's happening this week.

A DIPLOMACY OF OPTIMISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Diplomacy has its own language and elaborately choreographed events. The 
formality of international statecraft, akin to a minuet, allows negotiators to 
precisely understand a given word or gesture, and it can transmit an exact 
message when an assistant minister instead of a Cabinet member, say, attends a 
meeting.Often symbols, protocol and setting are all-important. However, the 
stylized tapestry of diplomacy, developed over centuries, sometimes can impede 
progress in negotiations. So there are times when breaking out of the formal 
mold works, as in President Jimmy Carter's 1978 Camp David talks with Egypt's 
Anwar Sadat and Israel's Menachem Begin. 
</P>
<P>
 It may have been Camp David that Johan Jorgen Holst, Norway's prime minister, 
was remembering when he invited negotiators for Israel and the Palestine 
Liberation Organization into his family's Oslo home and to the Norwegian 
countryside. By breaking diplomatic tradition -- and by working one 
backbreaking 14-hour day after another -- Holst gained an unprecedented 
agreement in this seemingly intractable dispute. He said later that the key was 
in providing negotiators a relaxed, informal atmosphere. In a way, Holst may 
have given his life for that hospitality. He died last week at 56 in an Oslo 
hospital, where he was recovering from a stroke apparently complicated by 
exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a man with limitless faith in human nature could tackle the seemingly 
unbridgeable gulf between Israel and the PLO. Both sides owe it to Holst's 
memory to keep trying.

WOMEN AND GUN OWNERSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Regarding former Police Commissioner Ann Reiss Lane's comment: "I thought, 
if these tough police officers are afraid, imagine what it must be like for the 
rest of us . . . with 200 million guns out there. . . ." Exactly. Missing from 
mention was how many of these guns are in the hands of criminals (Voices, Jan. 
10). 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, it was on Lane's watch that I first considered purchasing a gun of 
my own. That happened as the Los Angeles Police Department failed to respond to 
the spread of urban arson, marauding, looting and uncontrolled civil 
disturbance. A city under siege forced this former gun-control advocate to 
rethink her position. 
</P>
<P>
 Regrettably, it appears that greater self-sufficiency is now also required for 
the taxpaying and the law-abiding citizens. It may mean defending one's 
hillside home with a hose while awaiting the arrival of firefighters engaged 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 And, it may mean having a gun in one's home as a last line of defense while 
awaiting 911's dispatch of police to assist. 
</P>
<P>
 Any gun that I might purchase would be fully registered at the state and 
federal levels. As soon as someone figures out how to remove or at least 
register all the guns in criminal hands, I'd probably abandon thoughts of 
having a gun of my own.

 * What a terrible thing Lane is doing to women, the very group that is the 
greatest target of violent abuse in this country. She sees the recent surge of 
guns and gun products and training programs for women as a marketing ploy to 
"play on their fears." Lane and others of like mind serve only to reinforce the 
dangerous fallacy that women should be meek, helpless and totally dependent on 
others in a hostile situation. Beatings, rapes and murders are apparently 
things that nice women shouldn't think about, much less adequately defend 
themselves against with nasty, noisy guns. 
</P>
<P>
 For women who do wish to take responsibility for and control of their lives 
and safety, I wholeheartedly suggest buying a gun, becoming proficient in its 
use, and demanding of our government the right to carry that gun for 
protection. Lane's solution of hand-wringing and imitating the ostrich will 
only reinforce the violent criminal's belief that women are easy and just prey, 
and the horrible consequences for women will continue to steadily increase.

 * I found it somewhat amusing that former Police Commissioner Lane is thinking 
about organizing a campaign against guns similar to the Mothers Against Drunk 
Driving organization. If the Commish used the MADD theme, with the subject 
being guns instead, then she is on common philosophical grounds, much to her 
disgust I'm sure, with the National Rifle Assn. She should realize that MADD is 
not about to ban all cars in this country because a few individuals drink and 
drive. The NRA has similar goals, i.e., punish those who abuse guns, but leave 
the law-abiding citizen alone.

 * Here's a scenario for Ron Daub (letter, Jan. 6) and others who want to see 
"law-abiding citizens" carry guns to prevent random shootings "before they 
start." 
</P>
<P>
 Let's say some law-abiding Rambo is showing off his new Glock to some other 
law-abiding wanna-be. Then another law-abiding citizen, Rambo Too, gets into 
the act. When he sees the gun, he immediately suspects, "aha, another random 
shooting." So what's he gonna do? 
</P>
<P>
 He whips out his Ruger and blows away law-abiding Rambo. In his excitement, 
however, he pulls the trigger a little too much and, whoops, there goes yet 
another law-abiding citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Rambo Redux, another fine, upstanding law-abiding citizen, can't 
help but notice. Although he cannot stop it before it starts, he can certainly 
make sure it goes no further. But by this time, 14 more clones of our original 
hero have already drawn their iron and pretty soon there's not a one of them 
left.

themselves, alleging that they, not the criminals, will be the ones harmed if 
guns are controlled.

they pull the trigger.

"Crime does pay!"

GOVERNMENT RADIATION TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Gregg Easterbrook, in "The Doomsday Spin" (Opinion, Jan. 9), concludes that 
"low levels of radiation are far less worrisome than once assumed." But he is 
in serious error on essentially every scientific issue he addresses. 
</P>
<P>
 He suggests the old saw that a lower cancer rate in high-altitude Denver, with 
its elevated background radiation dose, may argue for beneficial effects of 
radiation. This notion has long ago been discredited for its failure to control 
comparability of cities on causes of cancer other than radiation. 
</P>
<P>
 Easterbrook erroneously suggests that Alice Stewart exonerates radiation in 
Hanford workers by finding that the cancer rate is lower than that for the 
population at large. Stewart's major finding is a very large effect of 
radiation in producing cancer in workers, when one compares Hanford workers 
getting various doses of radiation. 
</P>
<P>
 He describes the dose of injected plutonium in the plutonium experiment as 
"incredibly tiny." He is simply mistaken. Dr. Roland Finston's estimated 
bone-doses from plutonium in the persons at issue are very large. My own 
estimates agree with those of Finston. Easterbrook's comparison of a microcurie 
with a curie is irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
 The suggestion is made that the Hanford releases of 685,000 curies of 
radioiodine may have done little harm, in his statement, "Yet it may be that 
Hanford workers are not especially sick." But the Hanford estimation of doses 
and evaluation of health outcomes now being studied by government-sponsored 
programs have not yet reached any conclusions! 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Rosalyn Yalow's work on radioimmunoassay is cited by Easterbrook as "the 
basic test by which radioactive harm to the body is measured." Dr. Yalow's 
excellent work with radioimmunoassay has nothing at all to do with ascertaining 
radiation's harm to the body. 
</P>
<P>
 Easterbrook tells us that "nuclear-power plants cannot explode but can emit 
tiny amounts of radiation." The Chernobyl power plant did have a massive 
explosion and sent gigantic quantities of radioactive nuclides a mile high into 
the atmosphere and around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Easterbrook suggests, correctly, that "mammal bodies possess some genetic 
resistance to radiation." But he fails to mention that such genetic repair 
capability produces some misrepair, leaves some injury unrepaired and finds 
some injury unrepairable.  
</P>
<P>
 I have spent over 25 years in criticism of lies and inaccuracies from AEC 
(Atomic Energy Commission) and DOE (Department of Energy). I believe Energy 
Secretary Hazel O'Leary. I think her public statements and her actions are 
indeed admirable. She represents welcome attributes in government: candor, 
compassion and credibility. I wish her the very best in what appears to be a 
superb pro-people approach.

<P>
 * I'm probably spitting in the wind here, but why don't the schools just have 
uniforms for their students? This would save a lot of time for the teachers to 
teach, and do other important duties they have to do, instead of checking 
clothing, and covering symbols and pinning up pants so that the little 
potential gang members don't get themselves shot, or some other little kid that 
is dressed properly.  
</P>
<P>
 It seems like the kids are dictating to the adults, and the gang members are 
dictating to the police and the citizens of America.I think we have become too 
permissive and that is why we have lost control of the young and 
impressionable. Young people need to be told what is expected of them and 
adhere to it. Deep down this is what they want and the sooner a parent starts 
doing this the better for the children.

WELFARE CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Gov. Pete Wilson has again proposed Draconian cuts of 25% in the Aid to 
Families with Dependent Children program (AFDC) that nearly 2 million children 
depend on for their subsistence (Jan. 8). Such a cut would reduce a family to 
less than half the federal poverty level.This attempt to balance California's 
budget at the expense of children, in the midst of recession and growing family 
homelessness, is callous and tyrannical in the extreme. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, Wilson calls for a two-year time limit on AFDC. Some 
commentators compare it to President Clinton's welfare reform proposals for a 
two-year limit on receiving AFDC. Clinton, however, has seen the family 
devastation that looms with a simple-minded cutoff. He proposes to provide 
employment for such families should there be insufficient jobs in the private 
sector. Wilson proposes only a halt in aid and then washes his hands of these 
children. Will the people of a great state like California allow the governor 
to condemn nearly a quarter of the state's children to penury and squalor? Now 
is the time to "just say no."

PERSPECTIVE ON THE QUAKE; L.A.'S FAULT LINES; WE ACCEPTED NATURE'S RISKS TO 
BUILD A DREAM WORLD OF PRIVATE PURSUITS. NOW WE SEE THE PRICE OF ISOLATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD WEINSTEIN, Richard Weinstein is dean of the Graduate School of 
Architecture and Urban Planning at UCLA.

<TEXT>
<P>
 We live in the first American city whose shape and organization express the 
will to individual self-determination and the freedom from received precedent. 
The cities of the East Coast were founded and built under the influence of 
European densities and social inclinations. We have built a city on the 
American dream of the family home existing within its own envelope of space, 
and this same notion of individual self-determination has governed the growth 
of greater Los Angeles into a vast constellation of separate communities. This 
is a non-hierarchical and porous arrangement of space, which has bred a 
free-form style of living and the most diverse industrial base in the world 
from a kind of mulch of second-rate construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Flourishing, we could withstand whatever nature could do to shock the system. 
We had made a bargain: to be separated by a continent from the past, accepting 
fire, flood and moving earth in exchange for climate, mountain, sea, and for 
the promise of an unbounded future. Is this psychic bargain unraveling? 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, we sense ourselves to be connected to events over which we 
have little control. Unsettled by destabilizing changes dictated by distant 
forces -- economic restructuring and uncertainty, social unrest, immigration -- 
we are aware, suddenly, of the latent isolation of our condition. The very way 
we live is now perceived as linked to our vulnerability to fire, flood, drought 
and earthquake. Under stress, our privacy is also linked to isolation and 
anxiety. The freeway system is one physical expression of our desire for 
compensating connection and communication. Its partial destruction and the 
powerful images we have all seen of its frailty are somehow definitive of our 
present moment. Our mobility is essential to our existence as a community. When 
it is compromised, what is isolating about privacy is disturbingly revealed, 
and revealed with the power of a public metaphor. We are reminded not only of 
our personal circumstance, but also of the fragmented nature of our public 
circumstance -- the distance of our political leaders from us and each other, 
of our ethnic communities from one another, of our bureaucracies from each 
other and from us, of the tense separation between and among cities and 
counties and our warring, Balkanized city-states. Each of them, each of us, in 
our own back yards . . . except, fleetingly, in time of crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 There seems to be a collective anxiety about the future expressed in our 
response to this latest test of the Southern California premise. Certainly 
there is enough tragedy and loss to explain this reaction for almost any place, 
but not this one. Do we feel exposed because the material comfort so many of us 
enjoy is threatened? Because we can no longer manage without acknowledging that 
too many of us are ominously poor? That in building the city of private realms 
to pursue private dreams, we have never experienced the advantage afforded by 
community? I do not mean the personal acts of heroism or neighborliness in 
times of crisis, but rather the belonging to a larger set of collective 
interests that bind us together as a whole and define a public realm in more 
equitable balance with our private interests. Because we must now begin to act 
differently than we have before, is because we have separately succeeded so 
well up till now. The future will require that unfamiliar, collective 
adjustments be made. The fault lines running through our social, economic and 
political arrangements are under extreme pressure.

AGAINST ARROWS, A SHIELD OF GOSSAMER; POLITICS: CLINTON NEEDED MILITARY

 Just about a month ago, Adm. Bobby Ray Inman startled the President and his 
advisers as well as the Washington political community with his speech 
accepting Clinton's nomination to be secretary of defense. In that speech, 
Inman announced that he did not want the job, but had interviewed Clinton and 
found him to be a worthy commander in chief. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Inman again startled the same group by announcing that he was 
withdrawing because of some rather mild attacks on him during the past month by 
political columnists, particularly William Safire of the New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
 To those who understand the difference between the world views of career 
military officers and professional politicians, Inman's actions are not 
surprising. Career military officers, especially those who rise to the top, are 
skillful bureaucratic politicians. They know how to maneuver to gain maximum 
advantage over the other services, other agencies and other branches of 
government. Their political maneuvering is justified (or rationalized) in the 
name of protecting their troops and national security. They also guard their 
reputations jealously; according to their code, officers "do not lie, cheat or 
steal, nor tolerate those who do." Because they can order people in harm's way, 
their word must be their bond. Finally, officers must always put their troops 
first. Their lives depend on it. 
</P>
<P>
 In Inman's acceptance speech in the Rose Garden, he was talking to the troops. 
His message was, "Despite what you have heard about Clinton, he's OK. And, 
since I did not want this job, he'll have to give me what we (the military) 
need because Clinton can't fire me." But in maximizing his bureaucratic 
advantage, Inman was unaware that he was undermining Clinton's political 
position. Presidents hire and fire. They are not hired. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, when Inman was accused in print over the past month of being a liar 
and a tax cheat as well as a poor manager, it undermined the core of his 
military professionalism and he decided it was too high a price to pay for a 
job he did not want. But compared with what hasbeen said about political 
appointees in recent years, the criticism of Inman was mild.  
</P>
<P>
 Inman's withdrawal is probably best for all concerned. Clinton was hoping that 
the admiral would be a shield for him against the military, but given his 
declaration of independence in the Rose Garden, Inman, rather than Clinton, 
would have had the final say over defense policy. Moreover, if Inman was so 
thin-skinned that he let a Safire column get to him, how would he have handled 
the criticism that would surely have followed base closings, defense cuts or 
battlefield casualties? The nation is better off as well because having a 
career military officer exercising civilian control subverts the concept. 
Finally, Inman's resignation may draw attention to the almost absurd level of 
scrutiny we have injected into the confirmation process.

GIRLS' SCHOOLS ARE BEST FOR GIRLS; CO-ED SETTINGS NOT ONLY BRING MISSED 
OPPORTUNITY, BUT ALSO DROPPING OUT AND EARLY PREGNANCY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH T. KENNAN, Elizabeth T. Kennan is president of Mount Holyoke 
College. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is a growing national pattern of female academic failure and 
underachievement in this country that is directly tied to the way we educate 
girls and young women and that has consequences that resonate throughout our 
society. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent decision by three California coeducational schools to institute 
all-girl mathematics classes again raises the issue of the appropriateness of 
single-sex education, especially in public schools. Despite such criticism, it 
remains the best way to counter an increasingly serious trend of poorer gains 
by girls and young women in co-ed classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning with the examination of worldwide education for girls commissioned 
to mark Mount Holyoke College's Sesquicentennial in 1987, study after study has 
found that girls are overlooked and undervalued in most coeducational classes, 
especially in math and science. David and Myra Sadker's "Failing at Fairness: 
How America's Schools Cheat Girls" -- a 20-year study of education at all 
levels due to be released next month -- found that students who have survived 
this treatment in middle and high school experience a continuing erosion of 
self-confidence in many colleges and universities. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no doubt that girls show up on their first day of grammar school just 
as ready, willing and able to succeed as do boys. But as the Sadkers will show 
in their survey of classroom settings across the country, teachers call on boys 
more frequently, spend more time with them and encourage their initiative and 
inquisitiveness more than they do girls. By grade six, girls have become more 
tentative, far less likely to call out answers and more reluctant to take part 
in class demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Once children enter middle school, the situation worsens. Girls who have 
previously held the edge in subjects, including mathematics, begin to lose 
points in every category of national tests. This decline, most precipitous in 
math, continues throughout high school, so that by the time juniors take 
national Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Tests, boys outscore girls by an 
average 50 points. While 18,000 boys typically reach the highest PSAT 
categories, only 8,000 girls do.  
</P>
<P>
 Crucially, the Sadker study will document a "self-esteem slide" for girls that 
takes hold most strongly in the middle-school years. Tests show that girls fall 
approximately 10 points behind boys in confidence in their academic abilities 
during grammar school. During the three years of middle school, that confidence 
drops another 16 points. By high school graduation, only 29% of girls tested 
think they can do their work.  
</P>
<P>
 This erosion cannot be tied entirely to the difference in attention by 
teachers. It is also closely tied to the growing pervasiveness of sexual 
harassment in high schools and middle schools. This problem has grown to such 
proportions that conversations with 150 high school and middle-school students 
in California last year revealed nearly all had seen, experienced or 
participated in some form of sexual harassment. Our schools are becoming 
threatening places in which girls seek to avoid calling attention to themselves 
and move to the rear of the class. This movement, especially in math and the 
sciences, is reinforced by stereotyping among teachers. Thus, the number of 
male college graduates gravitating toward fields dominated by math and science 
far eclipses the number of females, although the percentages of women's college 
graduates pursuing these fields is markedly higher than graduates of co-ed 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1979, Mount Holyoke College started an intensive summer mathematics program 
for 15-year-old girls and their teachers that has become a national model. 
SummerMath gives girls the opportunity to conceptualize problems, translate 
life situations into numerical formulas and visualize changing relationships of 
numbers. In nearby Holyoke, one of the least affluent cities in Massachusetts, 
the college joined the city in 1988 in instituting a successful magnet school 
that pays special attention to the learning needs of the girls. The results 
have been astonishing. The program has bolstered success for all: Academic 
performance has skyrocketed, attendance has improved and pregnancies are few. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem of subtle but still unequal education for women has more serious 
consequences than the disproportionately small number of women scientists, 
mathematicians, researchers and engineers. The Mount Holyoke College study 
showed that the only single, universal predictor of early pregnancy was 
truncation of education.  
</P>
<P>
 I will be the first to call for coeducation at Mount Holyoke, the country's 
oldest women's college, when single-sex education becomes obsolete. We are a 
long way from that. Single-sex education for girls is a proven method for 
ensuring that they reach their fullest potential. Let those who want to abandon 
it propose more effective ways to educate young women.

VALLEY RESIDENTS FIND PATIENCE A VIRTUE AS LINES FORM FOR PROVISIONS; 
AFTERMATH: SHORTAGES ABOUND FOR GOODS BOTH ESSENTIAL AND COMFORTING. PRICE 
GOUGING IS REPORTED IN SOME PLACES.

<P>
 If there was ever a man prepared for an earthquake, it was James De Witt. 
</P>
<P>
 A camper sat in the driveway of his Northridge home, filled with camping gear, 
street maps, bottled water, cans of soup and a first-aid kit. In a box near his 
bed waited a cellular phone, a shortwave radio, two flashlights and extra 
batteries. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the end, it was all for naught. After Monday's earthquake, a fire broke 
out in his neighbor's house and his camper went up in flames, as did most of 
the house next door. 
</P>
<P>
 So on Tuesday, De Witt, his wife and 10-year-old son were no better off than 
the others who sat in idling cars at a Canoga Park gas station -- one among 
dozens of long lines that sprouted throughout the San Fernando Valley as 
residents sought fuel, bottled water, plywood, baby formula and other items the 
day after a violent earthquake left many communities devastated, with 
contaminated tap water and only sporadic electricity. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortages abounded. The watchword for the day was patience, especially for 
James De Witt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was kind of kicking myself after it happened," he said. "But I guess I just 
didn't plan well enough, so I have to start over . . . and be patient."  
</P>
<P>
 At a nearby hardware store, people waited in a line that stretched across the 
parking lot for a particularly hot item: 18-inch pieces of flexible copper 
tubing used for hot water heaters. The rattling of the 6.6 quake caused many 
pipes to break loose, rendering heaters useless. 
</P>
<P>
 "I called around to 10 or 12 stores, and there's probably only about four 
plumbing stores open in the whole Valley, and most of them are totally sold out 
of them," said 46-year-old Don Wyatt of Chatsworth, who stood near the head of 
the line. "Today, these things are like gold." 
</P>
<P>
 At some stores, customers waited for up to two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had to wait a long time," said Maria Cisneros, a 25-year-old Northridge 
resident cradling her 2-year-old daughter outside a supermarket in North Hills. 
"But we really need diapers. All day yesterday, I had to use napkins because 
none of the stores were open. Napkins don't work so well." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, I know," said Peggy Brister, who stood several places in line behind 
Cisneros holding a baby of her own. "I'm down to tissues." 
</P>
<P>
 But the most sought-after items were also the hardest to find. The store had 
sold out of diapers, but the women agreed to look together using Brister's car. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with stories of unselfishness and sharing came stories of greed and 
price gouging. 
</P>
<P>
 The son of Rose Castenada, an aide to Rep. Howard Berman (D-Panorama City), 
went out Tuesday to buy a copper tube for the family's water heater. He was 
told that the item, which usually goes for $5.98 to $8.98, now cost $30. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked why the store was charging so much, a merchant replied: "Earthquake 
prices." 
</P>
<P>
 By far the longest lines were at the gas pumps. 
</P>
<P>
 An Arco station at Winnetka Avenue and Roscoe Boulevard opened at 6 a.m. to a 
line of waiting cars. By 9 a.m., the line snaked out of the parking lot and 
spilled into Roscoe Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The place was so busy that station manager Albino Cesar feared he would sell 
out of his 50,000 gallons of fuel before everyone could fill up. 
</P>
<P>
 Cesar's customers wore looks of desperation, although they did their best to 
be polite. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyplace I've been, they've been closed," said Alfonso Longobardi, a 
22-year-old Air Force mechanic who was being transferred from Point Mugu to San 
Diego. "When I ran out of gas back down the road, I hitchhiked up here to fill 
my can. Everyone's been real nice. I just hope the guy is nice enough to give 
me a ride back, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Across the street, things weren't going so well at a Mobil station. Although 
electricity in the area had been restored, the computer system controlling the 
gas pumps was down, and people stared longingly at the dormant pumps. 
</P>
<P>
 So many people, in fact, that prospective customers turned Winnetka Avenue 
into a parking lot, mirroring the situation at the station across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be pumping any minute," station manager Joe Barney promised a woman, 
ever mindful of the rival station.  
</P>
<P>
 But privately he conceded: "It may take a minute, it may take an hour. . . . I 
wish it would happen soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Nodding to the traffic jam his enterprise had created, he added: "After all, 
this is my dream." 
</P>
<P>
 Across the Valley in Sylmar, where a good deal of the quake damaged occurred, 
Sam Ajian expressed a similar sentiment. While his mini-mart was the only 
convenience store open within several miles, the lack of electricity to power 
his walk-in freezer left the place with a lot of tepid beer and the occasional 
impatient customer. 
</P>
<P>
 "What? Warm beer?" the man asked incredulously. "You're nuts. You should just 
close." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," Ajian said quietly, surveying the shop's tilting shelves and broken 
bottles. "I think I will, at least until things get back to normal." 
</P>

FIFTH SUSPECT IN PASADENA SLAYINGS OF 3 SURRENDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The fifth suspect sought in the Halloween slayings of three Pasadena 
teen-agers will be arraigned today in Pasadena Municipal Court after 
surrendering at police headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Herbert McClain, 25, who fled to the Midwest for a time, walked into Pasadena 
police headquarters and told police he was "tired of looking over his 
shoulder," Lt. Denis Petersen said. 
</P>
<P>
 He is the last suspect sought in the ambush killings of Edgar Evans, 13, and 
Stephen Coats and Reggie Crawford, both 14, as they walked home from a 
Halloween party. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say the suspects, all reputed Pasadena gang members, were angry at the 
shooting of one of their gang colleagues and may have mistakenly shot the three 
teen-agers, who had no gang ties.

ART REVIEW; CAUTION: BAD ART UP AHEAD; THE HOLLYWOOD LA BREA GATEWAY IS AN 
UNFORTUNATE PIECE OF PUBLIC SCULPTURE WHOSE BIGGEST FAULT IS ITS REPRESENTATION 
OF WOMEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Poor Hollywood. The neighborhood's already tarnished image wasn't helped by 
the 1992 riots, which further marred its eastern sections, nor by the 
rambunctious 1993 mayoral campaign, in which the winner made political hay by 
holding up the town as a civic symbol of L.A.'s decline. 
</P>
<P>
 And now this: The most depressingly awful work of public art in recent memory 
has lately been constructed, and at a highly visible locale. 
</P>
<P>
 On a palm-studded traffic island at the intersection of Hollywood Boulevard 
and La Brea Avenue stands a 30-foot-tall gazebo. Its latticed dome, capped by a 
tall spire, is held aloft by four life-size sculptural figures. Officially 
titled the Hollywood La Brea Gateway, the monument is plainly meant as a 
landmark to announce your arrival at the western edge of Tinseltown. 
</P>
<P>
 The La Brea Gateway is one of several street alterations along Hollywood 
Boulevard expected to be in place by spring. The Community Redevelopment Agency 
has been trying to spruce up the main downtown artery with bursts of tall and 
willowy palms, with clusters of theatrical street lights and with sparkly, 
light-reflective asphalt paving. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the way (or already in place) are several commissioned works: a small 
information kiosk at the corner of Cherokee Avenue, designed by Kenny 
Schneider; an "arch of light" at Vine Street, by theatrical lighting designer 
Tom Ruzika; and a decorative crosswalk at Ivar Avenue, designed by Susan 
Stinsmuehlen-Amend, a glass artisan who is the lead artist for the entire 
Hollywood Boulevard project. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, back at the gazebo, the name "Hollywood" appears no fewer than 
eight times atop the structure -- four of them in neon. Any doubt about where 
you might be is emphatically erased, while handily accommodated are tourist 
shutterbugs anxious for a souvenir that can be pictured from their favorite 
angle. 
</P>
<P>
 Say cheese. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, to be precise, say cheesecake. For the life-size figures holding up the 
gazebo's Hollywood-encrusted roof are curvaceous, silver-screen beauties of 
yore, sculpted in shiny stainless steel. 
</P>
<P>
 The nostalgia button is pushed straightaway by the structure's cartoonish 
reference to machine-age, Art Deco styling, as well as by its clumsy adaptation 
of a classical belvedere -- a gazebo or summer house from which to view the 
surrounding scenery. Here, however, you're meant to gaze at the gazebo itself. 
The caryatids are its visual focus. 
</P>
<P>
 Who are these four, glossy glamour-girls from days gone by, on which the 
Heavenly Dome of Hollywood so lightly rests? Alas, you can't tell just by 
looking, so crudely sculpted are the figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Stylistically reminiscent of the bumpers on a '47 Cadillac, all four are 
essentially identical, as if each is but a slightly altered variation on a 
standard model. A helpful plaque below each one identifies the shining star 
above: Mae West (1893-1988), Dolores Del Rio (1904-1983), Anna May Wong 
(1907-1961), Dorothy Dandridge (1923-1967). 
</P>
<P>
 White, Latina, Asian American, African American -- a generous guess would be 
that this ugly landmark was intended to stand as a tribute to women in 
Hollywood. Its supporting female players do claim lofty art-historical 
ancestors: the 5th-Century B.C. figures gracefully holding up the porch of the 
Erecthium on the ancient Greek Acropolis, for example, or those that once 
flanked a 6th-Century B.C. entryway at Delphi's sanctuary of Apollo. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, even setting aside the coarseness of the La Brea Gateway's sculptural 
design, an iconic celebration of "women in Hollywood" is far from what is 
finally declared. It is not, after all, a Hattie McDaniel or a Margaret Dumont 
who is doing caryatid duty. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the four voluptuous variations on a glamour-girl theme celebrate the 
idea that the power in movies that goes to women is confined to sexual power. 
Multicultural sexism certainly counts as a new twist on an old theme, but you'd 
be hard pressed to describe it as an improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 From the terrazzo star on which the gazebo rests, to a little sculpted finial 
of Marilyn Monroe -- her golden skirt billowing gaily around her head -- with 
which its spire is ignominiously crowned, sex as a woman's historic gateway to 
Hollywood couldn't be more explicitly described. Or cheered. 
</P>
<P>
 The paucity of imaginative thinking evident in the project is plain from the 
very conception of the site as a neighborhood's gateway. Sculptural gateways 
have recently been springing up all over Los Angeles -- or, at least they've 
been trying to. 
</P>
<P>
 The first came in 1987 with the ill-fated scheme for a West Coast Gateway, 
L.A.'s proposed answer to New York's Statue of Liberty. Then came the regional 
mass transit hub, dubbed Union Station Gateway Plaza, now under construction 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 Gateway Plaza includes several mediocre plans for public art, among them one 
expressly designated a Gateway to East L.A. And now, the La Brea Gateway will 
be matched at the strip's eastern end by an arch of lights: the Hollywood & 
Vine Gateway. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, the proliferating gateway-as-civic-symbol motif deserves a rest. 
</P>
<P>
 From the wreckage of this well-intentioned fiasco we can salvage one slight 
bit of good, if eccentric, news. Thankfully, the dismal Hollywood La Brea 
Gateway was not designed by an artist. At least, not by an artist in the usual 
sense. 
</P>
<P>
 For Hollywood, the CRA made the unusual decision to tap into a tangential 
pipeline of creative talent: applied artists who work in the movie industry. 
The project's 11-member selection jury did include three traditionally 
considered artists, but it also included a movie producer, a scenic painter and 
a set designer. 
</P>
<P>
 To create the La Brea Gateway the jury selected Catherine Hardwicke, a 
production designer whose credits include "The Sad Professor" for public 
television, "The New Monkees" for Columbia TV, "Car 54, Where Are You?" for 
Orion Pictures and "Tombstone," currently in release from Hollywood Pictures, 
as well as a variety of music videos for Talking Heads, Iggy Pop, Oingo Boingo 
and Smokey Robinson. Hardwicke subcontracted the fabrication of the gazebo's 
component parts to others, including Jack Brogan, Margo Chase, Richard Prantis 
and Karl West. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, an argument can be made for bringing non-traditional talents into the 
public art process. But, a specific dilemma looms large for any attempt to 
create a monumental tribute to women in the movie industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Movies, as the late film critic Vito Russo concisely put it, have always been 
our culture's principle cheerleader for strict, heterosexual role-playing, 
championed as an enduring norm. Given that track record, can Hollywood's own 
artisans seriously be expected to erect a monument that would do anything but 
keep the pitiful drum-beat going? 
</P>
<P>
 That a sculptural ode to a restrictive tradition of straight, female sexual 
power in movie-land has emerged from within the ranks of Hollywood's own 
artisans should surprise no one. That the CRA should spend $75,000 on such a 
demeaning, anachronistic -- and permanent -- song of praise should disappoint 
everyone.

THEATER REVIEW; 'JOINED AT THE HEAD' . . . AND THE HEART; REMINISCENT OF 'STEEL 
MAGNOLIAS,' CATHERINE BUTTERFIELD'S PLAY AT THE PASADENA PLAYHOUSE AVOIDS EASY 
SENTIMENT AND TURNS OUT TO BE A FUNNY, SURPRISINGLY UNAFFECTING WORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Throughout Catherine Butterfield's "Joined at the Head," at the Pasadena 
Playhouse, the main fixture of the set is a giant, upright square that looks at 
first like a chalkboard. There are no words or images on it, but neither is it 
a completely blank slate. It looks as if someone's earlier work has been 
erased. 
</P>
<P>
 The big slate, designed by James Noone, later becomes transparent enough to 
reveal a hospital bed on the other side. In conjunction with events in the 
play, it suggests that our carefully inscribed impressions of our lives -- and 
other people's lives as "backdrop" to our own -- can quickly be erased after 
closer examination or after an unexpected turn of events. 
</P>
<P>
 We're talking about cancer here. From a brief description of the play's 
premise -- a best-selling author meets and likes the cancer-stricken wife of 
her high school boyfriend -- "Joined at the Head" sounds like another women's 
bonding-and-disease play -- like, say, "Steel Magnolias." That impression might 
be fed by the fact that Pamela Berlin, who directed "Magnolias" at the 
Playhouse, is back with "Joined at the Head." 
</P>
<P>
 These subjects certainly are present within "Joined at the Head," but this is 
no tear-jerker. It's a surprisingly affable play. And also a surprisingly 
unaffecting one. 
</P>
<P>
 Maggie (Robin Pearson Rose) is promoting her latest book in Boston when her 
former boyfriend, unseen in 20 years, invites her to dinner with his wife. It 
turns out the wife (playwright Butterfield) also is named Maggy, but with a y. 
She was a cheerleader at the same school, but she was one class behind Maggie 
and Jim. Back then, she noticed them more than they noticed her. 
</P>
<P>
 The grown-up women like each other a lot. It's almost as if they're different 
halves of the same woman. Then again, they've just met. And Maggy has cancer. 
They won't have a long time to sort out and enjoy their friendship. 
</P>
<P>
 So Butterfield's script does that work for them. It consciously undercuts 
potential sentiment with amusing momentary asides to the audience or with whole 
dialogues that occur between characters, living or dead, in which they comment 
on events in the play -- such as whether the other characters are 
"romanticizing" the facts. 
</P>
<P>
 Maggie, who's more flustered about all of this than the others, apologizes to 
the audience for interrupting the flow of the play: "I didn't mean this to be a 
Brechtian evening. I was hoping you'd be able to indulge your emotions from 
time to time." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, this isn't a Brechtian evening. Butterfield's style -- also seen in 
her short "The Backflip," which served as a curtain-raiser for "Northern 
Lights" in Hollywood last fall -- is more playfully Pirandellian than 
Brechtian. All three of the principal characters have a keen sense of humor, 
which is the biggest reason we like them so much. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the purported de-romanticizing, however, these people still look too 
good to be true. Would the two women really forge such a strong bond in what 
appears to be two brief encounters? Even if they would, the ease with which 
they do it doesn't help the momentum of the play. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Butterfield kept the role of Maggy for herself, she based her play on 
an experience in which she played the Maggie role. Accordingly, Maggy and Jim 
actually are backdrop to Maggie. It's too bad that professional achiever Maggie 
is otherwise so alone and friendless. This borders on cliche, and an overly 
schematic one at that. But Rose has a clear view of Maggie's foggy feelings, 
and sharp comic timing as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Butterfield's performance gives Maggy a serene glow, despite her cancer 
ravages, that's lovely to behold. Perhaps a little too lovely. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Allin looks too boyish and shipshape for someone in Jim's state of 
mind, he makes much of what he's given. Jim often virtually freezes while the 
women do their Pirandellian shtick. But as recompense, Allin gets a silently 
intense moment in Act I, and a juicy (if somewhat awkwardly placed) monologue 
in Act II. 
</P>
<P>
 Six other actors play many minor roles well, often for comic effect. This play 
has its funny and lyrical moments. But its ultimate impact remains elusive.

THEATER REVIEW; EXISTENTIAL COMEDY COMES OUT OF 'FUNK' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN BRESLAUER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<P>
 They didn't plan it this way, really. But the toppled columns and other 
architectural fragments on the set of playwright John Patrick Shanley's "The 
Big Funk" at the Zephyr can't help but take on added resonance in the wake of 
Los Angeles' latest disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the shaken terrain under scrutiny in this West Coast premiere is a 
landscape of the psyche, not of the metropolis. In Act I, five Angst -filled 
souls whom you wouldn't think would know one another have a round-robin of 
encounters. In Act II, the odd lot comes together for a dinner of steak and 
mutual abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Best known for such plays as "Danny and the Deep Blue Sea" and such films as 
"Moonstruck," Shanley likes to interject the offbeat into the everyday. Yet 
he's also known for his hyper-realistic treatments of interpersonal conflicts 
-- as in his latest work, the well-received "Four Dogs and a Bone," currently 
playing in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The Big Funk" is a playful play more in the former category than the latter. 
Sounding too much as if it were written by a guy who just discovered the kicks 
of psychoanalysis, "The Big Funk" is larded with dime-store Freudianisms and 
often too full of its heady self. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it's an ambitious existential comedy that's considerably more 
sophisticated than this uneven production. Directed with a sometimes deft, 
sometimes lazy hand by Jules Aaron, much of the action is static -- with the 
notable exception of a surprisingly graceful bathing scene. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that much of the acting is enervated and uninventive, as though 
the actors were in as much of a funk as their characters. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Big Funk (A Casual Play)," Zephyr Theatre, 7456 Melrose Ave., 
Hollywood, Fridays, 8 p.m.; Saturdays, 7:30 & 10 p.m.; Sundays 7 p.m. Ends Feb.

MUSIC REVIEWS; CAMERATA TAKES ON CHALLENGE OF MOZART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Mozart Camerata hadn't gotten around to playing much Mozart yet this 
season and when it finally did, Sunday afternoon at St. Andrew's Church in 
Newport Beach, it took on those twin peaks of perfection, the "Jupiter" 
Symphony and the Piano Concerto No. 21, K. 467. 
</P>
<P>
 To re-create perfection: That is the problem performers face with the great 
works of Mozart. Imagine having to repaint the "Mona Lisa" every time you 
wanted to see it and the magnitude of the task becomes clear. And there's 
always someone around to complain that the smile's not quite right. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is to say that the concert -- conducted by music director Ami Porat, 
with Corey Cerovsek back again as both violin and piano soloist -- went fairly 
well, except that certain things kept it earthbound. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canadian-born Cerovsek, now in his early 20s, opened with the Piano 
Concerto No. 21 and immediately seemed hampered by elements not entirely in his 
control: the tempo and the quality of the piano. 
</P>
<P>
 Porat took the first movement at what seemed a speedy clip for the majestic 
music at hand. Technically capable, Cerovsek had no finger trouble, but 
musically he could do little but run through the notes. The piano he played on 
proved brittle in tone and blunt in attack. Thus the second movement, which 
depends for much of its magical effect on sonority and touch, moved along 
routinely. Only in the finale did all the elements really mesh, the soloist 
comfortable and dashing. 
</P>
<P>
 Switching to violin, Cerovsek offered a clean, bright and sprightly reading of 
the Violin Concerto, K. 218, with a gently intense and intimate account of the 
slow movement. He sounds equally assured on both violin and piano and possessed 
of a natural, if not especially boisterous, musicality. 
</P>
<P>
 To close the concert Porat led a "Jupiter" at once robust in spirit and 
faceted in expression, yet robbed of some of its effect by ragged ensemble and 
a not too careful regard for instrumental balances (as too in the 
accompaniments to the concertos). In short, a performance that reminded one of 
the "Jupiter' s" greatness without actually capturing it. TIMOTHY MANGAN

THEATER REVIEW; AN 'ALICE' THAT DELIVERS WIT, SILLINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Clever clowning and buoyant silliness highlight "Alice and the Wonderful Tea 
Party," the latest family production from the Actors Repertory Theatre at the 
Santa Monica Playhouse, where the nonsense is nonstop and the Queen of Hearts 
is not what he . . . er, she seems. 
</P>
<P>
 A professional ensemble of six romps through this musical tale about a 
grown-up Alice (Cydne Moore), who returns to her half-forgotten Wonderland 
where old friends turn out to be as odd and "contrarywise" as ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Alice is immediately recruited to find the tea for the Queen of Heart's tea 
party because Tweedle Dee (Cheryl Moffatt) and Tweedle Dum (Heather Ross) have 
eaten up all the refreshments. If Alice fails, "off with her head," threatens 
the very large Queen with the deep voice (James Cooper, an amusing sight in 
ropes of pearls and voluminous skirts). 
</P>
<P>
 The clowning is both physical and verbal, appealing to a wide age range. 
Authors and co-directors Chris De Carlo and Evelyn Rudie get a lot of mileage 
out of well-timed groaners -- Queen: "Answer the door!" Lady-in-Waiting 
(Moffatt): "What's it asking?" -- and witty musical wordplay. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of several rapid-fire numbers, Alice and the Wonderland gang discover a 
cornucopia of "tea," from "frugality, civility, enormity and absurdity" to 
Newton's "gravity" and the Old Woman in the Shoe's "fertility." 
</P>
<P>
 Rudie's lyrics (she also wrote the music) are nothing if not eclectic -- while 
painting roses, the Queen's pages' bouncy duet refers to Cubism, Impressionism, 
Art Deco and El Greco -- but the comic delivery earns laughs from the youngest 
viewers, even when the words pass over their heads. 
</P>
<P>
 The cast is polished, energetic and good-natured; the show has an appealing 
simplicity, despite its verbal gymnastics. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashley Hayes and Moffatt did the vivid costumes; Timothy Chadwick designed the 
simple, but satisfying rose-themed set and James Cooper's lively light design 
enhances the action. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Alice and the Wonderful Tea Party," Santa Monica Playhouse, 1211 4th St., 
Santa Monica, Saturdays-Sundays, 1 and 3 p.m. through Feb. 13. $8; (310)

TV REVIEWS; 'ISHI' CHRONICLES A WELL-KNOWN TALE OF TWO CULTURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN ZIMMERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Ishi, the Last Yahi Indian" boldly goes where others have gone before -- in 
TV movies (cable and network), books and magazine articles -- to chronicle the 
life of "the last wild Indian in North America." That may be why this "American 
Experience" segment, airing tonight at 9 on Channels 28 and 15 (at 7 on Channel 
24), seems so flat -- this is very familiar turf. 
</P>
<P>
 The details are well-known. In 1911, Ishi, after 40 years in hiding with a 
tiny band of fellow Yahis, left the Mount Lassen foothills in Northern 
California and walked into Oroville as the sole survivor of his tribe. His 
appearance was a windfall for Berkeley anthropologist Alfred Kroeber, who was 
thrilled to have an "uncontaminated and uncivilized" native to study. Ishi 
spent the rest of his life with Kroeber at the Museum of Anthropology in San 
Francisco, functioning as a living exhibit until his death in 1916 of 
tuberculosis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ishi" is at its best when showing still photographs and archival film footage 
of the dignified Ishi coping in his strange new world. It is weakest when 
relying on dramatized readings of letters and articles from those years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ishi, the Last Yahi Indian" is not up to par for the usually excellent 
"American Experience" series, but it serves as a decent introduction to those 
unfamiliar with the story. MARTIN ZIMMERMAN

TV REVIEWS; 'TEKWAR' SURRENDERS TO SCI-FI SILLIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From "Trek" to "Tek," a.k.a. Drek. 
</P>
<P>
 No one will confuse actor-author-director and former "Star Trek"-er William 
Shatner's TV movie "TekWar" (at 8 tonight m. on KTLA Channel 5) with serious 
science-fiction -- least of all Shatner, apparently, who at least seems to have 
a good handle on just how preposterous his auteur endeavor is. The cheeseball 
futurism here is just barely silly enough to qualify as watchable. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometime in the 2040s, hero Jake Cardigan (Greg Evigan) gets a wake-up call 
after a four-year slumber in the "cryobionic penal institute." (And we'll have 
none of those Bobbitt jokes here.) A la "Demolition Man," this ex-cop was doing 
some prison time in the deep freeze after being disgraced on a bum rap. Once 
sprung, Cardigan finds himself unjustly deserted by his wife and kid, which 
leaves him plenty of free time to take up the job offer from his mysterious 
springer, Bascom (Shatner). 
</P>
<P>
 His first private-investigative assignment from Bascom is to track down a 
missing professor who developed a chip that would render useless all the 
technology used for the deadly Tek, which is a highly addictive form of virtual 
reality. On this quest (and no doubt in future ones), Cardigan ends up teaming 
up with another ex-cop, who's black, and an android, who's female -- making 
this seem a lot like "The Mod Squad Visits Wild Palms." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't worry too much about keeping up with the Tek-heads, as the dialogue 
stays on the basic side. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm an android -- a level 10," says Beth (Torri Higginson). 
</P>
<P>
 "At least," replies Cardigan, who knows an 11 when he sees one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't underestimate my capacity for human emotion," says she, stepping into 
the shower. "Would you come in and wash my back?" 
</P>
<P>
 It gets goofier. There's action in a hockey rink -- with a robot knocking 
killer pucks at Cardigan -- for no immediately apparent reason other than that 
"TekWar" was filmed in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 Best of all, there's singer Sheena Easton in a climactic cameo as a woman 
named Warbride who leads a radical environmentalist group in the wilderness. 
Easton, erstwhile health-spa pitchperson turned guerrilla messiah, wears a 
form-fitting camouflage halter-top. Down with the earth-scorching robber 
barons, up with va-va-va- voom!  
</P>
<P>
 Next month: "TekLords," the sequel, in which we can only hope the android and 
the Lifecyclist get in a cat fight over Jake. CHRIS WILLMAN

 Building inspectors on Tuesday canvassed Fillmore's historic business 
district, stepping over heaps of rubble and shards of broken glass to determine 
the structural safety of red brick and masonry shops built around the turn of 
the century. 
</P>
<P>
 As shopkeepers waited nervously behind yellow police tape, inspectors 
concluded each tour by placing a tag on the building. A green tag meant the 
structure was safe. A red tag signified significant structural damage that 
needs immediate repair. 
</P>
<P>
 Grocer Jesse Segovia stood stunned outside Segovia's Fillmore Market -- red 
tags taped to its windows. "We all have to make a living out of here," said 
Segovia, who heads the family-owned market. "This store has been around for 100 
years and hopefully it will be around for another 100 years." 
</P>
<P>
 No city in Ventura County was shaken more violently than Fillmore, which sits 
astride the Oak Ridge Fault responsible for Monday's quake. More than 50 people 
were injured during the temblor that caused an estimated $200 million in damage 
to the small town that has worked hard at maintaining its rural identity. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like to call Fillmore the last, best small town in Southern California," 
said City Manager Roy Payne, noting that city leaders have poured hundreds of 
thousands of dollars into refurbishing the downtown district. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a very optimistic view of what we would accomplish this year," Payne 
said. "We've been working very diligently on bringing the downtown back to 
life. Now we're back to square one." 
</P>
<P>
 In other parts of a 40-square-block area crippled by the quake, hundreds of 
newly homeless residents waited for word on whether they would be allowed to 
return to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Building inspectors closed indefinitely a 40-unit apartment complex and a 
two-story residential hotel that was home to more than 100 fieldworkers. 
</P>
<P>
 The walls of the 65-year-old Fillmore Hotel crumbled and collapsed Monday, 
crushing a row of cars along Fillmore Street and leaving the one- and 
two-bedroom apartments exposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the laborers displaced by the earthquake spent Monday night in 
emergency shelters set up in Fillmore. More than 350 people spent the night at 
two shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedro Barajas, 53, and his eight children lived in an apartment at the 
Fillmore Hotel. When the quake hit, they escaped partially dressed with only 
their lives. Sheriff's deputies will not allow them to return to the building. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't get anything -- not even shoes," he said while surrounded by his 
children at a shelter set up by the Red Cross at San Cayetano Elementary 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 During the earthquake, Barajas and his family huddled in the kitchen as the 
hotel walls peeled away. "We made sure we had the little ones," Barajas said. 
"Then we got out." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout Fillmore, families spent the night outside, sleeping in tents or 
simply laying mattresses on their front lawns. Many homes throughout the city 
were left listing or knocked off their foundations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still nervous," said Leticia Quezada, 22, who spent the night on her 
mother's front lawn with her brother, sister and mother. The family had set up 
a barbecue grill and a table where they ate lunch and dinner on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We probably will stay out here tonight as well," Quezada said. 
</P>
<P>
 Down the block, the Wertz family had set up two pup tents and two living room 
chairs on the front lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a mess in there, everything is on the floor, and besides the 
youngest one is terrified," said Mary Jo Wertz, cradling her 6-year-old Jeanie. 
</P>
<P>
 On California 126, on the eastern edge of Fillmore, highway construction crews 
Tuesday were beginning work to patch a giant crater created by the explosion of 
a natural gas line near a mobile home park that was home to more than 500 
senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 The explosion ripped a 10-foot-wide crater in the highway, shooting a ball of 
fire into the sky. 
</P>
<P>
 The fireball, in turn, ignited a blaze at a nearby mobile home park. One 
mobile home burned to the ground. Two adjacent trailers were badly damaged by 
fire. Several others were shaken from their foundations during the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the mobile home residents spent the night at the emergency shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, we want to move back in as soon as it's livable," said Carol Dorman, who 
runs Dino's drive-through in Fillmore and who lives in the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, merchants met with city officials at a spirited meeting Tuesday 
morning, telling them they were anxious to start rebuilding. But city officials 
said merchants would not be allowed to return to their shops until today at the 
earliest. 
</P>
<P>
 Building inspectors Tuesday continued a door-to-door survey of all houses and 
buildings throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of that effort focused on Fillmore's showcase business district where the 
quake fractured about 60 historic buildings along the city's main thoroughfare 
and sent brick and masonry crashing to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the downtown buildings are made of unreinforced masonry and considered 
unsafe during a major earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like most places," said Donald Jephcott, an Orange County structural 
engineer brought in to help determine whether downtown building were safe to 
re-enter. "These old buildings all come apart when they are shaken."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; RESIDENTS OF MOBILE HOMES ARE HIT HARD; SIMI 
VALLEY: ONLY ABOUT 25 OF ONE PARK'S 270 UNITS ESCAPED DAMAGE AND NONE HAD GAS 
OR WATER TUESDAY. 
</P>

<P>
 Simi Valley resident Scott Lewis stood outside his mobile home Tuesday morning 
surveying the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis, one of the occupants of the 250 homes in the Simi Country Mobile Home 
Estates park on Rory Lane that were either destroyed or severely damaged by the 
quake, was left without power, gas or water Tuesday. He was one of many 
residents who said they were considering moving out of the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Although power and water had been restored to much of the city by late 
Tuesday, some east-end neighborhoods were still without services. For residents 
of those areas, the city is supplying potable water at Santa Susana Park, the 
Metrolink Station on Los Angeles Avenue and Royal High School on Royal Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis' double-coach mobile home had twisted completely off its supporting 
jacks and dropped 2 feet to the concrete surface, cracking walls and puncturing 
holes through the floor during the early morning quake Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a 1 1/2-year-old daughter, and I tell you I've never been more scared 
in my life," said Lewis, 26. "I grabbed her like a football, and I grabbed my 
wife's arm and I ran for the door. I got them out of there. That's all I care 
about." 
</P>
<P>
 Several apartment complexes and shopping centers nearby also received major 
structural damage in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley Rehabilitation Center and Nursing Home on Los Angeles Avenue 
was condemned Monday, and its 94 patients were transferred to several hospitals 
and nursing homes throughout the east county, said Cecil Mays, an official at 
the center. 
</P>
<P>
 A mile away, the roofs of the Pic-N-Save and the Sears Outlet Store in the 
Tapo Oaks shopping center on Tapo Street collapsed. Down the street, two 
buildings of Simi Valley's famed Bottle Village also came crashing down. The 
one-acre village, which includes several buildings made of glass bottles, is 
internationally recognized as a valuable work of folk art. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of Bottle Village had hopes of restoring the deteriorating 
structures, which were built 30 years ago. The Preserve the Bottle Village 
Committee had been told recently that it had until June to supply the city with 
a plan to make the village earthquake-proof or face possible demolition. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to boost local interest in the village, Janice Wilson, who was leading 
the preservation efforts, had launched two educational projects: a video about 
the village and a grant-funded reprinting of a booklet by its creator, 
"Grandma" Tressa Prisbey. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson could not be reached for comment Tuesday. But a note was left on the 
wrought-iron gates in front of the village on Cochran Street: "No one was hurt. 
Cleanup days Saturday and Sunday, Jan. 23 and Jan. 24. Please come by if you 
can, even for a few minutes. Thanks." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbor Tom Rupert, whose cinder-block wall separating him from the collapsed 
village, said he was impressed that not all of the glass bottle buildings had 
toppled over. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe Grandma Prisbey knew how to build walls better than we do," laughed 
Wilson, a concrete contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the Simi Country mobile home park, many of whom are retired or 
otherwise living on modest incomes, were among the hardest hit in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of elderly people in here, and a lot of them were trapped in 
their houses," said resident Tim Limb, 36, whose mobile home was one of the few 
spared. "I just grabbed some of the young people and started going around 
helping people get out." 
</P>
<P>
 Miraculously, he said, there were no major injuries. "There were just some 
scratches and banged knees," he said. "One man had a gash on his head. But that 
was about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, only about 25 of the park's 270 mobile homes escaped damage. And only a 
few of those had power Tuesday. None had gas or water. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've only been here three weeks," said manager Mike Pennington, 42, who had 
little more than condolences to offer his tenants. "Nice welcome, huh?" 
</P>
<P>
 Pennington said it would probably be several weeks before all of the damaged 
mobile homes were removed. Several tenants told him Tuesday they planned to 
move out. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tim and Cheryl Peel, who have lived in the park for 5 1/2 years, were among 
those who said they probably would be leaving. Their mobile home split in two 
after it was knocked off its foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't feel safe in a mobile home anymore," said Tim Peel, 40, who was 
inside the mobile home with his 3-year-old daughter when the quake hit. "I used 
to, but this was quite a ride. We can't stay here. I just want to get what we 
can and get out of here." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbor Martha Cuilty, 65, was rummaging through her fallen mobile home with 
the help of her grandchildren Tuesday, trying to salvage whatever personal 
belongings and furniture she could. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think it was that bad," said Cuilty, a 17-year resident of the park. 
"But God -- when I came outside, it was terrible, terrible." 
</P>
<P>
 At the west end of the city, the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library was closed 
to the public Tuesday, as workers rearranged exhibits that had been jostled 
around but otherwise saved from serious damage by special earthquake-proof 
mounting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were very blessed that we had no major damage," said Dennis Daellenbach, 
assistant director of the museum and library near Simi Valley. "In almost all 
of the cases, the earthquake mitigation mounts did their job." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there were some signs of minor damage throughout the library. The quake 
left two visible cracks in the ceiling of the life-size Oval Office replica. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our intent is to open" today, said library curator Ann Bethel. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the city of Simi Valley has set up hot lines for public assistance 
and services. Residents may call 583-6321 or 583-6309. 
</P>
<P>
 Building and safety inspectors are canvassing the city to assess and estimate 
damage as quickly as possible, officials said. Residents who believe their 
homes have structural damage should call 583-6723. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Greg Stratton said that a disaster assistance center will be set up in 
the city within the next few days to aid residents.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; OFFICIALS EXPECT DISASTER DECLARATION; 
RECOVERY: INJURIES RISE TO 800 IN VENTURA COUNTY. DAMAGE ESTIMATES ARE AT LEAST 
$400 MILLION. AND MANY BUSINESSES MAY NOT BE ABLE TO WEATHER THE CATASTROPHE.

<P>
 Damage estimates rose to at least $400 million and injury totals climbed to 
800 on Tuesday as the full magnitude of Ventura County's worst earthquake in 
recent history began to emerge. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said they expected the county to soon join the San Fernando Valley, 
where Monday's 6.6-magnitude Northridge temblor was centered, as a federal 
disaster area. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has never been (a disaster) that affected this county so severely and 
so immediately as this earthquake," said Sheriff Larry Carpenter, whose 
department is directing emergency services. 
</P>
<P>
 And recovery is going to be difficult, said Chief Deputy Sheriff Oscar Fuller. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people's homes are ruined, a lot of jobs are up in the air and a lot 
of businesses that were already struggling may not survive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 800 injuries, only about two dozen were serious, hospitals reported. 
But a 60-year-old Simi Valley man died of a heart attack shortly after the 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The historic railroad town of Fillmore suffered at least $200 million in 
losses, because dozens of aging masonry shops downtown collapsed, and between 
600 and 1,000 houses were damaged, the Sheriff's Department estimated. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was in the newer east county communities of Simi Valley, Thousand Oaks 
and Moorpark that the estimates of devastation rose most sharply. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's significant structural damage that we're just beginning to see right 
now," said Mike Sedell, assistant city manager in Simi Valley. "The damage here 
could possibly be in excess of $200 million." 
</P>
<P>
 In all, perhaps 1,000 businesses were damaged in Simi Valley, and hundreds of 
homes also had damaged foundations, cracked walls, twisted beams and broken 
windows, Sedell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley Courthouse, library and City Hall all had major water damage, 
and structural damage at Simi Valley High School was so severe that officials 
said they could not guess when students might be able to return. 
</P>
<P>
 The roof collapsed at the Thousand Oaks Library. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is heartbreaking," City Councilwoman Elois Zeanah said. "Our library is 
one of the greatest resources we have." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the main library may not reopen for months. Zeanah said 
many books will be transferred to the Newbury Park branch, which remained open 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in Thousand Oaks, a Robinsons-May store at The Oaks mall was damaged. 
Dozens of houses in the affluent Sunset Hills subdivision of Thousand Oaks were 
damaged as bricks crumbled off chimneys or entire chimneys pulled away from 
homes. Many homes have huge cracks in the stucco that run from ceiling to floor 
both inside and outside. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good thing we were stumbling when we tried to come down the stairs. If 
we had made it out, we would have been under this rubble," resident Phil 
McGrath said Tuesday, pointing to a pile of bricks that fell from a pillar. 
</P>
<P>
 The Moorpark College library and gymnasium suffered enough damage that the 
facilities must undergo extensive repair and possibly reconstruction, said 
college President James Walker. 
</P>
<P>
 He said classes will begin today, after only a one-day delay. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to get kids who were late registering enrolled tomorrow," he said. 
"The longer you wait, the more students you lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks sustained only minor damage and 
classes beginning the spring semester were held Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, emergency officials said about 450 people were still housed at 
shelters in Fillmore and Simi Valley. But the number of injured residents at 
county hospital emergency rooms slowed to a trickle, climbing from 725 to about 
800 by Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Some east county stores were still rationing food and water on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as officials began their detailed injury and damage assessments, the 
county was getting back on its feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Electric power was restored in Fillmore and Piru by Tuesday morning. And by 
late afternoon, Simi Valley had regained all electrical power and about 90% of 
its water supply. Only the far eastern end of the city still had no water later 
in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 All east county school districts were closed for the day, as were those in 
Fillmore and the Ocean View district in the Oxnard Plain. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the western county, where damage was sparse, most students were at 
their desks and teachers were trying to reduce the trauma of a day and a night 
of shaking from hundreds of continuing aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Gearing up for months of gridlock caused by eight damaged freeways in the Los 
Angeles Basin, Ventura County transportation officials said they anticipated a 
dramatic increase in ridership on the Metrolink train route from Moorpark and 
Simi Valley to downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 None of the commuter trains ran Tuesday because a freight train hauling toxic 
materials was derailed by the temblor and blocked the track. But Mary Travis, 
manager of the county's transit programs, said she expected the track to be 
clear by this morning or tomorrow -- and the number of Ventura County riders to 
skyrocket from the current 600 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to cause a major change in a lot of people's commuting patterns 
for months to come," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the tracks are clear, four rush-hour trains will begin running this morning 
at 5:15 from Moorpark and 5:28 from Simi. Three more departures follow at 
intervals of about 45 minutes. Cost is $12 round trip from Moorpark and $10 
from Simi Valley. For information, call 800-438-1112 or 800-371-5465. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Bridges, the county's assistant administrator of emergency medical 
services, said the earthquake proved how vital it is that the county maintain 
its network of community hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Care at Santa Paula Hospital and Simi Valley Hospital, both of which had 
experienced financial problems, saved lives, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't tell you how valuable it was that these two somewhat remote areas had 
these services," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, county emergency officials said agency responses to the earthquake 
were as good as could be expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Within 45 minutes of the quake, Ventura County and the cities of Fillmore and 
Simi Valley activated highly detailed disaster response plans. Command centers 
were set up at Fillmore City Hall, the old county courthouse in Simi Valley and 
at sheriff's stations in Ventura and in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard and Ventura briefly set up command centers, which were shut down 
because damage was minimal. 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore officials responded the quickest, arriving at their command center at 
City Hall within 15 minutes of the quake. They were joined by about 30 members 
of the Fillmore Citizens' Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore officials said a disaster drill in November that simulated a break in 
the Piru Dam helped speed their response and informed residents that San 
Cayetano Elementary School would be the main shelter. About 200 residents had 
gathered on the school's lawn by daylight, sitting on green cots and wrapping 
themselves in blankets. 
</P>
<P>
 "People knew to come here right away," said Bob Buckles, a Fillmore city 
employee who planned the emergency drill and helped distribute blankets, cots 
and medical supplies at the school Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Wendy Haddock, assistant director of the sheriff's Office of Emergency 
Services, said a county drill last fall highlighted the vulnerability of 
buildings in Fillmore with unreinforced masonry. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't any surprise that Fillmore was going to have some problems. It was 
kind of a surprise that Simi Valley did because their buildings are fairly 
new," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Radio difficulties and a loss of some telephone lines made early 
communications among agencies chaotic. Ham operators throughout Ventura County 
provided early damage assessments, zeroing in on Fillmore and Simi Valley as 
the hardest hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of an overwhelming number of calls and radio difficulties, the County 
Fire Department decentralized its dispatching system. Instead of dispatchers 
telling firefighters where to go, battalion chiefs in each area prioritized the 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
 County firefighters responded to 220 emergencies within hours of the 
earthquake, Assistant Chief Dick Perry said.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; 8,000 SIMI HOUSEHOLDS WAIT FOR WATER SERVICE TO 
RESUME 
</P>

 Since Monday's earthquake, Simi Valley resident Jim Kiblinger has developed a 
new appreciation for a cup of coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 While most of the city's residents awoke Tuesday to find running water 
restored to their homes, Kiblinger had to dip into his 300-gallon spa in order 
to make his morning brew. 
</P>
<P>
 About 8,000 homes citywide were without water late Tuesday, as workers rushed 
to repair cracked pipes and broken reservoirs. "We've had all the neighbors 
coming over," said Kiblinger, who lives in the Pride housing tract in the elbow 
of Los Angeles Avenue and Kuehner Drive. "I keep my spa pretty clean; it makes 
some good coffee." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials for the city, which provides water through a water district to about 
two-thirds of Simi Valley's 120,000 residents, said they hoped to have service 
restored by late Tuesday to its 7,000 customers without service. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping people will be able to turn on their faucets without any problem 
within several hours," Assistant City Manager Mike Sedell said late Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 About 1,000 Simi Valley residents served by a second water company, Southern 
California Water, were also without service. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's reservoirs on Rebecca and Katherine streets were completely shut 
down, spokeswoman Charlotte St. John said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really don't have any idea what the extent of the damage is," St. John 
said. "We're just dealing with this one step at a time." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the company was pumping water from its partially damaged 
Sycamore Drive facility, said Mike Gutierrez, director of water resources. 
</P>
<P>
 Water company workers opened a fire hydrant at Heywood Street and Bridget 
Avenue to fill containers for residents who needed water to bathe and flush 
their toilets. 
</P>
<P>
 And city workers gave out free drinking water at Santa Susana Park, Royal High 
School and at the city's Metrolink station. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping this won't go on much longer," Gutierrez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said successful delivery of water depends not only on the city and 
Southern California Water, but also on the ability of the Calleguas Municipal 
Water District to repair damaged feeder lines. 
</P>
<P>
 During the quake, air vacuum valves were ripped from Calleguas' two main water 
lines. The district serves about 500,000 Ventura County residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Maintenance crews working around the clock have patched most of those valves, 
said General Manager Donald Kendall. But the district was still repairing 
cracks in the pipelines late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lines are damaged, but we have a good backup system," Kendall said. "We 
are going to get things up and running pretty quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 The district's sole source of water, a filtration plant in Granada Hills 
operated by the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, was shut 
down after the quake, leaving Calleguas with a two-week reserve supply in Simi 
Valley's Lake Bard. 
</P>
<P>
 A pipeline connecting the Granada Hills plant to Ventura County was also 
severely damaged, Kendall said, setting off a chain reaction that could 
threaten Simi Valley's water supply. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one lifeline link we had is gone," Kendall said. "But if people conserve 
water, we should be able to make it through." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Metropolitan Water District said they hoped to have the 
line repaired by the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Kendall said water with a brownish tinge is OK to drink, but all residents 
should boil their water, regardless of color. 
</P>
<P>
 "The water is safe," Kendall said. "This is just a precautionary measure."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; SIMI, FILLMORE SCHOOLS CLOSED AS DAMAGE IS 
ASSESSED; EDUCATION: CAMPUSES IN THE THOUSAND OAKS, MOORPARK, OAK PARK AND 
OCEAN VIEW DISTRICTS ARE SCHEDULED TO REOPEN TO STUDENTS TODAY.

<P>
 All Simi Valley and Fillmore schools will remain closed to students this 
morning as officials continue to clean up and assess damage from Monday's 
temblor, district workers said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools in the Thousand Oaks, Moorpark, Oak Park and Ocean View districts, 
which also were closed Tuesday, are scheduled to reopen to students today. 
Officials in those districts said inspections showed that their schools 
suffered no major damage. 
</P>
<P>
 At schools that were open Tuesday, many teachers spent the first part of the 
day discussing the earthquake with their students to calm the children's fears. 
</P>
<P>
 In Fillmore, one of the cities hardest hit by the earthquake, district 
officials said their schools are structurally sound and will reopen Thursday 
after further cleanup. But in Simi Valley, officials said that only 14 of the 
district's 27 schools are sure to reopen then.  
</P>
<P>
 Saying they may need more time to inspect the other 13 sites, Simi Valley 
officials said they will know by this afternoon the complete list of the 
schools that will open Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials were particularly concerned about three schools on the east 
side that may have suffered serious structural damage: Simi Valley High, Valley 
View Junior High and Township Elementary. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could have been a lot worse, but of course it's devastating," said Kathryn 
Scroggin, principal at Simi Valley High, where cracks and fallen plaster were 
visible outside the gymnasium, multipurpose building and library. 
</P>
<P>
 Scroggin and other school officials are preparing for the worst: the 
possibility that Monday's earthquake caused so much damage that the 30-year-old 
high school campus and the other two schools will be closed indefinitely.  
</P>
<P>
 School officials Tuesday were considering all options, including setting a 
staggered schedule at Royal and Apollo high schools so Simi Valley High's 2,100 
students could attend classes on those campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar plans might have to be developed for other schools, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We probably will have short-term and long-term plans," Simi Valley Supt. Mary 
Beth Wolford said. "Right now, our goal is to get students back to school as 
quickly as possible, whether we double up or however we have to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Except for Fillmore and Simi Valley, all other school districts that were 
closed Tuesday were scheduled to reopen today, including the Conejo Valley, 
Moorpark, Oak Park and Ocean View Elementary districts. 
</P>
<P>
 At many schools that were open Tuesday, school officials reported that 
hundreds of parents were keeping their children home following the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 12,000-student Oxnard Elementary School District, the absentee rate was 
60% higher than normal, and in Ventura the number of students absent from some 
schools was three times higher than usual. 
</P>
<P>
 For many of the children who did go to school, the first assignment Tuesday 
was to dart under their desks in earthquake drills. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials said they hoped the drills would instill confidence in the 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted the teachers to do their drop drills and fire drills to reinforce 
to the children that there is something they can do to protect themselves when 
an earthquake hits," said Bernard Korenstein, assistant superintendent of the 
Oxnard Elementary School District. 
</P>
<P>
 After the drills, the next assignment in many classrooms was for the children 
to talk about where they were, what they were doing and how they felt during 
Monday's temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers in Ojai said their students couldn't stop talking about the 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids were asking each other, 'Did you feel it? Did you feel it!' " said 
Suzanne Lovelady, who teaches a combined second- and third-grade class at San 
Antonio School. "They wanted to talk about it. It seemed to calm them down, get 
it out of their systems. You could tell they were scared and wanted things to 
be normal." 
</P>
<P>
 In Oxnard, teacher Laura Suel at Rose Avenue School agreed that discussing the 
earthquake in detail was therapeutic for second-grade students. 
</P>
<P>
 "A couple of them almost cried," Suel said. "But by the time the first hour 
was over, I think they were feeling better." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all children were traumatized by the earthquake: Some slept through it. 
</P>
<P>
 But 8-year-old Danika Jacob, a third-grader at Blanche Reynolds School in 
Ventura, said she did feel slightly different than usual when she woke up from 
her deep slumber Monday morning: "I had a stiff neck." 
</P>
<P>
 Students in Danika's class spent part of Tuesday morning making lists of items 
they want to get for their personal earthquake kits at home and drawing 
pictures of what they were doing during the earthquake. Danika's picture showed 
her sound asleep in bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Middle-school students were more shook up by the earthquake than elementary 
school children because the older children better comprehend the danger, said 
Kris Bergstrom, principal at Cabrillo Middle School in Ventura. But children in 
the middle-school years are too young to cope well with emotions stirred up by 
such a disaster, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 "They know it's serious and they know what the implications are, but they 
don't know how to handle their emotions," Bergstrom said. Many of the sixth- 
through eighth-grade students at Cabrillo acted sillier than usual Tuesday, she 
said, which she interpreted as their reaction to the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley schools that are definitely scheduled to open Thursday are 
Abraham Lincoln Elementary, Apollo High, Berylwood Elementary, Crestview 
Elementary, Hillside Junior High, Hollow Hills Elementary, Justin Elementary, 
Madera Elementary, Park View Elementary, Royal High, Simi Elementary, Simi 
Valley Adult School, Sinaloa Junior High and Vista Elementary.

 Put this theory in the doghouse: One comparatively recent myth is that 
earthquakes are preceded by large numbers of missing-pet items in local 
newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 It was propounded by a geologist named Jim Berkland, who was profiled in True 
News magazine in 1992 under the headline: "He Finds Earthquakes in the 
Classifieds." 
</P>
<P>
 Berkland's belief was that "animals . . . somehow sense changes in our 
magnetic field that precede these kinds of disasters." He said there was "an 
all-time record of 83 missing dog ads in the Los Angeles Times classifieds" at 
the time of the "big earthquake that struck the L.A. area last summer" -- 
apparently a reference to the Twin Temblors of June, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's L.A. Times, however, had only 19 missing-pet ads, in addition to 26 
found-pet items. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Berkland plays it safe. True News identified him as a San Jose 
resident.

 In need, sort of: While nervous residents could be seen stocking up on 
supplies all over the Southland, Westsiders still had standards to observe. 
</P>
<P>
 A woman appeared at a convenience store on Montana Avenue in Santa Monica 
after the quake and breathlessly asked: "Sir, I need bread. Do you have any 
bread?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I only have day-old bread," replied the proprietor, whose store was a 
shambles. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman hesitated. "Oh," she said. "Wait just a minute. I'll have to check 
with my husband." 
</P>
<P>
 She scurried out to a nearby parking lot to consult. 
</P>
<P>
 She returned and announced: "He says if that's all you've got, we'll take it."

 View from the East: CBS co-anchor Connie Chung declared on Monday night's 
newscast that the quake had "wiped out the freeway system in L.A.," which 
struck us as a bit of an overstatement. But the maps of L.A. in Tuesday's New 
York Times seemed to confirm this assertion. The detailed maps of L.A.'s 
transportation system gave no hint of the new Century Freeway (105). Inasmuch 
as it cost $2.2 billion and decades to build, we certainly hope it still 
exists.

 Earthquake chasing?Don Pellissier of Whittier sent along what he called a 
"crass bit of opportunism" -- a flyer from a Prudential real estate agent that 
said, "This morning's 'wake-up call' should be a reminder for us to check our 
level of preparedness. I thought these tips would be helpful for you. I trust 
you and your loved ones are well." 
</P>
<P>
 The flyer also contained a section titled: "27 Things to Help You Survive an 
Earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 Pellissier said he found the flyer on his front porch "a mere eight hours 
after the earthquake."

 One piece of good news: "We've been watching TV for 10 hours, and there hasn't 
been one mention of the Menendez brothers, the Bobbitts or Michael Jackson," 
said Bruce Hunkins of Inglewood, who phoned The Times the day of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's a silver lining to the quake, this is it." miscelLAny: 
</P>
<P>
 So it's back to Square 1 for the Santa Monica Freeway. Old-timers will recall 
that during the first three years of its existence, 1961-1964, there was no 
stretch of freeway between Vermont Avenue and La Cienega Boulevard.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; AREA'S LONG-TERM FORECAST CALLS FOR BIG 
TEMBLOR; SEISMOLOGY: EXPERTS SAY COUNTY'S NUMEROUS FAULTS LEAVE IT PRONE TO A 
MAJOR HIT 'SOMETIME IN THE NEXT 1,000 YEARS.'

 The chances of a major earthquake in Ventura County have increased slightly 
since Monday's magnitude 6.6 quake that devastated parts of Ventura and Los 
Angeles counties, quake experts said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "But that chance is very slight," said Lucille M. Jones, a scientist at the 
U.S. Geological Survey at Caltech. "Only about 5% or 10% of the time is an 
earthquake followed by another in the same general area." 
</P>
<P>
 As each day passes, the chances diminish that Monday's earthquake was merely a 
foreshock of a greater event to come in the near future, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a week or so, the chances that this was a foreshock will be very, very 
low," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the long term -- which in geology is measured in centuries or more -- 
Ventura County remains ripe for a major quake, seismologists said, because it 
is riddled with more than 300 faults. 
</P>
<P>
 Seismologists have not pinpointed which fault was responsible for Monday's 
quake, which was centered at Northridge about 10 miles east of the Ventura 
County line. 
</P>
<P>
 But they say it may well have occurred on the eastern end of the Oak Ridge 
Fault, a geologically fast-moving fracture that extends through Ventura County 
to the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge quake did nothing to relieve pressure that has built up during 
the last 200 years on the Ventura County portion of the fault, Jones said. That 
leaves what seismologists call the Ventura Basin prone to a major earthquake, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Ventura Basin is more vulnerable to an earthquake than other parts of 
Southern California because it has more active faults," Jones said. "The Oak 
Ridge potential (for a major earthquake) is up quite high because it's a 
fast-moving fault." 
</P>
<P>
 But not necessarily any time soon, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's geologic time, not human time," Jones said. "On a geological time frame, 
that means we're predicting an earthquake sometime in the next 1,000 years." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, scientists reported that mountain ranges north and south of the Santa 
Clara River Valley are moving together, possibly along the Oak Ridge Fault or 
the San Cayetano Fault to the north. 
</P>
<P>
 In her report, Caltech geophysicist Andrea Donnelian called Ventura County the 
"second most hazardous area in Southern California next to the San Andreas 
Fault." 
</P>
<P>
 The mountains are moving together at the rate of about half an inch per year 
-- considered rapid in geological time. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a pretty high rate of movement," said James J. Mori, a seismologist 
colleague of Jones at the U.S. Geological Survey. "If all that movement is 
being stored in terms of thrust on the fault, it certainly means there is a 
high potential for a damaging earthquake in the Ventura Basin." 
</P>
<P>
 But Mori and Jones said they need much more information before they could say 
how quickly the earthquake might occur. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the region is laced with about 300 faults capable of producing an 
earthquake of 6 or greater on the Richter scale, another fault in the region 
also could produce a large temblor, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mori said seismologists are not yet certain that the quake occurred along the 
Oak Ridge Fault because more studies are needed. But when seismologists plot 
the quake and its aftershocks on a map, the pattern indicates that the Oak 
Ridge is at least partly responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our best guess," Mori said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert S. Yeats, a geologist at Oregon State University who is a former Ojai 
resident, has studied the area and found that earthquakes relieve pressure 
along Ventura County faults about once every 200 years. 
</P>
<P>
 He said there is no evidence of a major earthquake in the area for at least 
that long, although there may have been one offshore in 1812. Ventura County 
Fault Lines Scientists say the fast-moving Oak Ridge Fault could be the source 
of a major quake in Ventura County. It is suspected of causing Monday's quake 
in Northridge.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; CREWS WORK TO CONTAIN CRUDE-OIL SPILL IN RIVER; 
ECOLOGY: A 15-MILE SLICK SPREADS TO PIRU AFTER PIPELINE BREAKS DURING JOLT. 
AREA IS HOME TO TWO ENDANGERED SPECIES.

<P>
 Cleanup crews scrambled Tuesday to contain a 15-mile-long slick of crude oil 
that spilled into the Santa Clara River, spreading from Santa Clarita to Piru, 
after a nearby pipeline ruptured during Monday's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials estimate 147,000 gallons leaked out of the 10-inch-wide pipeline 
before the spill was discovered at 8:30 a.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 By late Tuesday, state officials at the spill site had not found any injured 
fish or birds, said Mary Gale, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Fish 
and Game's Office of Oil Spill Prevention and Response. However, she said it 
was too early to determine the spill's full effect on the river and its 
wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally, you don't see (injuries to birds) in the first 24 hours," Gale 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The segment of the river stained by the spill is home to two federally 
endangered species -- the three-spined unarmored stickleback fish, and the 
least Bell's vireo, a bird. Also threatened are several species of birds and 
fish that state officials consider vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 The pipeline is owned by Long Beach-based Four Corners Pipe Line Co., a 
subsidiary of Arco. The line, used to transport oil from Kern County to several 
Los Angeles refineries, broke in nine places during the quake, an Arco official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two breaks in a 100-yard area in Santa Clarita, one in the pipe and another in 
the pipe's pumping station, contributed to the river spill.  
</P>
<P>
 The pipeline, which is more than 50 years old, was not pumping oil at the time 
of the quake but held a residue of heavy crude, said Albert Greenstein, an Arco 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 200 workers hired by Arco used booms and constructed earthen dams to 
contain the spill downriver just south of the town of Piru. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the spill site said less than a quarter of the oil had been 
collected late Tuesday, and they predicted the spill could take months to clean 
up completely. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very large oil spill," said Reed Smith, a Fish and Game official. 
"It's a mess." 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's spill was the second in the same environmentally fragile stretch of 
the Santa Clara River in recent years. In January, 1991, nearly 75,000 gallons 
of crude gushed from a ruptured Mobil Oil pipeline, polluting a 15-mile stretch 
of the river and killing at least 186 birds, wildlife authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's heartbreaking that the river is taking another blow," said Cat Brown, a 
wildlife biologist for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. "The short-term and 
long-term effects of a spill this size could spell disaster for that area."  
</P>
<P>
 After the 1991 spill, Mobil contributed $200,000 to environmental projects to 
settle a criminal complaint arising from the spill. 
</P>
<P>
 Gale said she did not know if Arco might be liable for damages from the spill. 
"We're only a day and a half into it," she said. "I don't feel comfortable 
making a statement about the possible prosecution." 
</P>
<P>
 The spill is also the second in less than a month involving a pipeline in an 
environmentally sensitive area. On Christmas Day, more than 2,000 barrels of 
oil spilled from a ruptured pipeline in McGrath Lake near the mouth of the 
Santa Clara River. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say pipelines are supposed to be safer than other means of moving oil, 
but I guess it's all relative," Brown said. "I think these spills argue for 
stronger standards in terms of construction and maintenance of these 
pipelines."  
</P>
<P>
 Greenstein said pipelines tend to move with the ground during an earthquake, 
but that in this instance the quake was centered too close to the pipe to avoid 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it's that strong and that close, there isn't much you can do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the nine breaks along the line, the two in Santa Clarita were the only ones 
to spill oil into a body of water. Another break in the same pipeline spilled 
into a San Fernando street Monday and ignited, destroying 17 vehicles, damaging 
four homes and severely burning a man passing the fire on his motorcycle, 
Greenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of these problems have been highly unusual for a pipeline," he said. 
"It's very unfortunate that any of this had to happen."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; AS ROADS GET CROWDED, METROLINK RIDERSHIP 
EXPECTED TO SWELL; COMMUTING: TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION OFFICIALS CONSIDER 
SPECIAL TRAINS WEST TO OXNARD OR VENTURA TO HELP RELIEVE THE BURDEN ON 
HIGHWAYS.

 Ventura County residents driving into Los Angeles enjoyed a fairly smooth 
commute Tuesday, officials said, but the same trip will become much more 
difficult today and through the end of the week as more commuters return to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far, so good; we'll see what happens tomorrow," Russell Snyder, spokesman 
for the state Department of Transportation, said Tuesday. "A lot of people 
stayed home, so that helped us a lot today. But we do expect traffic to pick up 
later in the week." 
</P>
<P>
 With the Simi Valley Freeway closed through parts of the San Fernando Valley 
and the Golden State Freeway shut down indefinitely, Snyder said drivers are 
left with few alternatives when driving east and south. The only major route 
now available is the Ventura Freeway, and Snyder said drivers will have to 
compete for space on that road for the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 118 (Simi Valley Freeway) is still a major problem, and that's an 
important route for a lot of Ventura County commuters, as is I-5 (the Golden 
State Freeway)," Snyder said. "This isn't going to be something that's going to 
be over tomorrow. It's going to be a long-term closure, and it's going to 
require a lot of patience and cooperation from people who use those routes." 
</P>
<P>
 One potentially mitigating factor is the expected restoration Thursday of 
Metrolink commuter rail service from Moorpark and Simi Valley into the San 
Fernando Valley and downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Travis, manager of transit programs for the Ventura County Transportation 
Commission, said she is hopeful that Metrolink service would resume shortly and 
that ridership is expected to soar far past the 500 to 600 Ventura County 
residents who usually take the weekday trains. 
</P>
<P>
 Travis also said Transportation Commission officials are investigating the 
possibility of running special Metrolink trains as far west as Oxnard or 
Ventura to help relieve the burden on highways. 
</P>
<P>
 County transportation officials have been considering expanding Metrolink 
service to western Ventura County since last summer's successful train 
experiment connecting Simi Valley in eastern Ventura County with the Ventura 
County Fair in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something that we wanted to try at some point in the future," Travis 
said. "Circumstances now are such that they make it more of a necessity than a 
trial." 
</P>
<P>
 To make the special service possible, the commission and Metrolink officials 
would need the permission of Southern Pacific Transportation Co. -- which 
controls the railroad tracks west of Moorpark -- and would need to line up 
extra staff and trains. 
</P>
<P>
 Travis said the commission was looking to run at least two trains from west 
Ventura County into Los Angeles and back each day. She said officials would 
know within a few days whether they will be able to add the service. 
</P>
<P>
 With many arterial roads crippled by the quake, local officials urged 
commuters to use public transportation such as Metrolink. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a great opportunity for everyone to take Metrolink because the 
traffic is going to be enormous," Moorpark Councilman Scott Montgomery said. 
"Metrolink is a tremendous alternative." 
</P>
<P>
 Travis said riders interested in the availability of Metrolink trains and 
their time schedules should call (800) 371-LINK or the county Transportation 
Commission's hot line, (800) 438-1112, after 7:30 a.m.

INMAN OPTS OUT; THE COLORFUL FORMER ADMIRAL WITHDRAWS WITH AN INTENSE FLAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bobby Ray Inman's startling announcement that he has withdrawn as President 
Clinton's nominee for secretary of defense presents the sad story of a highly 
qualified person who has decided to pass up one of the most important 
government posts rather than face the close scrutiny that, for better or worse, 
those who would hold high office must now expect. 
</P>
<P>
 For what prompted the retired admiral to step aside was not, evidently, any 
policy difference with the President -- "there is no daylight between the two 
of us at all" -- nor any concern that his nomination would receive less than 
overwhelming Senate approval. It was instead, he indicated, his feeling that 
after 30 years of highly praised public service, most of it in uniform, he did 
not feel that he had to defend anew his character, conduct or skills before 
those who might question them. 
</P>
<P>
 Inman identified two potential critics, Senate Republican leader Bob Dole and 
William Safire, a columnist for the New York Times. Offering no supporting 
evidence, Inman charged the two had struck a deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Inman alleged that Safire, who has had run-ins with Inman, would keep giving 
the President a hard time over the unanswered questions concerning the 
Clintons' Whitewater investment if Dole would ensure that Inman was subjected 
to rigorous questioning during his confirmation hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankly -- and we say this believing that Inman was an excellent choice for 
defense secretary -- we find this notion far-fetched. Certainly Safire needs no 
quid pro quo from Dole if he believes the full Whitewater story has yet to be 
told. And certainly Dole, as toughly partisan as anyone in Congress, doesn't 
have to be in cahoots with a columnist to keep a story that could embarrass 
Clinton in the public eye.

 Our early guess is that Bobby Ray Inman, who was never really eager to be 
secretary of defense, answered Clinton's call out of duty rather than 
overwhelming conviction, and that in the end his real feelings dictated the 
dramatic action he took. Not unique among those tapped for high office, Inman 
may have decided that the game just wasn't worth the candle.

NO ROOM FOR ON-THE-JOB TRAINING; DEFENSE: A POST-COLD WAR PENTAGON NEEDS 
SOMEONE WHO CAN TRULY MANAGE AND REFORM THE WAY IT WORKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 At least one thing that Bobby Ray Inman, President Clinton's former nominee 
for the Pentagon, said in his rather bizarre press conference Tuesday is both 
true and important: Clinton does need a secretary of defense capable of 
reforming the way the Pentagon does its business -- not strategy mind you, or 
military policy necessarily, but business-business, i.e. the buying of 
equipment, supplies and all else. 
</P>
<P>
 Inman wrongly implied that there was something new about the gap between the 
money allowed by planned budgets and the costs of the planned forces. (We have 
had gaps like that every year since 1950.) But he was quite right in stressing 
that only cost-cutting can save us from even more drastic force-cutting than we 
have already seen. And there is certainly much room for savings if the 
5,000-odd regulations that add a mountain of costly paperwork to every purchase 
can be replaced by a more businesslike system that allows buyers to buy at the 
best price. As of now, $300 or more can easily be spent on a $3 hammer, not 
because of fraud but because of the need to comply with too many laws. 
</P>
<P>
 What that means in turn is quite simply that Clinton's next secretary of 
defense must be competent enough to manage and even change his department, 
instead of merely presiding over its customary bureaucratic routines. That 
sounds like a pretty tame requirement, except that the Clinton Administration 
is well on its way to proving that the United States can survive without a 
President or a secretary of state or a national security adviser willing and 
able to think through and truly supervise foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
 True, one result is that the United States can no longer conduct 
"crisis-management" for the Bosnias, Somalias and Haitis of the world. Also 
true, nobody is supervising Clinton's mid-level appointees in the State 
Department, so that they do pretty much what they want in less-publicized areas 
that Congress does not watch closely. Thus, at least in one case (India), our 
relations are being damaged by a "diversity" appointee of rather eccentric 
views. Still, no disasters have ensued (touch wood on Korea), if only because 
in these post-Soviet days, the world is more disordered than dangerous for 
Americans, at least. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Pentagon is different. Haiti and Somalia can drop out of the news all 
the more easily for being neglected. But the hard reality of the budget gap 
will not just go away, and neither can it be dismissed as a mere 
public-relations problem, as the foreign-policy gap was described when a 
journalist was recently nominated deputy secretary of state for his "media 
skills." On the contrary, each day's delay adds to the excessive bills that are 
piling up and that must be paid out in declining budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 In practice, Clinton needs to find someone for the Pentagon who can actually 
do the job, i.e. who already knows the Pentagon universe of military forces, 
industries, strategies and Joint Commands, which are badly in need of tighter 
civilian control. To nominate a newcomer who would have to learn on the job 
would leave the Pentagon virtually unmanaged until well into the third year of 
the Clinton Administration, going by past experience. 
</P>
<P>
 The standard complaint is that after 12 years out of office, the Democrats 
have no suitable nominees with experience. That is not true at all for the 
Pentagon slot. Harold Brown, perhaps Jimmy Carter's most successful appointee, 
may again be willing to serve as secretary of defense. William Perry, the 
current, much-respected deputy, is a brilliant technologist whose competence is 
much broader that that. James Woolsey, now the CIA director, has vast 
experience in defense across the board, as well as proved executive skills. And 
if bipartisanship is wanted, there is James R. Schlesinger, both strategist and 
budget expert, who really did cut costs in that job once before (by tough 
bargaining, not by issuing yet more regulations). 
</P>
<P>
 The one thing that Clinton should avoid is another "imaginative" choice 
suggested, as Inman was, by his foreign-policy advisers. Goodness knows, there 
is plenty for them to do in their own neglected department.

TEACHER SALARIES

<P>
 * Re Michael D. Eisner, the $200-million man: 
</P>
<P>
 Are you looking for a high-paying job? Well, I've got one for you. In 1993, 
chairman Michael D. Eisner raked in $203,020,000 from the Walt Disney Co. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, in 1993, with over 20 years of service as a college business 
teacher, I earned exactly $56,658. That means Eisner made more than 3,583 
teachers, like me, in 1993. Damn, that's depressing. At least, for me and other 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, I know a lot of taxpayers who think I'm overpaid. They want to cut my 
pay and probably will. Right, Gov. Wilson. I wonder what these folks think 
about Eisner's paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact is, excessive salaries, golden parachutes, deferred compensation, 
stock options and other management perks are out of control in most companies 
in the United States. If we don't hold the line, it will further erode our 
international competitiveness and cost many workers their jobs. Our nation 
can't afford that.

DUCKS TIED UP IN STRETCH; HOCKEY: ANAHEIM SQUANDERS THREE-GOAL LEAD. TORONTO 
SCORES WITH 2:24 LEFT IN THIRD PERIOD FOR 3-3 DEADLOCK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Happiness came in measured doses for the Mighty Ducks Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 They tied the Toronto Maple Leafs, 3-3, in front of 15,728 at Maple Leaf 
Gardens. And that should have ranked as one of the season's best, most pleasing 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Ducks had a three-goal lead late in the second period and let it slip 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 They led, 3-2, with less than three minutes to play when Toronto defenseman 
Dmitri Mironov scored the game-tying goal on a shot from the blue line. 
</P>
<P>
 Goaltender Guy Hebert kept the Maple Leafs scoreless for more than 36 minutes, 
but never saw Mironov's shot. Hebert, who defeated Toronto, 1-0, on Dec. 15, 
said the Ducks should have won again. 
</P>
<P>
 So did Coach Ron Wilson, defenseman Randy Ladouceur and left wing Troy Loney. 
</P>
<P>
 Only when the Ducks considered the notion of an expansion team winning and 
tying against the Maple Leafs in their two Toronto appearances this season, did 
their spirits lift. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's quite an accomplishment to come in here and take three out of four 
points," Wilson said after the Ducks improved to 12-12-1 away from Anaheim 
Arena. They are 3-0-1 in their last four on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks also extended their unbeaten streak in Canada to seven and stopped 
Toronto's six-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm disappointed we didn't come out of here with another point," Wilson said. 
"But one point will do." 
</P>
<P>
 Ladouceur, playing for the first time in four games after bruising his thigh 
against Detroit Jan. 10, put it this way: 
</P>
<P>
 "The big picture looks pretty good. Three points in Maple Leaf Gardens is 
pretty good hockey." 
</P>
<P>
 Loney scored two second-period goals putting the Ducks ahead, 3-0, at the 
12:54 mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto seemed punchless for long stretches -- going without a shot on goal 
for more than 10 minutes to start the second period, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the Maple Leafs finally came to life, they were swift and decisive 
around the Duck net. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Ellett scored on a shot from the blue line at the 16:33 mark of the 
second period, then Dave Andreychuk scored on a backhander from the slot a 
little more than two minutes later. Doug Gilmour's assist on Andreychuk's goal 
was the 600th of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third period, Hebert kept the swarming Maple Leafs scoreless until 2:24 
remained in the game, when Mironov scored. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lost sight of it (the puck)," Hebert said later. "I thought about going 
down, but I wanted to stay on my feet in case they dumped it into the corner. 
They'd been doing that all night." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Mironov fired away with several players blocking Hebert's view, and 
the puck went between his pads and into the net. Mike Eastwood won a faceoff in 
the right circle, sending the puck back to Mironov. 
</P>
<P>
 Mironov was about as unlikely a hero for Toronto as you could get, what with 
Gilmour and Andreychuk the NHL's third- and fourth-leading scorers buzzing 
Hebert in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilmour has 15 goals and 52 assists and Andreychuk has 38 goals and 28 
assists. Mironov scored only his fifth goal, his first since Jan 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Hebert stopped 29 shots, but wasn't content with a tie, especially when the 
Ducks controlled the 
</P>
<P>
 game for so long. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we played an excellent game," he said. "We frustrated them all night 
long and I think we got under their skin. We probably should have sneaked out 
of here with another win." 
</P>
<P>
 There was no argument from any of his teammates, but they seemed pleased 
enough with the consolation prize. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll take the tie in this building," Loney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Duck Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Right wing Steven King, who played in a 4-3 loss to Vancouver on Sunday, did 
not play Tuesday. King continues to be bothered by a sprained left shoulder and 
his status is day-to-day. . . . The Ducks announced that $322,566.85 was raised 
for fire relief from the Dec. 9 exhibition against the Kings. All proceeds will 
be donated to chapters of the American Red Cross in Los Angeles and Orange 
counties.

LAKERS AGAIN DIG DEEP HOLE, 103-88; PRO BASKETBALL: THEY COME BACK IN THE 
FOURTH QUARTER BUT STILL FALL TO THE SUPERSONICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anthony Peeler was on the Laker bench in street clothes, his status day-to-day 
because of shin splints in his right leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Christie was home, continuing to rest and rehabilitate his sprained 
ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 Elden Campbell, a third starter? 
</P>
<P>
 He's there, somewhere. In the opening lineup for 29 of his 30 appearances but 
hardly a fixture, Campbell's only constant role is that of an enigma, 
reinforced Tuesday night in the Lakers' 103-88 loss to the Seattle SuperSonics 
before 14,627 at Seattle Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 He had 10 points, six rebounds, four blocks and an uncertain place in the 
rotation. He starts, but that has became a matter of semantics over the last 
six games, when Campbell has averaged only 23.3 minutes and only a few 
worthwhile moments. The 29 minutes against the SuperSonics were his most in 
that stretch, after going 21, 26, 21, 25 and 18 over the five previous outings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess he's just trying different combinations," Campbell said of Coach 
Randy Pfund. "If it's going to work, I'm all for it. If not, it's tough." 
</P>
<P>
 So what does he think so far? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still in the experimental stage. I'll give it a few more games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I need to be in a little more. Consistent minutes, consistent play, I 
think that's true. But he's experimenting with a few things." 
</P>
<P>
 Pfund does have a plan: playing those who will rebound. That is why Kurt 
Rambis got 15 minutes Tuesday and George Lynch has gone 34 and 40 in the two 
games he has started and stayed out of foul trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have reduced his (Campbell's) minutes," Pfund said. "I thought at times 
tonight he was very active one on one. I just like George's being so active. I 
want to play George a lot of minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch had three of his seven steals, the most by a Laker this season, in the 
fourth quarter, when the push toward a respectable final score arrived right on 
schedule, following the pattern of recent games in turning routs into simply 
losses. This time, the Lakers trailed by 78-56 at the end of the third quarter 
before chipping away. 
</P>
<P>
 They had Seattle's attention when it the score became 81-71, prompting a 
SuperSonic timeout with 7:26 to go. When Nick Van Exel made back-to-back 
three-pointers soon after, the score was 83-77. And the Lakers were still in 
striking distance at 90-81 with 4:10 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Or at least they were until going scoreless for the next 1:57. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the Lakers scored their next point, with 2:13 remaining, Seattle 
had a 94-83 lead, the momentum and a 17-1 home record. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never, ever thought they were a threat," Coach George Karl said of the 
comeback. "The only thing they had was Van Exel's threes." 
</P>
<P>
 Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers said Doug Christie will sit out at least another week because of 
the sprained left ankle that has already sidelined him since last Tuesday, 
which should mean a minimum of three more games without their leading scorer. 
That word came hours after the NBA announced he would compete in the slam dunk 
contest at all-star weekend in a field that will also include the former USC 
backcourt of Miami's Harold Miner and Denver's Robert Pack. Shawn Kemp of 
Seattle, James Robinson of Portland and Isaiah Rider of Minnesota also will 
take part next month in Minneapolis. Miner is the defending champion. . . . 
Antonio Harvey also sat out his third consecutive game because of a strained 
hip muscle and is expected to be sidelined at least another week. 
</P>
<P>
 The SuperSonics played without Nate McMillan, the league leader in steals, who 
has a sprained left ankle, and Ricky Pierce, who was in Texas for a funeral. 
That meant none of the main combatants from the Dec. 29 scuffle at the Forum -- 
Anthony Peeler, Christie and Pierce -- were in attendance for the rematch. . . 
. The Lakers have lost nine in a row at Seattle, their longest road skid 
against any team. . . . When Laker coaches and officials talk today, Randy 
Pfund plans to send up an SOS, maybe asking that someone be brought in on a 
10-day contract to offset the injuries to Christie, Peeler and Harvey. "With 
all these guys out, it makes sense for us to grab somebody," Pfund said. "Even 
if it's just in practice, we're down to nine players." 
</P>

HARDING TALKS TO THE FBI; FIGURE SKATING: SHE ALSO TALKS TO THE DISTRICT 
ATTORNEY, SEEKING TO CLEAR HER NAME IN THE ATTACK ON KERRIGAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tonya Harding faced questioning by the district attorney and FBI for the first 
time Tuesday as she sought to clear her name in the attack on Nancy Kerrigan 
and preserve a berth on the U.S. Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
 Voluntarily appearing with two attorneys, Harding looked somber and stared at 
the ground as she walked into the FBI office at 1 p.m. to give her version of 
the events surrounding the Jan. 6 assault at the U.S. Figure Skating 
Championships in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether Harding would take a lie detector test, an FBI spokesman said: 
"We're not going to get into that." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Gillooly, Harding's ex-husband, didn't take part in the meeting, which 
lasted several hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities, worried about jeopardizing a possible case against Gillooly, have 
not subpoenaed him or demanded that he come in for questioning. Under state 
law, a person can invoke his right of silence and, if compelled to give 
testimony in a grand jury proceeding or other investigatory proceeding, can 
receive immunity. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to take that chance of him getting immunity," assistant 
district attorney John Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
 On her way to see the FBI, Harding was asked whether Gillooly was going to be 
arrested. "No, he's not," she replied. Harding and Gillooly still live together 
even though they were divorced last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal charges against Harding are "possible at this point, but remote," FBI 
spokesman Bart Gori said before the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged "hit man" in the attack was due to arrive from Arizona later 
Tuesday to face charges of conspiracy and assault. 
</P>
<P>
 Shane Minoaka Stant, the man accused of striking Kerrigan's leg, appeared 
before a judge in Phoenix and agreed not to fight extradition to Oregon. Stant 
was to be arraigned in Portland today.  
</P>
<P>
 Stant turned himself in to the FBI in Phoenix last week after learning there 
was a warrant for his arrest in Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 In Detroit, Wayne County prosecutor John O'Hair told the Associated Press 
that, "At this point, we have no evidence here . . . at all about (Harding's) 
culpability as far as the episode is concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the Detroit investigation is nearly complete, but in Oregon it is 
still unfolding. He noted that Oregon authorities haven't interviewed Gillooly. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if Detroit authorities are investigating Gillooly, O'Hair said: 
</P>
<P>
 "They (Oregon) are the ones investigating Gillooly at this time. . . . 
Gillooly is still a question mark." 
</P>
<P>
 He said Portland authorities have far more information on Gillooly than 
Detroit authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not privy to the details" of the Portland investigation, O'Hair said. 
He will travel today to Portland with assistant prosecutor Doug Baker to meet 
with prosecutors and coordinate the case to determine where it might be put 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some very significant loose ends that have yet to be nailed down," 
O'Hair said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can have one proceeding in one jurisdiction, that would be the best 
way to proceed. . . . I think Detroit would be a proper forum. I think there 
should be one prosecution. It's yet to be determined if we can resolve this 
with one trial and one case (or whether there will be separate cases in 
Portland and Detroit)." 
</P>
<P>
 A grand jury in Portland scheduled two hours today to review the assault 
conspiracy charges against Harding's bodyguard, Shawn Eckardt. He was arraigned 
last week and released on $20,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal and local investigators are trying to determine if Harding's money, 
some of it from Olympic sources, paid for the attack on Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding, skating again early this morning and still proclaiming her innocence, 
faced the questioning by authorities amid reports that funds from the U.S. 
Figure Skating Assn. may have been used to finance the attack.

MORNING BRIEFING: AS RIVERS SEES IT, PROBLEMS IN NBA STILL RACIALLY BASED

 Doc Rivers, the former Clipper guard now on the New York Knicks' injured list, 
has some provocative remarks about racism in the NBA in his new book, "Those 
Who Love the Game." 
</P>
<P>
 On the wording of scouting reports: "If he is black, he is going to be 
'athletically gifted . . . quick . . . with great instincts . . . great 
leaper.' If he is white, it's going to read 'heady . . . determined . . . a 
take-charge guy . . . a floor general.' It happens again and again." 
</P>
<P>
 On prejudice: "I hate it, really hate it, when people make fun of what they 
see as ignorance. When they mock an athlete for what they define as being 
'dumb,' it is mostly a racial thing, though part of it represents a general 
prejudice against athletes." 
</P>
<P>
 On unorthodox personalities: "A white player is labeled a 'free spirit' or 
'fun loving.' But a black player who does the same thing is an 'attitude 
problem.' "

 Bad timing: "Isn't it a bit early for former champion Riddick Bowe to start 
complaining about not gaining the acclaim heaped upon the likes of Muhammad 
Ali, Sugar Ray Robinson, Willie Pep and Sugar Ray Leonard?" asks Phil Jackman

NBA ROUNDUP; SICK, INJURED SUNS STILL HAVE ENOUGH AGAINST MAVERICKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A.C. Green scored nine of his 19 points in a 5 1/2-minute span late in the 
game, including a three-point play with 1:38 to go that sealed the Phoenix 
Suns' 113-103 victory over the Dallas Mavericks at Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 Green made it 110-98 with his layup and free throw, sending the Mavericks to 
their 10th consecutive defeat and 33rd in 35 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Majerle scored 27 points and Oliver Miller had 19 points and 11 rebounds 
for the Suns, who improved to 3-3 in games played without injured Charles 
Barkley. 
</P>
<P>
 To add to their woes, Phoenix point guard Kevin Johnson, who had missed six of 
the last seven games because of a sprained right ankle and leg bruise, has come 
down with the chicken pox, according to the team doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson won't be able to practice until after he's examined Friday. However, 
he was expected to miss the rest of the week because of his leg injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 123, Detroit 91 -- Reserve Jon Barry scored a career-high 21 points 
as the Bucks ended a six-game losing streak at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit lost for a team-record 14th consecutive time. 
</P>
<P>
 Reserve guard Todd Day had 17 points, 13 in the fourth quarter, when the Bucks 
broke out of a month-long shooting slump. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pistons tied the club's single-season record losing streak of 14 games, 
set in 1980. Detroit's longest losing skid is 21 games -- the last 14 games of 
the 1979-80 season and the first seven of 1980-81. 
</P>
<P>
 Portland 104, Denver 103 -- Clifford Robinson's season-high 32 points and Rod 
Strickland's two free throws with 29 seconds to play in overtime lifted the 
Trail Blazers at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was the fourth in a row for the Trail Blazers. Denver suffered its 
fourth loss in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 95, Houston 83 -- Robert Parish, held scoreless by the Rockets last 
week, had 19 points and 17 rebounds at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory gave the Celtics their first two-game winning streak since Dec. 
1-3, when they defeated Washington and Portland. The defeat left the Rockets 
with their first three-game losing streak of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Hakeem Olajuwon outscored Parish, 37-0, in Houston's 94-84 victory at Boston 
last week.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; NFC; DR. JOHNSON PRONOUNCES SMITH WELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jimmy Johnson, coach of the Dallas Cowboys, leaves no doubt about Emmitt 
Smith's role in Sunday's NFC championship game against the San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Emmitt will play and he won't have shoulder problems," Johnson said Tuesday. 
"I have pronounced him healthy." 
</P>
<P>
 The NFL's leading rusher re-injured his shoulder while blocking and was held 
out of most of the second half of Sunday's 27-17 victory over the Green Bay 
Packers. Smith is receiving round-the-clock care to reduce the soreness in the 
shoulder he separated in the last game of the season against the New York 
Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys aren't the same team without him. They lost their first two games 
without Smith during a contract holdout. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said he won't hold back against the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did feel a little out of sync against the Packers," he said. "I had some 
problems holding the ball. I won't take any pain killers. I have the fear of 
hurting my shoulder and not realizing it's hurt. It's getting better every day. 
I'll be ready on Sunday." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Within 16 minutes of going on sale, the last 10,000 tickets for Sunday's game 
at Irving, Tex., were sold out. AFC

<P>
 Chiefs' Schottenheimer: Forget the Past 
</P>
<P>
 The Kansas City Chiefs are 3-0 in AFL/AFC championship games. Their coach is 
0-2. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not only that Marty Schottenheimer's Cleveland Browns lost both AFC title 
games they played under his command. It's the way they lost that causes wonder 
about him. 
</P>
<P>
 First came The Drive: Denver quarterback John Elway's famous 98-yard march in 
Cleveland Stadium led to a 23-20 overtime loss for the Browns in the 1986 title 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Second came The Fumble: Ernest Byner dropped the ball as he was about to cross 
the goal line with the winning touchdown. A few seconds later the Broncos had 
won, 38-33. 
</P>
<P>
 At least this time it won't be the Broncos and Elway. 
</P>
<P>
 It might be Kansas City and Joe Montana. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we've got to do is go in with the idea that the task is to play as well 
as we can against the Buffalo Bills and not consider past circumstances, the 
products of failure of success," Schottenheimer said. "If you get into that 
sort of thing, you're going to lose focus on the task at hand. Those things 
were a long time ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, his wife, Pat, did, ever so delicately, raise the issue once this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Marty, maybe the third time's the charm," she told her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Cleveland Browns promoted running backs coach Steve Crosby to offensive 
coordinator, giving him the title to go with the role he played during the 
second half of the 1993 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Crosby, 43, coached the Browns' running backs for one year under 
Schottenheimer in 1985 and returned to that job when Bill Belichick became 
Cleveland's coach in 1991. He assumed the position -- but not the title -- of 
offensive coordinator at midseason, about the same time Bernie Kosar was cut 
and replaced by Vinny Testaverde as the Browns' starting quarterback. Crosby 
called the Browns' plays during the last seven games of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Browns' offense improved over the final seven games, averaging 335 yards 
per game, compared with 263.7 yards per game in the first nine. But Cleveland 
lost five of those last seven games.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The No. 1 spot in college basketball suddenly is UCLA's to win -- or lose. . . 
. On a Monday night when the minds of Southern Californians were on more 
important matters, Kansas, ranked first in the Associated Press poll and tied 
with UCLA atop the USA Today/CNN poll, was upset at Phog Allen Fieldhouse by 
Kansas State. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Victories over Arizona and Arizona State Thursday and Saturday would make the 
unbeaten Bruins No. 1 in both rankings. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 But do they really need this? . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas is about to become the fourth top-ranked team this season to be 
unseated, and only one regular-season poll champion -- Duke in 1992 -- has won 
the NCAA tournament in the last 11 years. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 On balance, though, the Bruins should be excited about the possibility of 
being alone at the top for the first time since January, 1983. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It would be another boon to Jim Harrick's recruiting, which has picked up 
dramatically the last couple of years. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Ticket sales also would be given a lift. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Pauley Pavilion will be filled for only the second time this 
season. All 12,819 tickets were gone last Wednesday. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 ESPN -- with Dick Vitale and all the trimmings -- will televise the game live 
at 9 p.m. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 This is one season when the Pacific 10 Conference deserves national exposure, 
although the UCLA-Washington game didn't even get L.A. exposure Saturday. . . . 
 
</P>
<P>
 Key matchup could be between point guards, the Bruins' Tyus Edney and the 
Wildcats' Damon Stoudamire. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Women's college basketball administrators complain about a lack of attention 
given their sport -- and then schedule the important USC-Stanford game for 2 
p.m. at the Lyon Center on Jan. 30, little more than an hour before the Super 
Bowl kickoff. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It's a good thing for Joe Montana that the three-knockdown rule isn't in 
effect in the NFL. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Those hoping to see Montana face Steve Young in the Super Bowl are encouraged 
by the fact that visiting teams won the NFC and AFC championship games last 
year. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I like the way Marcus Allen scores touchdowns and the way he celebrates them 
-- simply by handing the football to the referee. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 News item: Offensive tackle Marvin Powell is voted into the college football 
Hall of Fame.Reaction: Would Powell make an all-USC first team? Former Trojan 
tackles include Ron Yary, Ron Mix and Anthony Munoz. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Muhammad Ali celebrated his 52nd birthday on Martin Luther King Day. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Congratulations to trainer Eddie Futch, who has sent many a fighter into an 
L.A. ring, upon his selection to the International Boxing Hall of Fame. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 ABC will get back into boxing March 12 with a bout between unbeaten young 
heavyweights Jeremy Williams of Long Beach and Larry Donald of Cincinnati at 
the MGM Grand. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The renovations to the Grand Olympic Auditorium were not set back by the 
earthquake and the Oscar De La Hoya-Jimmi Bredahl, James Toney-Tim Littles 
title doubleheader is still scheduled to reopen the building March 5. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Toney will have to make 168 pounds to defend his International Boxing 
Federation super-middleweight title, but looked good at 176 the other night 
when he knocked out Anthony Hembrick, the guy who missed the bus at the 1988 
Olympic Games. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 For the record: Sam Balter played basketball for the United States in the 1936 
Olympic Games, the first time the sport was included in Olympic competition. . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 It would take quite a comeback by John Williams for the Clippers not to regret 
the trade that brought him to Los Angeles from Washington for Don MacLean and 
William Bedford. . . . Shame on all those NBA scouts who downgraded MacLean, 
one of the best shooters in college basketball when he was at UCLA. Remember, 
the Detroit Pistons drafted him before trading him and Bedford to the Clippers 
for Olden Polynice and a couple of second-round picks. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Among the most underrated players in the league is Sacramento King guard Mitch 
Richmond. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Four of Chris McCarron's five Breeders' Cup trophies were among items broken 
at the jockey's home in the hills above Sherman Oaks during the earthquake. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's only sad until you see what's around you," McCarron said. "There are a 
lot of people who have suffered a lot more than we have." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Basketball lost a good friend when Fred Snowden died of a heart attack Monday. 
He hadn't coached since 1982, but never lost his enthusiasm for the sport and 
was a frequent spectator at the Sports Arena, Forum and Pauley Pavilion. He 
also will be remembered for the wonderful work he did for the Food 4 Less 
Foundation.

AUSTRALIAN OPEN; WASHINGTON SCORES UPSET OF NO. 2 STICH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 MaliVai Washington pulled off the biggest upset of the first round, defeating 
second-seeded Michael Stich, 7-6 (7-4), 6-3, 3-6, 6-2, at the Australian Open 
on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first round of the 1991 Australian Open, Washington squandered a 
two-set lead and lost to Stich. This time, the Floridian didn't let Stich off 
the hook. 
</P>
<P>
 "It actually kind of inspired me, because I wasn't going to let the 
two-set-to-love lead get away like it did back in '91," he said. "It didn't get 
me nervous or play a negative role." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington took advantage of repeated mistakes by Stich, a semifinalist in 
this tournament last year. Stich sprayed shots off the court in all directions 
and was forced into errors at the net by Washington's low returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington, ranked 26th in the world, lost his serve only in the third set. 
Although Stich is one of the best serve-and-volleyers, Washington had a better 
winning percentage at the net. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like he won the match," Stich said. "I gave it to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Stich appeared distracted at times, grumbling at line calls and fretting over 
several missed opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't even know the score at times. I cannot speak for my mental strength 
out there," Stich said. "MaliVai played a good match. He hung in there and he 
didn't make as many unforced errors as I made. I just played a very terrible 
match." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Courier defeated Marcos Ondruska of South Africa, 6-1, 6-4, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 In the women's draw, sixth-seeded Mary Joe Fernandez, a two-time Australian 
Open finalist, overcame Ines Gorrochategui of Argentina, 6-3, 2-6, 9-7. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the beginning of the second set she started firing away," said 
Fernandez, who rallied from a 4-2 deficit in the final set. "I was having 
trouble playing aggressively because she was taking it away from me." 
</P>
<P>
 Chanda Rubin, a Louisiana teen-ager who mixed up her attack, upset No. 12 
Amanda Coetzer, 6-1, 2-6, 6-3.

 Glenn Robinson had 33 points and 12 rebounds Tuesday night as the 12th-ranked 
Boilermakers rallied from a 10-point deficit to beat No. 8 Indiana, 83-76, in 
overtime at West Lafayette, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson made only nine of 22 shots from the field, but he made 13 of 15 free 
throws. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'm hitting, I'm hitting," said Robinson, who has been in a three-game 
shooting slump. "If I'm not, I'm not. As long as we're winning, it doesn't 
matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Cuonzo Martin added a season-high 23 points for the Boilermakers (15-1, 3-1 
Big Ten) and sent the game into overtime with a free throw with 20 seconds to 
play in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana (10-3, 3-1) did not score for the first four minutes of the extra 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 DePaul 78, No. 6 Massachusetts 76 -- Belefia Parks hit a tie-breaking 
three-pointer with 24 seconds left and Tom Kleinschmidt scored 22 of his 29 
points in the second half at Rosemont, Ill., as DePaul ended UMass' 10-game 
winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks' jump shot put DePaul (11-3) ahead, 76-73, and Kleinschmidt's two free 
throws 10 seconds later gave the Blue Demons a five-point lead over 
Massachusetts (13-2). 
</P>
<P>
 Florida 59, No. 7 Kentucky 57 -- Craig Brown made two free throws with 7.6 
seconds to play to lift Florida at Gainesville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Kentucky (13-3, 3-2 Southeastern Conference) led, 47-40, with under six 
minutes left, before Florida (14-2, 4-0) went on a 15-4 run to take a 55-51 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 16 Syracuse 92, St. John's 82 -- Lawrence Moten scored 31 points and 
Syracuse (11-2, 4-2 Big East) was eight for eight from the free-throw line in 
the final 63 seconds at Syracuse, N.Y., as the Orangemen sent St. John's (7-7, 
1-5) to its fifth loss in a row. OTHER GAMES 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry McCullough made a go-ahead free throw with 1:33 to play helping 
Pittsburgh (9-4, 3-3 Big East) to a 77-75 victory over Boston College (11-5, 
3-3) at Newton, Mass. . . . . . . It took overtime to do it, but for the first

defeated Nevada Las Vegas (6-5, 2-1) at Las Vegas, 95-91, Monday night.

DUCKS WASTE A THREE-GOAL LEAD, ARE TIED BY THE MAPLE LEAFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Happiness came in measured doses for the Mighty Ducks on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 They tied the Toronto Maple Leafs, 3-3, before 15,728 at Maple Leaf Gardens. 
And that should have ranked as one of the season's best, most pleasing 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Ducks had a three-goal lead late in the second period and let it slip 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 They led, 3-2, with less than three minutes to play when Toronto defenseman 
Dmitri Mironov scored on a shot from the blue line. 
</P>
<P>
 Goaltender Guy Hebert kept the Maple Leafs scoreless for more than 36 minutes, 
but never saw Mironov's shot. Hebert, who defeated Toronto, 1-0, on Dec. 15, 
said the Ducks should have won again. 
</P>
<P>
 So did Coach Ron Wilson, defenseman Randy Ladouceur and left wing Troy Loney. 
</P>
<P>
 Only when the Ducks considered the notion of an expansion team winning and 
tying against the Maple Leafs in their two Toronto appearances this season did 
their spirits lift. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's quite an accomplishment to come in here and take three out of four 
points," Wilson said after the Ducks won their fourth in a row on the road and 
improved to 12-12-1 away from Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks also extended their unbeaten streak in Canada to seven and ended 
Toronto's six-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm disappointed we didn't come out of here with another point," Wilson said. 
"But one point will do." 
</P>
<P>
 Ladouceur, playing for the first time in four games after suffering a bruised 
thigh against Detroit Jan. 10, put it this way: 
</P>
<P>
 "The big picture looks pretty good. Three points in Maple Leaf Gardens is 
pretty good hockey." 
</P>
<P>
 Loney scored two second-period goals to put the Ducks ahead, 3-0, at the 12:54 
mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto seemed punchless for long stretches -- going without a shot on goal 
for more than 10 minutes to start the second period, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the Maple Leafs finally came to life, they were swift and decisive 
around the Duck net. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Ellett scored on a shot from the blue line at 16:33 of the second period, 
then Dave Andreychuk scored on a back-hander from the slot a little more than 2 
minutes later. Doug Gilmour's assist on Andreychuk's goal was his 600th. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third period, Hebert kept the swarming Maple Leafs scoreless until 2:24 
remained in the game, when Mironov scored. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lost sight of it (the puck)," Hebert said. "I thought about going down, but 
I wanted to stay on my feet in case they dumped it into the corner. They'd been 
doing that all night." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Mironov fired away with a number of players blocking Hebert's view, 
and the puck went between his pads and into the net. 
</P>
<P>
 Mironov was an unlikely hero for Toronto, what with Gilmour and Andreychuk the 
NHL's third- and fourth-leading scorers buzzing Hebert in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilmour has 15 goals and 52 assists and Andreychuk has 38 goals and 28 
assists. Mironov scored only his fifth goal, his first since Jan 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Hebert stopped 29 shots, but wasn't content with a tie, especially when the 
Ducks controlled the game for so long. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we played an excellent game," he said. "We frustrated them all night 
long and I think we got under their skin. We probably should have sneaked out 
of here with another win." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Loney: "We'll take the tie in this building."

OUTDOOR NOTES / PETE THOMAS: IT TAKES TIME, BUT TUNA MAKE IT WORTHWHILE

 San Diego's long-range fishing season is well under way, and if those who want 
to get a first-hand look at how well it's going should show up at the docks at 
Emerson and Scott streets today between 7:30 and 8:30 a.m. There will be tons 
of tuna. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the Red Rooster III and Royal Polaris will be unloading after two weeks 
at Mexico's Revillagigedo Islands, where the bite on refrigerator-sized 
yellowfin tuna was anything but cold. 
</P>
<P>
 Fishing was so good that anglers released fish weighing less than 150 pounds 
halfway through the excursions to save room for the bigger ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank LoPreste, skipper of the Royal Polaris, said the trip got off to a slow 
start on Jan. 4 at Roca Partida, but after moving to nearby Clarion Island the 
next day, "fishing was absolutely sensational for the next five days." 
</P>
<P>
 The bite at Clarion started at 7:30 a.m. and lasted until after dark, with the 
anglers boating 94 tuna, from 75 to 130 pounds, and 43 wahoo. "That pace 
continued for next four days," LoPreste said. 
</P>
<P>
 After 11 days of fishing, they put more than 300 tuna and 200 wahoo on the 
boat. Anglers aboard the Red Rooster III had similar results. 
</P>
<P>
 Corky Yokoe of Buena Park took the biggest fish, a 280-pound yellowfin landed 
aboard the Royal Polaris after a 1 1/2-hour fight. Joyce Corrigan of Los 
Angeles, who has a women's all-tackle world record pending, a 305-pound tuna 
earlier in the season, took a 180-pounder. 
</P>
<P>
 Butch Brown caught and released 49 fish. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody got plenty of fish and released plenty," LoPreste said. "The boat 
is full." 
</P>

 Japan's countryside is as beautiful as any, but the hiking experience leaves 
something to be desired, unless hikers have no genuine desire to escape 
civilization. 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Schultheis says in a recent issue of Backpacker Magazine that 2,777-foot 
Mt. Hiei, near the ancient city of Kyoto, is not only one of the most 
picturesque, but one of the holiest of Japanese peaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The surrounding forests teem with deer, bear and monkeys, and monks still 
follow ancient traditions in their reverence of the mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 But Schultheis points out that there is nothing mythical or holy about what 
the hiker encounters at the summit. 
</P>
<P>
 "You feel like you are in the sacred heart of old, wild Japan -- until you 
walk on to the summit. There, you meet the road again and encounter a vast 
parking lot, vending machines, fast-food joints and carnival-style tourists 
traps," Schultheis writes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo resident and mountain climber Michael Jardine says the same is true 
elsewhere in Japan, citing the 12,366-foot Mt. Fujiyama as an example. 
</P>
<P>
 "Climbing Mt. Fuji is like going to a Japanese beach -- same crowds, same 
trash," Jardine told Schultheis. "At the end of each climbing season, they send 
bulldozers up the side of the mountain to clear away all the rubbish that has 
accumulated. The beaches never get cleaned. 
</P>
<P>
 "For most Japanese, climbing Fuji is a ritual. They have a saying: 'He who has 
never climbed Fujiyama is a fool; he who climbs Fujiyama twice is also a fool.' 
It's all part of the peculiar Japanese attitude toward wilderness. Where else 
could you climb a really high and difficult peak, like Mt. Aka, and find a red 
coin telephone on top?" 
</P>
<P>
 Briefly 
</P>
<P>
 SALTWATER -- Bottom fishing remains the most productive locally, because the 
calico bass bite has shut off at San Clemente and Catalina islands. But squid 
is starting to show and that could improve things considerably. The deep holes 
around the northern Channel Islands continue to produce large lingcod. The 
Pacific Dawn, with 21 anglers on its Sunday lingcod run, returned to CISCO 
Sportfishing in Oxnard with 83 fish 18-36 1/2 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabo San Lucas: Striped marlin are still abundant, but the catch has dropped. 
There are still a few blue marlin around, as proved by Jeff Paterson of 
Fairbanks, Alaska, who last Thursday landed a 700-pound blue that struck a red 
and orange lure. Most of the dorado and tuna have moved up into the gulf, 
biting primarily at the Gordo Banks. 
</P>
<P>
 Loreto: Fishing for yellowtail is good, but winds are blowing strong at times. 
Carmon Island is producing fish to 28 pounds. A few small dorado are still in 
the area, but not worth the effort. Cabrillo and pargo are steady. 
</P>
<P>
 SHOOTING -- Tom John Jr. of Acton was the overall winner of the inaugural Los 
Angeles Iron Man Shoot on Sunday in San Fernando and Newhall. Competitors 
participated, shooting sporting clays, skeet and trap. John hit 282 out of a 
possible 300 targets.

LOS ALAMITOS; WEEKEND GOES SUNNY SIDE UP FOR FATHER-SON TROTTING TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ANDERSEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The father-son training and driving team of Jack and Frank Sherren has quickly 
established itself in stakes races at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men won three of eight stakes held last week, virtually cornering the 
market on top-class trotters. On Thursday, they won the Breeders Championship 
for 3-year-old colts with Hunter Key and the 3-year-old filly division with Lil 
Eggie. On Friday, they won the 4-year-old filly division with Eggwhite. Their 
only loss in the four trotting stakes came Saturday, when Joe's Birthday 
finished third to Hays My Game, who is driven and trained by Rick Plano. 
Plano's stable won three stakes during the weekend, adding two stakes for 
pacers on Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sherrens family team is represented by two full sisters -- Lil Eggie and 
Eggwhite -- who were sired by Sacramento and are out of the mare White Nest 
Egg. Both Lil Eggie and Eggwhite are co-owned by Jack and Ann Sherren of 
Cypress and breeders Jim and Virginia Bagatelos of Dixon. 
</P>
<P>
 The two fillies have so dominated the California-bred ranks in recent years 
that the ensuing offspring -- the 2-year-old No Yoke Jack and the yearling My 
Nest Egg -- have been nominated to stakes races around the nation as well as 
California's. 
</P>
<P>
 But in California, at Los Alamitos and Sacramento, Eggwhite and Lil Eggie have 
starred. Eggwhite, a 4-year-old, wouldn't normally have any California-bred 
stakes races this year, but because no harness racing was conducted in 
California last fall, the purse money for stakes is being distributed this 
winter. Therefore, horses who were 3-year-olds in 1993 will have stakes 
opportunities this month at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 In Friday's $18,700 stakes, Eggwhite trailed Missy Dragon until the last 50 
yards and won by a nose in 2:01 3/5, best of her career. It was her first 
victory since winning a stakes for 3-year-old trotting fillies last May in 
Sacramento and increased her earnings to more than $118,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Eggwhite won 15 of her first 18 starts, but has won only three of 11 since. 
Last summer at Sacramento, she won only two of nine starts and finished second 
six times, losing frequently to Pert Aries, who was trained last summer by 
Steve Warrington and has not started at the current meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Eggwhite) didn't race badly last year, but when Steve began training that 
other filly combined with the big mile (circumference track at Sacramento), it 
helped Pert Aries a lot," Jack Sherren said. "The only time I beat him was when 
I went to the front and parked him (on the outside). Pert Aries usually went to 
the front, and my filly doesn't have that much gate speed." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sherrens are considering retiring Eggwhite after this meeting and possibly 
breeding her to a nationally known trotting sire, such as Speedy Crown. Aside 
from a few more stakes, she would have to face older colts and geldings for the 
remainder of the meeting because her large number of victories excludes her 
from any easier conditioned races. A decision has yet to be made. 
</P>
<P>
 Lil Eggie, however, has a full calender of stakes this year. Last year, at 
Sacramento, she won five of seven starts, with her only losses coming in races 
in which she went off-stride. One of those victories was by 23 lengths and 
produced a track record for 2-year-old fillies of 1:59 4/5, a time that stood 
as the nation's best for that division for part of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Lil Eggie won her sixth race and appears to be as talented as her 
older sister at this stage of her career. She beat five other 3-year-old 
fillies, trotting a mile in 2:03 1/5. Her next start might not come until Feb. 
3, when the next division of the Breeders Stakes is held. Later in the year, 
she might venture East, according to Jack Sherren. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lil Eggie could beat her older sister," he said. "I don't know how fast Lil 
Eggie is. We thought about taking her back East if there's some late-closing 
(stakes) at Lexington (Ky.). I'd like to take her back there and go for a 
record." 
</P>
<P>
 The earnings potential for a stakes-caliber harness horse in California has 
been hampered in recent years by a declining foal crop and a decline in 
nominations for races. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're fortunate in the sense that we have some nice horses, but we don't have 
the (breeding) program in California to have the earnings potential," Frank 
Sherren said. "A few years ago, with a 3-year-old, I think earnings of $150,000 
were possible. But we're California horsemen, and we'll stick it out." 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter's Key was the most pleasant surprise of the three winners for the 
Sherrens. The 3-year-old gelding won only one of eight starts at Sacramento 
last summer, often failing to stay on stride for the entire mile. His only 
victory last year came in a qualifying race for a stake. In the final, he once 
again broke stride and finished fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, he not only trotted the entire mile, but did so in a personal 
best time of 2:03 1/5. Magna Missile, the divisional leader last year, finished 
second. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always thought of him as a better colt than he indicated," Frank Sherren 
said. "He had some soreness problems. Confidence is such as big thing with 
these (trotting) horses. He'll be even better in the next month. Last year, he 
was only 50%. Now, he's 80% and in a few more races he'll be 100%." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's earthquake caused only minor damage to the grandstand, where several 
television monitors were broken. None of the horses stabled on the backstretch 
were injured, although there were some anxious moments. 
</P>
<P>
 "The horses all handled it pretty good," said trainer Jimmy Perez, who has a 
stable of 24 based at Los Alamitos. "Our horses are more temperamental than 
quarter horses or thoroughbreds. At 5 a.m., they were back to eating breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 "Knock on wood. When these happen, anything can happen. It could have been a 
disaster. The grooms were on their toes." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Plano's two stakes-winning pacers were Maxanali in the 3-year-old colts 
division and Keepyourpantson in the $22,000 4-year-old colts division, the 
richest race of the weekend. Romantic Music won the 4-year-old filly division 
and Hutt Girl was best among the 3-year-old fillies. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's card was shortened to 10 races after the harness program at the 
Meadowlands in East Rutherford, N.J., was canceled because of snow. Los 
Alamitos simulcasts three races a night from the Meadowlands. In the first five 
nights of the Los Alamitos harness meeting, the simulcasts have been canceled 
twice. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10 live races on Saturday were conducted in heavy fog. Visibility was less 
than 100 yards at times, which did not affect the safety of the races, but did 
hamper viewing. The mutuel handle suffered considerably, totaling only $596,404 
-- expected to be the lowest Saturday handle of the meeting. Friday's handle 
was $860,435, a meet high. 
</P>
<P>
 Positive Spirit, a 7-year-old horse, pulled an upset in Saturday's $9,000 
featured pace for older horses. Driven by Terry Kerr, Positive Spirit was timed 
in 1:56 for his second victory of the meeting. The Starting Gate, a 4-year-old 
horse trained by Plano, who has earned more than $378,000, finished fifth. . . 
. Thursday's program has no stakes races, but features much larger fields than 
previous programs.

FISHING REPORT: EARTHQUAKE CAUSES HOLD ON TROUT PLANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Because of road closures and other problems associated with Monday morning's 
earthquake, Department of Fish and Game trout plants scheduled this week for 
Los Angeles County reservoirs -- which come from a hatchery in Fillmore -- have 
been put on hold indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman at the Long Beach office said it has not been determined when 
the planting would resume. Trout stocked in Orange, San Bernardino and San 
Diego county waters come from a hatchery in Mojave, and stocking programs were 
not affected by the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Fishing reports were not available at some locations because of lack of 
telephone service.

 It took two overtimes, but the Troy girls' basketball team took sole 
possession of first place in the Freeway League Tuesday, defeating visiting 
Fullerton, 55-52. 
</P>
<P>
 Troy held a 48-46 lead with 10 seconds remaining in regulation, but Ashley 
Jones' eight-foot jump shot tied the score with four seconds left, sending the 
game into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebecca How's layup with one minute left gave the Warriors (12-5, 4-0 in 
league) a 55-50 lead in the second overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton (10-7, 3-1) controlled the game with its full-court defense and 
induced 30 turnovers by Troy. 
</P>
<P>
 "They really came out smoking tonight," Troy Coach Brad Sand said. "They just 
took us out of our game. I'm still trying to figure out how we won this game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew going into this game that it was going to be a tough one. Now we have 
to get back to work because they are going to get better by the next time we 
see them." 
</P>
<P>
 Nadia Hoerner had a game-high 21 points and 13 rebounds to lead Fullerton, and 
Jennie Gadd finished with 12 points and 12 rebounds for Troy. PETER BARZILAI

SUNSET LEAGUE GIRLS' BASKETBALL; YAMAMOTO'S BIG SHOT WINS IT FOR OCEAN VIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dustine Yamamoto, a slight 5-foot-4 Ocean View senior guard, is the least 
imposing player on her team. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tuesday night against fifth-ranked Fountain Valley, Yamamoto turned in the 
biggest performance of her life. 
</P>
<P>
 Her 17-foot basket with 10 seconds remaining gave the seventh-ranked Seahawks 
a 60-59 victory over the Barons (12-5, 4-2) in the battle for first place in 
the Sunset League. It helped Ocean View (16-3, 5-1) save face after blowing a 
16-point, fourth-quarter lead, falling behind with 21 seconds to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Yamamoto's heroics were really twofold. She scored 12 points in the third 
quarter as Ocean View extended its two-point lead to 46-34. But Fountain 
Valley's press forced 10 fourth-quarter turnovers and the Barons took a 59-58 
lead on a three-point play by Nicole Strange (17 points), setting the stage for 
Yamamoto. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Tuiolosega managed to break the press and whipped a pass cross court 
to Yamamoto, who considered taking a three-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I pulled back and this blue blur jumped past me," Yamamoto said, "so I 
stepped up and took it." 
</P>
<P>
 And buried it. 
</P>
<P>
 Yamamoto, averaging 9.1 points, missed her first five shots but finished by 
making seven of her last nine, including two three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 Becky Fraser and Farrah Magee scored 13 apiece, and Tuiolosega had 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Jen Ludwicki had a game-high 21 points, and she was forced into the 
corner by Alison Juroe in the final four seconds. Ludwicki's shot to win from 
18 feet dropped into the hands of Gina Ybarra, whose off-balance shot rolled 
slowly around the rim's back side -- and fell off as the buzzer sounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Seahawk Coach Ollie Martin: "Dustine's got a 4.06 grade-point average and 
she volunteers her time as an assistant coach on our frosh-soph team." 
</P>
<P>
 And Tuesday, she showed the underclassmen how it was done. 
</P>
<P>
 In other league games: 
</P>
<P>
 Marina 67, Rosary 45 -- Shandy Robbins had 15 points and 11 rebounds and Sonya 
Bryant added 12 points for sixth-ranked Marina (12-5, 5-1). Kathleen Celio 
scored 17 points for Rosary (9-4, 3-3).  
</P>
<P>
 Edison 50, Santa Ana 34 -- Kerrie O'Bric scored 13 points for Edison (11-6, 
2-4). Santa Ana held Marie Philman, the second-leading scorer in the county, to 
nine points, though she had 13 rebounds, five assists and four steals. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach 58, Westminster 46 -- Monica Geraci scored 18 points for 
visiting Huntington Beach (7-8, 3-3).

PREP SOCCER ROUNDUP; VALENCIA, BREA-OLINDA KEEP SCORELESS STREAKS GOING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN ARRITT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Entering Tuesday's game, the Valencia and Brea-Olinda girls' soccer teams 
hadn't been scored on in Orange League play and both left with their streaks 
intact, playing to a 0-0 tie at Brea-Olinda High. 
</P>
<P>
 The tie kept the Wildcats (5-6-3, 3-0-1) a half-game in front of Valencia 
(5-6-4, 2-0-2) as they pursue a second consecutive league championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Valencia entered the game with impressive credentials as well, finishing 
either first or second in the league standings since 1985 and qualifying for 
the playoffs each season since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense was a priority as the teams were limited to nine shots each. 
</P>
<P>
 Valencia fullbacks Casey West and Alicia Franklin teamed to break up several 
Wildcat scoring chances while Brea-Olinda's Tracy Tremayne and Stacey Seiler 
used their quickness to beat the Tiger forwards to the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea-Olinda's best chance to score came six minutes into the second half when 
Katie O'Brien passed the ball ahead to Desiree Hitchcock, who had slipped past 
a Tiger defender. However, Hitchcock's left-footer was aimed directly at 
Valencia goalkeeper Woodi Taylor, who made the save. 
</P>
<P>
 Valencia had a scoring opportunity with about five minutes remaining when Amy 
Ensman was awarded a free kick just outside the penalty box. 
</P>
<P>
 Ensman's shot hit a wall of Brea defenders and bounced straight back giving 
her a second attempt. This time her shot got through the defense, but sailed 
inches above the crossbar. DAN ARRITT

NEWSWIRE: BURBANK'S PERRYMAN COMMITS TO USC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three Valley-area high school athletes have made oral commitments to attend 
college on football scholarship: Burbank's Willie Perryman to USC, Montclair 
Prep's Dorrick Roy to Nebraska and Buena's Brian Williams to Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
 Perryman, a 6-foot-4, 215-pound speedster, played tight end and linebacker for 
the Bulldogs, but a knee injury limited his offensive output to 22 receptions 
for 363 yards and four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy, a 6-4, 220-pound tight end, had 27 receptions for 459 yards. "(Nebraska 
Coach (Tom Osborne) told me I had the athletic ability to play right away as a 
freshman," Roy said. "That was a big factor for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, a 6-5, 265-pound guard, was a first-team All-Ventura County 
selection by The Times. Tennis 
</P>
<P>
 MaliVai Washington pulled off the biggest upset of the first round, defeating 
second-seeded Michael Stich, 7-6 (7-4), 6-3, 3-6, 6-2, at the Australian Open. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first round of the 1991 Australian Open, Washington squandered a 
two-set lead and lost to Stich. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington took advantage of repeated mistakes by Stich, a semifinalist last 
year. Stich sprayed shots off the court in all directions and was forced into 
errors at the net by Washington's low returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington, ranked 26th in the world, lost his serve only in the third set.

 The 10th wedding-anniversary party of New York Deputy Mayor Charlie Brock and 
his wife, Myra, is a disaster. As the guests arrive at the Brocks' tasty 
Sneden's Landing home, there are no servants, Myra has vanished, and Charlie is 
upstairs, overdosed on Valium and with a bullet hole through his earlobe. 
</P>
<P>
 Neil Simon sidestepped from sitcom to farce for this one, and in the right 
hands his "Rumors" can be very funny. Farce requires different techniques than 
sitcom, and director Gregory Cohen seems to know the differences in rhythm and 
tempo in his staging at Huntington Beach Playhouse's new space in the city's 
recently expanded Library and Cultural Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The four couples invited to the party bring their own baggage of disaster with 
them, from infidelities to smashed BMWs to tobacco addiction to bad backs. To 
their dismay, they become entangled in a complicated game of deception, hiding 
the secret of Charlie's trauma from couple to couple, misunderstanding each 
other's strategies, defying logic and behaving very much like formally dressed 
Keystone Cops. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin G. Eckmann's two-story living-room set looks almost plush enough to 
belong in Sneden's Landing, except for pictures that sometimes wobble on canvas 
walls when doors are slammed. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same way, Cohen's cast feels plush enough to be the upper-crust 
swingers they're supposed to be, except for the first couple: Brock's attorney, 
Ken, and his attorney wife, Chris. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Ure goes from being fairly controlled at the beginning of Act I to a 
state just a few notches over the comic top later on, at times striking 
grotesque postures and grimaces that are unnecessary and unfunny. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cyndi Mitchell, as his wife, is out of it throughout, playing funny instead of 
trusting Simon's writing, a frenetic windup doll gone awry and getting her 
laughs as a sight-gag rather than from honest humor. Neither seem like 
attorneys worth their retainer. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the company rely on what Simon says and their own sense of the 
humor that can be mined by just acting their roles honestly. The laughs are in 
the script, and they get them with dignity and aplomb. 
</P>
<P>
 Most notable are Michael David and Melissa Dingwell, as Brock's stockbroker 
and his wife. David has the bulk of shtick throughout and never hits a wrong 
note, controlled and comfortable. It's also the control with which Dingwell 
performs, and her subtle comic style, that make her stand out. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Ross underplays Brock's clunky analyst friend Ernie with such flair 
that he can get laughs with a quick look or a reaction. Carole Hennessy 
balances Ross' restraint nicely as his wife, Cookie, who cooks like TV's Julia 
Child. Although she sometimes approaches overdoing her chronic backache, she 
never actually does. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Vetro looks the state Senate candidate he plays, and his paranoia and 
gullibility are just right. That's particularly true when he quails at his even 
more paranoid wife's emotional fireworks, in Marnelle Ross' nicely held-back 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Verhaegen is solidly authoritative as a cop come to investigate something 
that has nothing to do with the bullet hole in Charlie's earlobe, but Evelyn 
Canady is miscast as his buddy, whose peering at the bottoms of candles and 
under glasses is as out of place as Mitchell's contortions. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than the fine set, the production looks very sharp in the Playhouse's 
new home. The seats are plush and comfortable, the sight lines excellent, the 
technical equipment resplendent and capable of servicing any theatrical 
requirement. Not many community theaters have as professional a plant to frame 
their work.

THEATER REVIEWS; 'LETTERS' STILL GETS A STAMP OF APPROVAL; STEVE ALLEN AND 
JAYNE MEADOWS BRING GRACEFUL NATURALISM AND INTUITIVE TIMING TO THE LA MIRADA 
PERFORMANCE.

 "Letters are still our salvation," write the lovers. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed. Just when we feared that the post office had routed their 
correspondence to the dead letter department, Melissa Gardner and Andrew 
Makepeace Ladd III are together again. This time the mailman has delivered A.R. 
Gurney's "Love Letters" to the La Mirada Theatre for the Performing Arts, where 
the play's charms prove just as beguiling as during its record-breaking 
residency at the Canon Theatre in 1990-91. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's inaccurate to write "together again" about Steve Allen and Jayne 
Meadows. Their longstanding marriage provides the Gardner/Ladd epistolary 
relationship with graceful naturalism and intuitive timing. Allen and Meadows 
sit at an ornate wooden table and read aloud from the New Englanders' 50-year 
correspondence as if it's their own diary. Listening to this couple, you feel 
like a privileged visitor eavesdropping on intimate confessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Since "Love Letters" has no staged action, it's dependent on speech and body 
language to provide all dramatic impact. Among Allen's many gifts -- writing, 
directing, composing -- acting is the least of his talents. He tends to read 
too rapidly, obscuring the emotional depths hidden beneath Andrew's 
prim-and-proper Ivy League pose. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meadows is the purer actor, possessing a more expressive voice. Her Melissa 
sounds tough and resilient, but underneath the acerbic wit hides a 
vulnerability begging for Andrew's tender embrace. We understand through 
Meadows' pauses and silences why the privileged New England heiress succumbs to 
alcoholism and despair. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, sentiments and tears emerge, thanks to Gurney's inspired 
concept. It's to the La Mirada Theatre's credit that no stage director is 
listed. "Love Letters" requires no rehearsals, no memorizing of lines, no 
costumes and no sets. All that's required is a pair of actors who can be 
themselves. Allen and Meadows meet that challenge beautifully.

MUSIC REVIEW; CAMERATA ASPIRES TO MOZART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Mozart Camerata hadn't played much Mozart this season, and, when it 
finally did Sunday afternoon at St. Andrew's Church, it took on those twin 
peaks of perfection, the "Jupiter" Symphony and Piano Concerto No. 21, K. 467. 
</P>
<P>
 To re-create perfection: That is the problem performers face with the great 
works of Mozart. Imagine having to repaint the Mona Lisa every time you wanted 
to see it and the magnitude of the task becomes clear. And there's always 
someone around to complain that the smile's not quite right. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is to say that the concert -- led by Ami Porat, with Corey Cerovsek back 
again as both violin and piano soloist -- went fairly well, but certain things 
kept it earthbound. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canadian-born Cerovsek, now in his early 20s, opened with the Piano 
Concerto and immediately seemed hampered by elements not entirely in his 
control: the tempo, and the quality of the piano. 
</P>
<P>
 Porat, having dispensed with the maestoso half of the Allegro maestoso tempo 
marking on musicological grounds, took the first movement at what seemed a 
speedy clip for the majestic music at hand. Technically capable, Cerovsek had 
no finger trouble, but musically he could do little but run through the notes. 
</P>
<P>
 The piano proved brittle in tone and blunt in attack. Thus the second 
movement, which depends for much of its magical effect on sonority and touch, 
moved along a little too routinely. Only in the finale did all the elements 
really mesh, the soloist comfortable and dashing. 
</P>
<P>
 Switching to violin, Cerovsek offered a clean, bright and sprightly reading of 
the Violin Concerto in D, K. 218, with a gently intense and intimate account of 
the slow movement. He sounds equally assured on both violin and piano and 
possessed of a natural, if not especially boisterous, musicality. 
</P>
<P>
 To close the concert Porat led a "Jupiter" at once robust in spirit and 
faceted in expression, yet robbed of some of its effect by a ragged ensemble 
and a not too careful regard for instrumental balances (as, too, in the 
accompaniments to the concertos).  
</P>
<P>
 In short, it was a performance that reminded one of the "Jupiter's" greatness 
without actually capturing it.

 'Stupid' Caller Trick: CNN anchor Bernard Shaw fell victim to a phone hoax 
during Monday's earthquake coverage. The caller passed himself off to Shaw as a 
fire department spokesman, then gave an 800 number for quake information -- 
which turned out to be an order line for a video of raunchy radio host Howard 
Stern. Shaw later apologized to viewers and called the hoax "not funny; in fact 
it's stupid."

 * Plans Interrupted: Among the events canceled or postponed because of 
Monday's 6.6 temblor was Tuesday's "Crime in California: A Town Hall Meeting," 
a KCAL-TV Channel 9 special that was to have featured Gov. Pete Wilson, L.A. 
County Sheriff Sherman Block and LAPD Chief Willie Williams before a live 
studio audience. The event will be rescheduled for February or March, a KCAL 
spokeswoman said. . . . Effects of the quake reached all the way to New York, 
where organizers canceled a press conference today that was to have kicked off 
the "Rhythm, Country & Blues" recording project featuring duets between top 
country and rhythm & blues artists. Planned participants included Lyle Lovett 
and Gladys Knight, both of whom elected to stay in Los Angeles following the 
quake. LEGAL FILE

 Custody Battle: In a court battle imported from Italy and waged against 
celebrated American artist Jeffrey Koons, porn star Ilona "Cicciolina" Staller 
has won a Jan. 26 custody hearing in New York and the right to see their 
14-month-old son, Ludwig, in the meantime. Staller, also a former member of the 
Italian Parliament, is fighting Koons, her estranged husband, for the child, 
who has lived with Koons in New York since the artist took him from Staller's 
home in Rome on Christmas Eve. Koons, who has filed for divorce, says he took 
Ludwig because Staller broke a promise not to make any more X-rated movies and 
because he found a sex toy among Ludwig's playthings. Staller, who married 
Koons in 1991, denies the allegations. Staller was a member of the Italian 
Parliament from 1987 to 1992. PEOPLE WATCH

 Both 'Fighters' Go the Distance: It was Danny vs. Donny in a three-round 
charity boxing match to determine which former child star had grown into the 
more macho adult. The winner: Danny Bonaduce of "The Partridge Family" fame, 
who bloodied former singing teen idol Donny Osmond's nose and earned a 2-1 
decision in a charity bout held at Chicago's China Club Monday night. Although 
the amount raised had not yet been tabulated, 80% of the proceeds will go to 
the Tom and Roseanne Arnold Foundation, Bonaduce's chosen charity, while 20% 
will go to the Children's Miracle Network, chosen by Osmond. The challenge 
began at the gym where both men were working out. Osmond is currently starring 
in Chicago in the title role of the musical "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor 
Dreamcoat," while Bonaduce is a disc jockey for a Chicago radio station.

 Rewarded for Religion Coverage: ABC News and National Public Radio have 
received commendations from the Nashville-based Freedom Forum First Amendment 
Center at Vanderbilt University for making the coverage of religious news a 
priority. The non-partisan center cited ABC's recent hiring of its first 
full-time religion reporter, Peggy Wehmeyer, and plans by National Public Radio 
to create a religion-programming production unit. The center's chairman, John 
Seigenthaler, lauded the station for acting on the center's widely circulated 
September report, which recommended "that the American media get serious about 
covering religious news and the impact religion has on the life of Americans." 
Said Seigenthaler: "We are delighted that ABC and NPR have stepped up to the 
plate and hit what we perceive to be home runs. Our hope is that other 
television networks, radio networks and more newspapers will realize what a 
poor job is being done in covering this important area of American life."

 Country Song Nods: Songs by Alan Jackson and Vince Gill led the nominations 
for country song of the year Monday, with readers of Nashville's Music City 
News selecting Jackson's "Chattahoochee," "She Got the Rhythm and I Got the 
Blues" and "Tonight I Climbed the Wall," and Gill's "Don't Let Our Love Start 
Slippin' Away," "One More Last Chance" and "The Heart Won't Lie" (a duet with 
Reba McEntire) as six of the year's top 10 country songs. Other nominees were 
George Strait's "I Cross My Heart" and "When Did You Stop Loving Me," Tanya 
Tucker's "Two Sparrows in a Hurricane" and Lorrie Morgan's "What Part of No." 
The top vote-getter will be announced March 9 during the 11th annual "Music 
City News Country Songwriters Awards," which airs that night on cable's 
Nashville Network. SHAUNA SNOW

 MORE SUFFERING? The number of children being abused in Orange County appears 
to be higher than ever. The Child Abuse Social Registry shows the county took 
reports -- meaning a complaint had enough merit for a follow-up -- involving 
36,721 children in 1993, up more than 700 from the previous year. . . . 
"Unfortunately, no matter what we do, the numbers keep going up," says Bob 
Theemling, deputy director of children's services for the county. "Sometimes 
it's a one-time thing, sometimes it's chronic." But he urges anyone suspecting 
abuse to call the county hotline: (714) 938-8505. Hurting Children Physical 
mistreatment was the most common form of child-abuse complaint in Orange County 
in 1993. Physical: 39% Neglect: 29% Sexual: 25% Emotional: 3% Caretaker 
absence: 4% Source: Orange County Child Abuse Registry SHAKIN' IN HER BOOTIES: 
It could be that Nikki Nelsen is making a run for baby of the year. After her 
remarkable birth during Monday's quake, her mother, Monica Scheerer, spent much 
of Tuesday fielding calls from news organizations like CBS and NBC and 
receiving visitors from strangers. They wanted to know more about how the 
six-pound, six-ounce "quake baby" was born at Anaheim General Hospital under 
the illumination of spare flashlights. Says Scheerer, 28: "It's amazing. She's 
famous."

 PIANO ROLL: Monday's quake turned South Coast Repertory's Mainstage into a 
billiard table. The Costa Mesa theater sustained no damage, but the 
100-year-old grand piano used in "Hedda Gabler" did. The 550-pound antique 
crashed into a sofa, then rolled off the stage. SCR's technical crew made 
cosmetic repairs in time for Tuesday night's show. . . . "The piano has works 
in it, which are messed up," SCR spokesman Cristofer Gross says. Luckily, the 
piano isn't really played on stage: SCR uses taped music.

Hurricane Jackie -- damage your starting rotation and destroy your relief 
pitching, you will be compensated in full. Bavasi, the Angels' replacement 
general manager for Whitey Herzog, has inherited no such policy, only an 
Autry-endorsed fiscal policy that allows him to spend whatever it takes to 
upgrade the ballclub, provided it comes out of his own pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 Bavasi claims not to mind. "There are only 28 of these jobs," he says, "and 
I've got one of them." He considers this a good thing, but then Bavasi has been 
on the job only a week -- his first week as a general manager anywhere, at any 
level -- and he's young, 36, which is young enough to be Herzog's son, let 
alone his successor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels' rash of hirings and promotions last week introduced a new hue in 
the team's color scheme. Red, navy, silver . . . and now, green. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, the Angels force-fed a slew of rookies onto the 25-man roster. 
This season, they're force-feeding rookies into the front office. 
</P>
<P>
 The new lineup: 
</P>
<P>
 General manager -- Bavasi, 36. Last week, he was Herzog's assistant. Five 
months before that he was the Angels' minor league director. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant general manager -- Tim Mead, 35. Last week, he was typing up press 
releases, same as he had done during his 13 years in the Angels' publicity 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 Minor league director -- Ken Forsch, 47. Never a minor league director 
anywhere else. Five months ago, he was selling real estate. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant minor league director -- Jeff Parker, 23. Broke in with the Angels 
as a bat boy for Gene Mauch. Later served as an assistant equipment manager and 
an administrative aide to Bavasi. Will be younger than many of the players 
he'll be directing. 
</P>
<P>
 Unofficially, this is the youngest front-office staff in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I bet it is," Bavasi says. "I don't know for certain; San Diego's got to be 
pretty young. But look at Ken Forsch. He isn't old by any means, but I guess I 
could call him the old man of the group." 
</P>
<P>
 Bavasi laughs at the thought. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's perfect. I think I will call him that." 
</P>
<P>
 This time last year, the Angels' everyday decisions were made by Herzog, now 
62, and Dan O'Brien, who turns 65 in March. Now, the big desk belongs to 
Bavasi, who turns the conversation during an interview from baseball to the 
rock bands he's currently listening to -- Counting Crows and Crash Test 
Dummies. 
</P>
<P>
 This is one change from the Herzog/O'Brien regime. 
</P>
<P>
 Herzog and O'Brien never listened to Crash Test Dummies, although they did 
trade for a few. 
</P>
<P>
 This bodes well for the musical entertainment between innings at Anaheim 
Stadium, but what about the ballclub? Bavasi already suspects what the other 
teams are thinking -- that the Angels' staff is callow and inexperienced and 
(as they rub their hands together) possibly ripe for exploiting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't blame them," Bavasi says. "I would expect them to. No sense 
worrying about it, I can't change it. I'm more concerned with just being on top 
of things ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 On the wall of Mead's new office, the one that used to belong to Herzog, is a 
purchase Mead made over the weekend, a framed photo of a crew team rowing in 
tandem. Underneath is an inscription that reads: "Teamwork Is The Ability To 
Work Together Toward A Common Vision . . . It Is The Fuel That Allows Common 
People To Attain Uncommon Results." 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought that was appropriate," Mead says. "We're all common people here." 
</P>
<P>
 "If we have any advantage," Bavasi points out, "maybe it's that we probably 
feel a great need to rely on each other. I have a sense right now that if one 
of us lets down a bit, we've shafted everybody. We're going to need to support 
each other to do good work." 
</P>
<P>
 Bavasi knows he "can't operate like Whitey did. I can't operate like a lot of 
baseball general managers. I can't make a move just on my feelings, I can't go 
into a triple-A club and look at a player and say, 'That's the guy.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got to rely on (scouting director) Bob Fontaine and (minor league 
hitting instructor) Joe Maddon and all of our people to make all of our 
decisions as correct as they can be. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a perfect science, and we just need to be as accurate as we can, 
because the financial climate restricts the margin of error quite a bit." 
</P>
<P>
 Take, for instance, the Gregg Olson negotiations, which have been dumped into 
Bavasi's lap. 
</P>
<P>
 "A difficult one," Bavasi says. "He has a lot of suitors because he's a player 
that's seldom out there. A closer is seldom out on the free-agent market, and 
he's attractive because you don't have to give up a draft pick and you don't 
have to trade any players. 
</P>
<P>
 "But then again, the last thing he's done as a professional is sit down for 
two months (with an elbow injury). So, you have to be careful." 
</P>
<P>
 So Bavasi makes a lot of phone calls, to scouts, to doctors and occasionally, 
to Dad, also known as Buzzie, who knows the turf. Buzzie was the Angels' 
general manager from 1978 through 1984. Buzzie presided during Gene Autry's 
spend-free days, when free agents were delivered to Anaheim not by taxi but by 
Brinks truck. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels won two division titles under Buzzie, but he will be forever 
remembered as the man who let Nolan Ryan get away. Bill could make major points 
with Angel fans now by saying he tried to talk Buzzie out of it, but, alas, his 
recollection of their discussions in late 1979 is a little foggy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The essence I got from it," Bill Bavasi says, "was simple -- it was just a 
hell of a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
 A generation later, the essence of running the Angels has hardly changed a 
bit.

'BIG DOG' CAN HUNT; MCCARTHY PREYS ON THE BIG WEST IN A SMALL TOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About half an hour before a recent tipoff, Neil McCarthy wheeled his car into 
the parking lot at the Pan American Center, adjusted his coat and tie and ran a 
hand through his silver hair. 
</P>
<P>
 The New Mexico State basketball coach slipped past spectators into the 
13,000-seat arena, where his team was warming up on the court below, and broke 
into one of the few grins he displayed all evening while shaking hands with 
boosters. 
</P>
<P>
 In this university town 50 miles north of El Paso, the chain-smoking, private 
McCarthy is truly "the Big Dog," as he once described himself. 
</P>
<P>
 He rode into the Mesilla Valley nine years ago, having won 200 games and six 
conference titles in 10 seasons at Weber State, and promised to win more. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Army boxing champion from Vallejo, Calif., has done just that. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aggies went from 7-20 to 18-12 in 1985-86, his first season. Three seasons 
later, they were 21-11 and haven't won fewer than 23 games in a season since. 
New Mexico State has appeared in the last four NCAA tournaments and McCarthy, 
who has won more games than any coach in school history, has an outside shot at 
his 400th victory this season. 
</P>
<P>
 With their best junior college recruiting class, the Aggies are 12-1 overall 
and 4-0 in the Big West and scored one of their biggest victories Monday night. 
For the first time in 11 years of playing Nevada Las Vegas, New Mexico State 
beat the Runnin' Rebels at Las Vegas, 95-91, in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 McCarthy is rewarded handsomely. His contract, enhanced by boosters, a shoe 
deal and radio and television shows, is valued at more than $250,000 a year. 
His picture is on the cover of the Aggie media guide, his name on the lips of 
seemingly every shop owner in town. The Aggies have their own weekly basketball 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, outside this town of 80,000, the introspective, sometimes ornery coach 
remains a relative unknown, seen nationwide only on a handful of late-night 
games on cable television. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's put this town on the map," said George Zinno, a local produce wholesaler 
and basketball booster. "I just don't think enough people know him. He's kind 
of a loner." 
</P>
<P>
 A night owl, McCarthy lives quietly in a condo on a golf course in the 
foothills overlooking the Rio Grande River, plotting strategies and watching 
old game videos. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be mid-July and he'll call at 10 p.m. and want to talk about Santa 
Barbara or Irvine," assistant Coach Gar Foreman said.  
</P>
<P>
 McCarthy has guarded his private life since his first wife died of a ruptured 
brain aneurysm in 1975. He was an assistant at Weber State then and had three 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was depressed for a good year and a half after she died," McCar thy said. 
</P>
<P>
 His second wife, Vivian, learned that she had breast cancer 18 months ago. She 
had a double mastectomy. McCarthy has taken her illness hard, becoming 
reclusive, friends say. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel very positive she will get through this fight with cancer," McCarthy 
said. "But the only time I don't think about it is when I'm on the basketball 
court." 
</P>
<P>
 Because he is private, McCarthy has been accused of being cold-hearted and 
eccentric, cantankerous and egotistical, more concerned with winning than 
getting players to graduate. He is rarely seen on campus, unless there are 
practices or games. 
</P>
<P>
 McCarthy scoffs at those labels. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm cordial, " he said. "But I'm not your best friend the first month I meet 
you." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Aggies' graduation rate, which has been a source of controversy 
from time to time in New Mexico newspapers, McCarthy points out that three 
players from last year's 26-8 team have earned degrees. According to statistics 
published by the NCAA, 56% of all basketball players who began the season at 
New Mexico State in 1985-86 have degrees, second only to UC Santa Barbara among 
the 10 Big West teams. 
</P>
<P>
 McCarthy, according to university staff, allows players to return and finish 
work toward their degrees under scholarship after their eligibility has 
expired. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bottom line is winning and McCarthy has made no bones about that. In 
1990, he threatened to take another job, then talked the university into taking 
money from other athletic programs and improving the salaries of his assistant 
coaches and strengthening his recruiting budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt that (the university) made a commitment to having a winning basketball 
program and we've delivered," McCarthy said.  
</P>
<P>
 There's no doubting his success and what it means to this community. 
Attendance has doubled from the 6,500 the Aggies averaged before he arrived.  
</P>
<P>
 His success with a preponderance of junior college transfers is even more 
striking.  
</P>
<P>
 "Neil is one of the best basketball coaches in the country," San Jose State 
Coach Stan Morrison said. "He's always getting new players in and he never 
stumbles." 
</P>
<P>
 The Aggies like to run, yet McCarthy emphasizes defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of us coming from JC were all offensive stars," said guard Ron Coleman, 
a transfer from Westark Community College in Ft. Smith, Ark. "We didn't play 
much defense. But here, whatever defense you are lacking, you'll get. If you 
stay with it, you'll be improved come tournament time." 
</P>
<P>
 Morrison said McCarthy has set a trend that will continue in the Big West. 
When the season started, 44 players in the conference were junior college 
transfers, most in at least a decade. Eight of those were at New Mexico State. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would pay money to see one of his practices, the way he gets those kids to 
play together," Morrison said. "He does not get enough credit for what he 
does." 
</P>
<P>
 Television has played a role in recruiting success, drawing JC kids from urban 
centers to the Southwest. McCarthy schedules four or five national cable TV 
games a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior forward James Dockery, a transfer from Wabash Valley College in Mt. 
Carmel, Ill., liked what he saw. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw them enough times on TV to be familiar with this place," he said. "It 
was a big part of why I came here. I saw the way they played, running up and 
down the court, and I liked it." 
</P>
<P>
 The New Mexico State trip is not a one Big West coaches, particularly those in 
urban centers, like to make. The Aggies are 114-21 under McCarthy in the Pan Am 
Center. Their hope is that McCarthy will leave soon for a better job. 
</P>
<P>
 Not too likely, the Big Dog said, lighting another cigarette as he sat in a 
big swivel chair behind an even bigger desk in his campus office. McCarthy 
points out that he has turned down offers from Hawaii, Colorado and an 
interview at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 "The longer you stay here, the more you get attached to it," he said, taking a 
puff. "I prefer small towns. It would take a very, very good job for me to 
leave here."

TROJAN GAME MOVED; EARTHQUAKE: USC WILL PLAY ARIZONA STATE AT LYON CENTER 
BECAUSE OF POSSIBLE DAMAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the Sports Arena being checked for possible structural damage caused by 
Monday's earthquake, Thursday night's basketball game between USC and Arizona 
State was moved to the Lyon Center on the USC campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans' game against ninth-ranked Arizona on Saturday afternoon might 
also be moved. An announcement is expected in the next day or two. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the interest of public safety and until a full determination of the 
damages has been made, the Sports Arena will remain closed until further 
notice," said Jay Hagerman, general manager of the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who will end a six-game trip tonight in Orlando, will announce 
today whether they will move Friday's game against the Cleveland Cavaliers. 
Officials, who were awaiting a final report from two engineers who inspected 
the arena Tuesday, are believed to be considering Anaheim Arena and Pauley 
Pavilion if the Sports Arena isn't ready. 
</P>
<P>
 USC's game against Arizona State begins at 7 p.m. The 2,500-capacity Lyon 
Center is sold out. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA and the Lakers announced no changes in their schedules, Pauley Pavilion 
and the Forum having been deemed safe. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake had a devastating impact on the Cal State Northridge basketball 
team, which cut short a trip to Colorado and returned to town Tuesday morning. 
The Matadors were in Boulder early Monday and had difficulty reaching family 
and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge lost to Colorado on Monday night, 100-85, after announcing it would 
cancel tonight's game against Air Force. Officials at the academy said the game 
would go down as no contest. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the team's 17 players had friends who lived in the Northridge 
apartment complex that collapsed, killing at least 16 people. 
</P>
<P>
 "We obviously weren't focused," Coach Pete Cassidy said. "It's 
understandable." 
</P>
<P>
 Cassidy and his team planned to meet Thursday morning to begin preparing for 
Saturday's game against California at Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 But after seeing the damage, several players were uncertain if they would be 
ready to play. "We have nothing," said Ryan Martin, a junior guard. "Everything 
just got smashed, all our furnishings, belongings -- the whole building is a 
mess. I won't be thinking about basketball for a week or so." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Peter Micelli, a junior center: "I don't think the other guys are 
thinking about practice. They're thinking about where they're going to live 
next week. This definitely trivializes sports." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings continued their trip Tuesday night in Dallas, and Wayne Gretzky said 
he will not return to Los Angeles before Saturday's NHL All-Star game despite 
reports that his house in Beverly Hills was severely damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going home to no home, basically," said Gretzky, who will start for the 
Western Conference in Saturday's game at New York. "It was really bad at my 
house. All our furniture is ruined, beams fell from the ceiling and there were 
falling chunks of plaster everywhere. The TVs were all crashed, the shutters 
flew by, there were 50 or 60 cracks in the house and the chimney separated from 
the house. 
</P>
<P>
 He added, "I'm nervous to go back to L.A. now. I'm a pretty big chicken. . . . 
I'm sure all the people who live there are nervous." 
</P>
<P>
 High school sports were also affected Tuesday. Many schools in the San 
Fernando Valley and neighboring communities canceled practice and events in 
basketball, soccer and wrestling. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Unified School District, second largest in the nation, will be 
closed today for the second consecutive day. All basketball and soccer games 
are postponed. Basketball games will be made up on Feb. 7, and soccer games on 
Jan. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 "From that point on, we're dealing with schools on an individual basis," said 
Barbara Fiege, district athletic commissioner. "If school is back on again 
Thursday, those schools that can play, will. We'll have contingency plans for 
those who may have damage to their gyms or fields." 
</P>
<P>
 Dean Crowley, Southern Section commissioner, said all of the schools in his 
section will determine their own courses of action. "If the principal decides 
the school is safe and can play, they will," he said. "If not, they won't. But 
we won't have any forfeits. That wouldn't be fair." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of damage to Anaheim Stadium, the Mickey Thompson stadium off-road 
race was postponed from Saturday to Feb. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Motorcyclist Assn. Supercross race on Jan. 29 will go on as 
scheduled at Anaheim Stadium, officials said.

HARDING TALKS TO FBI; FIGURE SKATING: INTERROGATION LASTS WELL INTO THE NIGHT. 
SKATER ANNOUNCES SPLIT WITH EX-HUSBAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tonya Harding submitted to day-and-night interrogation by the FBI and local 
authorities Tuesday and announced at day's end that she was separating from her 
former husband, Jeff Gillooly, who is under investigation in the attack on 
Harding's rival for figure skating dominance, Nancy Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding skated in the pre-dawn darkness Tuesday to try and keep her form and 
then spoke with investigators deep into the night to try and clear the cloud 
over her name and keep her place on the U.S. Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
 After nine hours at the FBI office here, while questioning was continuing, one 
of her attorneys issued a statement announcing Harding was separating from her 
former spouse after a four-month reconciliation: 
</P>
<P>
 "After a lot of agony, thought and evaluation, I have decided that it would be 
best for Jeff and me to separate. The events of the last few days have been 
difficult for both of us. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am innocent, and I continue to believe that Jeff is innocent of any 
wrongdoing. I wish him nothing but the best, but I believe during this crucial 
time of preparation for the Olympics that I must concentrate attention on my 
training." 
</P>
<P>
 During the weekend, Harding's coach told reporters the skater would distance 
herself if there was any evidence he was involved in hiring thugs to disable 
Kerrigan during the U.S. National Figure Skating Championships earlier this 
month, an attack that has captured interest and generated revulsion around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 As of late Tuesday, neither Harding nor Gillooly had been charged. But three 
men, including one with connections to both the skater and her ex-husband, have 
been arrested, and at least one confessed and blamed Gillooly for masterminding 
the plot. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's marathon meeting with the FBI was the first time Harding submitted 
to questioning by authorities since the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 She appeared somber at midday as she walked into the office building where the 
Portland FBI is headquartered. She was accompanied by an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, authorities are trying to determine if Harding's money 
paid for the attempt to disable Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillooly, who has conducted a stormy seven-year romance with the skater, was 
accused of hatching the plot by Shawn E. Eckardt, a would-be bodyguard with a 
murky past. He is known to be a long-time acquaintance of Gillooly and was seen 
at Harding's side when she returned from winning the national championships in 
Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillooly has declined to meet with investigators. His attorney confirmed that 
Gillooly paid Eckardt $3,500 shortly after the attack on Kerrigan. But attorney 
Ronald H. Hoevet said the money was for protecting Harding on her return from 
Detroit and for arranging security at a future skating appearance, which 
subsequently was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney said $500 was paid in cash and another $3,000 from Harding's 
skating fund -- money that she earned in paid performances and money donated by 
supporters and fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a legitimate payment," Hoevet said. "This was the only time Gillooly 
or Harding paid Eckardt for bodyguard services." 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney said Gillooly was in no rush to answer investigators' questions 
because he is not on the Olympic team and feels no time pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities have not made him come in for questioning or subpoenaed him for 
fear of jeopardizing any future case against him. Under Oregon law, a person 
can remain silent and, if compelled to give testimony in a grand jury 
proceeding or other investigatory proceeding, can receive immunity. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to take that chance of him getting immunity," assistant 
district attorney John Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Tuesday, the suspected "hit man" in the attack was extradited to 
Oregon from Phoenix to face charges of conspiracy and assault. Shane M. Stant 
is accused of clubbing Kerrigan on the leg with a metal baton. Authorities say 
they have motel records placing him in the vicinity of the Detroit skating 
championship during the days before the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Stant was to be arraigned today. 
</P>
<P>
 Also today, a grand jury in Portland was to meet and review conspiracy charges 
against Eckardt, the mysterious bodyguard. He was arraigned last week and 
released on $20,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 A third man arrested for conspiracy was Stant's uncle, Derrick B. Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in Detroit where the attack occurred, deputy police chief Benny 
Napoleon said authorities conducting their own investigation there "have not 
received anything that would implicate Tonya Harding. At this point in time, 
she is not someone we're looking at." 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne County, Mich., prosecutor John O'Hair and an assistant were to travel to 
Portland today to try an iron out what could be a sticky jurisdictional mess 
between Detroit, site of the attack, and Portland, where the conspiracy 
apparently occurred and where the arrests have been made.

MATADORS RETURN TO TAKE STOCK

<P>
 Blurry-eyed and racked by worry, members of the Cal State Northridge men's 
basketball team came back late Tuesday morning to the place they most wanted to 
be: their quake-ravaged homes.

<P>
 Northridge canceled its game tonight against the Air Force Academy in Colorado 
Springs, Colo., and flew back to the Southland from Denver, arriving at John 
Wayne Airport in Orange County and splitting up into vans for the two-hour 
drive to campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors are scheduled to play Saturday against California in Berkeley, 
but assistant Mike Johnson said Tuesday night he doubted that Northridge would 
make the trip. "I don't think it would be fair to ask the players to go," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Pete Cassidy said any decision on Saturday's game would be made after 
consultation with players and school administrators. "It's going to take a 
couple of days to sort things out," he said. "I just can't give any definitive 
answers." 
</P>
<P>
 Cassidy asked team members to meet on campus at 11 a.m. on Thursday, but at 
least one player expects to need more time to piece his life back together. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Martin, a junior from Huntington Beach, said he does not expect to take 
part if Northridge plays Cal. 
</P>
<P>
 "From what I can see right now, there's no way. No way," said Martin, whose 
Northridge apartment was destroyed by the quake. "I can't imagine the way I am 
right now that I'll be able to (play). I just can't sleep on someone's floor 
for a week. I need to find a place to eat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be out of here, safe. That's what's most important. Basketball is 
secondary to that." 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors fell to 3-12, losing, 100-85, against Colorado. Afterward Cassidy 
told the Associated Press, "We obviously weren't focused. It's understandable. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than 24 hours later, several Northridge players were back home, helping 
where they could. 
</P>
<P>
 From his residence just around the corner from a collapsed apartment building 
where 16 people died, center Peter Micelli relayed stories of heroism by two of 
his roommates, Alfonso Flores and Darrin Jones, both Northridge 
student-trainers. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones had helped elderly and injured neighbors from their darkened homes in 
the minutes immediately after the quake. He and Flores both took first-aid kits 
from their home and took to the streets, tending to the injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Micelli said he and several teammates, some of whom are now homeless, helped 
friends -- and each other -- relocate to safer areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with Martin, guards Andre Chevalier and Brooklyn McLinn, center Shane 
O'Doherty, forward Josh Willis, swingman Shawn Stone and assistant coaches 
Johnson and James Morris all had been forced to move from their residences, 
Micelli said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were lucky here," Micelli said as he surveyed only minor damage around his 
single-story rented house. "Most (teammates) are probably going to have to stay 
here with us, at least for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the destruction in surrounding areas, Micelli said he was glad to be 
home. "With what we were seeing on TV at the hotel, my friends and family were 
the only things on my mind," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Micelli was talking to his sister by telephone Monday afternoon when a strong 
aftershock struck the Northridge area.  
</P>
<P>
 "She just started screaming, and I could hear my mom and my other sister in 
the background and they were screaming too," he said. "She said, 'It's 
happening again. It's happening again.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt so helpless. It was frustrating. You're sitting there and there's 
nothing you can do." 
</P>
<P>
 Micelli said he was ready to return his attention to basketball but added that 
he understand if some of his teammates did not share his enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not a team that can afford to stop practice and come back and win any 
games," Micelli said.  
</P>
<P>
 "But that's on my mind because I have a place to live. I don't think the other 
guys are thinking about practice. They're thinking about where they're going to 
live next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "This definitely trivializes sports. We have to deal with these things first 
before we can go on with the privileges in life."

MCDOWELL ASKING FOR $6.5 MILLION; BASEBALL: WHITE SOX TALK TRADE WITH YANKEES 
FOR CY YOUNG AWARD WINNER, WHO LEADS ARBITRATION PARADE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Chicago White Sox are secretly negotiating with the New York Yankees in an 
attempt to trade Cy Young Award winner Jack McDowell, but in the meantime, they 
may soon make him the highest-paid pitcher in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 McDowell asked the Chicago White Sox for a record $6.5 million Tuesday when 
players and teams exchanged salary arbitration numbers. If McDowell goes to 
arbitration and wins, he will receive the highest salary for a pitcher in a 
single season. Even if he loses, the $5.3 million offered by the White Sox will 
be the highest award in the history of the process. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, having to go to arbitration for a third consecutive year has McDowell 
believing his relationship with the White Sox may soon end. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that's getting old is not being appreciated," said Jim McDowell, 
Jack's brother and agent. "That would be nice, instead of having a club bicker 
over every last dollar year after year. . . . I mean, you'd think that 20-win 
seasons and a Cy Young would mean something." 
</P>
<P>
 McDowell led a record group of 16 players seeking at least $3.9 million in 
arbitration, including Atlanta outfielder Ron Gant, who requested $6 million. 
Of the 80 players who traded figures, 59 are seeking at least $1 million. Only 
two players were offered cuts by their teams -- Cincinnati relief pitcher Rob 
Dibble and Montreal infielder Randy Milligan. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodger pitchers Kevin Gross and Ramon Martinez asked for $3 million and $2.9 
million, respectively. The Dodgers offered Martinez $2.475 million, the most 
they have offered in arbitration, and Gross $2.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "My hope is to resolve the two cases and not go to arbitration," said Dodger 
General Manager Fred Claire, who spent several hours in negotiations Tuesday 
with Mike Piazza, the National League's rookie of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most arbitration cases are resolved without a hearing, there are 
several that may be difficult this year. Juan Gonzalez, who led the American 
League with 46 home runs, was offered $3 million by Texas, $1.9 million less 
than he asked. Philadelphia pitcher Curt Schilling, the most valuable player in 
the National League playoffs, asked for $3.2 million and was offered $2 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels had no players who exchanged arbitration figures.

AT LAST, BIG TEAMS AGREE TO SHARE REVENUE; BASEBALL: OWNERS VOTE UNANIMOUSLY 
FOR SYSTEM AND PREPARE TO SEND SALARY-CAP PLAN TO PLAYERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After a long and divisive process, baseball's owners agreed unanimously to a 
revenue-sharing formula Tuesday, but it is only the end of the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement will be implemented only if the players' union accepts a salary 
cap in negotiations that have been delayed while owners haggled over revenue 
sharing for almost a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Will the union accept a cap? The possibility seems remote. Even Richard 
Ravitch, exasperated at times over his inability to get the owners to agree to 
a revenue-sharing formula in his role as president of their Player Relations 
Committee, said his toughest task is ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "It won't be easy, but we can finally move on to the main event," he said 
after a 12-hour meeting that was interrupted by frequent caucuses of the big-, 
middle- and small-revenue clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 They will meet again today to vote, perhaps, on restructuring the 
commissioner's office and, perhaps, elect someone to fill it. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey Schiller, executive director of the U.S. Olympic Committee; and Arnold 
Weber, president of Northwestern, are believed to be the finalists, but owners 
are lobbying Bud Selig to remain in his interim role indefinitely. He probably 
will stay through the labor negotiations, at least. Selig insisted that the 
revenue-sharing agreement was historic. "Twelve months ago the clubs wouldn't 
even trade financial reports," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The St. Louis Cardinals presented the plan approved Tuesday. Details were not 
offered, but it is believed to call for a big-market pool of about $55 million 
for the most needy of their brethren. 
</P>
<P>
 The list of clubs paying and receiving could change annually, based on their 
"economic profiles," Ravitch said, and they would not all pay nor receive the 
same amounts. 
</P>
<P>
 "In each year," he said, "about a third (of the clubs) would be paying and a 
third receiving." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers were one of eight big-market clubs won over by the plan. If 
implemented today, the Angels, Pittsburgh Pirates, Minnesota Twins, Montreal 
Expos, Milwaukee Brewers, San Diego Padres and Seattle Mariners would be among 
receiving clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel executive Jackie Autry said the plan, coupled to the "right (stadium) 
lease would enable them to ameliorate their problems. 
</P>
<P>
 She also responded to remarks here by Yankee owner George Steinbrenner that he 
was mystified that the Angels were a small-market team ("my geography teacher 
must not have taught me very well") by saying the Angels have the 
seventh-smallest revenue in baseball and the second-worst lease. 
</P>
<P>
 "George believes we're an L.A. team, but we've never drawn from the L.A. basin 
and there are no major TV or radio stations in Orange County," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ravitch said the unanimous vote was critical in that it reflects the owners' 
determination to enhance the competitive balance and gain cost controls through 
a salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 The cap, Ravitch said, is being formulated. He also said that with the bloom 
off the TV rose, with 10% of the players now making 50% of the compensation and 
with many veterans being squeezed out, he is hopeful the union will also see 
the need for a new system. 
</P>
<P>
 Executive director Don Fehr, reached at his New York home, wasn't optimistic. 
"We've never cared how the owners distributed their money as long as it didn't 
adversely affect the free market, but now they want the union's help in 
restricting the market," he said. "I mean, that's what a salary cap is."

USC, CLIPPERS CHANGE VENUES; SCHEDULE: SPORTS ARENA BEING CHECKED FOR QUAKE 
DAMAGE; MANY HIGH SCHOOL EVENTS POSTPONED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With the Sports Arena being checked for possible structural damage caused by 
Monday's earthquake, Thursday night's basketball game between USC and Arizona 
State was moved to the Lyon Center on the USC campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans' game against ninth-ranked Arizona on Saturday afternoon also 
might be moved.  
</P>
<P>
 "In the interest of public safety and until a full determination of the 
damages has been made, the Sports Arena will remain closed until further 
notice," said Jay Hagerman, general manager of the Sports Arena.  
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who will end a six-game trip tonight in Orlando, will announce 
today whether they will move Friday's game against the Cleveland Cavaliers. 
Officials, who were awaiting a final report from engineers who inspected the 
arena Tuesday, declined to speculate on where the game might be moved. 
</P>
<P>
 USC's game against Arizona State will begin at 7. The 2,500-capacity Lyon 
Center is sold out. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA and the Lakers announced no changes in their schedules, Pauley Pavilion 
and the Forum having been deemed safe. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake had a devastating impact on the Cal State Northridge basketball 
team, which cut short a trip to Colorado and returned to town Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge lost to Colorado on Monday night, 100-85, after announcing it would 
cancel tonight's game against Air Force. Officials at the academy said the game 
would go down as no contest. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the team's 17 players had friends who lived in the Northridge 
apartment complex that collapsed, killing at least 16 people. 
</P>
<P>
 "We obviously weren't focused," Coach Pete Cassidy said. "It's 
understandable." 
</P>
<P>
 Cassidy and his team planned to meet Thursday morning to begin preparing for 
Saturday's game against California at Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 But after seeing the damage, several players were uncertain if they would be 
ready to play. "We have nothing," said Ryan Martin, a junior guard. "Everything 
just got smashed, all our furnishings, belongings -- the whole building is a 
mess. I won't be thinking about basketball for a week or so." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Peter Micelli, a junior center: "I don't think the other guys are 
thinking about practice. They're thinking about where they're going to live 
next week. This definitely trivializes sports." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings continued their trip Tuesday night in Dallas, and Wayne Gretzky said 
he will not return to Los Angeles before Saturday's NHL All-Star game despite 
reports that his house in Beverly Hills was severely damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going home to no home, basically," said Gretzky, who will start for the 
Western Conference in Saturday's game at New York. "It was really bad at my 
house. All our furniture is ruined, beams fell from the ceiling and there were 
falling chunks of plaster everywhere. The TVs were all crashed, the shutters 
flew by, there were 50 or 60 cracks in the house and the chimney separated from 
the house. 
</P>
<P>
 He added, "I'm nervous to go back to L.A. now. I'm a pretty big chicken. . . . 
I'm sure all the people who live there are nervous." 
</P>
<P>
 High school sports also were affected Tuesday. Many schools in the San 
Fernando Valley and neighboring communities canceled practice and postponed 
games in basketball, soccer and wrestling. 
</P>
<P>
 All City Section athletics events scheduled for today were postponed as 
schools in the L.A. Unified School District remain closed. 
</P>
<P>
 City boys' and girls' basketball games scheduled for Tuesday and today were 
postponed until Feb. 7, and boys' and girls' soccer matches were moved to Jan. 
28, according to Barbara Fiege, the district athletic commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrestling matches scheduled for Thursday also will be postponed and 
rescheduled on a match-by-match basis, she said. No decision has been reached 
on games scheduled for Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiege sought information Tuesday about the status of gymnasiums and playing 
fields from all district high schools but had trouble communicating with 
schools in the Valley because of an overloaded telephone system. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sent out a fax to all schools asking them for status reports and 
suggestions, and we've been getting answers throughout the day," Fiege said 
Tuesday. "But probably the ones who are doing worse we haven't heard from yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Section basketball games set for Tuesday in the Foothill League 
involving Hart and Saugus from the William S. Hart school district and Burbank 
and Burroughs from the Burbank district were postponed until further notice. 
Later in the day, Burbank Coach Jeff Davis said all Foothill League basketball 
games this week had been postponed. 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley, Glendale and Hoover in the Glendale district were open 
Tuesday, but Glendale postponed all athletic events because many of the 
school's coaches live in areas rocked by the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's Marmonte League basketball schedule also is mixed. Westlake Coach 
Gary Grayson, who lives in Ventura and experienced almost no effects from the 
earthquake, expects his team to play host to Camarillo as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Royal and Simi Valley of the Simi Valley district postponed league 
games against Newbury Park and Thousand Oaks, respectively. Agoura Coach Kevin 
Pasky said his team's game at Channel Islands will be played. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools in the Antelope Valley escaped damage and were open Tuesday, and all 
three Golden League games involving five district schools were played Tuesday 
night as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard-Westlake basketball Coach Greg Hilliard said he expects to take his 
team to Torrance tonight for its Mission League game against Bishop Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of extensive damage to the entire campus, Alemany postponed both of 
its games this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "The gym has a permanent skylight and the baskets are on the floor," Alemany 
Coach Rob Webb said. "Right now, the goal is to get the school back running. 
Basketball has to take a back seat." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of damage to Anaheim Stadium, the Mickey Thompson stadium off-road 
race was postponed from Saturday to Feb. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Motorcyclist Assn. Supercross race Jan. 29 will go on as 
scheduled at Anaheim Stadium, officials said. 
</P>

 Times staff writers Helene Elliott, Mike Hiserman and Shav Glick contributed

FEMALE ATHLETES SAY COMPETENCE, NOT GENDER, MAKES DIFFERENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM Q. BERKSHIRE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 She has treasured the best and weathered the worst. 
</P>
<P>
 Gina Ybarra, Fountain Valley multi-sport athlete, has trained under wonderful 
female and male coaches. She has also endured the watchful eyes of unqualified 
men and women. Excellence and ineptitude in coaching, it seems, play no gender 
favorites. 
</P>
<P>
 For Ybarra and other competitors, it matters not whether they are coached by a 
man or a woman, it is the quality of the coach that determines whether an 
athlete will have a positive or negative experience. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fall, Ybarra played on the Baron volleyball team -- coached by a man, 
Mike Hinton -- that reached the Southern Section Division II finals. She is 
playing basketball for Carol Strausburg -- a woman. During her athletic career, 
she has played for five men and six women. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had good women and good men coaches and I've had bad women and bad men 
coaches," she said. "It all depends on the individual." 
</P>
<P>
 Jamie Shine, a volleyball and basketball standout at El Modena, was coached 
exclusively by men until Maureen Flannigan took over the Vanguard volleyball 
program last fall. Shine also believes the quality of a coach depends on 
personal attributes and knowledge, not the sex of the individual. 
</P>
<P>
 "They all teach what they know, and that's not a girl or a guy thing," said 
Shine, who added that she felt her competitive experience was complete having 
been coached by a woman. 
</P>
<P>
 All the female athletes interviewed said they formed closer personal 
relationships with their female coaches, but friendships had little to do with 
who influenced them most. 
</P>
<P>
 Ybarra says she prefers female coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't had anyone as good as (former Fountain Valley volleyball coach) 
Misty Sano or Carol," she said. "Women have encouraged me more. They've been 
more supportive." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Gainey Hauser, Mater Dei's first-year basketball coach, has the advantage 
of looking back on a career in which she had coaching input from women and men. 
She said male coaches influenced her more because she grew up surrounded by 
men, but she has learned from both. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my coaching, the way I relate to my kids, the way I care about them, 
that's what I learned from women," she said. "But I also take the tough 
approach, how to be real firm, and that I learned from my men coaches." 
</P>
<P>
 Coaching girls and boys is as complex an issue as being coached by a woman or 
a man. Cheryl Garcia has coached the Santiago girls' and boys' tennis teams for 
five years. She has discovered that under a woman's tutelage, boys aren't as 
tough as they make themselves out to be. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've found the guys are bigger whiners," Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia recalled attending a sports clinic where she was the only woman coach 
among dozens of men. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were talking about how they hated coaching girls because of how much the 
girls complain," she said. "I told them my guys are huge complainers. Maybe 
they act like that because they think of me as their mother. Men coaches are 
very surprised to hear that." 
</P>
<P>
 Almost as surprised as Garcia was when, several years ago, her No. 1 player on 
the boys' team had a bad match and started crying. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had never had a girl or guy cry before," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 And she sees a sensitive side that a male coach might never see. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can get just as emotional if they've broken up with a girlfriend, as a 
girl will if she's broken up with a boyfriend," she said. "I don't see a 
difference. (Boys) try to come off as if nothing affects them, but things do 
(affect them.)" 
</P>
<P>
 Patti Laird, who has coached girls' and boys' volleyball at Los Alamitos, has 
a different perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coaching girls and boys is like comparing apples and oranges," Laird said. 
"It's two different things. Boys are more business-like, they don't take things 
personally. With girls, they take it very personally. Girls take everything to 
heart. Boys have their own check-and-balance system within themselves, they 
don't get emotional. Girls will feel sorry for themselves and they bring it to 
the court so that everyone will feel sorry for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the girls, nothing's fair. The girls will say, 'I won't like you anymore 
if you make me do that.' I tell them I don't care, because this isn't a 
popularity contest." 
</P>
<P>
 But Laird has found herself answering to boys and their fathers, rattling off 
her qualifications, which she said men don't have to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "Men had a hard time with the idea of a woman coaching their sons," she said. 
"I have to give them my credentials: high school, college, USVBA." 
</P>
<P>
 Credentials and following through would eventually earn Laird the boys' 
respect. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as you do what you say you're going to do and know what you're doing, 
the boys will respect you," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia also said she has to prove herself to her boys and has had to put up 
with her share of grief from them. But overall, it has been worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hasn't always been enjoyable, but I keep doing it because they need me," 
she said. "And there are some (boys) who love the fact that I don't yell at 
them. For some, that's a real blessing." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos senior Kristin Reyes, who has played varsity volleyball, 
basketball and track for three years, sees little difference between men and 
women coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Bottom line? 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as they're good, I don't care who coaches me," Reyes said.

FAIR BALL? WOMEN COACHES SEEM TO COME UP SHORT; ATHLETICS: MORE GIRLS ARE

 Women's athletics may have come a long way, but most of the people coaching 
high school girls' sports in Orange County are men. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 20 years after Title IX put teeth into the women's sports movement, 
only 31% of the varsity head coaching positions for girls' sports in the county 
are held by women. In large-team sports such as soccer and track, the 
percentage is less than a fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 That creates a problem, says Encinitas sports psychologist Lucy Jo Palladino. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be an unusual male coach," she said, "who could successfully 
understand, who could relate to, a majority of young female athletes." 
</P>
<P>
 But not everyone agrees with Palladino's assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Brent Rushall, keynote speaker at the 1990 World Conference of Sports 
Psychology and a four-time U.S. Olympic team psychologist, is one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coaching is dependent upon education, the ability to perform the 
characteristics of successful coaching, how you positively inform kids, the 
quality of the program, getting them to improve," he said. "That's very 
androgynous." 
</P>
<P>
 Women's coaching positions have increased because of Title IX, which provided 
for gender equity in high school and college athletics. But consider the sports 
in which women coaches are most prominent in Orange County: gymnastics (50%), 
girls' tennis (43%), softball (41%) and field hockey (40%); notably, there are 
only four gymnastics programs in the county and 10 field hockey teams.  
</P>
<P>
 Even the one sport most identified with girls suffers. Volleyball has been a 
sanctioned sport for girls since 1972 -- the boys had one division competing in 
1974 but its participation numbers didn't take off until 1986-87 -- and 39% of 
the girls' head coaches are women. Perhaps more surprising, given the number of 
women who understand the sport, is that only 17% of the boys' volleyball 
coaches are female. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the number of participants nationally, the most popular girls' 
sports, in addition to volleyball and tennis, are basketball (with 23% women 
head coaches in Orange County) and cross-country (25%). The percentage of women 
coaching large-team girls' sports -- soccer (24%), swimming (28%) and track and 
field (16%) -- is well under one-third. 
</P>
<P>
 Women make up 36% of the coaches for badminton, a co-ed sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Some schools are doing a great job of maintaining gender equity among the 
coaching ranks. Mater Dei and first-year Aliso Niguel have eight head coaching 
positions filled by women. 
</P>
<P>
 University, Mater Dei and Ocean View have at least two boys' programs under 
the direction of women. 
</P>
<P>
 Which schools have the lowest numbers? Excluding small schools, which often 
have fewer teams and smaller staffs, El Dorado, Foothill, Trabuco Hills and 
Santa Ana have no female head coaches, and Capistrano Valley has one -- its 
gymnastics coach. Almost as bad is Fountain Valley, with a student enrollment 
of more than 1,900, whose only female head is girls' basketball Coach Carol 
Strausburg, who was hired 16 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But those schools have a defender in Newport Harbor girls' basketball Coach 
Shannon Jakosky, who grew up in an athletic environment as the daughter of 
Ralph Miller, the Oregon State men's basketball coach for 19 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "There aren't that many available women who know what they're doing," she 
said. "Are you looking for parity? The market pool is not there. The cream of 
the coaching crop is going immediately into the collegiate ranks, where it is 
most profitable. If I weren't doing this for fun, what enticement would I have 
to go teach in a public school and take on the problems that you take on?" 
</P>
<P>
 Before Title IX, there were 32,000 members of the Assn. of Intercollegiate 
Athletics for Women. The AIAW disbanded in 1982, but there were 94,920 women 
athletes in the NCAA in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Girls' sports have become more popular, not only at the collegiate level, but 
also in high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 According to figures from the National Federation of State High School Assns., 
the number of high school female participants in 1992-93 was 1,997,489; 10 
years earlier, there were 1,779,972. By comparison, the number of boys 
participating has remained about 3.4 million since 1988-87. 
</P>
<P>
 Greater access to facilities generated more female players, more teams and 
more coaching opportunities. Nationally, women held 90% of the coaching 
positions for girls' teams in 1972 because administrators sought anyone who 
would take on that responsibility, but by 1992, they held only 48.3%. As heads 
of programs, those numbers decreased from 90% to 16.8%. At the high school 
level, 90% of girls' team coaches were women in 1980, but that figure is now 
down to 35%, according to the Women's Sports Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 So, there are more jobs but fewer women's coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's why: 
</P>
<P>
 * Mariah Burton Nelson, who wrote "Good Sports: Women's Ways of Playing," 
contends that winning and losing aren't as important to women as being involved 
in games. Men tend to place more emphasis on hierarchy and who wins and loses. 
Women look at the competition as a means to better their own level of 
achievement as participants. 
</P>
<P>
 * Despite unprecedented opportunities in sports brought about by Title IX, 
Frances Munning wrote in the September, 1990, issue of Women's Sports and 
Fitness that women's teams became more competitive, but women coaches weren't 
interested in the new emphasis -- winning. While female participants were 
increasing because of access, female coaching and administrative numbers were 
taking a nose-dive. 
</P>
<P>
 The nature of the beast built its master. The competition of women's sports 
attracted male coaches, and now men dominate the coaching ranks. That is true 
in college, that is true in high schools, that is true in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need more female coaches in our girls' programs," said Dean Crowley, 
Southern Section commissioner. "I'm absolutely sold on that." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Gainey Hauser at Mater Dei, Joni Easterly at Katella and Mary Mulligan at 
San Clemente are girls' basketball coaches who used to play at those schools. 
Costa Mesa's Lisa McNamee, Kennedy's Karen Wolfe and Irvine's Connie Brazell 
all attended high school locally and played basketball in Orange County. Their 
ages range from 22 to 30 and they are among the first wave of females who grew 
up as athletes under Title IX. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way you're going to get more women in coaching is to give them a 
chance," said Eric Tweit, Newport Harbor's athletic director and girls' 
cross-country and track and field coach. "As an A.D., you need to have some 
representation of women on your staff. If you have all male coaches, I don't 
think you're being fair to the girls, giving them role models. . . . (But) it's 
easier to hire males -- more males apply for our jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Sally Reclusado is the girls' athletic director at El Dorado, which has no 
women head coaches. "It bothers me to a certain extent," she said. "It's 
important to have a female role model. Males seem to have a certain way of 
reacting in the heat of competition -- language being one of them. I just think 
a female manner in competition is important." 
</P>
<P>
 So why doesn't she hire a female coach? 
</P>
<P>
 "About 20% of the applicants for our positions are women," Reclusado said, 
"but it seems the best people for the jobs of those who apply are males." 
</P>
<P>
 McNamee made this observation about girls' basketball: "It's interesting how 
not a lot of women coach, but for the most part, all their teams are 
successful." 
</P>
<P>
 Four of the 16 female coaches in the county have teams in this week's top 10, 
and two others were considered. There are 14 girls' soccer programs with women 
coaches, and four have programs among the 15 named in this week's poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Strausburg, whose career record starting the week was 280-151 (.649) and 
who has taught at Fountain Valley since 1966: "More girls want to get into 
coaching and get into education, but the problem in our area is that there are 
no teaching and coaching jobs, or there may be a coaching job but you can't 
survive on the stipend. When that opens up, I think you'll see more women in 
coaching." 
</P>
<P>
 An informal poll of some Orange County athletic directors showed they would 
like to hire women to coach girls' teams, but their prevailing theory is that 
the best person be hired, regardless of gender. Most of the 11 female 
basketball, soccer and softball coaches interviewed for this story agreed, but 
advised that there are key differences between boy and girl athletes: 
</P>
<P>
 * Girls' mood swings are greater, they're more emotional and tend to be more 
sensitive to criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 * They tend to talk behind a teammate's back, whereas boys are more outright 
and honest. 
</P>
<P>
 * They bounce back from losses easier. 
</P>
<P>
 * They don't tend to have the same type of intense, aggressive nature as boys. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes a particular type of person to coach girls," said Hauser, who played 
for a woman coach in high school and a man at Fresno State. "Men and women are 
different and girls are much more emotional, especially as teen-agers . . . You 
can push them as hard as boys, and you can expect them to work as hard as boys, 
but you can't motivate them the way you motivate boys. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's advantageous to be a woman coaching girls, but there are real successful 
men who can do it. But they have to be able to communicate. They have to be a 
little more patient; they can't expect miracles." 
</P>
<P>
 Brazell, half-joking, was more to the point: "The advantages are that women 
are women and men don't understand us." 
</P>
<P>
 But today's female athlete is changing and is not the same as the one who grew 
up with the Girls' Athletic Assn. playdays that preceded Title IX. Today's 
female coaches, too, are more serious than the scores of mostly unknowledgeable 
girls' coaches who make up the 90% of coaches immediately after Title IX. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfe, who played basketball at Garden Grove and Cal State Northridge, said 
girls have been socialized differently, and the ones who grew up as athletes -- 
the way boys are socialized -- stand out immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 "There may be some guys who have problems coaching females because they see 
females. But I don't see a girl and I don't see a guy, I see an athlete," said 
Wolfe, whose teams are 29-14 in two years. "That's just the way I coach." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly all the coaches expressed the importance of being a positive role model 
for their athletes, helping them become more well-rounded individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Girls need to see women as authoritative figures in leadership roles," said 
Cypress assistant athletic director Kathie Maier, who actively recruits female 
applicants. "It allows them to see themselves further down the line, whether 
it's in athletics or as CEO of a top company. When we only model males in those 
roles, it sends the message that that's not an option for a young girl." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jakosky: "We're the first generation of competitive athletes who have had 
a chance to play in high school and college who are now returning to the sports 
world. We're evolving. The women over the last 10 years or so are pioneers. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the next 20 or 30 years, we're going to really start reaping the benefits. 
. . . Everything good takes time." What Sports Women Coach

 Market Overview 
</P>
<P>
 * Corporate earnings reports took the spotlight Tuesday, helping to push most 
stock indexes higher. 
</P>
<P>
 * Treasury bond yields drifted lower, while in commodity markets heating oil 
prices plummeted after a recent rally. Stocks  
</P>
<P>
 The broad market advanced, but the blue-chip Dow industrials took a rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Caught in a cross-fire of profit taking and more strength in economy-sensitive 
stocks, the Dow closed unchanged at its record of 3,870.29 set Monday. A small 
gain late in the day faded in the final minute of trading. 
</P>
<P>
 However, winners topped losers 12 to 9 on the New York Stock Exchange on heavy 
volume of 309.7 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the Nasdaq Stock Market of mostly smaller issues, the composite index 
edged up 0.84 point to 793.02, a new high that topped the prior peak of 792.31 
set Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last two hours (Nasdaq stocks) started sneaking on the upside. But it was 
not much of a rip-roaring day," said analyst Bob Padala at brokerage Donaldson, 
Lufkin & Jenrette. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth-quarter profit reports from the nation's major companies have begun to 
flow in earnest this week, and those reports helped drive much of Tuesday's 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrysler's healthy earnings report drove its shares up 3/4 to a new all-time 
high of 62 1/2. But some major bank stocks lost ground despite strong earnings 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, "people have seen what amounts to very favorable earnings reports," 
said Joseph DeMarco, managing director of equity trading at Marinvest. 
</P>
<P>
 That is important, because with stock prices at or near record highs, analysts 
say that only robust earnings can give investors the confidence to bid prices 
up further. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Tuesday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Chrysler's earnings report pulled up General Motors' shares, which jumped 1 
3/8 to 62 1/8, and Ford Motor, which added 1/4 to 68 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Other industrial issues that gained included GE, up 1 1/4 to 108 3/8; Cummins 
Engine, up 1 to 55 3/4; Illinois Tool Works, up 7/8 to 42 1/8, and industrial 
parts distributor W.W. Grainger, up 3 1/8 to 61 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among other stocks rising on earnings reports included chemical maker Morton 
International, up 5 3/4 to 105; Johnson Controls, up 2 1/2 to 58 1/2; Federal 
Home Loan Mortgage Corp., up 1 3/8 to 54 3/4, and software firm Powersoft, up 4 
to 48. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the downside, investors panned earnings reports from Honeywell, which 
fell 7/8 to 32 3/4; bank teller machine maker Diebold, which dropped 2 5/8 to 
60 5/8, and carpet maker Shaw Industries, which sank 3 to 21. 
</P>
<P>
 After the market closed Tuesday, computer chip giant Intel reported quarterly 
earnings that fell below expectations. Though the stock closed up 1 to 67 1/4, 
some analysts predicted a dive today. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bank stocks were mixed as many large banks reported earnings. Losers 
included Banc One, down 7/8 to 36 7/8, and Nationsbank, down 1/2 to 49 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 James Solloway, director of research at Argus Research Corp., attributed the 
lack of investor interest in bank shares, despite solid earnings, to the shift 
away from interest-sensitive issues in general since last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 As the economic recovery gathers steam, many investors are assuming that 
interest rates will continue to rise, squeezing bank profit margins, Solloway 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Elsewhere, Eli Lilly, which announced that it will divest its medical 
devices and diagnostics operations to focus on its core pharmaceutical 
business, surged 1 5/8 to 61 1/2. * Capital Cities/ABC leaped 12 1/8 to 637 
after an Oppenheimer analyst predicted the stock could hit $1,000 a share, 
helped by an earnings turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
 * Private-label soft drink maker Cott plunged 2 1/8 to 24 7/8 after brokerage 
Mabon Nugent cut its rating on the stock. 
</P>
<P>
 * Biotech firm Genzyme rose 3 1/4 to 34, although the company said there was 
no news to push the stock higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks ended mixed abroad, with the Mexico City's Bolsa index rising 50.29 
points to 2,556.62, bolstered by hopes the conflict in Chiapas will be resolved 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, the Nikkei average closed at 18,514.55, down 210.82 points, while 
London's FTSE-100 index rose 29.2 points to 3,437.0. Germany's DAX average 
ended at 2,113.84, down 23.54 points. 
</P>
<P>
 In Toronto, the TSE-300 index surged to a new high, up 17.66 points to 
4,561.90. Other Markets  
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury's main 30-year bond yield eased to 6.26% from 6.29% as the bond 
market continued to mark time. 
</P>
<P>
 Lending strength to the Treasury market were purchases by cities and states 
seeking to stow proceeds from recent municipal bond sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, heating oil prices collapsed Tuesday, dragging down crude oil and 
gasoline futures, as a break in the cold weather gripping the eastern half of 
the country was forecast for the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 February heating oil futures lost 6% of their value, dropping 3.18 cents to 
49.49 cents a gallon on the New York Merc. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasts for a thaw also pressured hog prices at the Chicago Merc. Prices 
have risen recently because the bitter weather is hard on the animals and makes 
it difficult to transport them to market. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, gold advanced: Near-term futures added $1.50 to $393.10 an ounce on 
the New York Comex. Silver added 1.7 cents to $5.33.

 Treasury Bill Rates Fall: The Treasury Department sold $12.7 billion of new 
three-month bills at an average discount rate of 2.99%, down from 3.02% last 
week. An additional $12.6 billion in new six-month bills was sold at an average 
discount rate of 3.15%, down from 3.18% last week.The three-month bill rate was 
the lowest since they sold for 2.96% on Oct. 4. The six-month bill rate was the 
lowest since they averaged 3.14% on Oct. 18. The new discount rates understate 
the actual return to investors: 3.06% for three-month bills, with a $10,000 
bill selling for $9,924.40, and 3.24% for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,840.80. The discount rate reflects the price discount received when 
government securities are purchased at less than face value.

ON THE MOVE / CAROL SMITH: EXECUTIVE TRAVEL; HOTELS GET DOWN TO BUSINESS ON THE 
ROAD

<P>
 Hyatt Hotels Corp. this week became the latest hotel chain to revamp services 
to accommodate the changing needs of business travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 The days when business trips were a perk of the job and a luxury to be enjoyed 
are gone. Today, business travelers are feeling more pressure than ever to 
produce while on the road. Hyatt's Business Plan, with 24-hour access to 
printers, copy machines and office supplies on the same floor as one's room, as 
well as a large workstation with a fax machine in the room and no telephone 
access charges, is aimed at making it easier to get work done, Hyatt 
spokeswoman Carrie Reckert said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Business Plan is available in 30 of the chain's hotels, including three in 
Los Angeles and one in Long Beach. The Hyatt in Anaheim will offer it beginning 
Feb. 15, and by March it will be available at 80 hotels. The package of 
business services costs $15 on top of the regular room charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago-based Hyatt is not the first to revise its marketing strategy toward 
business clients. Other chains have already begun tinkering with amenities and 
services to find the combination that attracts and keeps working guests. 
</P>
<P>
 Radisson Hotels International, for example, offers business-class rooms with 
computer hookups, phones without extra access charges and fax deliveries to the 
room. Some ITT Sheratons now have built-in computers, printers and fax machines 
in some rooms. And Hilton Hotels Corp. has a BusinesSavers package that 
includes free calls and faxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Hyatt's move, however, shows just how much the business travel climate has 
changed with the recession. The new plan resulted from discussions with 
hundreds of business people about their pet peeves on the road and their needs, 
Reckert said. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some findings from Hyatt's survey: 
</P>
<P>
 * Of the 500 respondents, 72% said they feel more pressured on business trips 
today than they did five years ago, and 58% said they spend more time working 
in their hotel rooms than they did five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * A free continental breakfast and a desk telephone free of access charges 
were the features most desired by working guests. A lounge work space outside 
the room and the availability of rental computers ranked last. 
</P>
<P>
 * Two-thirds of the respondents said they would inconvenience themselves if it 
meant reducing the cost of a trip to save the company money. Younger travelers 
were less willing to do so, however. Only 55% of those younger than 35 said 
they would put the company's profitability above their own convenience. 
</P>
<P>
 * Almost a third (31%) of those surveyed said productivity was most important 
on the road. Just 13% said having free time was most important. Again, the 
younger the traveler, the more likely he or she was to value free time over 
getting work done. 
</P>
<P>
 * The respondents seemed to feel they worked harder than someone else. A 
majority (83%) of employees said they worked harder than their bosses, and a 
majority (85%) of supervisors said they felt they worked harder than their 
staffs. 
</P>
<P>
 These results show a decidedly different attitude emerging among travelers, 
Reckert said. Studies conducted by Hyatt five years ago, for example, found 
that baby-boom generation travelers expected adventure and excitement from 
business trips. Now they expect to get work done. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Hokoyama, president of Los Angeles-based Leadership and Education for 
Asian Pacifics, a nonprofit public policy institute, is typical of the new 
executive. He travels extensively on business -- about 90,000 miles on 20 trips 
or more a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think with the advent of the laptop computer, it's almost like you have no 
excuses (for not getting work done) anymore," he said. "You can basically take 
every file and everything you've ever written with you anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 To save money on air fare, Hokoyama said, he makes his trips longer and less 
frequent. Longer trips also mean having to get more work done on the road.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't even think about the swimming pool anymore," he said.

 Hyatt initiated the most recent study out of a sense that hotels weren't 
keeping pace with this type of business traveler, said Jim Evans, senior vice 
president for sales and marketing. "Every time we picked up the paper we saw 
companies cutting back," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this particular recession . . . it was a white-collar recession. We had 
begun to see business travel weaken. 
</P>
<P>
 "And for the first time, we saw top management involved in travel planning," 
he said. That meant employees were required to fly certain airlines and stay in 
certain hotels. It also meant fewer trips. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of the '90s, for sure, is people in general are doing more with less," 
Evans said. "Most bosses are saying, 'We can't allow you to travel as 
frequently as in the past, and when you do travel, you've got to keep pace with 
what's going on back here.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those who travel on business have seen their peers lose their jobs to 
corporate reorganizations. They don't want to lose any productive time. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago, the amenities hotels were looking at putting in business 
travelers' rooms were magnifying mirrors, oversize towels, hair dryers and 
shoe-shine kits, Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now they're telling us, 'When I have those two hours in the room I need the 
tools of my trade at hand.' "

CLINTON'S HEALTH CALLED 'EXCELLENT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton underwent a routine physical Tuesday that found him to be in 
excellent health, although he is still bothered by allergies and has a slightly 
elevated cholesterol level. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton spent 6 1/2 hours at Bethesda Naval Hospital, where he was examined 
under the direction of White House physician Dr. Robert Ramsey. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President is in excellent health, with no indication of heart disease or 
other serious disorders," Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the few details provided: 
</P>
<P>
 * Clinton's blood pressure was 132 over 74 with a resting pulse of 57. That is 
close to the normal blood pressure rate of 120 over 80. 
</P>
<P>
 * His cholesterol level was 204, with 200 considered the upper limit of ideal. 
Two hundred to 239 is considered borderline, with patients urged to repeat the 
test within two years to see if they can bring it down. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, 47, who went to Bethesda by helicopter, wore no coat or hat despite 
the 19-degree temperature.

'BLUE FLU' STRIKES 197 OF 205 ANAHEIM OFFICERS; LABOR: ONE-DAY JOB ACTION TO 
PROTEST LACK OF A CONTRACT IS HAILED BY POLICE UNION AS A SHOW OF SOLIDARITY. 
MANAGEMENT, WITH HELP FROM SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT AND OTHER CITIES, MAINTAINS 
ROUTINE PATROLS. 
</P>

<P>
 In a strong show of unity, almost 200 police officers Tuesday participated in 
a 24-hour "blue flu" job action, forcing the city to keep the peace with 
department brass and officers from surrounding cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 100% of the officers scheduled to work Tuesday called in sick in what 
union officials called a dramatic display of the rank and file's frustration 
over their 18-month contract dispute with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our members are sending a message to City Hall that they're fed up," Anaheim 
Police Assn. President Bruce Bottolfson said. "There is absolute frustration on 
the part of our police officers." 
</P>
<P>
 In the face of the protest, Anaheim Police Chief Randall Gaston said the 
department was able to provide normal levels of service by patrolling the city 
with lieutenants, captains, civilian support staff and officers from Buena 
Park, Fullerton, Garden Grove, Orange and the Sheriff's Department. The wages 
were paid by Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, it's business as usual," Gaston said at a morning press conference 
after nearly the entire morning crew called in sick. Help from surrounding 
police departments started at 6 a.m. -- when the first shift began calling in 
sick -- and will continue until 6 a.m. today, when the protest was to end. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the city Tuesday squad cars maintained a visible presence. No major 
crimes were reported during the sickout, and the union, which had announced the 
job action last week, said officers had agreed to work if a crisis occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Several did come to work to take part in ongoing investigations, including 
narcotics detectives who helped bust an apparent methamphetamine lab at a 
motel, said Gaston. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, City Manager James D. Ruth called the officers' job action 
"unconscionable" and said it would have no impact on the labor dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's insulting and unprofessional," Ruth said of the blue-flu tactic. "And it 
puts the citizens of Anaheim in jeopardy. . . . Here are guys who are supposed 
to be upholding the law breaking it." 
</P>
<P>
 State courts have ruled that blue-flu job actions are illegal. The action also 
violates the officers' contract and department policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief refused to discuss staffing levels or disclose how many officers 
participated, but he acknowledged that the job action "apparently has 
widespread support." 
</P>
<P>
 Union officials reported that at least 197 out of about 205 officers scheduled 
to work the morning, afternoon and graveyard shifts called in sick.  
</P>
<P>
 The union did not ask probationary officers -- those who are on their first 
year on the job -- to call in sick, because it is easier to fire a probationary 
officer than a full-time officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's blue flu was the first of its kind in Anaheim and only the second in 
the county in at least 15 years. In 1988, Santa Ana officers participated in a 
sickout but came back to work within hours of the walkout when the city won a 
court injunction against the action. 
</P>
<P>
 Under department policy, Chief Gaston said officers may call in sick if they, 
or someone in their family, is ill. He said, however, that the department does 
not plan to investigate the officers' sick-leave requests Tuesday. Ruth said 
the officers will receive sick pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Anaheim officials could have sought an injunction, they opted against 
it. Ruth, however, said the city will consider going to court "should they go 
out" again. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Bottolfson said a second blue flu is likely if the city does not 
change its contract offer. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers are seeking a 15% pay raise over the next three years. The city 
is offering a raise of 6.5% over the next two years, with a third-year raise of 
3.5% to 5%, depending on the Consumer Price Index. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has offered other incentives including a one-time $750 lump sum if 
the officers accept the offer and the addition of Martin Luther King Jr.'s 
birthday as a permanent holiday. Other incentives include a vacation buyback of 
up to 40 hours per payroll year, an increase in bilingual incentive pay from 
$50 to $60 a week, and an enhanced medical plan for retirees. City officials 
say their offer represents a $5.2-million package. They estimate that the 
union's demands would cost the city $7.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Department budget is $51.5 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Bottolfson said the city's offer falls far short of what the department's 352 
officers should be getting. He noted that Anaheim ranks 18th in a study of 20 
Orange County cities in officers' salaries. The salary range for Anaheim 
officers is $2,804 to $4,040 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, he said the department is also understaffed. Currently, there are 
1.23 officers per 1,000 people. The national average, however, is nearly 2 
officers per 1,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 The union and city have been negotiating since the officers' contract expired 
in July, 1992. But recently, the negotiations have become more heated. The 
officers have not received a raise since July, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officers have demonstrated at two City Council meetings and have 
picketed outside Disneyland to protest. The union is also planning to picket 
next week's council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Bottolfson said the stalled negotiations have been extremely frustrating to 
the officers who see the city spending on other projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of trying to get new arenas, professional sports franchises and 
Disney's $3-billion expansion project, the city should be focusing on public 
safety issues, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the dispute continues, Bottolfson said the association would play an active 
role in the November City Council elections, when two council seats will be on 
the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd like to think that people still listen to police officers and will 
listen when we say this guy, this guy and this guy will get the job done for 
us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although all five council members support increasing the officer's pay and 
hiring more police, they have been unable to agree on how to raise the funds. 
At least two councilman criticized the union's action. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm disappointed," said Councilman Bob D. Simpson, a former Anaheim fire 
chief. "I have a soft spot in my heart for public safety officers, but I don't 
think this is the way to go about (getting a raise.) I think both sides lose 
when this happens." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Tom Daly expressed his dismay, saying he is "disappointed that the bond" 
between the "police and the people . . . is eroding." 
</P>
<P>
 "All of us appreciate the job the police do. . . . It's discouraging to see 
this type of tactic used," he said. "The city has had a generous offer on the 
table for many months. Considering the tough economy . . . a wage and benefit 
increase over 10% is reasonable and fair." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth said the city is committed to public safety and is seeking to hire 22 new 
officers with the help of a federal grant. He said the city is also looking 
into other ways to fund the hiring of more officers. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Ruth said, the city's present offer to the union is "very fair." He said 
union officials fail to realize that Anaheim, like most cities in California, 
is in the grips of "a fiscal crisis." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth criticized the job action, saying it further hurt the city's finances 
because the city must pay for having hired other officers to patrol the city. 
The cost was not immediately known, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers said they agonized about calling a blue flu. The union even worked 
with the department's management to minimize its impact by giving the chief 
time to work out a contingency plan. The officers also said they would report 
to work should a crisis occur in the city or if the officers were needed 
because of earthquake activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest risk for us is losing the public support," Bottolfson said. 
"We're concerned about that." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the officers said they have been more than patient with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been a cop in this town for 17 years, and I have never seen the guys 
more with the association," said Detective Ken Gregory. "We have been 2 1/2 
years without a pay raise. Do you ever see the Teamsters work three days after 
their contract expires? We have tried to negotiate. We don't have to be the No. 
1-paid department in the county, but we would like to be in the top 10, and it 
would be nice to be in the top five."

LOTTO WINNER HAS TO SPLIT THE LOOT -- WITH HIMSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 There were two winning tickets in Saturday's Super Lotto jackpot. Luckily for 
Garland Whitaker, he had them both. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitaker, 54, thought he ordered his two regular sets of numbers this week, 
but accidentally ended up with a matched pair. So he will split the $17.8 
million prize -- with himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always had hopes, but I didn't think it'd ever come true," said Whitaker, 
who has lived his entire life in Southern California and has been playing the 
same two sets of Lotto numbers twice a week at Rancho Liquors in Westminster 
for about four years. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't play, you can't win," Whitaker said Tuesday night, sounding like 
a commercial for the lottery and promising to keep playing the numbers. 
"Everybody that plays, I guess, has some kind of hope that they're going to 
win. Now I've got to help somebody else win. Or maybe I'll get lucky again." 
</P>
<P>
 Lottery spokesman Bob Taylor said this is the second time one person has 
claimed two winning tickets. Though in this case it will make no difference -- 
Whitaker was the only winner -- the two tickets seem like a double dose of 
luck. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a mistake," Taylor said. "A fortunate mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 The winning tickets were Whitaker's favorite numbers -- " his numbers," Taylor 
pointed out. Seven and 11, because he loves to shoot craps, Whitaker explained. 
His date of birth: 12-19-39. And 51, because that's how old Whitaker was when 
he began to play. Normally, there's another sequence based on his wedding 
anniversary, but not this time. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitaker, a self-employed machinist, and Nancy, his wife of 10 years, plan to 
retire, buy a bigger house, and travel around the United States. His 
20-year-old daughter, a college student, already has picked out a new Toyota 
Celica.  
</P>
<P>
 But since they discovered the winning tickets Sunday afternoon, the family 
hasn't bought anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hasn't really hit, I don't think, that I can go out and spend money or 
whatever," said Nancy Whitaker, a customer service representative at Northrop 
who planned to quit her job this morning. "I spent more before I had any." 
</P>
<P>
 The Whitakers had to wait until Tuesday to claim their prize because lottery 
offices were closed Monday for Martin Luther King Day. They stayed up all night 
Sunday, and were wide awake when the earthquake hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here we are, we just won the Lotto, and now we're having an earthquake," 
Garland Whitaker remembered thinking. "The house is going to burn down, burn up 
the tickets and we'll have been millionaires for just one night." 
</P>
<P>
 To be extra safe, they stuck the tickets in a fireproof box, though the 
Whitakers' Westminster home, like the rest of Orange County, was spared major 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The Whitakers are the latest in a string of winners who live, work or buy 
tickets in Westminster, perhaps Orange County's luckiest city. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Beeks, 37, a Westminster resident who regularly played the Lotto at a 
local 7-Eleven, won $16.8 million last Thanksgiving. The county's two biggest 
winners ever, Carlos Olvera ($25.1 million) and Ronald Smith ($20.6 million) 
both lived in Westminster. In 1992, a $14.2-million Super Lotto ticket was 
bought in the city, and in 1988 and 1989, residents won $2.7 million each. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he has noticed the trend, Taylor said the Westminster luck is "just one 
of those random things."

HARSHER TERMS ARE URGED FOR HERNANDEZES; COURTS: THE COUPLE EMBEZZLED $1 
MILLION MORE THAN THOUGHT, AND USED $80,000 FROM THE SALE OF A CAR TO TRY TO 
BUY ACTOR RICHARD GERE'S HOME EVEN AFTER THEIR ARREST, AUTHORITIES SAY IN 
PAPERS.

 Danny and Susie Hernandez embezzled $1 million more than previously thought 
from his former employer and even after the socialite couple's arrests in 
March, put $80,000 into an escrow account to buy actor Richard Gere's 
$1.5-million home, authorities allege. 
</P>
<P>
 In court papers, the U.S. attorney's office has recommended that Danny 
Hernandez spend between 12 1/2 and 15 1/2 years in federal prison, more than 
double the sentence suggested by his probation officer. Prosecutors say he has 
attempted to obstruct justice by concealing his assets. 
</P>
<P>
 The government recommends that Susie Hernandez spend between 2 1/4 and 2 3/4 
years in prison for her role in setting up bank accounts in her name to stash 
the money that her husband skimmed from the customers of PGP Industries, a 
precious metals firm. Probation officers have recommended a lesser sentence but 
the exact terms have not been revealed in court. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest flurry of paperwork by the U.S. attorney's office in Santa Ana, 
filed Friday in U.S. District Court, comes days before the Hernandezes are to 
be sentenced on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 James T. Duff, the Los Angeles attorney representing Danny Hernandez, did not 
return a call for comment. Susie Hernandez's public defender, Joan Politeo 
Freeman, said she had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple are well-known in Orange County's society circles and became 
popular for charitable donations. At one time or another, they owned five 
Mercedes-Benzes, three Rolls-Royces, three Ferraris, one Jaguar, an Aston 
Martin, a Porsche and a Jeep. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Hernandez pleaded guilty to mail fraud and money laundering. Susie 
Hernandez pleaded guilty to income tax evasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Both have plea agreements with the government that promise their help with a 
federal investigation into the activities of Danny Hernandez's former employer, 
PGP Industries of Santa Fe Springs. Danny Hernandez said PGP executives urged 
employees to shortchange customers of precious metals. The company has denied 
the allegation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the documents filed Friday, the government alleges that the Hernandez 
crimes date back to 1987, although the offenses to which they pleaded guilty 
cover 1989 through 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The pre-sentencing report prepared on the couple alleged they embezzled 
precious metals from PGP more than 50 times and the loss totaled more than $1 
million. The U.S. government says it has confirmed more than a dozen of the 
transactions -- or the sale of 576.7 ounces of gold -- and all were made in the 
name of Susie Amash, Susie Hernandez's maiden name. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of the thefts of precious metals were disclosed to the government by 
defendants, despite their promises in their plea agreements," Assistant U.S. 
Atty. Stephen G. Wolfe wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfe also alleged that two months before Danny Hernandez was arrested in 
March, 1993, he sold a Ferrari for $80,000. One month after his arrest, he 
placed the money into an escrow account in an attempt to buy the Hollywood 
Hills home of actor Richard Gere. Danny Hernandez enlisted help from the 
daughter of his civil attorney to open escrow for the home but the deal fell 
through, the government alleges. 
</P>
<P>
 As further proof that the couple should serve harsher sentences, prosecutors 
say Susie Hernandez -- while awaiting sentencing -- coerced a $2,000 payment 
from a real estate developer and demanded $8,000 more if he carried out a 
scheduled foreclosure of their Laguna Niguel property.  
</P>
<P>
 Wolfe alleged that Susie Hernandez's real estate broker called developer 
Robert O'Hill last Dec. 9 and threatened to file bankruptcy in order to delay 
the foreclosure the next day if O'Hill did not loan Susie Hernandez $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hernandezes were to have turned over all their assets shortly after their 
arrests. But they continued to flaunt their lifestyles and, according to 
prosecutors, hid or disposed of thousands of dollars in assets, including 
jewelry, custom household appliances and a membership in a San Juan Capistrano 
country club. 
</P>
<P>
 When O'Hill said he would consider a smaller loan, the broker suggested O'Hill 
come up with $2,000 that day and $8,000 later. O'Hill agreed to put the deal in 
writing, and when he asked Susie Hernandez if she intended to repay the loan, 
she said she did not intend to do so and would eventually file bankruptcy 
anyway, the government alleges in court documents. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government takes the position that concealing assets that the Hernandezes 
have pledged to identify and surrender in criminal forfeiture represents an 
obstruction of justice," Wolfe said. "So does lying to the court and the 
probation office."

TURNING POINTS; ST. JOSEPH BALLET HELPS AT-RISK YOUTHS CHANGE LIVES, STUDY 
FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE TASSY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 Flor de Liz (Flower) Alzate, 18, remembers being sent to the principal's 
office at age 12 after having a fight in school. She used to wear heavy makeup 
to look older and be popular, and her grades were going downhill. But worse, "I 
was almost going to be in a gang," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then one day, after about two years of ballet classes at St. Joseph Ballet 
Company in Santa Ana, the Tustin High School senior decided to start wearing 
less makeup and begin working harder in school. When her dance instructor asked 
why, "I said, 'Because I'm happy now.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Now she takes honors courses, maintains a 3.5 grade-point average, and was 
recently accepted to study dance at the North Carolina School of the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Alzate is one of 270 students from Orange County taking dance class at St. 
Joseph Ballet, where youths ages 9 to 19 and all virtually from low-income 
neighborhoods receive free dance training. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the dance students -- and their instructors -- have long believed that 
the program helps them change their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Now there is proof. 
</P>
<P>
 A yearlong study completed last month shows that the dancers have higher 
self-esteem than children with similar backgrounds but no dance training, and 
that they believe they can take responsibility to affect changes for 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew these children were different," said Julie Siri, a social worker who 
conducted the study funded by the James Irvine Foundation, an organization that 
in 1992 awarded St. Joseph Ballet a two-year, $65,000 grant. 
</P>
<P>
 To do it, she went to St. Joseph Ballet several times a week for two months 
and gave standardized tests to 113 students.  
</P>
<P>
 Siri, a social worker at a San Gabriel Valley hospice, said a key finding was 
that kids at St. Joseph Ballet sought validation internally and rejected the 
approval that some of their peers lived by: "If you want to feel good, come and 
join my gang or take these drugs," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Evaluation of St. Joseph Ballet's Impact on Inner-City Youth" also found 
that the average grade-point average of the dancers, who attend 68 schools, was 
3.0 for the 1992-1993 school year, which Siri considers remarkable for students 
living in crowded households where more than one language is spoken. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the study, the program provides the students with a form of 
intervention that can save them from crime and teen-age pregnancy. A 1993 
Report on the Condition of Children in Orange County, commissioned by the Board 
of Supervisors, found that those social ills were increasing dramatically 
throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 But intervention is not due to the dancing alone, Siri determined. "The 
environment is more important than the ballet per se. It's having an enriched 
environment." 
</P>
<P>
 That is what Beth Burns, the founder and artistic director, has aimed to 
provide. "I have a passionate belief in the worth and dignity and ability of 
young people regardless of their neighborhood, ethnicity and struggling 
financial situation," she said.

 Burns, 37, who lives in Newport Beach, used to belong to the Sisters of St. 
Joseph of Orange. Now she belongs almost exclusively to her dance students. 
</P>
<P>
 One evening last week, Burns helped Alzate and another dancer, Odette Molero, 
18, who was also accepted at the North Carolina school, to compose letters to 
possible scholarship sources. "Dream, ladies!" she told the teen-agers. "Dream, 
don't be shy. Because they don't want to help people with little puny goals."  
</P>
<P>
 When she is not teaching classes or being a role model to the students, she is 
planning concerts and community performances. "When you really believe in 
something, it's easy to work for, and a joy to make it happen. I really believe 
that communicating to children how lovable they are . . . can transform their 
lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Burns said the findings in Siri's study attest to what she already knew 
instinctively. "It's a simple and dramatic confirmation that we're helping 
these children have opportunities they would not" otherwise enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
 The opportunities available to some of these children are scarce, and the pull 
of juvenile delinquency is strong. One group of boys at the dance school comes 
from neighborhoods in Santa Ana so dangerous that they walk to classes in a big 
circle to avoid being singled out and isolated by gang members, Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the dancers know they could have been pulled into delinquency, but 
instead decided to dance. "We love it!" says Liz Lira, 12, one of the 
participants who comes "every single day except Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
 The junior high school student said, "Where I live, you can hear gunshots, and 
you can hear drunk people arguing. You come here and you feel safe." 
</P>
<P>
 St. Joseph Ballet has given her and classmate Thelma Macias, 12, the courage 
to leave negative things behind. Macias is one of eight children, and both her 
parents work from the late afternoon until early in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting on the floor in her leotard and bare feet last week, she explained 
that the staff keeps a watchful eye on her when her family cannot. "They notice 
our changes and explain to us what might happen, and that gets you thinking, 
and then you go back to the right direction," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Macias' friends have been pulled in the wrong direction, though. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have one friend that's on parole and a friend that's on speed," she said. 
"The friend on parole was supposedly caught tagging and stealing. They're all, 
'do this, do this,' and I'm like, 'no thanks.' " Other kids she knows are 
getting involved in gangs. "It's like a fraternity, but in a dumb way," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of gang involvement, Alzate, Lira and Macias are committed to 
long-term dance involvement, and all say they want to become professional 
ballerinas. "The dance world is always going to be in my life," Alzate said.

DANA PARSONS: SHAKEN OUT OF OUR SLEEP, BUT PROBABLY NOT INTO ACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I know what you're thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 You're thinking you've bought yourself another, what, one year? Two years? 
Maybe three or four, if you're really lucky? Another earthquake wakes us up in 
the wee hours of the morning, but we in Orange County pretty much survive 
intact. This was the "Sort of Big One" at 6.6 and yet we escape again, and so 
now you're thinking, "We probably won't have another one for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 Let's all roll over and go back to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, after the Bay Area earthquake, experts identified 15 fire 
stations in Orange County as being "very unlikely" to survive a significant 
quake. Another 20 would face "substantial damage," according to a report. This 
week, county officials acknowledged that they haven't authorized much if any of 
the needed retrofitting for the stations, which are vital during emergencies 
because they provide the first line of defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, sure, we could jump all over the county for being so derelict. How awful 
and shortsighted of them to delay earthquake preparedness. They won't be able 
to say they weren't warned. How dare they jeopardize public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 How dare they act, oops, just like the rest of us. 
</P>
<P>
 It sounds rather empty to criticize the county for not spending millions of 
dollars for earthquake preparedness when private citizens don't even have a 
plan on protecting their own families. 
</P>
<P>
 We might hope for a higher level of awareness for elected officials -- given 
that they have a public safety responsibility -- but they roll the dice on 
earthquakes just like the rest of us. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when public money is tight and things like health care cost more 
every day, can we blame the county for not putting earthquake preparedness on 
its short list of "Things to Do"? It's not like the public is clamoring to 
upgrade those fire stations. Besides, when any public entity is strapped for 
money, it covers the bills marked "due and payable." Government tends to forgo 
maintenance. If you don't believe me, check some of the school or city 
playgrounds around the county. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, Supervisor Harriett Wieder said she would ask the County Fire 
Department to update the situation since the 1989 report. Unless the structures 
have healed themselves in the last four years, the indications are the 
information won't be much different than it was then, when Supervisor Tom Riley 
called the situation "very serious." 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, the county has survived another four years since the Bay Area quake, 
lulling everyone further into a deep sleep. It was money spent on something 
else, and we got away with it. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake mentality adds a whole new layer of procrastination to the 
equation. It's almost part of the Southern California machismo to laugh in the 
face of the impending disaster. And after the last couple years of trauma 
around here -- with fires and quakes and riots -- is there any disaster that 
could generate a sense of urgency? 
</P>
<P>
 After the Landers quake in 1992, seismologists said a similar quake would do 
great damage if it were centered in a more populous area. That wasn't enough to 
scare Orange County into getting to work on the fire stations, and I doubt the 
Northridge quake will do it, either. 
</P>
<P>
 To paraphrase the sentiment in "The Crying Game," it's just not in our nature. 
</P>
<P>
 What is in our nature is to promise to get prepared and then do nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 The county didn't follow up on the 1989 report for the same reason citizens 
don't buy bottled water and squirrel away food -- we just can't convince 
ourselves that another quake is coming or that, if it comes, it will affect us. 
</P>
<P>
 When the quake started rolling Monday, I chastised myself for being 
unprepared. Again. No food, no water, no supplies. I didn't go hide under a 
desk or stand in the doorway. Just like every other time, I was caught off 
guard. Just like every other time, I vowed it wouldn't happen again. 
</P>
<P>
 One of these days (or years), Orange County may be awakened from a pleasant 
sleep by the familiar feel of the earth moving beneath it. Buildings may 
collapse and freeways buckle. We'll scream a collective " Damn, we knew it was 
coming , and we weren't ready! " 
</P>
<P>
 If this week's big quake had been centered in Orange County instead of 
Northridge, I suppose we'd all have been within our rights to criticize county 
government for not spending the money on those fire stations. 
</P>
<P>
 I, for one, however, would have to leave that criticism to someone else. I'd 
feel a little sheepish condemning the county when I still don't know where my 
gas shut-off switch is.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; JOBS THAT LEAD TO JOBS ON 'OUTSIDE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT ELSTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sheryl Forman says her dream job is to work at Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 But until that day comes, the 32-year-old woman who has been diagnosed with 
limited learning ability is employed at California Elwyn, where she does simple 
tasks such as putting rubber bands on bundles of brochures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love jobs but no one knows," Forman said recently while working at the 
Fountain Valley office along with some 230 other people in a big production 
room where dozens of jobs are being done simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
 To employees such as Forman, who sit at tables doing simple repetitive chores, 
California Elwyn is a safe place where they can make a living while also 
preparing themselves to enter the sometimes rougher workplace outside. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are basically providing training to prepare them for job placement within 
the community," said Dana Dotson, senior administrative assistant at the 
nonprofit corporation. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are many pitfalls to having what the California Elwyn workers refer 
to as an "outside job." 
</P>
<P>
 Forman left a job at a movie theater because she found she couldn't take her 
co-workers' taunts about being developmentally disabled. So she returned to 
California Elwyn, where she has worked for a total of six years. Despite being 
nervous, she looks forward to her next outside job. 
</P>
<P>
 California Elwyn has case managers and workstation monitors who gently help 
workers handle the pressures of a workplace. Employees are taught the 
importance of arriving on time and being productive throughout the day. They 
are evaluated for their production rate and attend quarterly reviews. Workers 
are paid based on their output and can make up to $125 a week, supplementing 
their Social Security checks. 
</P>
<P>
 Many employees are there on referrals from the state Department of 
Rehabilitation. For 20 years, Elwyn has provided work for people who otherwise 
might not find jobs because of their limited skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people join California Elwyn and only work for a few months before 
getting a job; others stay for more than a decade," Dotson said. "We leave it 
up to them. Not everybody wants to leave and go work someplace else." 
</P>
<P>
 With its unique work force, California Elwyn, which also has an office in 
Culver City, places competitive bids as it presses to win contracts for its 
work force. Among the kind of contracts it takes on include working for several 
major airlines to replace the used ear-sponges on in-flight headsets. 
</P>
<P>
 All this is often preparation for the workers, who may move on to "outside 
jobs" as maintenance workers or servers at fast-food restaurants or stocking 
shelves at grocery stores. 
</P>
<P>
 But others find the California Elwyn environment seductive. Martin Falsenfeld, 
33, who lives in Costa Mesa, worked at Cypress College and performed filing 
chores at a bank before joining Elwyn in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 "Originally, I thought I would be here a couple of months. But I am afraid to 
say that I am starting to enjoy it," he said.ROBERT ELSTON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; PANEL FUNDS MUSIC PROGRAMS AT SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT BARKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Huntington Harbour Philharmonic Committee has donated about $120,000 from 
a recent fund-raiser to aid school music programs at a time when districts have 
found it increasingly tough to fund such arts electives on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 The money was raised at the organization's 31st Cruise of Lights, an annual 
event that attracted nearly 25,000 viewers in December. 
</P>
<P>
 About $12,000 was given directly to city schools. The remainder was donated to 
the Orange County Philharmonic Society to be distributed for music programs and 
concerts at all schools in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Circle View Elementary received funds for the partial salary of a music 
teacher; Ethel Dwyer Middle School, for sheet music and transportation of 
pupils to the Orange County Philharmonic Society's Disneyland Jazz Concert at 
the Orange County Performing Arts Center, and Harbour View Elementary, for a 
vocal music teacher for 8 1/2 hours a week for 25 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization also donated money to Huntington Beach High School for the 
purchase of instruments for a new orchestra class at the School for Performing 
Arts and to Marina High School for sheet music for the music library, the 
repair of musical instruments and salaries of music staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Other beneficiaries are: Marine View Middle School, for the partial 
underwriting of a teacher's salary for the school's Song and Dance Company 
program; Agnes L. Smith Elementary, for a music teacher's salary for 13 hours a 
week for 12 weeks, and St. Bonaventure Elementary, for music charts and 
teachers' manuals. 
</P>
<P>
 Annette Eliot, the organization's vice president for public relations, said 
money raised from the Cruise of Lights and donations from Philharmonic members 
are more important than ever, particularly in times of school budget 
constraints. 
</P>
<P>
 "If not for our programs and our money, some schools may not have any music 
education," she said. "Music increases the meaning of life and enriches the 
soul."ROBERT BARKER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; PROGRAM TO MARK GROUP'S 29TH YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To celebrate its 29th birthday, Friends of the Fountain Valley Library will 
hold a celebration Thursday featuring a presentation that portrays the "spirit 
of the Sierra Nevada range." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Range of Light" will be presented at 7 p.m. by Ranger Jim Long. 
</P>
<P>
 The multimedia presentation, which reflects the writings and philosophy of 
John Muir, brings to life the Sierra wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
 Long, who photographed and arranged the presentation, grew up in the Sierra, 
and through "The Range of Light" has combined his love of the mountains with 
his love for classical music in creating the program. 
</P>
<P>
 The Friends of the Library, which has about 70 members, raises money to 
support the local library. The group sponsors programs, including the 
Children's Summer Reading program, and buys new books for the library. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolores Highum, a 20-year member, said the group raises $800 a month at its 
bookstore next to the library. Used paperbacks are sold for 25 cents and 
hardcover books for 50 cents. Donated books are also accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 The event, which is free and open to the public, will be held at the library, 
17635 Los Alamos St., located behind City Hall, off Slater Avenue.  
</P>
<P>
 More information is available by calling the library at (714) 962-1324 or 
Highum at (714) 842-6874.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; CITY SEEKS TO RESTORE TRAM SERVICE AT PIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city might bring back tram service on the Seal Beach Pier, once fire 
repairs to the landmark structure are completed later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Jerry L. Bankston said that the Ruby's restaurant and a charter 
fishing business at the end of the pier are interested in reviving the 
city-operated tram, which was frequently used by residents from Leisure World. 
</P>
<P>
 The service was halted in 1991 after a fire burned the heavy wood pilings in 
the middle of the pier. Workers installed temporary supports that made it 
impossible for the tram to travel along the pier, Bankston said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials hope to select a contractor soon to make permanent repairs to 
the pier. The project is expected to cost $225,000. The work is covered by 
insurance, but the city must pay a $100,000 deductible. The city also plans to 
repair some seismic damage caused by the 1992 Landers earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The pier will be closed for two to three weeks during the construction. 
Officials hope work will be completed before the busy summer tourist season. 
</P>
<P>
 Bankston said the city might consider using an electric-powered tram similar 
in appearance to a golf cart to take passengers around the pier. A smaller tram 
than the one previously used would be easier to maneuver and would cost less to 
insure, he said. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; AIR BASE A FACTOR IN COUNCIL CAMPAIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Planning for the eventual conversion of the Tustin Marine Corps Air Station to 
civilian use is likely to be one of the major issues in the April 12 municipal 
election, during which two seats on the City Council will be at stake. 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews and statements filed with their nomination papers last week, the 
four council candidates said the helicopter base could become either an asset 
or a drain on city finances. 
</P>
<P>
 "Proper planning can produce another beneficial and self-supporting area for 
Tustin," said Councilman Charles E. Puckett. He added that if the planning is 
mishandled, the city could be "severely impacted." 
</P>
<P>
 A 17-member task force is drafting redevelopment plans for the 1,620-acre 
base, which is scheduled to close in 1997. The council is expected to adopt the 
plans in the summer. The U.S. Navy, however, will have the final say on how the 
base is reused. 
</P>
<P>
 Puckett and Councilwoman Leslie Anne Pontious, who are both seeking second 
terms, are being challenged by Michael J. Doyle and Tracy Worley, both running 
for office for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 To overcome the name recognition disadvantage that challengers often face in 
races against incumbents, Doyle and Worley announced their candidacies six 
months ago, an unusually early start for municipal campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Doyle, a restaurant owner, and Worley, a homemaker, have been endorsed by 
Mayor Jim Potts, who said he needed the two on the council to help him open the 
city's trash-hauling contract to competitive bidding and to hire an in-house 
attorney to cut the city's legal expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Several city residents have criticized Potts for supporting the challengers, 
saying the mayor simply wants "puppets" on the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Potts responded that Doyle and Worley are "independent-minded people. They can 
think for themselves," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 All four candidates say that Tustin streets should be made safer and that a 
strong police force, using modern equipment such as video cameras and 
computers, is necessary to combat growing crime in residential neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "Public safety is a key to ensuring that Tustin continues to be an attractive 
community," said Pontious. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, the council decided to install video cameras on the city's 
23 patrol cars in the wake of the shooting of a Manhattan Beach police officer 
who was making a traffic stop. The cameras will be installed next month, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Worley, a 32-year-old mother of two young children, said the city must also 
provide programs to steer youths from trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Doyle and Worley, who have promised to share campaign expenses, including the 
cost of a headquarters and mailers, said they will work for term limits, limits 
on campaign contributions and the elimination of gifts to members of the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
 But Puckett and Pontious argue that those issues are already addressed by 
state law. Citing them amounts to grandstanding, they claim. 
</P>
<P>
 The key issue, Puckett said, is experience. His six years of service on the 
Planning Commission give him the expertise to help plan the conversion of the 
Marine base, he said. Pontious has also served on the planning panel. BERT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; NEIGHBORHOOD PARK PLANS MAKE PROGRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Plans to transform a narrow 1.3-mile railroad right-of-way into a neighborhood 
recreation area took a step forward this month with a meeting between Northwood 
residents and a noted urban designer. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents packed a local middle school one Saturday morning two weeks ago to 
discuss the fledgling park's design and give their input to San Francisco 
architect Lawrence Halprin, who volunteered his time to work on the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The unusual daylong dialogue produced general agreement on many ideas for the 
65-foot-wide sliver of land that runs roughly between Culver Drive and Jeffrey 
Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents said they want an eight-foot-wide walking path to run through the 
middle of the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Many participants also agreed that the park should include benches and trash 
cans but no public restrooms. It should also be connected to nearby Silkwood 
Park and to Westwood Basics Plus Elementary School, the group suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 Other ideas included: 
</P>
<P>
 * Planting trees and shrubbery around the area. 
</P>
<P>
 * Using drought-resistant plants when possible. 
</P>
<P>
 * Installing timer-activated lights throughout the park. 
</P>
<P>
 * Taking safety measures to protect pedestrians who must cross busy streets 
while using the trail. 
</P>
<P>
 A design consultant will now draw more detailed plans for the park and present 
them to the city in March. The project is expected to cost several million 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of how to use the right-of-way has been a contentious one ever since 
the railroad tracks were removed about a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Many residents fought a proposal to use the land as part of a regional bike 
path. 
</P>
<P>
 And while those who attended the meeting did not agree on all points, city 
officials said the event represented progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "Really, I went in skeptical," said Councilwoman Paula Werner, who attended 
the meeting. "This process has been going on for years and there's been 
divisiveness. But during the course of the day, I think we were really able to 
think and plan the kind of park we want. I was pleased with the entire 
course."SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; FRIENDLY BALD EAGLE WILL VISIT SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A bald eagle that prefers to socialize with humans rather than other birds 
will visit three schools today in Costa Mesa and Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The eagle, named Buddy, was found in Alaska after being abandoned by people 
who had apparently raised him for a few months, said Sandy Smith of the Alaska 
Raptor Rehabilitation Center, a group which cares for injured birds of prey. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said the bird had never learned to fly, and had to be taught by a 
trainer at the center. The process of imprinting, which normally bonds a young 
bird to its parents, triggered a bond with humans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever their care-giver is, it considers that their species for the rest of 
their life," Smith said of Buddy's bond to humans. "He's comfortable sitting in 
a group with people, whereas a wild bird would not be." 
</P>
<P>
 Buddy cannot be released to the wild because he doesn't know what to do there, 
Smith said. He would have to return to humans for food and company. When Buddy 
built his first nest last year, he encouraged his trainer to build with him, 
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said Buddy is expected to live up to 50 years in captivity, surviving on 
a diet of fish and an occasional rat. 
</P>
<P>
 Buddy does not like to be touched by people other than his trainers, Smith 
said. The 5-year-old bird has a six-foot wingspan and weighs eight pounds, she 
said. The birds can grow to have a wingspan of eight feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The raptor group will bring the bird to The Kline School in Costa Mesa at 8:30 
a.m., Principal Susan Kline said. The public is welcome to join students in the 
play area for the bird's visit. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the day the eagle will visit the Kaiser Primary Center and the 
Lincoln Elementary School in Newport Beach.WILLSON CUMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ALISO VIEJO; NO VIOLATIONS IN CUT TREES, COUNTY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The leader of a local environmental group wants the county to probe the 
destruction of 58 oak trees that were cut down by a developer, but a county 
official said Tuesday there were no apparent violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Laguna Greenbelt president Elisabeth Brown, who said the trees were at 
least 100 years old, said the developer, the Mission Viejo Co., should not have 
removed them while the environmental review process was still underway. 
</P>
<P>
 "The worst fears were realized," Brown said. "We're going to certainly protest 
to the county. It's up to them. They're the lead agency in this thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown is also a biologist and member of the Coastal Greenbelt Authority, a 
panel formed to manage the Laguna Coast Wilderness Park, which is next to 
Aliso/Wood Canyons Regional Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The grove was removed Friday from Corral Canyon in Aliso Viejo, near the edge 
of Aliso park, at the western edge of the next phase of a housing development.  
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo Co. spokeswoman Wendy Wetzel said the developer had a right to 
remove the trees, which she said were sickly and not preserved as part of the 
regional park. 
</P>
<P>
 "These trees are located in the area slated for future development. . . . The 
very best groves of oaks and sycamores, the most environmentally sensitive 
land, that 2,600 acres was preserved in the regional park," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not a healthy grove in the first place," she said, adding that a tree 
survey last year revealed decay in the root system, trunks and branch structure 
and that some of the oaks were hollow inside. "In fact, some of them were 
already dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Wetzel said the trees were destroyed under the deadline of a new federal law 
that prohibits any noise within 500 yards of known gnatcatcher area, which 
would include the regional park. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a federal deadline that we had to meet," Wetzel said. "That way it 
doesn't disturb their nesting season." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Wingard, director of regulations for the County Environmental Management 
Agency, said to his knowledge the county has not issued any approval to remove 
the trees, nor would it be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Wingard said that he met Tuesday to discuss the issue with county officials 
from the planning, and harbors, beaches and parks departments. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our discussion, we weren't aware of any deadline that had to do with the 
gnatcatcher," Wingard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wingard said Brown called him and he responded by sending county grading 
inspectors to the site Tuesday, but they did not find any grading violations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not aware of any violation of county ordinance or code," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wingard also said the county isn't likely to take further action on the matter 
unless there is new information. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary L. Schwager, who had been able to view the grove from his Top of the 
World home in Laguna Beach, said he will raise the issue at his neighborhood 
association's meeting on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be horrifying to me to think it was done by mistake or done without 
giving it the full due process of law," he said. "It used to be a beautiful 
little secret place, with oak trees and shaded. Now it is the same ugly brown 
as the rest of the construction area is." LESLIE EARNEST

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA; PERMITS FOR NUDE DANCING PUT ON ICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Businesses that want to offer nude dancing here will be prohibited from doing 
so for the next 10 months. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members last week unanimously imposed a 300-day moratorium on 
issuing permits for such entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 The ban extends a 45-day moratorium council members imposed last month after 
they were told some businesses planned to apply for permission to open a nude 
bar in the city. The council immediately moved to prevent that with the ban on 
new permits. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's Planning Department already has been directed to develop an 
ordinance regulating adult entertainment businesses in the city, which the 
council is expected to adopt within months, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Richard Jones said a complete ban on nude entertainment, as 
contained in the moratorium, would be illegal if it was made permanent. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said that because the city lacks an ordinance regulating such 
businesses, the moratorium is necessary to keep new businesses from opening 
immediately and creating "a threat to the public health, safety and welfare."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; NOMINEES SOUGHT FOR CIVIL RIGHTS AWARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County Human Relations Commission is now accepting nominations for 
its 1994 awards honoring local people who have made outstanding contributions 
in the area of human and civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission, which was created to help diffuse inter-group tensions and 
foster communication, will present the awards in Costa Mesa in April. 
Nominations will be accepted through Feb. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of unpleasant and nasty aspects to the work we do -- 
(monitoring) hate crimes, racism and bigotry," said Rusty Kennedy, the 
commission's executive director. "So this is a shot in the arm for us. A chance 
to recognize positive things going on in the community." 
</P>
<P>
 The 11-member commission will select 18 award winners based on their 
contribution to the Orange County community. An emphasis is put on work 
benefiting groups that are discriminated against, disenfranchised or 
disadvantaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy said the awards also highlight the efforts of people who often toil 
out of the limelight. 
</P>
<P>
 "It holds up good people and their accomplishments, including a lot of people 
who don't get a great deal of recognition," he said. "Sometimes it's 
high-profile people, but often it's people on the grass-roots level." 
</P>
<P>
 The diverse field of recipients last year included the general manager of 
Southern California Edison, a group of high school students who worked to 
improve ethnic relations in their community, and the parents of a gay youth who 
reached out to support others in similar circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides honoring award winners, the April 24 banquet at the Costa Mesa 
Community Center, 1845 Park Ave, also will celebrate the 23rd anniversary of 
the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 To get a nomination form, more information or banquet tickets, call the 
commission's office at (714) 567-7470. Tickets are $10 per person. 
</P>
<P>
 Applications are also available by writing to the Orange County Human 
Relations Commission, 1300 S. Grand Ave., Building B, Santa Ana, 92705. Entries 
may also be sent via facsimile machine to (714) 567-7474. GEOFF BOUCHER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE; CITY TO CONSIDER BID TO DEMOLISH 5 HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 10 years after being condemned, demolition of five homes in Verde 
Canyon will start next week if the City Council tonight approves a contractor's 
bid for the work. 
</P>
<P>
 The homes are among the 10 destroyed or condemned after a massive landslide in 
Verde Canyon in December, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will consider a low bid of $34,000, submitted by Fynok American 
Co. of Inglewood, to raze the five structures. The cost of demolition will be 
charged to the owners as a lien against the property. 
</P>
<P>
 "The houses were declared a nuisance because of the unstable soil conditions 
beneath them," said city building official Trang Huynh. "We want to make sure 
this site is cleaned up. These houses can't continue to just sit there." 
</P>
<P>
 The condemned and boarded-up structures have occasionally been used by 
transients over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawsuits over the disaster held up demolition for several years. City 
officials were ready to proceed with the work last year, but a housing 
development proposal for the canyon area halted the city's plans. 
</P>
<P>
 However, when it became apparent that the proposal to build 30 homes at the 
bottom of Verde Canyon was moving slowly, the city pushed forward with the 
demolition plan. FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; STREET TO GET SPEED SIGNS AND CROSSWALK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLSON CUMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has ordered speed-limit signs and a crosswalk in a Fullerton 
Avenue block that a resident complained is made dangerous by speeding cars. 
</P>
<P>
 James Italiano approached the city last fall and asked that Fullerton Avenue 
be closed at 20th Street to keep commuter traffic out of his neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Italiano said the block on which he lives, between 19th and 20th streets, is 
being used by commuters as a short cut to the Costa Mesa Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The commuters often exceed the 25-m.p.h. speed limit, Italiano said, 
endangering people who are trying to cross the street. Italiano also said the 
block is the scene of many accidents and has become very noisy because of the 
extra traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials studied the traffic patterns and said there are about 1,500 
cars per day. Other neighborhood streets are carrying 1,200 to 5,400 cars per 
day, the study said. The study did not recommend closing the street and said 
there are not enough cars to warrant installing speed bumps. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the study, there have been six accidents on the street in the 
last two years and there have not been an unusual number of them in Italiano's 
block. 
</P>
<P>
 The report said no significant changes need be made but suggested that signs 
pointing out the 25-m.p.h. speed limit could help slow down traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also voted to install a crosswalk at the east side of the 
intersection of Fullerton Avenue and East 19th Street. A unanimous decision was 
made to ask the Police Department to patrol the block at least one day every 
three months. 
</P>
<P>
 Italiano said after the meeting that he was pleased by the effort by the city 
to study the situation, and said he was hopeful that the changes would make his 
neighborhood safer. WILLSON CUMMER

4TH SUSPECT IN KILLING OF STEVE WOODS TO STAND TRIAL AS ADULT; COURT: ALL FOUR 
JUVENILES WILL ALSO BE CHARGED WITH GANG INVOLVEMENT, WHICH WOULD EXTEND THEIR 
SENTENCES.

<P>
 A final suspect charged with murder and assault in the killing of San Clemente 
teen-ager Steve Woods was ordered Tuesday to stand trial as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
 Saul Penuelas, who recently turned 18, is the fourth juvenile in the case to 
face murder and multiple assault charges in adult court.The others, including 
Penuelas' younger brother, were ordered last week to stand trial as adults on 
the same charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Gary Paer said he will also charge the four with gang 
involvement, which would extend their sentences. Each one is being held on 
$250,000 bail in Orange County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods, 17, was among a group of friends in several vehicles who were pelted 
with rocks, beer cans and other items by a group of 10 to 15 people on Oct. 15 
as they tried to avoid a confrontation at Calafia Beach County Park in San 
Clemente, according to testimony. Woods, a passenger in the first vehicle to 
leave the parking lot, was speared through the head with the metal rod of a 
paint roller. He fell into a coma and died about three weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
 Saul Penuelas, who told police he threw a rock during the melee, was driving 
the pickup that apparently contained the paint rollers, according to testimony. 
The defendant's father, to whom the pickup belonged, works as a painter. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense lawyers have said their clients didn't intend to kill anyone and could 
be rehabilitated in the juvenile system. 
</P>
<P>
 Two adults were also charged in the case.

RILEY URGES MARINE BASE FACTIONS TO SETTLE DIFFERENCES; SPEECH: INCOMING BOARD 
CHAIRMAN ALSO OUTLINES PLAN TO HELP LOW-INCOME RESIDENTS BUY HOMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 New Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley on Tuesday urged factions 
warring for control of El Toro Marine Corps Air Station to settle their 
differences and also outlined a plan that might allow low-income residents to 
purchase homes with less money down. 
</P>
<P>
 In his State of the County address, Riley told a packed Hall of Administration 
chamber that converting the Marine base continues to be the "most complex and 
difficult" of his 19-year career on the board. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe, however, that in the middle of difficulty lies opportunity," Riley 
said. "Until everyone involved makes the effort to focus on what is best for 
the county, it will be difficult to move ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 The conversion process for months has been slowed by divisiveness over who 
will control development of the 4,700-acre base. South County cities have waged 
a battle against commercial airport development, while North County cities 
support airport plans to boost local tourism. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, Riley's address left no doubt that he wanted the county to take the 
lead on future planning matters. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we move into the process of planning for the conversion of the El Toro 
Marine base, the county will be leading one of the most significant land-use 
efforts to date," Riley said. "We have a unique opportunity to . . . craft what 
can ultimately be the centerpiece of our county." 
</P>
<P>
 While describing El Toro's conversion as "my No. 1 priority for 1994," the 
81-year-old supervisor also stressed the need to resuscitate the county's 
library system and provide housing for low-income residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley said he was studying a plan to allow low-income residents to purchase 
homes by paying only 3% in down payments. Tuesday, Riley had few details of how 
the plan would work, but said the county would be joining with state 
authorities to create such a program for Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "The need is definitely there," Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Orange County's beleaguered library system, Riley said he would consider 
increasing fees, seeking funding aid from cities or establishing special tax 
districts to replenish money lost last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's library budget was slashed by nearly $6 million in 1993, 
causing a 44% reduction in operating hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "The impact on our library system has been severe," Riley said. "Library 
materials, including periodical subscriptions, reference books, business 
services and new books has been decreased from $6 million to $1.5 million." 
</P>
<P>
 Riley said he would call for the creation of a special "library task force" to 
make funding recommendations to the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisor, a former Marine Corps brigadier general, has represented the 
sprawling South County district since 1974, when he was appointed by then-Gov. 
Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley has announced that he will retire next year, at the end of his term.

CALTRANS NAMES NEW CHIEF FOR LOCAL DISTRICT; TRANSPORTATION: BRENT FELKER, WHO 
IS OVERSEEING THE SANTA ANA FREEWAY WIDENING, WILL ASSUME THE POST OF DIRECTOR 
MONDAY.

<P>
 A 33-year-old project manager overseeing the widening of the Santa Ana Freeway 
has been named to head Caltrans' Orange County District, officials confirmed 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Brent Felker, now serving as deputy district director for construction in the 
county, will assume the post Monday, California Department of Transportation 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the new district director I will continue the improvements needed to 
develop a multi-modal system here in Orange County," Felker said, including 
high-occupancy freeway lanes, rail lines and express bus systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Felker has spent much of his time in recent years overseeing the widening of 
the freeway through Santa Ana and Irvine, plans for new on- and off-ramps for 
Disneyland in Anaheim and the redesigning of the El Toro "Y." 
</P>
<P>
 "Transportation officials in Orange County and throughout the state are going 
to continue to focus on making improvements," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Felker said he had just completed a preliminary survey of possible earthquake 
damage to the county's freeway construction, bridges, overpasses and 
underpasses. He said he had identified no damage in the county on the state 
highway system. 
</P>
<P>
 In an earlier interview, Felker said that the freeway construction now going 
on in the county "is essentially unique to the state. . . . It's like 
conducting open-heart surgery while keeping the patient walking or running. . . 
. Our drive is to keep people moving." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that construction on the Santa Ana Freeway has not scared drivers off 
the route, as sometimes happens during major traffic accidents or other 
tie-ups. During the construction, he said, traffic on the freeway has remained 
constant -- about 250,000 to 300,000 vehicles daily.

FIRE DESTROYS DISCOUNT STORE IN STRIP MALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A fire broke out in a strip mall late Monday night, destroying a discount 
store and threatening several other businesses, fire officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time firefighters were called to the mall at 10:57 p.m., the 99 Cents 
Store at 433 N. Tustin Ave. was engulfed in flames, said Orange Fire Battalion 
Chief Ray Montoya. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just a stubborn, stubborn fire," Montoya said. "The fire had been 
burning for at least 15 minutes and all of the contents inside of the store 
were already burned. The fire was smoldering. We opened the doors to get in and 
there was dark, thick, hot smoke down to the floor, which made it difficult to 
find where the fire originated." 
</P>
<P>
 It took 46 firefighters almost two hours to bring the blaze under control. The 
fire caused an estimated $700,000 damage to the store and its contents. No one 
was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Other businesses in the mall suffered some smoke damage but firefighters were 
able to prevent the flames from spreading to a restaurant, video store and pet 
hospital housed in the same mall. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took some very aggressive firefighting to keep the fire confined to the 
one business," Montoya said. "We're very fortunate that we didn't have any 
winds to get in our way." 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters forced their way into the pet hospital to rescue a dog that had 
just had surgery and was being boarded there for the night. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dog was really scared," Montoya said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials still have not determined a cause for the fire, which remains under 
investigation.

ACTIVIST JOYCE WILSON DIES DURING QUAKE 
</P>

<P>
 Joyce Wilson, a longtime abortion opponent and campaigner for local 
Republicans, died of a heart attack during the earthquake Monday morning as she 
rose to gather her children for safety. She was 52. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, a Cypress resident for the past 18 years, was an early member of the 
Pro-Life Political Action Committee of Orange County and had campaigned for 
various candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 A mother of seven children aged 12 to 29, she wrote articles for the Roman 
Catholic Diocese of Orange newsletter and worked part-time as an electrologist 
at a Cypress beauty salon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you what she was to me; to me she's the glue of the county. She 
glued us all together," said Cathy Sullivan, Wilson's best friend and political 
partner. "She empowered us, especially women, through support, prayer, not 
judging us. You could tell her anything, you knew she would pray for you. She 
was an empowerer." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson is survived by her husband of 30 years, Ed; five daughters, two sons 
and a sister, Gayle Wright of Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rosary will be recited at 7:30 tonight at St. Mary's by the Sea, 321 10th 
St., Huntington Beach. The funeral will be at St. Mary's Thursday at 9 a.m., 
with burial in Rose Hills Cemetery in Whittier. 
</P>

 Memorial fund donations may be sent to the Pro-Life PAC, P.O. Box 1683, Garden 
Grove, Calif. 92642.

YOUTH CENTER PLANNED AT SAN CLEMENTE MIDDLE SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CORE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Officials at Shorecliffs Middle School in San Clemente and the South Coast 
YMCA are planning to put an after-school youth center on the Shorecliffs campus 
by next fall. The facility would be the first of its kind at a South County 
middle school. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had on-campus, school-based programming at elementary schools for 10 
years," said Vince Corsaro, South Coast YMCA's executive director. "As kids 
have been moving into middle schools, we've just gotten a lot of people coming 
to us saying, 'Where are all those things I was used to?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The move for such a facility also gained momentum as a result of recent acts 
of violence involving San Clemente youths after school hours, said Shorecliffs 
teacher and activities director Adam Ochwat. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking for more ways to keep adolescents active," Ochwat said. "We're 
trying to give them options to the streets." 
</P>
<P>
 Plans for the center are expected to be considered by the YMCA and Capistrano 
Unified School District boards in the next two to three months. Corsaro and 
Ochwat said they hope to have it operating by the time school opens in the 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
 All elementary school campuses in the Capistrano school district have portable 
buildings, provided by the YMCA, that give children a place to go and 
activities to keep them busy until 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The YMCA operates a middle-school pilot program at Willard Intermediate School 
in the Santa Ana Unified School District, but there are no other such 
facilities in the county, Corsaro said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new youth center would be located in a 2,000-square-foot, $60,000 portable 
building provided by the YMCA on the campus at 240 Via Socorro, Corsaro said. 
</P>
<P>
 Details on what would be available at the center are still being worked out, 
but Ochwat said it could contain computers and books for studying, along with 
video games and other recreation equipment. The school's existing basketball 
and volleyball courts could also be used. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is to set up a place where they can study, talk and organize 
athletic events -- a safe place for someone to go and hang out for an hour or 
two," Ochwat said. 
</P>
<P>
 Corsaro added that he hoped many of the ideas for organizing the center would 
come from those who will be involved with it the most. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would like to see a high degree of involvement in the program by the 
students and the parents, so there is a sense of ownership," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ochwat said the school is attempting to raise at least $20,000 in cash or 
equipment to furnish the facility. "We're open to donations of computers, video 
equipment, furniture, whatever it might be," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The school also is sponsoring a fund-raising dinner on Feb. 5 at 5:30 p.m. 
that will include appearances by professional athletes, a drawing for sports 
memorabilia and an auction. The cost is $35 a person or $300 for a table of 10. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information or to purchase tickets, call the San Clemente Chamber of 
Commerce at (714) 492-1131.

HOME WELCOMES 26 NORTHRIDGE SENIORS; EMERGENCY RELIEF: ANAHEIM MEADOWS 
RETIREMENT CENTER WILL HOUSE ELDERS DISPLACED BY EARTHQUAKE. SO FAR, THE 
TRANSPLANTS LIKE THE CHANGE OF PACE, SCENERY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A retirement home here opened its doors for free to 26 people left homeless 
after their Northridge retirement home was damaged by the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan Istrin, president of Anaheim Meadows retirement home on La Palma 
Avenue, got the call for help at 7 p.m. Monday. A former colleague told him 
that residents at the Northridge Gardens retirement home needed a place to stay 
because the early morning temblor had burst a water pipe, causing extensive 
flooding. The quake also left the retirement home without electrical power. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said the residents need help and to come up and help, so I came," Istrin 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 He drove to Northridge, but once there, Istrin realized that he needed more 
than his van to move the 26 people. Undaunted, he chartered a bus and took his 
soon-to-be guests to Anaheim Meadows, located about three miles from 
Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just want to give people a dry, warm and comfortable place to stay until 
all the shaking stops," said Istrin, 32. "It's not Northridge and it's not 
home, so we hope they don't mind it too much." 
</P>
<P>
 The displaced residents have taken their situation in stride. Tuesday, they 
mingled with each other and explored their new surroundings at the three-story 
white building they will housed at for the next couple of weeks. They listened 
to music in the courtyard. They watched "Dennis the Menace." 
</P>
<P>
 "No, it hasn't been bad at all," said 73-year-old Carlo Heckert. "I've been 
loving it here because of the nice ladies tending to us. Some of them are 
pretty." 
</P>
<P>
 For 86-year-old Bill Ockerman, staying in Anaheim gave him an opportunity to 
have lunch with his daughter-in-law from Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's quite nice getting away from Northridge every once in awhile," he said. 
"Who knows, if they don't charge very much, maybe I'll stay here." 
</P>
<P>
 His friend, Gertrude Fellows, likes the Meadows' hospitality, but said 
recreation here is a little lacking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to play bridge at home a lot, and they don't play bridge here," said 
Fellows, 90. "It's a little quiet, but I guess quiet is very nice compared to 
an earthquake."

MOST O.C.-BASED CHAIN STORES MAKE FAST RECOVERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL FLAGG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By Tuesday afternoon, all but two of the 22 El Pollo Loco chicken restaurants 
that had begun Monday as dark, powerless hulks with broken windows had been 
reopened. 
</P>
<P>
 And -- as if to make up for the earthquake damage -- business was booming. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County-based fast-food vendors and retail chains with stores in Los 
Angeles and the San Fernando Valley escaped relatively unscathed from Monday's 
6.6-magnitude earthquake. These companies had reopened most of their stores in 
the parts of the city most severely damaged by the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 None of El Pollo Loco's outlets seemed to have suffered any structural damage, 
for instance, although the two still without power lost as much as several 
thousand dollars worth of chicken and other foodstuffs. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, "a lot of people didn't have power and couldn't cook, and 
they didn't want to be in the house anyway," said Jeff Tandberg, operations 
coordinator for the Irvine-based chain, which operates 140 restaurants in 
California and the Southwest. "So business was very good." 
</P>
<P>
 Few of the chain's workers had trouble getting to work Monday and Tuesday, 
said Tandberg, because many arrive at low-wage jobs via public transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Gradually, though, the restaurants were returning to normal throughout 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 So, too, were HomeBase's building-supply stores nearest the quake's epicenter 
in Northridge. All but the North Hollywood store were open by Tuesday, although 
the inside of the Simi Valley store was still a shambles. While employees swept 
up broken glass in the aisles, clerks were selling to customers through the 
front doors of the big warehouse-type store. 
</P>
<P>
 People queued up to buy flashlights, water heaters, batteries, plywood, 
drywall, brooms, buckets, cleaning liquids and all the other paraphernalia of 
disaster recovery. Business was brisk, according to an official of the 
Fullerton-based chain of 82 stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was La Habra-based Food 4 Less, which says it's getting to be an 
old hand at coping with Southern California's disasters, including man-made 
ones like a riot. 
</P>
<P>
 The chain operates 200 Alpha Beta, Boys Market and Viva supermarkets -- 34 of 
which were without power Monday. Not half an hour after the 4:31 a.m. quake, 
employees were at the stores trying to get them cleaned up. An additional 20 
stores had power but wound up with as much as 90% of their groceries all over 
the aisles, a loss of tens of thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 At the supermarkets that managed to open Monday, there was little demand for 
food; what people wanted was bottled water and batteries, since many 
neighborhoods were without power and water. 
</P>
<P>
 Lessons learned the hard way during the Los Angeles riots two years ago -- 
when 40 of the company's supermarkets were destroyed or damaged -- came in 
handy. Among them: how to get food to the stores when the roads are blocked. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seasoned veterans, if anyone can be in this kind of experience," said 
Food 4 Less Vice President Darius Anderson. "There were a lot of roads closed, 
but we worked out new routes to get our stores replenished." 
</P>
<P>
 By Tuesday, only 11 stores -- still waiting for power to be restored -- 
remained closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell also took it on the chin. More than 30 outlets around Los Angeles 
were left without power or clean water or both. Most were still closed Tuesday 
and were -- at best -- a day away from reopening. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine-based Taco Bell, a Mexican style fast-food chain with 4,500 outlets 
nationwide, didn't know how much revenue it would lose on the closed outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 And the jury was still out for Rockwell International's big Canoga Park plant, 
where its Rocketdyne unit makes engines for the space shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
 The plant sustained some structural damage, such as cracks in tiles, a broken 
water pipe, broken windows and other damage. The extent of the damage and 
estimates of how much it will cost to fix it won't be known until at least 
today, Rockwell said. Meanwhile, 6,000 workers were furloughed at home for a 
second day Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 There was better news at its Downey facility, where its Space Systems unit 
designs and makes manned spacecraft for the huge Seal Beach-based defense 
contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 That plant was closed Monday when a water pipe broke, but the damage was 
repaired and most of the 4,400 employees were back at work Tuesday.

VIACOM RAISES PARAMOUNT BID BY $800 MILLION IN CASH, STOCK; MERGERS: ANALYSTS 
SAY THE SWEETENED OFFER SHIFTS THE PRESSURE TO RIVAL QVC'S BARRY DILLER TO 
AGAIN INCREASE HIS BID. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Viacom Inc. on Tuesday again raised the stakes in the bidding for Paramount 
Communications Inc., with an offer that puts it on roughly equal footing with 
rival QVC Network Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Both bids are now valued at about $10.4 billion, as the Feb. 1 deadline for 
submitting offers draws closer. Analysts say the pressure has shifted to QVC 
Chairman Barry Diller, who might have to raise his bid again to maintain his 
advantage over Viacom Chairman Sumner Redstone. 
</P>
<P>
 Redstone's new offer contains $800 million in additional cash and stock, plus 
a partial guarantee that Viacom will make up the difference if its stock falls 
below a minimum value. 
</P>
<P>
 In cash terms, it exceeds the value of the QVC bid by nearly $900 million. But 
QVC's package of securities for the "back end" portion of its two-tiered bid 
remains higher. 
</P>
<P>
 During the course of market trading Tuesday, the blended value of QVC's bid 
was pegged $1 to $2 higher per share by some on Wall Street. But traders 
cautioned that the value of QVC shares is expected to fall if QVC actually wins 
the bidding contest. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the surface, Barry's bid is higher but Sumner's bid has more cash and the 
back end has a little more certitude," said Mario Gabelli, a New York money 
manager with about 4.2 million Paramount shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Gabelli predicted that Diller will adjust his offer because he's "too far 
apart on the cash part." He added, "If he buttresses the back end (of the 
offer) substantially, he may still be able to win with less cash." 
</P>
<P>
 Diller, who last week said he had made his final offer, was mum Tuesday about 
how he might respond. Under the rules of the auction, Paramount has declared 
Feb. 1 the final date for any changes in the bids. With its move, Viacom has 
pushed the expiration of its new offer to midnight Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 For its part, Paramount issued a terse statement saying its board would meet 
this week to consider the new Viacom bid. Paramount abandoned an earlier, 
friendly merger agreement with Viacom after the Delaware courts rebuked the 
board for failing to weigh QVC's unsolicited offers seriously. When an auction 
was initiated Dec. 20, QVC submitted the highest bid, and the Paramount board 
currently has a merger agreement with QVC. 
</P>
<P>
 The final decision, however, rests with Paramount shareholders, who will 
determine the winning bid by tendering 51% of their shares to one of the 
competing bidders. 
</P>
<P>
 For that reason, arbitragers continued to predict Tuesday that the bidding 
will go down to the wire. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expect QVC to go up sometime between now and Jan. 31," said Eric Rosenfeld, 
managing director of Oppenheimer & Co.'s arbitrage department. "You're going to 
get a disinformation campaign saying this is the final (Viacom) bid. Feb. 1 at 
5 p.m., you'll see a final bid." 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to the Paramount board, Viacom hinted broadly that it is making 
its final bid, by saying its new offer "is at the highest level that we believe 
would be in the interests of not only the Paramount stockholders, but the 
stockholders of Blockbuster and Viacom." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the fourth time Viacom has raised its bid since it initially offered 
$69.14 in the merger deal of Sept. 12. The current cash portion of its bid is 
$107 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 The role of Blockbuster Entertainment Corp. has become crucial to Viacom 
because it is providing much of the cash and is scheduled to merge with Viacom 
in an $8.4-billion transaction. Some sources suggested that the video rental 
giant's directors were cool to the idea of yet another revised bid. But a 
source in the Blockbuster camp denied it was a tough sell. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount shares rose $1.25 to close at $80 on the New York Stock Exchange on 
Tuesday. Viacom Class A shares fell $1.75 to $40.25, while Viacom Class B sank 
$1.375 to $37.75. QVC slipped 50 cents to close at $43. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate development, Paramount spurned most of QVC's suggestions for 
changes in its auction rules. Among other things, QVC complained fiercely last 
week that a last-minute bid by Viacom on Jan. 7 violated the auction process, 
but Paramount's outside counsel wrote QVC attorney Martin Lipton that 
"Paramount has no reason to believe that the Jan. 7 Viacom offer was in breach" 
of the rules accepted by both parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer James Bates contributed to this report. Bids at a Glance 
</P>
<P>
 Viacom-Blockbuster and QVC are both offering cash for 50.1% of Paramount stock 
and packages of securities for the remaining stake. The cash represents a fixed 
value for Paramount shareholders, while the securities fluctuate in value. 
Viacom has raised the cash portion of its bid to $107 while sweetening the 
securities portion by establishing a minimum value guarantee on its stock. Here 
is a brief synopsis of the current offers: 03,29,13,13 Viacom- Blockbuster QVC 
new bid current bid Cash value per share: $107 $92 Securities value per share: 
$62.14 $77.49 Blended value per share*: $84.62 $84.75 Total value (billions): 
$10.4 $10.4 *with no discount applied for convertible preferred shares.

EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; SOUTHLAND REAL ESTATE MARKET JOLTED INTO LIMBO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Much of the region's housing market turned chaotic Tuesday, as homeowners 
whose property was damaged by the earthquake swamped their lenders with phone 
calls, buyers tried to back out of previous commitments and sellers pushed to 
close sales in escrow. 
</P>
<P>
 While most of the destruction occurred in the San Fernando Valley, the impact 
of the quake is rippling through housing markets across the rest of Los Angeles 
County and other parts of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Lenders have temporarily frozen thousands of pending loan applications until 
the properties can be inspected or reappraised, a move that could add weeks to 
escrows that were supposed to close as early as today.  
</P>
<P>
 In turn, buyers who want to purchase a house or homeowners who simply want to 
refinance their loans may face additional delays as harried appraisers and home 
inspectors struggle to keep up with their rising workload. 
</P>
<P>
 Compounding the troubles, many real estate and escrow offices remained closed 
due to damage caused by the quake and its aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those that were open could operate at only half-speed, largely because 
telephone service remained spotty in some areas and many employees either could 
not or would not come to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got a couple of workers who have lost their homes, others who have 
suffered damage and one who is living in the park right now," escrow agent Jim 
Potter said as he took a break from picking up the shattered glass and toppled 
computers at the agency he owns in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just can't see any deal being closed in the entire Valley for at least a 
week, and that's going to back up the system everywhere," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of borrowers overwhelmed the shorthanded staff at the customer 
service and check-processing facility of mortgage lender Countrywide Funding in 
Simi Valley, about 15 miles west of the quake's epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half the facility's 2,000 workers were absent Tuesday. Many were 
still sifting through the debris at their own homes, while others simply could 
not get to work because dozens of freeways and roads remained closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Some customers, weeping, begged for help in making their mortgage payments, 
while other calls came from angry sellers who demanded that the bank force 
now-reluctant buyers to go through with purchases that Countrywide had agreed 
to finance, said Jane Ivey, a Countrywide vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're helping our customers who need it, but we can't force a buyer to go 
through with a sale if he wants to back out because of the earthquake," Ivey 
said. "We're doing everything we can to help out, but we've had to tell some 
folks that they better call a lawyer." 
</P>
<P>
 Countrywide and some other major lenders have temporarily suspended funding 
loans in earthquake-affected areas until each property can be either 
reinspected or reappraised. 
</P>
<P>
 Great Western Bank said it will probably reinspect homes only in the 
hardest-hit areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "It might inconvenience some customers, but it's the prudent thing to do," 
said Ian Campbell, a Great Western spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 But many of the same lenders have also launched special loan programs aimed at 
helping victims of the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Appraisers, meanwhile, are bracing for an onslaught of new work. Many were 
already putting in long hours to cope with the latest wave of refinancing. A 
flurry of quake-related work could translate into longer waits for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Appraisals might start taking a little more time for us to put together, 
because we'll have to take into account any quake-related damage to the 
property we're evaluating or damage to surrounding homes," said Dave Clarke, an 
appraiser in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Clarke said, homeowners who did not suffer any damage and are 
simply seeking to refinance their existing loans could be among the losers in 
the aftermath of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners whose properties were damaged may be eligible for financial help 
from their lenders and government agencies, Clarke said. But homeowners seeking 
lower mortgage rates may be prevented from refinancing because lenders might be 
skittish about making loans in neighborhoods that have sustained heavy damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Some experts also said Tuesday that the quake could encourage many homeowners 
who sustained damage to simply let their lenders foreclose. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the quake, property values in the San Fernando Valley were down 
about 20% from their peak of a few years ago. Since thousands of homeowners in 
the Valley and across Southern California had seen their equity wiped out long 
before the earthquake hit, some may see no reason to make expensive repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people are just going to figure that they'd be throwing good money after 
bad, so they'll just mail their keys back to their bank and say, 'It's your 
problem now,' " Clarke said.

JAMES FLANIGAN: EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; VALLEY PLANT IS DRUMMING UP 
BUSINESS AS USUAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If President Clinton, who is scheduled to visit today, wants to know the heart 
and soul of Los Angeles, let him visit small businesses in the earthquake-hit 
San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 There he will find companies cleaning up, testing machinery and starting work 
again. If Clinton takes his saxophone and visits Remo Belli, president and 
owner of Remo Inc. in North Hollywood -- the world's largest maker of drumheads 
(the drum's polyester skin) -- he will see a company that even got back into 
production Tuesday, because this is an important week in its business. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake couldn't have come at a worse time for Remo. The annual show of 
the National Assn. of Music Merchants opens Friday in Anaheim, with up to 
40,000 musical instrument customers and dealers expected to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 This is also the week that Remo, which gets half its $20 million in annual 
sales from abroad, welcomes its 35 worldwide distributors and shows off its 
latest innovations in drums and drumheads. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, musical instruments dealers from Europe, Japan and the Middle East 
were calling Belli, asking if it was OK to come to Los Angeles. "Sure, come 
ahead," he told them from his small office in the main plant on Raymer Street 
-- the one that got electricity back on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 A second plant nearby on Saticoy Street was still without power, but even 
there, many of Remo's 250 employees were restacking drum cylinders and getting 
ready to resume production when the power came back. 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways -- in its informality and energy, its spirit of innovation and 
even in the squabbles it has had with regulators -- Remo exemplifies small 
business in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not alone. Most companies in the Valley remained closed Tuesday but had 
people in the darkened factories preparing to open Wednesday. In Woodland 
Hills, Gershon Weltman, president of Perceptions Inc., and a crew of employees 
were sweeping up broken glass and restacking files. Perceptions, which makes 
simulators for training soldiers to drive tanks, is now adapting its know-how 
to teaching truckers how to handle 18-wheelers. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby at Erwin and De Soto streets, Data Products, a maker of computer 
printers, was also closed. But company President Irvin Moloney and his workers 
were in the plant cleaning up water from busted sprinkler pipes and testing 
computer machinery. 
</P>
<P>
 Remo Belli, like most small business owners, doesn't carry costly earthquake 
insurance. Remo Inc.'s sprinkler damage will be a write-off, and the few days 
of lost production -- roughly 30,000 of the 3 million drumheads his company 
makes each year -- will have to be made up on overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the earthquake hasn't changed Belli's plan to invest $1 million this year 
in equipment and efficiencies so he can keep the lead over competition from 
Taiwan, South Korea and Brazil. They offer low prices; Belli offers great 
variety at low cost -- drumheads in eight or nine sizes and more than 400 
kinds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can give you a sound for rock 'n' roll or for the L.A. Philharmonic or the 
Marine Band," says Belli, 66, who founded the company 36 years ago in 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Belli was a drummer from Mishawaka, Ind., (near Elkhart) who stayed in Los 
Angeles after serving in the Navy during World War II. His idea was that a 
synthetic drumhead would be an improvement on the calfskin ones that were 
standard at that time. So, in 1956, with the aid of a chemist and an 
accountant, he started to make drumheads of DuPont Mylar, then a new polyester 
material.  
</P>
<P>
 Today Belli, who ties his gray hair back with a rubber band, credits synthetic 
drumheads with making possible the surge of youth music that accompanied rock 
'n' roll, the Beatles and other groups in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 "There would have been no way to supply 300,000 garage bands if drums were 
made with calfskin," he says. "They couldn't have killed all those animals." 
</P>
<P>
 Belli's company, and the music business of Los Angeles, took off in the '60s. 
"But traditional U.S. musical instrument makers in Chicago and Elkhart didn't 
get it," says Belli. They refused to invest to expand their businesses "and 
they ignored the Japanese," he says. But Belli didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Yamaha and other Japanese companies were distributors and good customers of 
Remo products, even if they were sometimes competitors as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The qualities of California business -- openness to new products and new 
markets -- stood Remo in good stead. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's not the end of the story. California too grew stodgy, and Remo 
almost left for San Antonio, Tex., last year. Belli's complaints about the 
bureaucratic attitudes of environmental regulators and the cost of workers' 
compensation insurance are common ones -- but in his case, there's a twist. 
</P>
<P>
 What Belli really didn't like was that Remo was classified as a plastics 
manufacturer instead of a musical instrument maker (because its drumheads are 
of polyester). So it paid higher insurance premiums than Rico Reeds, a nearby 
maker of reeds for clarinets and saxophones, "that was classed a musical 
instrument maker because it works with cane." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem was simple and, for once, so was the solution. A motion in 
Sacramento, made with the help of Los Angeles County's Economic Development 
Corp., and Remo was reclassified as a musical instrument business. 
</P>
<P>
 That made a $1.5-million-a-year difference in insurance premiums, says Belli. 
And so Remo, its 250 jobs -- and its new ideas -- stayed in California. 
</P>
<P>
 New ideas are needed in music today, because the instrument business is 
becoming an unexpected victim of the Information Age: youngsters spend their 
money on video games, computer software and CD-ROMs. So musical instruments are 
a no-growth business, except for the great promise Belli sees in the emerging 
field of music and health. 
</P>
<P>
 Remo's plant contains gigantic, six-sided drums that have provided effective 
therapy for Alzheimer's patients. The vibrations reach them where speech and 
other stimuli do not. Remo is working with medical researchers, who are finding 
that playing music can do for the mind what brisk walking does for the body. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's potentially an enormous market," says Belli, and he's going for it. And 
despite earthquake damage, he's also turning out special items for this 
summer's World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Remo is focusing not on what happened yesterday, but on what needs to be done 
tomorrow -- like the best of Los Angeles business.

EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; CALCULATING CALAMITY; DISRUPTION, LOSSES TO 
THE REGION COULD HIT AT LEAST $7 BILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 As businesses cleaned up and assessed damage on the day after the Northridge 
earthquake, it became clear that the costs of the disaster to Southern 
California will mount quickly -- to a total of $7 billion or more, according to 
insurance industry estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 Some costs will be immediate: 
</P>
<P>
 * Thousands of workers will forgo wages as they sit home, either because they 
can't commute to work over crippled freeways or their plants and offices are 
still closed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Business will lose millions of dollars from damage to inventories, collapsed 
buildings and sales that fell through. For many small and medium-sized 
businesses, those losses are uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
 The Insurance Information Institute estimated that the losses from structural 
damage would easily match those resulting from the 1989 quake in the San 
Francisco Bay Area. That quake caused $7 billion in total losses, of which 
about $960 million was not covered by insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 But some early estimates went even higher: One San Francisco engineering 
consulting firm said losses could reach as high as $15.1 billion, of which 
between $1.5 billion and $1.9 billion would be insured. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-term effects are less certain. At the very least, area businesses can 
expect to see higher costs due to interrupted transportation. With the key 
arteries of Interstates 5 and 10 expected to be blocked for at least a year, 
economists predict chronic delays in getting goods to market or commuters to 
workplaces.  
</P>
<P>
 "You're holding up people and merchandise, and all of that costs something," 
said Bruce F. DeVine, chief economist at the Southern California Assn. of 
Governments. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, no agency or economist has come up with estimates of the extent of 
damage to businesses or of the numbers of workers laid off temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
 "Typically, across the board in catastrophes, 30% to 40% of insurance claims 
and 60% to 70% of total dollars lost" are business related, said Jim Welsh, 
claim consultant at Property Claims Service, a trade group in Rahway, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 A survey of local firms illustrates how the quake is already having an impact 
on the local economy, particularly in areas near the epicenter. Valley Firms 
Take Stock 
</P>
<P>
 Several large employers remained shuttered. The Anheuser-Busch brewery in Van 
Nuys, which employs 1,500 people, was closed as damage was being assessed. Many 
of the workers were helping clean up, while others stayed home to deal with 
their own damage. The brewery is expected to be closed for at least a week.  
</P>
<P>
 Plant manager Gary Lee said through a spokesman that the company had no 
estimate of damages yet. Production was diverted to breweries near Sacramento 
and in Colorado and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, at Superior Industries International in Van Nuys, an auto parts 
plant that employs 1,000 workers, the doors were closed for damage inspections 
Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 Many workers were there, but others had trouble getting in, particularly those 
who live in Santa Clarita and the Antelope Valley, areas virtually cut off by 
the collapse of California 14, said R. Jeffrey Ornstein, chief financial 
officer.  
</P>
<P>
 The plant, which supplies aluminum wheels to auto makers, was expected to 
reopen today and resume limited production within a week. Orders were being 
filled from the company's four other plants outside Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 At the 20th Century Insurance Co.'s ravaged headquarters building in Woodland 
Hills, customers who didn't want to wait for a phone call decided to drive in 
with their earthquake damage claims. 
</P>
<P>
 The 11-story building was closed, with panes of glass shattered all over the 
building, but in the parking lot, a cardboard sign reading "Customers" had been 
taped up. It directed people to a dozen claims adjusters set up at tables in 
the parking lot, processing claims and handing out bottled water in the hot 
sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven floors up in the darkened headquarters building, 20th Century's chief 
executive, Neil H. Ashley, said he expected the company's earthquake damage 
claims to come in comfortably under the $100-million reinsurance earthquake 
limit that it has through Lloyd's of London and other European insurers. Malls 
Tally Losses 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California retailers swept up broken glass and sorted through jumbled 
merchandise. While some stores were able to open, most major malls, which 
employ thousands of people, remained closed in the hard-hit swath from the San 
Fernando Valley to West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The crumpled Northridge Fashion Mall was not expected to reopen for weeks, and 
several others -- including Topanga Plaza, Sherman Oaks Galleria and Sherman 
Oaks Fashion Square -- were still assessing the destruction. Damage estimates 
were not yet available. 
</P>
<P>
 Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza was closed Tuesday and was not expected to reopen 
until Thursday or Friday, general manager Joseph Rouzan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Westside Pavilion sustained glass and water damage, but may reopen today or 
Thursday. The parking garage behind the Robinsons-May store has visible cracks 
and will remain closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale Galleria reopened Tuesday, but mall officials closed an older parking 
structure that represented more than half the mall's parking space. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Center had significant glass breakage and some water damage, but "the 
building seems to have come through in pretty good shape," said Don Trefry, 
general manager of the 170-store mall. "We're shooting to reopen by the end of 
the week." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Good Guys said five of its 23 consumer electronics stores remained 
closed in Southern California as workers cleaned up. Many of the stores, which 
each carry more than $1.25 million in inventory, lost goods in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 And every day a store is closed means the loss of about $33,000 in sales, a 
typical day's take, company officials said. Most of that loss is covered by 
business-interruption insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, all told, the company expects its total losses to amount to about 
$400,000 before taxes. Plight of Small Business 
</P>
<P>
 Small businesses often do not have the luxury of insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, Steve Yang and his wife, Christine, opened Phoenicia Liquor 
Jr. Market in Northridge with a $100,000 loan. The Yangs, who emigrated from 
South Korea 10 years ago, wanted to own a business in a quiet neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the sun rose Tuesday, Yang awakened in a car parked in front of the 
wrecked store, through which the quake had sent a river of liquor gushing into 
the street. Yang, 34, had spent the night in his car with two friends to guard 
against looters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need some help!" Christine Yang said. The Yangs don't have earthquake 
insurance and probably lost $30,000 in inventory. "We have to make home 
payment, rent for store. We have to do something." 
</P>
<P>
 Not far away, Jean-Yves Etesse wore hiking boots as he crunched through layers 
of broken glass strewn over the floor of his Northridge pasta restaurant, 
California Cucina. A few of his 40 employees showed up for work and salvaged 
what they could of the frozen meat and other perishables. 
</P>
<P>
 The damage was extensive: A $7,000 cappuccino machine had been torn from the 
wall. Bottles of fine Italian wine had been hurled as far as 20 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Etesse, who opened the restaurant just four months ago with about $250,000, 
acknowledged that he had gambled by starting a business in the midst of a 
recession. "I thought it would do good," he said. "But now I think it was the 
biggest mistake of my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Owners of stores on Santa Monica's trendy Third Street Promenade, meanwhile, 
scrambled to repair heavy exterior damage up and down the street. Front-end 
loaders and other construction machinery drowned out conversation at the 
outdoor cafes, while passers-by strolled and gawked in the sunny 80-degree 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
 Though gas service was restored by midday, business owners in Santa Monica 
fretted about the economic effects of the partial closure of the Santa Monica 
Freeway Banks Dig Out 
</P>
<P>
 As power was restored to more branches, banks continued to bring their 
automated teller machines back on line and open branches in affected areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank of America said about 90% of its 280 branches in Los Angeles County were 
open Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In South-Central Los Angeles, the main office of Founders National Bank -- the 
only black-owned commercial bank in the city -- sustained heavy structural 
damage.  
</P>
<P>
 President Carlton Jenkins, dressed in jeans and sitting in an office littered 
with fallen plaques, estimated that the bank suffered between $250,000 and 
$500,000 in damage. The two-story building may be a total loss: The bank didn't 
have earthquake insurance because the policy was too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, employees were loading computers and other office equipment into 
trucks so they could be taken to one of the bank's three other branches. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the disturbances of '92, the place was untouched," Jenkins said. "We 
tended to look at the building as being invincible and not subject to the wrath 
of the Almighty." 
</P>
<P>
 At Wilshire Boulevard and Beverly Drive, the windows of the Union Bank 
building were pasted with red stickers that read, "Unsafe: Do Not Enter." At 
the top of the seven-story building, a water tower had toppled and was poking 
through the side of the structure, attracting stares. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been closed for safety reasons right now," said Stephen Johnson, a Union 
Bank spokesman, who said eight other bank branches in Los Angeles were also 
closed for damage. He said most of the branches will reopen in the next two 
weeks. Taking on Hazardous Duty 
</P>
<P>
 For some companies, cleaning up meant more than sweeping up broken glass. 
</P>
<P>
 By Tuesday morning, the Southern Pacific Railroad had reclaimed sulfuric acid 
that spilled from one of 64 train cars that derailed on SP's Coast Line route 
near Northridge and had begun soil remediation efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, cargo spilled from only one of 16 tank cars carrying sulfuric 
acid and equipped with special couplers and protective shields to minimize 
punctures. 
</P>
<P>
 For its part, Atlantic Richfield Co. will have to pay for damage caused by 
leaks from one of its oil pipelines in the San Fernando Valley and in Santa 
Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 By Tuesday, the oil company had fielded 200 workers to clean up a spill of 
3,500 barrels -- 147,000 gallons -- of crude oil, about 2,900 to 3,000 barrels 
of which created a slick along the entire 12-mile length of the Santa Clara 
River. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the oil caught fire and burned 17 cars and four houses near San 
Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 The company had no estimate of its liability, but spokesman Al Greenstein 
said, "It'll be expensive."

 Borland Earnings Plunge: Borland International Inc. reported fiscal 
third-quarter earnings more than 80% below analysts' expectations.For the 
quarter ended Dec. 31, the Scotts Valley, Calif.-based computer software 
company posted net income of $418,000, or 2 cents a share, contrasted with a 
net loss of $61.3 million, or $2.34 a share, in the year-ago quarter. Last 
year's results included a onetime charge of $34.8 million for restructuring 
that included 350 layoffs and an inventory write-down. Revenue rose 7.1% to 
$111.7 million, from $104.3 million in the year-ago period.

 Chrysler Recalling New Pickups: The auto maker said about 17,800 Dodge Rams 
from the early 1994 model year are being recalled to fix a defective seat 
latch. A rivet in the seat latch mechanism could deform and allow the seat back 
to tilt forward in an accident, reducing passenger protection, Chrysler Corp. 
spokesman Lee Sechler said. No accidents or injuries have been reported because 
of the condition, discovered during company evaluations.

 McDonald's to Buy Back $1 Billion in Stock: The world's largest restaurant 
chain said it plans to buy back the common stock during the next three years, 
primarily using excess cash flow."We believe that common share repurchase is an 
excellent means of improving returns for common shareholders and have 
repurchased $2.2 billion of our common stock over the past 10 years," said Jack 
M. Greenberg, vice chairman and chief financial officer. The announcement comes 
at a time when shares of McDonald's Corp. have been hovering near their record 
of $59.125, set Dec. 1. McDonald's stock rose 62.5 cents Tuesday to $57.50 on 
the NYSE.

 Lilly to Divest Nine Subsidiaries: Eli Lilly & Co. said it will divest its 
medical devices and diagnostics operations to focus on its core pharmaceuticals 
business.Seven of the nine units are located in California. The final form of 
the divestiture has not been resolved, but the Indianapolis-based firm 
envisions forming a holding company for six of its medical device and 
diagnostic units, then spinning it off to shareholders in the next year through 
a public offering. Three remaining units will be sold separately. The move, 
along with a previously announced early-retirement program, will result in a 
$1.2-billion charge taken in the fourth quarter of 1993.

EARNINGS: CHRYSLER ANNOUNCES RECORD QUARTERLY PROFIT OF $777 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD W. NAUSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chrysler Corp., adding an exclamation point to the resurgence of the U.S. 
automobile industry, reported record fourth-quarter earnings Tuesday, as 
vehicle sales soared and operating costs declined. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which was on the brink of bankruptcy four years ago, reported net 
income of $777 million for the last three months of 1993. Before taxes and 
special charges, Chrysler earned $3.8 billion in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an exceptional year," Chairman Robert Eaton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrysler is the smallest of the Big Three but also the hottest. Its market 
share is now nearly 15% -- the highest proportion in 23 years. The company was 
the star of the recent auto show in Detroit, where it unveiled several new 
models. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. auto industry is emerging as the world's strongest. The restructuring 
of the last few years is beginning to pay off with improved product quality and 
world-class manufacturing efficiency, factors that are showing up on the bottom 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrysler's fourth-quarter earnings translate into $2.11 a share, far more than 
Wall Street's consensus estimate of $1.61 a share. The company earned $1.12 a 
share, or $356 million, in the equivalent period of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 While Chrysler had a net loss of $2.6 billion, or $7.62 a share, in 1993, that 
reflected accounting charges of $4.7 billion for retirees' medical benefits and 
$283 million for post-employment benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrysler earned $2.4 billion, or $6.77 a share, without the accounting 
charges. In 1992, it earned $723 million, or $2.21 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are phenomenal earnings," said Maryann Keller, an analyst for Furman 
Selz of New York. "Part of it is product-related and part of it is the 
economy." 
</P>
<P>
 Chrysler rose 75 cents, to an all-time high of $62.50 a share, on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 With revenue of $43.6 billion, the company sold 19% more vehicles last year 
than in 1992. Sales of minivans, LH mid-size sedans and Dodge Ram pickups were 
particularly strong. It has high hopes for new 1994 models aimed at import 
buyers: the low-priced Neon, the Cirrus and Dodge Stratus. 
</P>
<P>
 With sales up, Chrysler's profit margins have improved sharply. The company 
said its pretax earnings per car was $1,335 in 1993, compared to $325 in 1992. 
In the fourth-quarter, its profit margin was $1,727. 
</P>
<P>
 The main reason for the higher profit was lower cash rebates and other 
enticements given to buyers. The average incentive per car was $650 in the last 
quarter, compared to $1,020 a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Incentives are likely to drop further if the economy remains strong and 
consumers stay in a buying mood. Chrysler can also keep rebates to a minimum on 
new products coming to showrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Ford and General Motors, Chrysler has not been a major force 
internationally. But that may change in the coming years as it makes a push to 
export popular models to Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Chrysler's international sales totaled 105,849 vehicles, up 45% 
from 1992. In Europe, it sold nearly 61,000 vehicles and could top 100,000 this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrysler also is trying to improve its quality rankings. Company officials 
acknowledge that this is their No. 1 priority.

CBS HAS WON U.S. BROADCAST RIGHTS TO 1998 WINTER GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LIPPMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 CBS will announce today that it has won the U.S. broadcast rights for the 1998 
Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan, industry sources said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS emerged the winner after Fox Broadcasting Co., the other contender for the 
TV rights, declined to bid, a source said. Fox had been seriously weighing a 
bid for the 1998 Winter Olympics in the wake of its surprise $1.58-billion 
winning bid for a new NFL contract. 
</P>
<P>
 One observer said Fox's commitment to the NFL, where analysts expect it to 
lose between $600 million and $700 million over the course of the four-year 
contract, probably played a role in Fox backing away from the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 A considerable amount of prestige was at stake for CBS. With the NFL headed to 
the upstart fourth network, CBS faced the unwelcome prospect of seeing its 
sports franchise erode even further if it did not have a big-ticket item such 
as the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC and NBC had already dropped out of the bidding, saying it had become too 
costly. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said CBS will pay about $350 million for the broadcast rights, 
signaling that TV fees for the now biannual event continue to escalate. During 
the 1980s, the networks lost hundreds of millions of dollars on the NFL, Major 
League Baseball and the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS Chief Executive Laurence Tisch will reportedly make the announcement in 
New York along with officials from the International Olympic Committee, which 
awards the TV rights. A spokesperson for CBS declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Olympics in recent years have turned into a financial quagmire for the 
networks, and each time the networks vow to hold the line on TV rights fees. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS said it broke even on the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France, for 
which it paid $243 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The network has also paid $300 million for the 1994 Winter Olympics scheduled 
for next month in Lillehammer, Norway. And NBC is paying $456 million for the 
1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 For the 16 days and nights of the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, CBS 
reportedly has already sold more than 85% of its advertising time. 
</P>
<P>
 The network has said it is about $50 million ahead of where it was five months 
before the 1992 Albertville Games. On top of the rights fees, the network must 
field an army of producers and technicians halfway around the globe to cover 
the event. The production tab can exceed $70 million.

for the period, although earnings would have been about $4.50 a share without 
the charge, the company said in a statement. Drug industry analysts estimated 
Lilly could realize $2 billion from the spinoff.

INSIDER TRADING CHARGES ELICIT 5TH GUILTY PLEA; CRIME: AT ISSUE ARE PROFITS 
FROM TIPS ABOUT THEN-PENDING MOTEL 6 TAKEOVER. CIVIL CASE NAMES 23 PEOPLE AS 
VIOLATORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters

<TEXT>
<P>
 The president of Greenwald Securities Trading Inc. pleaded guilty Tuesday to 
participating in a coast-to-coast insider trading ring that profited off shares 
of Motel 6 when it was a takeover target in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, six defendants have been named in criminal charges growing out of the 
scheme, and 23 others have been named in a related civil case brought by the 
Securities and Exchange Commission -- the most defendants ever named in an SEC 
insider trading case. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants in the SEC case could be liable for more than $10 million in 
fines and penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Greenwald, 33, a lawyer who heads the Wall Street investment firm 
bearing his name, was charged with one criminal count of conspiracy. He could 
be sentenced to up to five years in prison and fined more than $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenwald was also accused of trading in shares of Norton Co., which received 
a tender offer from BTR in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. David Meister said the amount of money Greenwald made 
from the scheme has not been made public and that the investigation is 
continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas-based Motel 6, a nationwide chain of economy motels, was acquired by 
Accor, a French hotel and tourism company, in August, 1990. Before the 
takeover, Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Co. owned the majority of Motel 6 through 
various partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 12, 1990, Accor announced it would buy Motel 6 for $22.50 a share, 
almost $6 over the previous day's closing price on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the defendants in the SEC civil case is former Motel 6 executive Hugh 
Thrasher. 
</P>
<P>
 Others charged in the criminal case are John Anderson, owner of Sun Days 
Tanning Centers, a Beverly Hills tanning parlor chain; Gregg Shawzin, owner of 
Futures-Link Inc., a Beverly Hills commodities brokerage firm, and Jeffrey 
Sanker, a Los Angeles nightclub promoter. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenwald was the fifth criminal defendant to plead guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC alleges that Thrasher had tipped a dying friend, Carl Harris, about 
the pending takeover in order to "bestow a gift" on him. Harris, who has since 
died, tipped others, including Shawzin, who passed the information on to 
Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 The criminal charges allege that the Motel 6 trades generated more than $1.1 
million in accounts, which Anderson shared or controlled.

PROFIT REPORTS PUSH STOCKS MOSTLY HIGHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Market Overview * Corporate earnings took the spotlight Tuesday, pushing 
stocks mostly higher, although blue-chip issues ended unchanged at the previous 
session's record high. 
</P>
<P>
 * Treasury bond yields drifted lower, pushing up prices on pent-up demand from 
investors who had refrained from purchasing bonds in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 * The dollar declined across the board in largely technical trading on world 
currency markets. Stocks  
</P>
<P>
 Caught in a cross-fire of profit taking and strength in economically sensitive 
stocks, the Dow Jones industrial average matched its record of 3,870.29, set 
Monday, while advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 4 to 3 on the New 
York Stock Exchange. Big Board volume was an active 309.73 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nasdaq index edged up 0.84 of a point to 793.02, surpassing its record 
closing high of 792.31 set Jan. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last two hours (Nasdaq stocks) started sneaking on the upside. But it was 
not much of a rip-roaring day," said Bob Padala of Donaldson, Lufkin & 
Jenrette. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth-quarter profit reports from the nation's companies began in earnest 
this week, and on Tuesday the market was flooded with word of records from the 
likes of Chrysler and Chase Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
 But while Chrysler rose 3/4 to 62 1/2 and Chase rose 3/8 to 35 7/8, Wells 
Fargo slipped 2 3/8 to 133 3/4, Chemical Banking dropped 1 to 40 1/2 and Banc 
One fell 7/8 to 36 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 James Solloway, director of research at Argus Research Corp., attributed the 
lack of investor interest in financial shares, despite solid earnings, to the 
shift away from interest-sensitive issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Since October, 1990, the industrial average has risen steadily, driven 
principally by an unprecedented decline in interest rates. Long-term rates, at 
about 6%, are the lowest since the Treasury began issuing 30-year bonds in 
1977. 
</P>
<P>
 Low interest rates encourage stock investors because they cut the cost of 
money to companies and makes share prices more appealing. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, analysts say that as the economic recovery gathers steam, rates may 
have reached their bottom and the focus is shifting to corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
 "The better earnings are driving the market now," said William LeFevre, senior 
market analyst at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * The players in the bidding war for Paramount Communications were active 
again after Viacom sweetened its bid for the media giant. Paramount rose up 1 
1/4 to 80, while QVC Network lost 1/2 to 43 in Nasdaq trading. Viacom Class B 
stock fell 1 3/8 to 37 3/4 on the American Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Economically sensitive, or cyclical stocks, have been the catalyst for the 
market's most recent run into record ground. On Tuesday, International Paper 
rose 1 7/8 to 74 3/8 and W.R. Grace rose 1 to 42 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Chemical Waste Management gained 5/8 to 11 after Prudential Securities 
upgraded the stock. 
</P>
<P>
 * Eli Lilly, which announced that it will divest its medical devices and 
diagnostics operations to focus on its core pharmaceutical business, rose 1 5/8 
to 61 1/2. * Cott lost 2 1/8 to 24 7/8 after Mabon Nugent cut a rating on the 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
 * Genzyme rose 3 1/4 to 34, although the company said there was no news to 
push the stock higher. 
</P>
<P>
 * BMC Software fell 2 3/8 to 60 7/8. The company acquired software developer 
Patrol Software and its Australian affiliate for $33.7 million in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks ended mixed abroad, with the Mexico City's Bolsa index rising 50.29 
points to 2,556.62, bolstered by hopes the conflict in Chiapas would be 
resolved soon, traders said. In Tokyo, the key 225-share Nikkei average closed 
at 18,514.55, down 210.82 points, while London's Financial Times 100-share 
average rose 29.2 points to 3,437.0. Germany's 30-share DAX average ended at 
2,113.84, down 23.54 points. Other Markets  
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury's main 30-year bond yield fell to 6.26% from 6.29%. Prices, which 
move in the opposite direction, rose 9/32 point, or $2.81 per $1,000 in face 
value. 
</P>
<P>
 The government securities market was closed Monday for the Martin Luther King 
Jr. holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last year, many investors were worried that bond prices had little room 
to rise further after a powerful yearlong rally. But a price surge in early 
1994 has drawn many sidelined investors with money to spend back to the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Also lending strength to the Treasury market were purchases by cities and 
states seeking to stow proceeds from recent municipal bond sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Treasury traders also found encouragement in a decline in key commodity 
prices.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in currency trading, the dollar opened on a relatively strong note 
as trading resumed after Monday's holiday. But the upward move ran out of steam 
later in the day. 
</P>

 Trump Says He Won't Buy Vegas Casino: Developer Donald Trump said he has 
changed his mind about buying the Aladdin Hotel to enter the Las Vegas gaming 
market."The number we were discussing was $51 million, but we thought that was 
a high number," he said. "We have no interest in the Aladdin." A top Trump 
executive, Dennis Gomes, said earlier this month that Trump was on the verge of 
buying the casino. Another Trump source had told Associated Press that Trump 
had made a verbal agreement with the hotel's owner to buy it for $65 million. 
Trump denied that. The owner, Bell Atlantic-Tricon Leasing Corp., said the 
casino will be sold through a sealed-bid auction.

 Oracle Corp. Postpones Demonstration: After months of planning and an 
approximate $1-million investment, disappointed officials of Oracle Corp. 
postponed a shindig planned for Tuesday night at CBS television studios on 
Beverly Blvd. The company had planned to demonstrate new interactive services 
before several hundred invited guests and by satellite to London, Tokyo, 
Washington and New York. Although the CBS facility held up well in the quake, 
Oracle, a database software company, figured it should reschedule the event 
later "in deference to the city and the tragedy that has befallen it," a 
spokeswoman said.

 Intel Earnings Jump: Intel Corp. said strong demand from the personal computer 
market sent fourth-quarter earnings up 38% over the year-ago period.Intel, the 
leading independent maker of microprocessors, said net income rose to $594 
million, or $1.35 a share, from $429 million, or 99 cents, in the year-earlier 
period. Revenue jumped 28% to $2.39 billion, from $1.86 billion. The earnings 
were 4 cents shy of the mean estimate of $1.39 a share from 27 analysts polled 
by the Institutional Brokers Estimate System. Intel said the results were hurt 
by "heavier than usual start-up costs for chip factories in California and 
Ireland."

EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; TRUCKERS GET GOODS MOVING AGAIN; COMMERCE: 
DRIVERS FIGURE OUT ALTERNATE ROADS AROUND CLOSED FREEWAYS. REROUTING SHIPMENTS 
MAY DRIVE UP PRICE OF PRODUCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ and JESUS SANCHEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shipments of fruit, gasoline, household furniture, clothing and other products 
moved fairly smoothly through the Southland on Tuesday, although the crippling 
of major freeways caused some delays while many damaged businesses couldn't 
receive deliveries, transportation officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices for fresh produce could rise later this year as the region becomes more 
dependent on shipments from the Central Valley, which may become more costly 
because of road closures, some officials warned. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Southland's massive transportation network flexed its muscles for the 
first time following Monday's devastating temblor, there were some delays 
reported as truckers scrambled for alternate routes and the region's major 
railroads labored to restore service. 
</P>
<P>
 Union Pacific, Santa Fe and Southern Pacific railroads were all expected to 
resume full service by this afternoon, including Southern Pacific's Coast Line 
route, which was closed when the earthquake derailed a 64-car freight train 
near the quake's epicenter in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Truckers, meanwhile, exchanged notes "via CB radio or face to face at truck 
stops . . . to determine the best way to navigate around and through the 
affected areas," said Paula Riebe, a spokeswoman for Allied Van Lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Their biggest headache was the closure of Interstate 5 north of Los Angeles. 
The freeway is the main artery between Southern California and the central 
farming regions, Northern California and the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
 The truckers' option of choice appeared to be driving from the Los Angeles 
area east to San Bernardino, where they took Interstate 15 north over the Cajon 
Pass, joined U.S. 395 and then crossed back west over the Tehachapi Mountains 
to rejoin Interstate 5 or U.S. 99 near Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlantic Richfield Co., whose roughly 500 gasoline stations in greater Los 
Angeles are served by 45 delivery trucks that are loaded in South Gate, used 
that route for its deliveries to the Antelope Valley, said spokeswoman Annie 
Reutinger. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not even behind one load for the places that are open," she said, 
noting that about 15 Arco stations remain closed because of quake damage, most 
in the San Fernando Valley. "The ones that are open are full." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the day presented a host of problems for truckers. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenge for the drivers and dispatchers at Qwikway Trucking Co. was to 
move a backlog of freight from Monday and maneuver around closed freeways and 
other obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody wants their deliveries first," said Qwikway dispatcher Reyes M. 
Gonzales, who had to do without four big rig drivers whose homes had been 
damaged. "These are going to be trying times." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the Qwikway drivers who did show up at the company's Vernon terminal 
were reluctant to travel to the San Fernando and Antelope valleys, where trucks 
faced long delays as a result of streets closures and the partial shut down of 
I-5. Gonzales had to cancel one shipment of fabric to a Lancaster cloth store 
after drivers refused to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "Forget about it. How are you going to get there?" one driver told Gonzales. 
</P>
<P>
 But overall, certain factors worked in favor of the shipping companies Tuesday 
-- factors that probably won't last long, some transport operators said. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, they noted that traffic in general was light Tuesday, as many 
people eschewed work and many businesses stayed closed. Several grocery, mall 
and department stores were among those closed because of quake damage, reducing 
the demand for supplies shipped by truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, for Qwikway driver Jose Leon, 28, it was the closure of damaged 
businesses that gave him more problems than blocked freeways. Leon was able to 
make only five of 13 scheduled deliveries in West Los Angeles when he found 
stores and entire malls -- including the Beverly Center, Westside Pavilion and 
Santa Monica Place -- closed. 
</P>
<P>
 At Crenshaw Plaza, where the quake had knocked out the freight elevators and 
caused widespread damage, Leon and his helper, Raul Jaime, lugged boxes through 
water stained hallways and up a stairway to a Kinney Shoe store, where 
employees were repairing displays and merchandise that had been knocked over.  
</P>
<P>
 At Santa Monica Place, Leon brought his 24-foot-long Ford truck to an abrupt 
halt when he saw the loading dock was flooded. Dumpsters and debris floated in 
the black water. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's it," said Leon, who is paid based on completed deliveries. "Now, I'm 
really mad. I should have stayed home today." 
</P>
<P>
 Produce deliveries, meanwhile, were aided by the fact that many crops 
currently sold in the Southland are shipped in from the Imperial and Coachella 
valleys and other points east and south that don't run into the section of I-5 
that's closed, said Barbara Buck, executive vice president of the Fresh Produce 
& Floral Council in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 But once Southern California's demand for crops from Central California rises 
this spring, the disruptions could result in higher prices and shortages, said 
Bill Garnett, president of Think Fresh Transport in Los Angeles, which uses its 
own fleet and outside truckers to deliver produce. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're going to see some (price) fluctuations, depending on where the harvest 
is and the commodity," Garnett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Using the alternate routes to travel north from Los Angeles add at least two 
hours to a trip to Central California and, in some cases, make the trip 
unprofitable for the trucker, Garnett said. That means truckers likely will 
have to charge the farmers and wholesalers more for some crops, and those 
additional costs could be passed on to consumers, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, just getting through Los Angeles' city limits proved a challenge 
for United Parcel Service. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're rerouting through surface streets where we can," said spokesman Susan 
Rosenberg at the company's Atlanta headquarters. UPS also was working out 
alternative drop-off and pickup points for customers who needed to tend to 
damaged property, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 And some Allied Van Lines drivers arrived in the Los Angeles area Monday and 
Tuesday only to find they couldn't reach their customers to deliver or pick up 
their belongings. "They're in the area, sort of in a holding pattern for the 
next couple of days," said Allied's Riebe. 
</P>
<P>
 Riebe said one Allied customer in Chatsworth -- who was very close to the 
quake's epicenter -- was scheduled to have her goods picked up Monday for a 
move to Washington state. That's now on hold. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Allied movers already had packed all of her belongings on Saturday. 
So while the woman's neighbors sustained heavy property damage, Riebe said, "as 
best as we can tell none of her possessions were damaged because they were all 
packed."

PRUDENTIAL SETTLES TEXAS CASE, TO PAY $1.5 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prudential Securities Inc. agreed Tuesday to pay $1.5 million in fines and 
temporarily suspend business in Texas to settle state securities law 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas was the lone holdout last October when state and federal securities 
regulators announced a $371-million settlement with Prudential.The agreement 
resolved charges that predecessor firm Prudential-Bache deceived investors in 
its sale of limited partnerships in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement with the Texas Securities Board, Prudential will pay a 
fine of $1 million, in addition to a $500,000 fine that was Texas' share of the 
October agreement. Prudential also agreed not to solicit new accounts from its 
Dallas office for 20 days and not to solicit new accounts elsewhere in Texas 
for a concurrent five-day period. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardwick Simmons, president and chief executive of Prudential Securities, said 
the sanctions do not affect the day-to-day operations of some 90,000 existing 
accounts in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most importantly, this agreement with Texas means all 50 states are now 
parties to our global settlement and allows us to move forward with the 
business of the firm," Simmons said in a statement.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: MUNI BONDHOLDERS STAND FIRM IN SHAKE OF QUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The mammoth California municipal bond market, which has weathered disaster 
after disaster (natural and man-made) for four years, is so far shrugging off 
the Southland quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond traders reported little activity in the California muni market Tuesday, 
the first post-quake trading day because Monday was a holiday. Despite fears 
that damage costs, broken freeways and broken lives will sink the Southland 
further into recession--worsening the already weak financial condition of state 
and local government--muni owners aren't in a mood to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 Why not? Most investors probably can think of two logical reasons not to part 
with their California tax-free muni bonds or bond mutual funds: 
</P>
<P>
 * Belying the worst recession since the 1930s, there have been few defaults in 
recent years among the hundreds of California government entities that have 
issued bonds for public works and other projects. Simply put, bond issuers have 
honored their debts, and most people who have sold munis since 1989 betting 
otherwise have erred. Thus, one more disaster "is like old hat to this market 
by now," says Bill Loring, manager of the Colonial California Tax-Free bond 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, only four California muni issues worth a total of $56 million 
actually stopped making interest payments to bondholders, according to Zane 
Mann, publisher of the California Municipal Bond Advisor newsletter in Palm 
Springs. In a total California muni market worth an estimated $130 billion, 
those defaults were barely a blip. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, bond-rating services say that so far, they've identified few 
Southland muni issues that are at risk because the buildings (such as 
courthouses) or other projects that were financed by the bonds were harmed by 
the Northridge quake. "Damage in most instances is not substantial, as far as 
we can tell," says Amy Doppelt, analyst at rating agency Fitch Investors 
Service in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 * With the rise in federal tax rates last year, tax-free muni bonds make more 
economic sense than ever for many investors. The Vanguard California Tax-Free 
Insured bond fund, for example, currently yields about 4.7%, annualized. For a 
California couple in the combined federal-state marginal tax bracket of at 
least 34.7% (taxable income of $61,241 or more), that 4.7% is equivalent to a 
taxable yield of at least 7.2%. It isn't easy to find 7%-plus yields anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 Something else may be encouraging California bond investors to sit tight, as 
well: the idea that bad news can actually be good news. After all, in the wake 
of south Florida's killer hurricane in 1992, the rebuilding boom there pumped 
hundreds of millions of dollars into the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, if quake victims buy new goods to replace what was destroyed, 
they'll boost sales tax revenue; if they rebuild, they'll create construction 
jobs and thus new income tax revenue. Either way, state and local coffers may 
take in more money, short-term, than expected. Anything that strengthens the 
finances of bond issuers gives investors more confidence to hold the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, investors' currently sanguine view of the California muni market may 
not last. For one thing, Gov. Pete Wilson's proposed state budget for the next 
fiscal year, beginning July 1, is balanced now only because he's counting on 
massive (and doubtful ) federal aid to pay for illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 As we get further into budget-wrangling season and the state's share of 
emergency costs for the Southland quake mushrooms, bond owners may begin to 
fear again for the financial health of the state and of cities, counties and 
other entities that will eventually feel the state's fiscal pain--perhaps with 
deeper budget cuts than last year's. 
</P>
<P>
 And if that happens against the backdrop of rising market interest rates this 
spring because of the strong U.S. economy, the state's muni bonds could suffer 
a double whammy: They would drop in price first because of credit-quality 
concerns and second because higher market interest rates automatically clip the 
value of all older bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 It's important to remember that the muni market now is very dependent on 
individuals, through their direct holdings and via mutual funds. Other muni 
owners, such as banks, have faded as players. Thus, if individuals begin to 
sell, or simply stop buying, the market could hit a temporary vacuum. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What's a muni owner or potential buyer to do? First, just realize that the 
market may be a little too blase about the state's budget outlook. Some experts 
say investor optimism has pulled yields on the state's popular general 
obligation bonds down to levels that may be too low, relative to other bonds. 
With 25-year G.O. bonds paying about 5.4%, "These yields don't build in the 
ongoing credit worries about the state," argues one veteran Los Angeles muni 
trader. If you're hungry to buy, waiting a few months may pay off. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, you shouldn't own muni bonds or any bonds today unless you can answer 
some basic questions: Do you have a good feel for the issuer's financial 
health, if an individual bond? And no matter how attractive the yield you're 
earning, can you accept the idea of a loss of some principal (if only on paper) 
should the market temporarily turn against California bonds on credit concerns 
or because of a rise in market interest rates? Munis: The Big Picture 
</P>
<P>
 California, the biggest issuer of tax-free municipal bonds, is like other 
states now dependent on individual investors to buy and hold that debt--unlike 
10 years ago, when banks and insurance firms dominated the market. How muni 
ownership has changed since 1983: 
</P>
<P>
 Pct. of all munis owned: 03,18,07,07 Owner category 1983 1993 Households 31.5% 
39.4% Mutual funds 6.0 25.0 Insurance cos. 19.1 12.2 Bank trusts 6.5 8.4 
Banks/S&Ls 32.7 8.2 Closed-end funds 0 3.8 Other 4.2 3.0 Based on total dollar 
amount of bonds outstanding.

 As negotiators turn to a major unresolved issue in the global trade agreement 
that was otherwise completed last month, the Clinton Administration on Tuesday 
unveiled its primary approach to the talks and pressed Thailand to allow a 
greater foreign role in its booming financial services market. 
</P>
<P>
 Anxious to take advantage of the region's multiyear run of stunning growth, 
foreign investors are excitedly eyeing stock exchanges, banking opportunities 
and a variety of other investment prospects. Nearly all are now protected from 
foreign participation to one degree or another by government regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 "An efficient and open financial services industry helps further integrate 
both the regional and the global economy," Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen 
said in a speech to the Thai Bankers Assn. "From our perspective, that 
contributes to our goal to sustain growth, which in turn both creates jobs and 
enhances stability." 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen has made the goal of opening foreign markets to U.S. investors a 
central theme of a weeklong tour of Asia, which is now almost certain to 
include an expanded refueling stop in Japan on the way home Sunday, to allow 
him to meet with Japanese Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii. Bentsen would be the 
most senior member of the Administration to pressure Japanese officials face to 
face into making progress on the stalled trade framework talks, which carry a

 Reflecting the growing interest in investment opportunities in Asia, Bentsen 
has been talking with increasing optimism about the prospects for removing the 
19-year embargo that has prohibited U.S. companies from doing business in 
Vietnam. The embargo is a carry-over from the end of the Vietnam War and is 
intended to pressure the communist government in Hanoi into making a fuller 
accounting of the troops listed as missing in action or as prisoners of war. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking favorably about Vietnamese cooperation, reflected in upbeat reports 
from congressional delegations that have visited Vietnam, Bentsen said at a 
news conference that the movement toward lifting the embargo is "progressing 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 He met during the afternoon with Thailand's prime minister, Chuan Leekpai, and 
said afterward that the prime minister told him that in coming talks Thailand 
would "increase and improve its offer on financial services."  
</P>
<P>
 Efforts to remove regulations that stand as obstacles to cross-border 
operations by investment firms, banks and the insurance industry were 
unsuccessful in the final days of negotiations that rewrote the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The 117 nations that took part in the final 
talks in Geneva in December agreed to resume the financial services 
negotiations, with the goal of completing the outstanding segment before the 
global pact takes effect, expected on Jan. 1, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlining the approach the United States will pursue in the talks, Bentsen 
said Washington will seek "to open markets, not close ours." Thus, he said, the 
Administration stands ready "to guarantee full market access" to those 
countries giving American firms satisfactory access. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the United States will "negotiate constructively," avoiding any steps 
that would harm foreign companies already operating in the U.S. market. And he 
said the Administration will not try to block foreign companies from entering 
the U.S. financial services market. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, he said, while the United States seeks a multinational agreement 
treating all nations equally, "we cannot accept a situation in which other 
nations retain the right to discriminate against our firms while they are 
permitted to expand in our market." 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration is pushing for an opening of financial service business 
because it believes the United States has a competitive advantage in that area. 
And, in a world that depends on more than manufacturing to create wealth, 
financial services are expected to play a key role in national prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big world now, and emerging markets are especially important," a 
senior Treasury official said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a period of growth that is sluggish at best in Europe, Asia, with the 
exception of Japan, has continued to expand. The economy in Thailand, for 
example, grew 7.5% last year and averaged 10% annual growth the preceding three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Turning to one of the markets with some of the most lucrative potential, 
Bentsen is beginning a four-day visit to China today.  
</P>
<P>
 John S. Wadsworth, Jr., managing director of the Morgan Stanley Asia Ltd. 
office in Hong Kong, predicted that by the end of the decade, the fledgling 
Shanghai stock exchange will be the biggest in Asia, capitalized at $2 
trillion. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen began his day Tuesday by meeting privately with Wadsworth and the 
Asian representatives of such investment firms as Goldman Sachs and Citibank, 
hearing their complaints about the problems of doing business in the region and 
their expectations for future operations.

 The figure fell in 1993 for the first time in three years, but a record 60% of 
the cases were caused by recession, a private credit research organization 
said.Teikoku Data Bank Ltd. said bankruptcies by companies with liabilities of 
more than $90,000 fell 0.9% from a year earlier, to 14,041 cases. Of those, 
8,534 cases resulted from poor sales, slumping exports or other causes linked 
to Japan's 3-year-old recession, the bank said. Meanwhile, the number of 
bankruptcies caused by falling prices of land, stocks and securities fell 29.6% 
to 989.

The Australian newspaper reported.Finance Minister Ralph Willis will be 
empowered to grant exemptions to the wholesale income tax on computer and 
computer-related equipment owned by multinationals for at least nine months. On 
an ad-hoc basis, Cathay Pacific Airlines and computer concern Data General

BULLOCK'S STORE WILL PROBABLY BE RAZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 23-year-old Bullock's department store in Northridge Fashion Center, 
reduced to little more than a pile of rubble by Monday morning's earthquake, 
will likely be demolished, experts said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 If the store is rebuilt, construction costs could run up to $28 million, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost to replace damaged or destroyed merchandise inside the store was not 
known. But even if the rebuilding process were to go smoothly, with no legal or 
zoning delays, it would take six to eight months to reopen the store. That 
would mean millions of dollars in lost revenue for Los Angeles-based Bullock's 
and its parent, R. H. Macy & Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like it's going to have to be completely rebuilt," said Dave Keim, a 
principal building inspector with the Los Angeles Building and Safety 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The department store was completed in 1971, before enactment of stiff building 
codes prompted by the devastating Sylmar earthquake that year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, you couldn't build this building exactly the way it was," said 
Franklin Lew, a state building inspector from Contra Costa County who looked 
over the Northridge Bullock's on Tuesday in an information-gathering effort. In 
addition to rebuilding within current seismic codes, he said, other features 
such as access for the handicapped and improved energy conservation would have 
to be included. 
</P>
<P>
 Conforming to current earthquake codes would probably account for about 2% of 
the total construction cost, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The department store might have collapsed, Lew said, because the tile walls 
used in some buildings of that era tended not to be attached securely enough to 
the floor and roof. Also, he said, the precast concrete used does not tend to 
allow the steel and other metal in buildings to stretch during an earthquake -- 
causing something referred to as "brittle failure." 
</P>
<P>
 Lew said he saw similar problems in buildings destroyed during the 1989 Bay 
Area earthquake and the 1964 Anchorage, Alaska, earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The architecture firm Ellerbe Becket Inc., which designed the building, could 
not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Merle Goldstone, a spokeswoman for Bullock's, which owns the building, would 
not comment on the extent of the damage or the retailer's plans. She said a 
statement would be issued by the company today. "At this point, we're just 
trying to assess things." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldstone also declined to say if Bullock's has earthquake or other insurance 
that would cover costs of the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Edwards with GAB Business Services, an adjuster for Macy, was outside 
Bullock's on Tuesday, but said he didn't know what the company's insurance 
would cover. He said he couldn't even get inside the building to inspect the 
damage, but noted that the destruction appeared to be "the worst I've seen." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Holmes, a San Francisco structural engineer who inspected the collapsed 
store for the structures reconnaissance team of the Earthquake Research 
Institute, a private organization of engineers, seismologists and geologists, 
said the 190,000-square-foot store would probably cost between $100 and $150 
per square foot to rebuild, or a total of up to $28 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an expensive loss, that's for sure," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scores of gawkers with video and still cameras lined the sidewalk outside the 
mall, and cars slowing for passengers to look at the toppled store caused 
traffic tie-ups on Tampa Avenue. A few police officers even stopped to have 
their pictures taken in front of the store. 
</P>
<P>
 The building itself was a tangled mass of steel and concrete, with large parts 
of the second and third floors caved in. From a short distance, a jumble of red 
Bullock's shopping bags could be seen inside. The only merchandise visible was 
in a cabinet, teetering on the edge next to where the second floor fell in, 
containing pots and pans and marked with the sign "Tools of the Trade." 
</P>
<P>
 Concrete and drywall lay on the sidewalk outside, where the falling debris had 
knocked down trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge Fashion Center General Manager Lloyd Miller could not be reached 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The mall remained closed Tuesday while the extent of damage to the shops was 
being evaluated. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Bullock's and areas of the mall parking lots were the only structures 
that collapsed, other parts of the shopping center -- which also houses J. C. 
Penney, Sears, Broadway and two Robinson's-May department stores -- also 
sustained some damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The mall is one of the most financially successful shopping centers in 
Southern California. With total retail sales of $337 million, it was the fifth 
largest mall in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura 
counties in 1990, the last year for which figures are available from the State 
Board of Equalization. 
</P>
<P>
 But John Lyda, development director at Topanga Plaza in Canoga Park, where 
stores will be closed for between two weeks and three months while repairs are 
made, said the earthquake couldn't have come at a worse time for retailers. 
</P>
<P>
 "These poor people have weathered the recession. Now there's this 
catastrophe," he said.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; BEING PREPARED ISN'T ALWAYS ENOUGH; SHORTAGES: 
ONE MAN PLANNED AHEAD. BUT DISASTER PUTS HIM IN LINE WITH OTHERS, WAITING HOURS 
FOR NEEDED ITEMS.

<P>
 If there was ever a man prepared for an earthquake, it was James De Witt. 
</P>
<P>
 A camper sat in the driveway of his Northridge home filled with camping gear, 
street maps, bottled water, cans of soup and a first aid kit. In a box near his 
bed waited a cellular phone, a shortwave radio, two flashlights and extra 
batteries. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the end, it was all for naught: After Monday's earthquake, a fire broke 
out in his neighbor's house and his camper went up in flames, as did most of 
the house next door. 
</P>
<P>
 So on Tuesday, De Witt, his wife and 10-year-old son were no better off than 
the others who sat in idling cars at a Canoga Park gas station -- one of dozens 
of long lines that sprouted up throughout the San Fernando Valley as residents 
sought fuel, bottled water, plywood, baby formula and other items the day after 
a deadly quake left many communities devastated, and with contaminated tap 
water and only sporadic electricity. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortages abounded and the watchword for the day was patience, especially for 
James De Witt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was kind've kicking myself after it happened," he said. "But I guess I just 
didn't plan well enough, so I have to start over . . . and be patient."  
</P>
<P>
 At a nearby hardware store, people waited in a line that stretched across the 
parking lot to the street for a particularly hot item -- an 18-inch piece of 
flexible copper tubing used for hot water heaters. The rattling of the 
6.6-earthquake caused many of the pipes to break loose, rendering the heaters 
inoperable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I called around to 10 or 12 stores, and there's probably only about four 
plumbing stores open in the whole Valley, and most of them are totally sold out 
of them," said 46-year-old Don Wyatt of Chatsworth, who stood near the head of 
the line. "Today, these things are like gold." 
</P>
<P>
 At some stores, customers waited for up to two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had to wait a long time," said Maria Cisneros, a 25-year-old Northridge 
resident cradling her 2-year-old daughter outside a supermarket in North Hills. 
"But we really need diapers. All day yesterday, I had to use napkins because 
none of the stores were open. Napkins don't work so well." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, I know," said Peggy Brister, who stood several places in line behind 
Cisneros holding a baby of her own. "I'm down to tissues." 
</P>
<P>
 But the most sought-after items were also the hardest to find. The store had 
sold out of diapers, but the women agreed to look together using Brister's car. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with stories of unselfishness and sharing came stories of greed and 
price gouging. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose Castaneda, an aide to Rep. Howard Berman (D-Panorama City), said her son 
went out Tuesday to buy a copper tube for the family's hot water heater. He was 
told the item, which usually goes for $5.98 to $8.98, was being sold for $30. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked why the store was charging so much, a merchant replied: "Earthquake 
prices." 
</P>
<P>
 By far the longest lines were at the pumps. 
</P>
<P>
 An Arco station at Winnetka Avenue and Roscoe Boulevard opened at 6 a.m. to a 
line of waiting cars. By 9 a.m., cars snaked out of the parking lot and spilled 
out onto Roscoe Boulevard, creating a long line of traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 The place was so busy, station manager Albino Cesar feared he would sell out 
of his 50,000 gallons of fuel before everyone was able to fill up. 
</P>
<P>
 And Cesar's customers carried looks of desperation, although they did their 
best to be polite. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every place I've been, they've been closed," said Alfonso Longobardi, a 
22-year-old U.S. Air Force mechanic who was being transferred from Point Mugu 
to San Diego. "When I ran out of gas back down the road, I hitchhiked up here 
to fill my can. Everyone's been real nice. I just hope the guy is nice enough 
to give me a ride back too." 
</P>
<P>
 Across the street, things weren't going so well at a Mobil station. Although 
electricity in the area had been restored, the computer system controlling the 
gas pumps was a no-show, and people stared longingly at the dormant pumps. 
</P>
<P>
 So many people, in fact, that prospective customers turned Winnetka Avenue 
into a parking lot, mirroring the situation at the station across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be pumping any minute," station manager Joe Barney promised a woman, 
ever mindful of the rival station. 
</P>
<P>
 Privately however, he conceded: "It may take a minute, it may take an hour . . 
. I wish it would happen soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Nodding to the traffic jam his enterprise had created, he added: "After all, 
this is my dream." 
</P>
<P>
 Across the Valley in Sylmar, where a good deal of quake damage occurred, Sam 
Ajian expressed a similar sentiment. While his mini-mart was the only 
convenience store open within several miles, the lack of electricity to power 
his huge walk-in freezer left the place with a lot of tepid beer and the 
occasional impatient customer. 
</P>
<P>
 "What? Warm beer?" asked the man incredulously. "You're nuts. You should just 
close." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," Ajian said quietly, surveying the shop's tilting shelves and broken 
bottles. "I think I will, at least until things get back to normal." 
</P>

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; CREWS RACE TO CONTAIN OIL SPILL IN RIVER; SANTA 
CLARITA: A 15-MILE SLICK SPREADS AFTER PIPELINE BREAKS DURING JOLT. AREA IS 
HOME TO TWO ENDANGERED SPECIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Cleanup crews scrambled Tuesday to contain a 15-mile-long slick of crude oil 
that spilled into the Santa Clara River in Santa Clarita after a pipeline 
ruptured during Monday's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 147,000 gallons of crude poured from the 10-inch-wide pipeline 
before the spill was discovered about 8:30 a.m. Monday. There were no reports 
late Tuesday of deaths or injuries to birds or fish, but officials said it was 
too early to gauge the spill's effect on the river and its wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally you don't see (injuries to birds) in the first 24 hours," said Mary 
Gale, spokeswoman for the state Department of Fish and Game's office of oil 
spill prevention and response. 
</P>
<P>
 The stretch of river befouled by the spill is home to two endangered species 
-- a fish known as the three-spined unarmored stickleback and a songbird called 
the least Bell's vireo. The river is also home to wading birds and other 
wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 The pipeline is owned by Four Corners Pipe Line Co., a subsidiary of Arco. The 
line, used to transport oil from Kern County to several Los Angeles-area 
refineries, broke in nine places during the quake, an Arco official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two breaks within about 100 yards of one another caused the spill into the 
river. 
</P>
<P>
 Another break in the same line in San Fernando on Monday sparked a fire that 
destroyed 17 parked cars, damaged or destroyed four houses and severely burned 
a man passing by on his motorcycle, said Albert Greenstein, manager of media 
relations for Arco.  
</P>
<P>
 The pipeline was not pumping oil at the time of quake but held a residue of 
crude, Greenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 An Arco official estimated the spill at 3,500 barrels, or 147,000 gallons, of 
which about 3,000 barrels reached the river. The official said cleanup work 
could continue for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 200 workers hired by Arco were siphoning oil from the river and 
using earthen dams to contain the spill just south of the town of Piru in 
eastern Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very large oil spill," said Reed Smith, a Department of Fish and 
Game official. "It's a mess." 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's spill was not the first to stain this stretch of the Santa Clara 
River. In January, 1991, nearly 75,000 gallons of crude from a ruptured Mobil 
Oil pipeline polluted a 15-mile stretch of the river, killing at least 186 
birds, wildlife authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's heartbreaking that the river is taking another blow," said Cat Brown, a 
wildlife biologist for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. "The short-term and 
long-term effects of a spill this size could spell disaster for that area."  
</P>
<P>
 After the 1991 spill, Mobil contributed $200,000 to environmental projects to 
settle a criminal complaint arising from the spill. 
</P>

 Gale said she did not know if Arco might be liable for damages from the spill. 
"We're only a day and a half into it," she said. "I don't feel comfortable 
making a statement about . . . possible prosecution." 
</P>

 About 20 Department of Fish and Game staff were monitoring the cleanup. Some 
were dispatched from the nearby cleanup of McGrath Lake near the mouth of the 
Santa Clara River in Ventura County, where more than 80,000 gallons of oil 
spilled from a ruptured pipeline on Christmas Day.

CRICHTON'S 'DISCLOSURE'; HIS NEW PROTAGONIST IS A VICTIM OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT 
-- AND HE'S A GUY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH GETLIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael Crichton looks like a winner but feels like a dinosaur. 
</P>
<P>
 True, he stands to make millions from his new novel, "Disclosure," just as he 
did with "Jurassic Park," "Rising Sun" and other blockbusters. Yet to hear him 
talk, he and other freethinkers face extinction in a fight for survival with 
feminists and the pooh-bahs of political correctness. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's absolutely a chill in the workplace these days," Crichton says, 
picking lint off his Armani suit and scowling down at Central Park, 43 floors 
below his hotel suite. "Everyone talks about it and no one likes it. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't make any kind of a joke at work. You can't make any kind of a 
personal comment, and it has a little neo-Nazi flavor," he adds. "It's the 
thought police and people are unhappy. They're not going to put up with it." 
</P>
<P>
 This will come as news to those who battle gender-based job discrimination. 
But Crichton pulls no punches, blaming some women for most of the trouble. 
They've twisted modern feminism into a doctrine of special privilege, he 
claims, polluting relations between the sexes and putting everyone on edge. 
</P>
<P>
 At least that's the message of "Disclosure," a provocative story of sexual 
harassment and New Age computer high jinks that has Hollywood written all over 
it. Indeed, the book was recently sold to Warner Bros. for a whopping $3.5 
million, and it reads more like a script treatment than a novel. 
</P>
<P>
 Crichton's latest stars a ruthless woman who beats out her former lover for a 
coveted executive job. Savoring victory, she tries to destroy him by filing 
phony sex harassment charges. He fights back to clear his name. 
</P>
<P>
 The author says it took him eight weeks to write the first draft of 
"Disclosure" in a bungalow near his Santa Monica home. He's on tour to promote 
the book, but it's almost beside the point. Like John Grisham, he's one of 
those writers whose mere name on a cover guarantees huge sales. 
</P>
<P>
 It also sparks criticism: Why does Crichton make a woman his villain, some 
reviewers have asked, when most sexual harassment cases are filed by women 
against men? In 1992, according to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 
only 968 men filed sexual harassment charges out 10,577 complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, there are shots at Crichton's literary depth: "It will be the very 
rare person who rereads 'Disclosure,' " sniffed the Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
 So what else is new? Some critics charged that his previous novel, "Rising 
Sun," crudely bashed the Japanese, and Crichton has responded with anger, 
saying such barbs are unfair. Yet his chest-beating, polemical books seem to 
invite them. Like his characters, he loves being outspoken. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: What prompted you to focus on sexual harassment as a topic? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: I was looking for a long time for some way to talk about the 
relationship of the sexes in this country. And this seemed to be the right 
story, this reversed story. It's a very difficult problem and I had never faced 
it before.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You've said the plot is based on a real-life occurrence related by a 
friend. How much did you change the actual incident for the novel? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I didn't want to change it at all. But of course one is required (legally) 
to change it, so the problem was to find things that would be equivalent. I had 
to disguise the real situation but tried to keep the values the same. I don't 
think I should say much beyond that.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How did you go about researching the book? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I read extensively in the academic literature on the subject and I thought 
that would be my preparation. Now, I thought, I'll go speak to people in 
different corporations, none of whom wanted to be associated with me! I said, 
"Would you like to be thanked in the book?" And they said, "Absolutely not!" 
None of the attorneys. I think it shows the sensitivity on this.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Did anything surprise you in your research at high-tech computer firms? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The first thing I discovered is that these people had no knowledge of the 
(scientific or academic) literature. They had no knowledge of various feminist 
positions on these issues . . . and they didn't want to know. Their lives are 
very fast-paced and they had a kind of rough-and-ready pragmatic approach to 
gender issues. They're young companies, and there's a tremendous amount of 
sexual activity. Although the companies all have rules about what you can and 
can't do with other people, the companies can't (control) it. The human 
resources people act like they're in charge of some rabbit warren.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Was there a change in your self-awareness as you wrote the book? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, very dramatic. My intention was to address what I thought of as 
unacknowledged biases and assumptions in our society. And I discovered to my 
amazement while I was working that I had plenty of my own. I had a good deal of 
difficult feelings about this protagonist as I was writing.  
</P>
<P>
 When "Disclosure" begins, Tom Sanders is a computer executive in his early 40s 
who expects to get a long-awaited promotion. By the end, he's lucky to still 
have his job and the respect of his wife, a tough-talking attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders' problems begin when Meredith Johnson, a stunningly attractive 
employee in his Seattle-based company, DigiCom, seemingly comes out of nowhere 
to pluck the promotion away from him. The two had an unhappy affair 10 years 
before, and hours after her new job is announced, Johnson invites Sanders up to 
her new office for something more than a handshake and a glass of wine. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Sanders can't believe what's happening and he tries to dodge her 
overtures. But she persists and finally gets him down on a sofa with her. At 
the last second, he refuses to go through with the act, saying it would be 
wrong. He reminds his new boss that he has a wife and two kids, but she erupts 
with fury, vowing to get even with the man who has spurned her. 
</P>
<P>
 For the rest of the book, Sanders fights valiantly to convince scores of 
people -- including his lawyer -- that he has been a victim of sexual 
harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Seconds before Sanders backs off, he has undressed Johnson and there's 
quite a bit of heavy breathing. Isn't it hard to view him as a victim? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. His pants are down around his knees. So how much of a victim are you? 
And yet, when you turn the situation around, current feminist dogma says 
absolutely that if it's a man and a woman and that situation occurs, and she 
says 'no' at the very last moment, that's absolutely within her rights. She's a 
victim throughout the whole encounter. But when you reverse the roles and look 
at it, you'd say, no, that's not right at all. He's a participant. He has a 
role. He could have backed out earlier. So what's going on here?  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What does that tell you about sexual harassment in the workplace? 
</P>
<P>
 A: There are some cases (of harassment) that are just clear, certain kinds of 
behavior that are no longer acceptable and haven't been acceptable for a long 
time. There's another kind of behavior that represents hypersensitivity. In the 
middle it's muddy, and the middle is wide. And what attorneys say is, there's 
almost always something else going on between two people (beyond sexual 
tensions).  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Where does modern feminist thought fit into all this? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I've always welcomed more powerful and independent women. But I absolutely 
do not favor the protectionist, victimist posture of some feminist groups. I 
think it's bad for women and it's a bad strategy for men. Egalitarian feminism 
says men and women are equal and should have equal opportunity. . . . 
Protectionist feminism says women have special needs and special requirements. 
Women must be specifically protected. And that protectionism is (defended) by a 
group of men and women.  
</P>
<P>
 A tall, imposing man, Crichton speaks in the measured tones of an academic. 
Although some dismiss him as a pop writer who hops the latest trend, it's hard 
to ignore his credentials. A graduate of Harvard College and the Harvard 
Medical School, he's written 13 books and directed several films. Worldwide, 
there are more than 100 million copies of his works in print. 
</P>
<P>
 At 51, Crichton is married to his fourth wife, actress Anne-Marie Martin, and 
has a 4-year-old daughter, Taylor. Throughout the interview, the author 
stresses that he doesn't want his words -- or his book -- to be seen as a 
diatribe against women. The key point, he says, is that both sexes have to live 
and work together equally and with a lot more mutual respect. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: At the end of this book, a character says sexual harassment issues won't be 
resolved until 50% of all executives are women. What do you mean? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Traditional corporate America is a roomful of men. White men, usually. And 
the most important differences start to occur (in the workplace) when you're 
not the only woman in the room. The more women there are, the more that kind of 
level changes. So, when will (these problems) go away? When there are more or 
less equal numbers. When we see that there's a spectrum with women executives, 
as with men. Some are nurturing, some are not. Some are curt, some are polite. 
Some abuse their power, some don't. Some have to be fired.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do you see harassment disputes changing in the workplace? 
</P>
<P>
 A: As more and more women become supervisors, they'll get charged (with 
harassment). The charge is easy. The charge is a snap. And you are presumed 
guilty in this country -- it's astounding. The charge can be used to get rid of 
somebody you don't like. So more and more women are going to see this.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: There are many men and women who would object to those comments. They'd say 
you were creating a misleading and unlikely incident to sell books. 
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't want to tiptoe through my life. It's a drag. And I don't want to 
feel that the world is dangerous. I think part of my tendency to be outspoken 
is the desire to contradict that prevailing caution.

TERMS OF ENDURANCE; CARRYING THE WEIGHT OF THE FREE WORLD CAN ADD FAR MORE THAN 
FOUR YEARS TO A PRESIDENT'S LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA SLAVIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Look closely at the face of William Jefferson Clinton. Are those the lines of 
last year's budget battle across his brow? 
</P>
<P>
 The bungled nominations of Zoe Baird, Lani Guinier and, now, Bobby Inman; the 
embarrassments in Somalia and Haiti; the uphill struggle over NAFTA -- have 
they added to the baggage under his eyes and turned his well-trimmed thatch of 
salt and pepper just a trifle saltier? 
</P>
<P>
 Those who have scrutinized our 42nd President during his first year are 
divided. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't noticed too much change in the face, more in the haircut," said 
Bernie Boston, a recently retired Los Angeles Times photographer who has 
photographed every President since Eisenhower. 
</P>
<P>
 "He keeps talking about losing weight, but he definitely looks bigger and his 
hair's a lot grayer," said Mike Theiler, who has snapped Clinton regularly for 
the Reuters news agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "His physical appearance varies, but he does look tired very often," said 
Robert Gilbert, a professor of political science at Northeastern University in 
Boston and the author of the book "The Mortal Presidency." 
</P>
<P>
 "The most obvious problem is his weight. He gains weight dramatically and then 
loses it, then gains again. It puts his heart under stress and he's at the age 
where cardiovascular problems become more likely," Gilbert added. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no doubt that the presidency, the mother of all employment 
challenges, can be a health hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 Even discounting the four Presidents who were assassinated -- Abraham Lincoln, 
James Garfield, William McKinley and John F. Kennedy -- those who have held the 
nation's highest political office have tended to die before the average for 
their time, Gilbert found. (Supreme Court justices and members of Congress, on 
the other hand, have been comparatively long-lived.) 
</P>
<P>
 Four Presidents -- William Henry Harrison, Zachary Taylor, Warren G. Harding 
and Franklin D. Roosevelt -- died on the job of assorted natural causes. 
Harrison holds the record for the shortest term: 31 days. He expired of 
pneumonia contracted while speaking for nearly two hours in the rain on 
Inauguration Day, an argument for short political speeches if there ever was 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 Others didn't last much beyond their final days in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 James Polk was only 49 when he was inaugurated, then the record for youth. But 
he was a cheerless workaholic who died three months after leaving office. His 
secretary of state, James Buchanan, said of Polk: "He was the most laborious 
man I have ever known and in the brief period of four years had assumed the 
appearance of an old man." 
</P>
<P>
 Much the same was said of Lyndon B. Johnson, worn down by the war in Vietnam 
and riots in American streets, when he decided not to seek reelection in 1968. 
He wrote in his memoirs that he doubted he could survive four more years after 
his first term ended. He didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 In gauging a President's health, appearances have sometimes been deceiving. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy, whose election at 43 broke the Polk record for youth, projected 
tremendous vigor but was tormented by chronic back pain caused by injuries and 
the fact that he "was born with the left side of his body smaller than the 
right," according to Dr. Janet Travell, one of his physicians, quoted in 
Gilbert's book. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy also suffered from Addison's disease, a failure of the adrenal glands, 
which obliged him to take powerful steroid drugs that sometimes left his face 
puffy. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Beschloss, a presidential historian, said Kennedy actually looked 
better toward the end of his term than at the beginning, when he was getting 
"lots of different drugs from lots of different doctors who did not 
coordinate." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, his back problems may have contributed to his death. Had he not been 
wearing a back brace on that trip to Dallas, it was suggested in the Warren 
Commission report on the assassination, he might have been able to duck the 
fatal bullet. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to Kennedy, Jimmy Carter, 52 when he took office, seemed to show 
all the weight of the presidency in his face and carriage. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did age noticeably in terms of his hair becoming almost white, but his 
health was actually pretty good," said Jody Powell, Carter's press secretary. 
Nearly two decades later, Powell noted, Carter, now 70, is "still going at 
110%." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, it was Carter's devotion to jogging, more than double-digit 
inflation or the Iran hostage crisis, that both helped him survive the stress 
and made him look so haggard. "Carter lost 15 pounds as a result of a lot of 
running, and that tended to exaggerate the seeming effects of age," Beschloss 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the contrast between the anxious ex-peanut farmer from Georgia, with 
his sagging shoulders and furrowed brow, and the chipper old actor from 
Hollywood who followed could hardly have been more graphic. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was almost the antithesis," said Stephen Hess, a senior fellow at the 
Brookings Institution. "Just look at Ronald Reagan. The oldest President coming 
in, but a man who knew how to slough off responsibilities -- or should I say 
delegate -- and didn't take them upstairs in the White House with him." 
</P>
<P>
 Reagan began to look the septuagenarian he was only in his second term, after 
cancer surgery and the Iran-Contra scandal. His earlier brush with death, when 
John Hinckley shot him in 1981, barely scratched the "Teflon." 
</P>
<P>
 And what of Reagan's successor? 
</P>
<P>
 Despite noticeably more hands-on management, a thyroid condition that briefly 
caused a heart irregularity and some major embarrassments (if minor health 
events), such as throwing up in public on the prime minister of Japan, George 
Bush also held up pretty well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bush aged a lot more in the vice presidency," Beschloss said, "when he had to 
subordinate himself and his views to Reagan." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Clinton, the experts spoke favorably of his optimistic personality and 
his efforts to diminish stress. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clinton works hard but doesn't attempt to achieve the level of detail that 
Carter did, and he's more comfortable delegating responsibility," said Philip 
Tetlock, a professor of psychology at UC Berkeley.  
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Suzanne Griffin, a specialist in biological psychiatry at Georgetown 
University, attributed Clinton's relatively good shape to "his sense of humor, 
his interest in other pursuits, such as music, and regular exercise." 
</P>
<P>
 But the President's fondness for fatty foods and late nights, and the 
seemingly never-ending succession of crises -- personal and political -- may 
not bode well. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pressure has got to take its toll," Powell said. "I don't see it in his 
face now, but by the end of four years, I guarantee you'll see it."

 How much help should you give your kids with their homework? 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents must strike a balance between encouraging and becoming so involved" 
that children think they can't manage on their own, says Dr. Robert Brooks, 
director of psychology at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass."Children are more 
likely to be successful in school if their parents help them early on to be 
independent thinkers." 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some tips from Parent's Digest magazine: 
</P>
<P>
 * Encourage kids to take pride in their work. Give them a boost when they're 
stuck but don't fill in all the blanks. When children ask how to spell a word 
or what's the capital of Ohio, help them look it up. If they don't understand 
the meaning of a poem, read it aloud together and discuss it, but don't say 
what you think the meaning is. 
</P>
<P>
 * Let them know it's OK to make a mistake. "Many kids are so afraid of making 
mistakes they get easily frustrated when they can't figure something out," 
Brooks says. "That's when I hold up a pencil and, corny as it sounds, ask: 'Why 
do you think they put erasers on pencils?' " 
</P>
<P>
 * Many children need parents to help them set up a regular place and time to 
do homework, as well as constant reminders to do it. "Tell them that you value 
homework," Brooks says. "Homework is part of their responsibility in school." 
</P>
<P>
 * If child often fail to finish homework, arrange a conference with the 
teacher to make sure the child's attitude isn't masking a learning problem or 
some other anxiety.

WOMEN PILOTS ACCEPT NO LIMITS IN THE SKY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BARLOW, THE STAMFORD ADVOCATE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whenever Julie Gereben flew with her parents in an airliner, she would always 
go up to the cockpit to watch the pilots. And when the pilot of a small 
airplane asked her if she wanted to take the controls for a few minutes during 
a sightseeing flight over Mt. St. Helens, she didn't hesitate. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Karkman realized she wanted to be a pilot while flying in a Piper 
Cherokee from Poland back to her home in Sweden so she could attend her 
sister's wedding. 
</P>
<P>
 Holly Smith had never even been in an airplane when, after graduating from 
high school in Dublin, Ga., she decided to become a pilot. "I did not want to 
work behind a desk and I thought flying would be interesting, a good way to see 
the world," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Gereben, 24, Karkman, 20, and Smith, 24, are part of aviation's next 
generation. For the moment, they are flight instructors in Stratford, Ct. But 
within a few years, they are likely to be flying sophisticated jet aircraft for 
airlines or major corporations. Assuming, of course, that they survive the 
hardships and occasional dangers that accompany their entry-level jobs in 
aviation. 
</P>
<P>
 Like interns hoping to become full-fledged medical doctors, flight instructors 
must work excruciatingly long hours for low pay in a highly stressful 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes a lot of belief in yourself and in your abilities," Gereben says. 
"You have to trust your experience and your training." 
</P>
<P>
 If, for example, a student accidentally twists the plane into a spin, the 
flight instructor is expected to take the controls calmly, stop the spin and 
get the plane under control again -- all before it drills a large hole in the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Or if at an altitude of 3,500 feet a student accidentally kills the engine by 
pulling back the control for fuel mixture instead of carburetor heat (the two 
controls are right next to each other in many small airplanes), the flight 
instructor must gently push the mixture control back to its proper position, 
restart the engine and politely remind the student to be more careful in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 Flight instructors are also responsible for deciding whether a licensed pilot 
is qualified to fly a certain airplane. This kind of situation can be 
potentially awkward for young instructors because it requires them to pass 
judgment on older, more experienced pilots who are paying for the privilege of 
being checked out in a new airplane. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to put your foot down," says Gereben, "no matter how much anyone is 
paying." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith agrees that self-confidence ranks high on the list of prerequisites for 
the job. Higher, in fact, than strength, courage, academic ability and 
reasonably good vision (she admits to wearing contact lenses). 
</P>
<P>
 What a good flight instructor really needs is better-than-average hand-eye 
coordination, inexhaustible patience and a strong instinct for survival. 
</P>
<P>
 "Common sense is the big thing," says Karkman, echoing the consensus that 
there are few things worse than "book smart, plane dumb" pilots. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the three women considers herself exceptional. But the statistics tell 
a different story. In 1991, the latest year for which figures were available, 
there were 692,095 licensed pilots in the United States. Of that total, 40,931 
-- just under 6% -- were women. In the same year, there were 69,209 certified 
flight instructors. Of the number, 3,629 -- just above 5% -- were women. So the 
fact that Gereben, Karkman and Smith make up 50% of the teaching staff at the 
flying service they work for seems in itself remarkable until you talk to the 
flight school's owner, Peter Reilly. 
</P>
<P>
 Like his pilots, Reilly puts a lot of stock in common sense. Hiring women to 
fill job slots that had been reserved traditionally for men was a decision 
Reilly based on his years of experience as the director of a human resources 
department for a major corporation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aviation, like many other activities, is increasingly dependent on knowledge 
and the ability to direct systems," he says. "The need for physical strength 
has diminished." If there is any rivalry between the male and female 
instructors, Reilly says he hasn't noticed it. "As a matter of fact, they all 
get along very well and they are mutually supportive." 
</P>
<P>
 One advantage that women pilots have over their male counterparts shows up in 
the early stages of flight training, according to Peggy Baty, dean of Parks 
College in Illinois, the oldest continuously operating aviation college in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Because they have a lighter touch on the controls and tend not to overuse 
them, female student pilots often fly more smoothly than do male student 
pilots, Baty says. 
</P>
<P>
 What many people forget, Baty says, is that women have been involved in 
aviation from its earliest days. The first woman pilot soloed in 1910. During 
aviation's great barnstorming era in the 1920s and 1930s, women pilots were a 
common sight. It wasn't until World War II, when the emphasis shifted to combat 
flying, that women were frozen out of meaningful careers in aviation. 
</P>
<P>
 There are now 1,600 women flying "heavy" airplanes -- airliners with a gross 
weight in excess of 90,000 pounds. That represents about 4% of the total number 
of flight engineers, first officers and captains. Due to industry-wide 
furloughs and layoffs, it is difficult to provide exact figures on the number 
of women who have been promoted to captain, says Lori Griffith, statistician 
for the International Society of Women Airline Pilots. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffith, who captains a Boeing 737 for USAir, estimated there are between 375 
and 425 women captains flying today. That ballpark figure represents less than 
1% of the total, she says.

Q&A WITH ROBBIE ROBERTSON; REFLECTIONS ON THE AGE OF A 'REAL' ROCK BAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even though such essential artists as David Bowie and the Velvet Underground 
have been bypassed by Rock and Roll Hall of Fame judges over the years, the 
Band's election to the Hall in its first year of eligibility was a virtual 
certainty.  
</P>
<P>
 Few groups have ever enjoyed as much respect from critics and peers as this 
quintet, which came to national attention in the '60s as the backing group for 
Bob Dylan and then came into its own with a pair of remarkable '70s albums, 
"Music From Big Pink" and "The Band."  
</P>
<P>
 Although Rick Danko, Levon Helm, Garth Hudson and the late Richard Manuel made 
invaluable contributions to the Band's music, it is guitarist and chief 
songwriter Robbie Robertson who remains most identified with the group. His 
leadership role, however, has led to strained feelings, especially with Helm, 
who criticizes Robertson in a recent autobiography, alleging that Robertson 
tried to control the group and eventually forced it to break up.  
</P>
<P>
 On the eve of the Hall of Fame ceremonies tonight in New York, Robertson , 50, 
spoke about the criticisms and the early magic of the Band.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: There was a lot of controversy last year at the Hall of Fame dinner 
because you and Bruce Springsteen played Creedence Clearwater Revival songs 
with John Fogerty while the other members of Creedence, Stu Cook and Doug 
Clifford, had to sit in the audience. Can you see a similar thing happening 
again because of the tensions between you and Levon? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: What happened last year certainly wasn't meant to belittle anyone or 
step on anyone's toes. I found out about the other two guys being upset after 
the fact. But when I thought about their reaction, I thought, "You know, 
they're right." That's why I said to some of the people at the Hall of Fame 
that from now on in these situations, it should be all or nobody when it comes 
to playing at the induction dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Does that mean you'd get on stage with Levon? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Absolutely, but I don't think it's going to happen. A couple of months ago, 
I called Levon and said maybe we should talk about this Rock and Roll Hall of 
Fame thing and the Band box set that is going to be coming out this year. But 
it didn't get any further than that, and I've heard from the Hall of Fame that 
Levon has said he might prefer not to play, just to enjoy the evening. To me, 
whatever everybody wants to do is fine. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about Levon's criticism about you trying to be the boss in the Band? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I never wanted to be the boss, and, in fact, I never thought I was the 
boss. I was just trying to organize things so we could do things like make 
records and go out and play a show somewhere. It was not a big controlling 
thing on my part, but you know what happens in these situations. 
</P>
<P>
 In a group, one guy is really good at this and one guy is good at that, and it 
kind of all settles. I just kind of found myself in the position of: "If I 
don't do this, nobody's going to do it. We'll just be sitting here in a year 
saying, 'I don't know, what do you think?' " So you have to try to get things 
moving. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What was the strength of the Band? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The fact that it was a real band . . . five parts. Garth was the most 
accomplished musician in rock 'n' roll, bar none. Rick reinvented bass playing. 
Levon had a sound on his drums that no one else had. Other drummers used to 
kiss his hands. Plus Rick and Richard and Levon were all such great voices. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you regret calling an end to it in 1976? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No, because I really felt that the circumstances dictated it. It wasn't 
about me saying, "OK, 16 years, I've had enough." Things had run their course. 
It became so difficult to do things that used to be so easy. . . . To get 
everybody together to come to the studio. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about halls of fame? Is the validation really meaningful after all 
these years of acclaim? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It's certainly nice to be acknowledged along with Elvis Presley, Chuck 
Berry and some of the other people who have been inducted. But the most 
important thing about the Hall of Fame to me is the chance it gives us to 
salute the people who came before us . . . the chance to acknowledge Muddy 
Waters or Carl Perkins or Mahalia Jackson . . . the people who were such a 
tremendous influence on us all. They're the reason we got addicted to this 
whole music. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Looking back, what was the most important validation -- the time you sat 
back and were really proud of what you had done? 
</P>
<P>
 A: That was probably when the Band's first album, "Music From Big Pink," came 
out. We had made this record and were playing it for friends and other 
musicians, and everybody was saying, "You know, this is really different." 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't sound different to us because we were just playing what was inside 
us, but it wasn't what was happening then in music. Music wasn't going our 
direction, and the fact that people embraced it was like crossing a major 
bridge in our career. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Let's talk about Hall of Fame caliber musicians. As a guitarist, who is the 
best guitarist you ever heard? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I always think of it in terms of styles, rather than technique. For 
instance, you could ask, "Who is a better trumpet player, Dizzy Gillespie or 
Miles Davis?" Well, I don't think one's better than the other, but I might say 
that I like Miles' sound more. It does more for me personally. 
</P>
<P>
 And in that sense, I could point to when I first heard Muddy Waters play 
bottleneck guitar. It had an influence on me that I still feel. I was doing 
some music for Barry Levinson's new movie, "Jimmy Hollywood," and I realized I 
was doing this guitar thing that goes back to when I was 15 and I heard Muddy 
Waters do it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about the greatest singer? 
</P>
<P>
 A: There are so many, but I have to go back to the ones who first impressed 
me, and you have to say Elvis Presley. When you hear him sing something like 
"Blue Moon," there's a sound in his voice that is unparalleled. Yet I liked the 
sound of Howlin' Wolf just as much. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about songs or songwriter? 
</P>
<P>
 A: If we are talking about the very beginning, there were things of Hank 
Williams' that hooked me . . . that made me think I'd like to make up something 
as strong as that. 
</P>
<P>
 I think "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry" was probably the Williams song that had 
the biggest impact. It brought out a feeling in me that I didn't even know 
music could bring out, because most of the music I had heard on the radio 
before that was such happy-go-lucky stuff. . . . "How Much Is That Doggie in 
the Window" and things like that. Hank Williams was from another place, and 
that's where I wanted to go.

O.C. MUSIC / CHRIS PASLES; PETERS FINDS MERRY LIFE IN COLORATURA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Roberta Peters was 19 when she stood on the stage of the Metropolitan Opera 
House in New York to audition for the formidably difficult role of Queen of the 
Night in Mozart's "Die Zauberflote." 
</P>
<P>
 "I sang the first aria, and I heard a voice say, 'Miss Peters, would you mind 
repeating that?' " she recalled over lunch recently at a nearby restaurant. "So 
I did. Then after the second time, from another part of the house, I heard, 
'Miss Peters, Would you please repeat that one more time?' 
</P>
<P>
 "I did it four times. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I didn't know was that Mr. Bing (Sir Rudolf Bing, general manager of the 
Met) was out there asking the different conductors who were in the house to 
come in and hear it. When I got off, he gave me the contract." 
</P>
<P>
 The contract lasted 35 years. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, Peters actually made her professional debut, at the Met, two 
months earlier than scheduled, in another Mozart opera. On Nov. 17, 1950, she 
took over Zerlina in "Don Giovanni" as a last-minute replacement.  
</P>
<P>
 She brings all that experience to the title role of Lehar's "The Merry Widow," 
which Opera Pacific presents starting Friday at the Orange County Performing 
Arts Center in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 "My teacher instilled in me such a confidence," she said, "that when I look 
back now I'm scared, thinking about how confident I was and how I was able to 
go out on the stage just like that, within three hours' notice, never having 
been on any stage. The Met was my first job." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Her teacher was William Herman, and she is still grateful to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He took me as a little girl from the Bronx, who didn't know a thing -- nobody 
in my family ever sang -- and threw me into this completely different world. 
And, of course, I was ready to accept it." 
</P>
<P>
 She committed herself totally to his teaching. "I stopped school when I was 13 
to study singing, and I got the education that I need for this kind of career. 
I would take the subway into Manhattan, have a singing lesson about 10 o'clock 
and then I would go from that to a French lesson and then I would go to a 
ballet lesson and then maybe to an Italian lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 "So all day long I was traveling around New York City, as a 13-year-old little 
girl . . . . I didn't go to proms. I never was with my contemporaries. But I 
was so happy, I can't tell you." 
</P>
<P>
 Herman wouldn't let her sing anywhere professionally for the next six years, 
however. Not until he felt she was ready. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very intense, and I knew 20 operas when I got into the Met. I was 
prepared, absolutely prepared. That's why I was able to go out and sing Zerlina 
without one rehearsal." 
</P>
<P>
 During her long and distinguished career at the Met, Peters was noted 
especially for coloratura roles -- those requiring high, light, agile singing 
in virtuosic arias. But she doesn't see many young coloraturas coming along 
now. That kind of voice, too, has become less fashionable as the dramatic 
revolution wrought by Maria Callas and other singers became dominant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a lot of voices that may have been high coloraturas started to do the 
heavier repertoire because Callas' voice was richer, heavier and much more 
dramatic," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just hoping that it is a cycle, because right now I don't see many out 
there -- one or two that I know of, but the voices are very small, and I don't 
know that they'll really make a big career. But also I think it's a question of 
having the correct schooling." 
</P>
<P>
 Her advice to young singers is to "get with the best teacher you can find. But 
that's very difficult -- to find the right person, because it has to be a 
complete rapport. And then another difficult thing, too, is that if the teacher 
isn't right for you, the student gets too attached. You say, 'Oh, gee, what if 
I leave this teacher? Where am I going to go?' 
</P>
<P>
 "I still practice and study. I have a coach in San Diego, George Trovillo, who 
was my accompanist for about 12 years, before he moved out here and retired. I 
come out here about three or four times a year. I call it my retreat. I'm out 
for a week or so, and we work all the time. You see, you have to have somebody 
who says, 'Watch this. Be very careful of this.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, one of the members of the ('Widow') cast asked me, 'What is your 
secret of staying in so long?' . . . First and foremost, I stayed with the 
correct repertoire for me. I didn't go into too much Puccini. I didn't do 
'Toscas.' I stayed with the (lighter) 'Lucias,' 'Rigolettos' and 'Barbers' and 
didn't push my voice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have loved to do a 'Salome' -- I love that kind of (heavy Germanic) 
music -- but not in this lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
 Younger singers also face obstacles she didn't face. 
</P>
<P>
 "They take one lesson a week. They have to work. They come in the evening 
because they don't have the money, and the lessons are $125 to a $150 each. So 
really, where are you going to get that training any more?" 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, "a lot of audiences are accepting mediocrity," she said. "I 
think they don't know any better. They never heard (Jussi) Bjoerling or those 
other great singers. There were great artists in those days. But we can't let 
that stop us. We've got to look for good talent in the artists, in the 
composers. You've got to give the young ones a chance. Maybe something will 
come." 
</P>

HOWARD ROSENBERG: QUAKE NEWS ROB YOU OF FAVES? YOU CAN COPE; TELEVISION: MAKE

 Coping With the Quake II . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Disasters always happen to the next guy. You never think about them happening 
to you. As this week's devastating quake has affirmed, however, they do happen 
to you, and with potentially dire consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 The two most likely scenarios: 
</P>
<P>
 * An earthquake knocks TV off the air in your area. 
</P>
<P>
 * TV coverage of an earthquake preempts your favorite programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Either scenario can cause severe discomfort, to say nothing of psychological 
damage. How to cope and prepare for the future? 
</P>
<P>
 One solution is to make this a recovery that meets not only your own needs but 
also those of the community, by bringing everyone together. Gather your 
neighbors, for example, so that all of you can discuss favorite episodes of 
your favorite shows. Call it community commiseration. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, it was tough missing Monday night's "Blossom" on NBC and "Dave's World" 
on CBS, and so on and so on. Just as painful is an evening without "A Current 
Affair" on KTTV-TV Channel 11. Yet reminiscing about past episodes will relieve 
the ache: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Remember the time Will's fraternity brothers left him drunk in a haunted 
cemetery on NBC's 'Fresh Prince of Bel-Air'? And NBC's 'Unsolved Mysteries' -- 
the health care worker who was wanted for tampering with medication?" 
</P>
<P>
 Well, you get the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, sure, you need your flashlights and portable radios with extra 
batteries, your food, clothing, blankets and other emergency items. But what 
good is an earthquake kit without videotape cassettes of your favorite TV 
shows? 
</P>
<P>
 The scheduled guest on today's "Sally Jessy Raphael" on KNBC-TV Channel 4 -- 
assuming there's no quake coverage -- is lovable Richard Simmons. A classic. 
Tape it! Coming Thursday on KCAL-TV Channel 9's "Maury Povich," gay teens. 
Scintillating. Tape it! You must survive. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, you ask, but what happens when disaster reporting distorts the way your 
favorite station covers the news? Easy. Do your own retrospective. If Channel 
4's news teases are what you're missing, for example, gather some of your 
neighbors in a room and have them shout: "BOMBSHELL!" 
</P>
<P>
 You'll prize the moment forever. 
</P>
<P>
 Or perhaps you're suffering withdrawal from missing the jocularity of the 
morning news on KTLA-TV Channel 5. Once more, the better your memory, the 
better your therapy. Get those neighbors together again, and this time hash 
over your favorite morning news moments, the time Sam gave Carlos a hotfoot, 
and so on and so on. It'll lift your spirits. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You and your neighbors can even make it into a game by coming up with your own 
post-quake scenarios for Channel 5's morning news: Barbara hits Carlos in the 
face with a cream pie. Carlos sticks chewing gum in Barbara's hair. 
</P>
<P>
 The TV that viewers probably have missed most, though, are those daytime talk 
shows that keep us all abreast of important issues. Again, nothing is more 
healthy than channeling this deep longing into something productive for the 
community, a game in which each neighbor suggests his or her own 
earthquake-related topic for Sally, Geraldo, Phil or whomever: 
</P>
<P>
 Transsexual looters . . . . Firemen who sleep with their mothers-in-law . . . 
. Skinhead children of seismologists . . . . Reporters who rob. 
</P>
<P>
 In the event of a total power outage, we all can be inspired by Ray Bradbury's 
futuristic "Fahrenheit 451," whose most-admirable characters fight book burning 
by committing to memory great works of literature and philosophy such as 
Plato's "Republic" and Jonathan Swift's "Gulliver's Travels," in effect 
becoming the authors' surrogates by speaking their words that are no longer in 
print. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an idea that should be applied to television. 
</P>
<P>
 With quake experts predicting that The Big One is yet to come, there's no time 
to spare. Tonight on ABC's "George," for example, George and Juanita leave the 
kids with the housekeeper for the evening. Memorize it. On Fox's "Beverly 
Hills, 90210," Brandon tutors a basketball star, Andrea and Dan mull telling 
everyone about their relationship, Stuart's parents invite over Jim and Cindy. 
Memorize it, and spread the word to your neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Just think of the potential -- a neighborhood mentally preserving an entire 
prime-time schedule in case The Big One does indeed arrive some day. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, if it happens that you're a TV critic for the Los Angeles Times and a 
quake knocks over all of your sets and you have to write a column anyway, do 
what you always do. Make it up.

6 MONTHS AFTER ITS DEBUT, 'FRONT PAGE' STILL STRUGGLES; TELEVISION: FOX'S FIRST 
NEWS PRODUCT IS FIGHTING TO ESTABLISH A SOMEWHAT SASSY IDENTITY ALONG WITH 
LEGITIMACY AS NEWS PROGRAM. DISMAL RATINGS HAVE PROMPTED THE NETWORK TO MOVE 
THE SHOW FROM SATURDAYS TO TUESDAYS. 
</P>

<P>
 It's designed to lure young viewers with jazzy video effects, yet still 
maintain its "news first" credibility. It's supposed to provide a younger take 
on the world, but most of the guys who offer the show's most distinctive points 
of view look like your basic middle-age TV pundits ward-robed as usual in coats 
and ties. It airs on Fox, a brand name most associated with such 
tabloid-reality programs as "A Current Affair" and "America's Most Wanted," and 
yet the show's executive producer aspires for an image more along the lines of 
"60 Minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 So it goes in the seemingly schizophrenic world of "Front Page" -- Fox's first 
and only news product that after half a year on the air is fighting 
simultaneously to establish a unique, somewhat sassy identity and legitimacy as 
a thoughtful news organization. It is also fighting to find an audience. So 
far, airing Saturdays, the show is ranked a dismal 98th out of 102 prime-time 
programs. In an effort to improve on that, the network is moving the series to 
Tuesdays at 9 p.m. beginning Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that if we're not distinct with our style, we won't succeed," said 
David Corvo, executive producer of the show. "But the biggest thing is our 
journalism better be solid, and I really don't see those two things as being in 
conflict. If each piece does not have substance and clarity, you are going to 
lose your audience, and then it won't matter how flashy you look." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Corvo, 43, who used to supervise news shows at CBS, said that since Fox is not 
a place anyone associates with news, it is essential that the show take pains 
to make sure viewers perceive "Front Page" as a news program. Staking that 
claim is critical not just in attracting the audience that likes to watch news 
magazines, but also in gaining access to the newsmakers who matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if it's the politically correct thing to say, but yes it's 
tougher for us (than a new news show on the other networks) because Fox either 
has no news image or it's a tabloid image," Corvo said. "We're doing something 
altogether different than 'A Current Affair,' but still people are confused. It 
happens in Hollywood when we want to talk to someone, they say, 'I already did 
"A Current Affair" ' or 'I didn't like what they did about me.' We get the same 
from politicians. So in terms of even being able to get those really good 
stories, we have to hang that news sign out there. I suppose there are more 
radical versions of news programs that could be done, but I don't think we 
could do that with the first one." 
</P>
<P>
 From the start, "Front Page" has been backpedaling on some of its more radical 
elements. The heavy use of graphics employed at the beginning last June have 
been cut back. The idea of simply jumping from one self-contained piece to the 
next without a traditional introduction was scrapped too. Now, one or another 
of the show's five principal reporters introduces each piece -- often by way of 
a stroll through the architecturally gorgeous Bradbury Building in downtown Los 
Angeles. Corvo said he even wants to hire a full-time anchor person. Nearly all 
of the network news magazines are built around such star anchors as Diane 
Sawyer or Jane Pauley who not only serve to centralize each show, but also lure 
viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always thought the show would do better with an anchor, but we didn't have 
the right person," Corvo said. "It's an interesting search because you know 
that all of the best people aren't sitting on the beach waiting for a call. But 
we figured when we found him or her we could add them to the mix, and in the 
meantime we had the opportunity to get on the air and learn how to do stories." 
</P>
<P>
 Corvo added that some of the more avant-garde pieces -- such as a recent story 
on rap music -- have been slowed or toned down a bit. Still, he asserted that 
"Front Page" uses more of what he calls "off-Broadway" video techniques more 
common to MTV, ESPN2 or British television than any of the other network news 
magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 And that is designed to please Fox's younger audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are definitely looking to do news for the Fox audience, and I think that 
means being focused on an editorial content and approach that will work with 
younger viewers," said Andy Fessel, Fox's senior vice president, research and 
marketing. "Viewers expect Fox not to give them the same old stuff, and this is 
a way to introduce the young Fox viewers to important news and information that 
they wouldn't otherwise get." 
</P>
<P>
 Corvo said that stories are chosen to appeal to younger viewers. In a piece 
about condoms in schools, for example, "Front Page" chose to tell the story 
from the point of view of the students, rather than the adult policy makers. It 
also presented a profile of the pop star Meatloaf. It arranged for three white 
suburban and three inner-city black students in Chicago to switch high schools 
for a week to illustrate the vast disparities in educational resources between 
rich and poor. It did a piece on pretty and well-educated youth who are hooked 
on heroin -- complete with close-up video of users shooting up. And it aired a 
savvy and flamboyant video essay on what it will mean to have 500 TV channels 
in every home. 
</P>
<P>
 The show has filled up much of its air time with some more traditional news 
magazine topics such as the floods in the Midwest, the November fires in 
Southern California and the Polly Klaas memorial service. And Corvo said his 
main goal is not to find stories that serve youth specifically, but stories 
about heavyweight newsmakers or issues that might establish the show's news 
reputation and help put it on the map. 
</P>
<P>
 The place where the show's so-called "attitude" shines most conspicuously, 
however, is in its regular one-minute commentaries. Here, Mike Lupica offers a 
curmudgeonly opinion on the New York's mayor's race or Chris Mathews derides 
the NAFTA debate. But while some younger viewers might take delight in 
cowboy-hatted Joe Bob Briggs' sarcastic diatribes against cappuccino bars or 
bottled water, for the most part the other regular TV columnists on the show 
don't look or talk like the generation the show is aimed at. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Corvo explained that his commentators are more "McLaughlin Group" than MTV's 
"House of Style" because it's tough to do these pieces, and he turned to people 
he knew. He doesn't rule out finding younger, hipper voices down the road -- 
and he said he expects "Front Page" to be around a long time despite the 
initial ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 To date, the show has finished last in its time period, averaging just a 9% 
share of the available audience. And even when all the other news magazines 
were registering huge numbers last summer, "Front Page" barely showed a 
heartbeat. 
</P>
<P>
 But the show has seen a slight improvement in its ratings over the last couple 
of months, and during the November sweeps it tied for second in its time period 
among adults ages 18 to 34. In addition, Fox owner Rupert Murdoch has made news 
a top priority, and Corvo said that he has seen nothing but a long-term 
commitment to "Front Page" from every level of the Fox hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no disappointment with the show," Fessel, the Fox vice president, 
declared. "It's performing in the range that we projected. 'Front Page' has a 
great future here at Fox." 
</P>
<P>
 Corvo said he hopes that he too has a great future in the fourth network's 
embryonic news department, even though his buttoned-down pals at CBS News in 
New York tell him they don't much care for what he's up to. 
</P>
<P>
 "They call me and say: 'What are you doing out there? Are you eating too many 
avocados?' But I find this very liberating. I don't know if I could put this 
show on the air at CBS. The great thing is, we don't have any institutional 
roadblocks. We're going to get slammed, sure. If you do something too close to 
what everyone else is doing, you're criticized for just doing the same old 
thing, and if you try something in a new style, they say, 'Gee, you're kind of 
trivial, aren't you? Why aren't you doing "60 Minutes?" ' But it's fun to try 
some new things and find our own way in the middle somewhere."

SOUTHLAND STRUGGLES TO DIG OUT; QUAKE TOLL RISES TO 40; SERVICES STILL DOWN; 
DISASTER: AFTERSHOCKS FROM 6.6 TEMBLOR CONTINUE. MANY TURN NEIGHBORHOODS AND 
PARKS INTO CAMPGROUNDS WHILE OTHERS SEEK REFUGE IN SHELTERS AND HOTELS.

<P>
 As waves of aftershocks continued to jolt quake-ravaged Southern California, 
life was anything but back to normal Tuesday for vast swaths of the region, 
which was struggling to dig out from the rubble, maneuver over a crumpled 
freeway system and assess the devastation without full benefit of power, gas or 
phones. 
</P>
<P>
 A day after a magnitude 6.6 earthquake rumbled violently under the San 
Fernando Valley, tens of thousands of frazzled and displaced residents turned 
their neighborhoods into sprawling campgrounds, burning tree limbs for warmth, 
boiling water against contaminants, stocking up on batteries and wondering when 
-- or if -- they will be able to return home. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least if I die here, they'll find me quick and not have to search for me 
in the rubble," said Silvia Martinez, 25, who was camped out at Echo Park Lake, 
where she had set up a frayed mattress under a makeshift tent of black garbage 
bags strung between two shopping carts. 
</P>
<P>
 The day's major developments: 
</P>
<P>
 * The death toll climbed to 40. Among the latest fatalities was the 16th body 
to be pulled from the three-story Northridge Meadows apartments, which became 
the focus of a grim rescue mission after it collapsed into two floors. Four 
other deaths in the latest tally were attributed to heart attacks. One other 
died in a traffic accident on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 * Medical officials said that 530 people had suffered injuries serious enough 
to be hospitalized, while another 2,333 injured were treated and released. 
Hospitals remained swamped across the Valley, doctors performed triage in 
parking lots and kidney patients scrambled to find dialysis treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 * Unable or unwilling to venture back to their homes, as many as 20,000 people 
had set up camp in at least 70 city parks. Thousands more were holed up at 
emergency shelters or were checked into hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 * As top federal officials met to discuss how best to bring emergency aid to 
the region, President Clinton announced he would visit Los Angeles today. 
Insurance industry officials estimated that insured damage from the quake and 
aftershocks will exceed $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 * With scores of employees staying away from work, traffic on the region's 
fractured roadways was remarkably light. Already, demolition crews were busy 
tearing down crumbled and debris-strewn stretches of the Santa Monica and 
Golden State freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nearly 82,000 customers were still without power, at least 50,000 had no 
water and 28,000 were without natural gas. Although telephone service was 
largely restored, officials said lines remained congested and urged residents 
to limit their calls. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mayor Richard Riordan extended the curfew through Tuesday night, saying the 
continuing need for one would be evaluated each day. He did, however, change 
its start from dusk to 11 p.m. Los Angeles police, meanwhile, reported minimal 
looting and curfew violations. If fact, Monday night was so quiet that only 73 
people were arrested in the entire city, a fraction of the average tally. 
</P>
<P>
 * While some comfort could be taken in Tuesday's blue skies and warm winter 
sun, forecasters predicted rain by the weekend, hastening efforts to board up 
and repair damaged structures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's hit everyone here yet," said Connie Buchanan, 65, whose 
one-bedroom apartment in Sherman Oaks was squashed to about half its original 
height. All along her block on Murieta Avenue, an almost festival atmosphere 
prevailed as residents evacuated buildings, filling the sidewalks with 
furniture, clothes and paintings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all sort of going around not knowing what to feel," she said. Do You 
Cry? 
</P>
<P>
 On the Day After, disaster maintained its persistent grip. While many 
survivors were able to reflect on the good fortune that Monday's earthquake had 
struck so early in the morning, the full extent of its deadly punch grew 
increasingly clear. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Northridge Meadows apartments, where nearly half of the quake's dead 
had been unearthed from the submerged first floor, search dogs discovered a 
16th body surrounded by pots and pans, wedged under heavy pillars in a 
three-foot void. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials did not immediately identify the victim, but it was believed to be 
Pil Sook Lee, a 47-year-old mechanic who had been preparing to go to work when 
the quake struck. Lee's wife, Hyun, a nurse, managed to crawl from the rubble 
with a 12-year-old son. But within hours of the quake, she learned that her 
14-year-old son had been killed and her husband was presumed dead. 
</P>
<P>
 After 24 hours of desperate searching that riveted TV viewers nationwide, Los 
Angeles Fire Department Battalion Chief Bill Burmester said he was confident 
that no one -- alive or dead -- was left in the 160-unit structure that has 
become an emblem of the quake's deadly muscle. During the final sweep, rescue 
teams used high-tech listening devices and a tiny fiber-optic camera that was 
lowered into narrow crevices. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan, in his first ground tour of the earthquake damage, 
crossed police lines and walked so close to the damaged Northridge complex that 
authorities warned him to stay back. "It's just scary how quickly life can be 
put out," he said after he stared at the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point on Riordan's tour, a sobbing woman threw her arms around him and 
virtually pulled him into her Granada Hills home. Water had ruined her living 
room, mud was caked on her rug and a plastic tarp covered what was left of her 
possessions. "I don't know what to do," she cried. 
</P>
<P>
 Art Ginsburg, whose motto is "Every Sandwich Is a Work of Art," knew exactly 
what to do. A fire, apparently the result of a quake-related gas leak, ripped 
through his namesake deli in Studio City early Tuesday morning, caving in the 
roof and causing hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 But after 37 years serving up roast beef, pastrami and Swiss cheese 
sandwiches, Ginsburg was not about to throw in the towel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was sick when they called me," he said. "I cried. I think we all cried. But 
the sign has been up there since 1957, it's still up there and it's going to 
stay up there." 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Monica, where some residents expressed concern that a barrage of 
reports from the Valley had overshadowed severe damage of their own, 83 
buildings were deemed unsafe for occupancy and access to 111 other structures 
was restricted. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said hundreds of gas leaks had been detected in the city and one 
house exploded during Monday's quake. On Tuesday, broken glass and dislodged 
bricks kept businesses along Wilshire and San Vicente boulevards shuttered. The 
popular Third Street Promenade pedestrian mall was bandaged in plywood. At the 
landmark Santa Monica pier, cars were banned as inspectors tried to assess 
foundation damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandra Campos showed up with her husband and four daughters at a Red Cross 
shelter at Santa Monica Community College after their eight-story oceanfront 
apartment complex was evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to find out -- is there someone I can talk to about finding a place to 
live?" Campos asked. "My daughters want to go home. I tell them, 'What home do 
we have to go to?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Piero Selvaggio was feeling particularly battered. Just 2 1/2 months ago, the 
47-year-old restaurateur lost his hillside home in Malibu to wind-whipped 
wildfires. On Tuesday, his voice grew tight as he described the damage to his 
prized wine collection at Valentino in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my wildest dream, in my worst scenario, I always felt if anything like 
this would happen there would be a river of wine running from my restaurant to 
the beach," he said. "When I drove in, the red river that I had thought in my 
dreams many times was reality. The wine was flowing through my driveway, across 
the parking lot, on the way down to Pico Boulevard." 
</P>
<P>
 Selvaggio estimated that about 30,000 bottles were destroyed in his 
100,000-bottle cellar -- the largest wine list, he says, on the West Coast. 
After sorting through the shattered glass, looking for fragments of labels and 
corks, he calculated the loss at about $250,000. But he said many of the 
vintages, which he had collected over the last two decades from old vineyards 
in France and Italy, do not exist any more. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you do?" he asked. "Do you continue to cry? Do you continue to scream 
and say, 'Why me?' " 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, damage estimates rose to at least $400 million and injury 
totals climbed to 800 Tuesday as officials said they expected to soon join the 
San Fernando Valley as a federal disaster area. 
</P>
<P>
 At least half the damage was reported in the historic railroad town of 
Fillmore, where dozens of aging masonry shops collapsed and between 600 and 
1,000 houses were damaged, officials estimated. Building inspectors 
indefinitely closed the 40-unit Arundell Circle apartment complex and a 
two-story residential hotel that was home to more than 100 field laborers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't get anything -- not even shoes," said Pedro Barajas, 53, who was 
left homeless with his eight children after their apartment at the Fillmore 
Hotel was damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was in the newer eastern Ventura County communities of Simi Valley, 
Thousand Oaks and Moorpark that the estimates of devastation rose most sharply. 
</P>
<P>
 The Moorpark College library and gymnasium suffered so much damage that 
officials said they may never be repaired. Thousand Oaks' large new library 
lost part of its roof. The Simi Valley courthouse and City Hall both had major 
water damage. Structural damage at Simi Valley High School was so severe that 
officials said they could not guess when students might return. 
</P>
<P>
 And parts of Simi Valley's famed Bottle Village, a one-acre enclave made of 
glass bottles, came crashing down. Like Gold 
</P>
<P>
 Much of Tuesday was devoted to the gritty task of survival, as residents hit 
hardest by Monday's disaster struggled to adapt, improvise and overcome. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake left many without the barest necessities: 82,000 homes and 
businesses were without electricity, 50,000 were without water, another 50,000 
had only intermittent water and 28,000 were without natural gas. 
</P>
<P>
 A freshly conscripted army of homeless -- often dazed, ill-clothed and barely 
able to find words to describe their plight -- sought safety in city parks and 
parking lots and unused patches of urban greenery. Tents, lean-tos and family 
vehicles were used for shelter; meals were cooked over portable barbecue pits 
and makeshift ovens. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the 20,000 who slept under Monday's starry skies had fled their unsafe 
homes after ceilings collapsed and buckled walls sent possessions flying 
willy-nilly. But some chose the outdoors simply because it seemed less confined 
in a world that was caving in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was afraid to be here," conceded Gladys Contreras, 32, who was camping 
beside the Echo Park Lake with her three children, ages 2 to 16. "But it was 
preferable to dying in my apartment." 
</P>
<P>
 For many of the new homeless, however, the seismic threat was soon replaced by 
by the prospect of urban danger. Worried about confrontations with the 
hard-core homeless or other nighttime menaces, some campers tried to find spots 
near police stations or National Guard outposts; others made their own security 
arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 Olga Gonzalez, who slept in a tent near the Los Feliz Boulevard entrance to 
Griffith Park, said her husband and another man stayed up all night to protect 
the children in their band of a dozen families. At about 3 a.m., she said, two 
coyotes came within 30 feet of their tent, but the men prepared to do battle 
with sticks. Later, a homeless woman with a dog trundled by and cursed at her 
new neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll stay 72 hours," said Gonzalez, 29. "They say that's when the earth 
should stay still." 
</P>
<P>
 The steady rocking of aftershocks sent many other anxious residents out in 
search of the bare essentials, triggering long lines at automated bank teller 
machines, gas pumps and hardware stores, where the repentant hastily stocked up 
on survival supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 At Granada Hills High School, people lined up for hours to get five-gallon 
jugs of water, courtesy of the city Department of Water and Power. One woman, 
criticized for going directly to the front of the line, yelled back: "My 
husband has had open heart surgery!" 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of others formed a long line at a Northridge hardware store, many of 
them seeking one particularly hot item -- an 18-inch piece of flexible copper 
tubing used for hot water heaters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I called around to 10 or 12 stores, and there's probably only about four 
plumbing stores open in the whole Valley, and most of them are totally sold out 
of them," said 46-year-old Don Wyatt of Chatsworth, who stood near the head of 
the line. "Today, these things are like gold." 
</P>
<P>
 Diapers were also worth more than their weight. "All day yesterday, I had to 
use napkins because none of the stores were open," said Maria Cisneros, a 
25-year-old Northridge resident who had spent two hours cradling her 2-year-old 
daughter outside a supermarket in North Hills. "Napkins don't work so well." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, I know," said Peggy Brister, who stood several places away in line with 
a baby of her own. "I'm down to tissues." 
</P>
<P>
 With supply low and demand high, reports of price-gouging began to surface. 
The son of Rose Castenada, an aide to Rep. Howard Berman (D-Panorama City), 
went out Tuesday to buy one of those copper tubes for the family's water 
heater. He was told the item, which usually goes for less than $10, was being 
sold for $30. 
</P>
<P>
 When he asked why the store was charging so much, a merchant replied: 
"Earthquake prices." 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Willie L. Williams called for residents who encounter such 
practices to contact officers immediately. But if there was meanness and 
profiteering, there was also charity and goodwill. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynnette Hargraves, 46, and her cousin, Jackie Johnson, 42, were frantically 
calling relatives on the East Coast from a pay phone after their apartment 
building on Reseda Boulevard was leveled. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have nothing. We lost everything. We need money," said the 
pajama-clad Hargraves, pleading for her relatives to send money by Western 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need water," Johnson said to a passerby. "We're staying in a park. We 
don't want to do that, but at least it's near a police station." 
</P>
<P>
 As she walked by, Patricia Story heard the two strangers crying. Without a 
moment's hesitation, she handed them $25 and a slip of paper with her phone 
number. "If you need a place to stay, I have a three-bedroom house," she said 
soothingly. 'Bust Our Butts' 
</P>
<P>
 Even as officials continued to take stock of the damage wrought by Monday's 
earthquake, the rebuilding efforts began throughout Southern California, 
hurried in part by the forecast of rain by Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Reconstruction of the junction of the Golden State and Antelope Valley 
freeways was Caltrans' top priority because of its role as a commercial 
umbilical cord linking Northern and Southern California, said Dean Dunphy, 
state secretary of Business, Transportation and Housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to bust our butts to get this done as fast as possible," Dunphy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleanup crews will work around the clock to clear the rubble -- an exercise 
that should take at least a week, Dunphy said. Meanwhile, a nearby road will be 
resurfaced to provide a detour during the construction. 
</P>
<P>
 To expedite the freeway repairs, Caltrans is short-circuiting the bidding 
process and expediting construction permits so contracts can be awarded within 
weeks instead of months, said Caltrans chief bridge engineer Jim Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
 Further greasing the skids, U.S. Transportation Secretary Federico F. Pena -- 
dispatched to Los Angeles by President Clinton in advance of his own visit here 
today -- said four contracts, totaling $3.4 million, were immediately awarded 
to help clear freeway debris. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anywhere along the line where we can cut red tape, we will do that," said 
Pena after touring damaged areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans also announced it would ask an independent panel of engineering 
experts to review the state's program of retrofitting highway bridges to resist 
earthquake damage. The panel was established after the 1989 Loma Prieta quake 
collapsed a double-decked section of the Nimitz Freeway in Oakland and damaged 
part of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we are trying to do is get the very best science, get the best 
structural engineers to review our work so we are not sitting here thinking we 
know everything," said Caltrans Director Jim Van Loben Sels. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, work crews were out before dawn taking aim at the crumbled stretch of 
Santa Monica Freeway, where a 200-foot concrete bridge collapsed onto La 
Cienega Boulevard. In a task that seemed as daunting as breaking apart an 
iceberg with an ice pick, workers used two hydraulic hammers, mounted on large 
trucks, to begin chipping away at the concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene attracted hundreds of spectators -- and catering trucks to feed 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the region's celebrated freeway system lay in shambles, there was 
good news for subterranean commuters. After a one-day closure, the Red Line 
subway reopened Tuesday with reduced service and officials said the tunnels 
sustained no visible earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 As aftershocks from the quake's destructive punch continued to ripple across 
Southern California, the cleanup campaign also was being waged on an 
environmental front. Near Newhall, crews scrambled Tuesday to contain a 
15-mile-long slick of crude oil that spilled into the Santa Clara River after a 
nearby Arco pipeline ruptured. 
</P>
<P>
 Booms were put into the river to stop further flow toward the ocean, while 
workers attempted to remove the oil from the water surface with vacuums and 
pads. Still, more than 1,000 barrels of oil had spread from Santa Clarita to 
Piru, triggering concern about the impact on the river and its wildlife, 
including two federally endangered species -- a fish known as the unarmored 
three-spined stickleback, and a bird, the least Bell's vireo. 
</P>
<P>
 To the south, Anaheim city officials -- hoping for state and federal disaster 
aid -- mapped plans to repair Anaheim Stadium, where the 35,000-pound message 
board and instant-replay screen crashed down and the landmark "Big A" atop the 
stadium was bent backward at a 45-degree angle. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had significant damage -- several million dollars damage," said city 
spokesman Bret Colson. "Obviously, it's dwarfed by what's happened in Los 
Angeles County, but we've taken a pretty big hit too."

 Preliminary estimates on the cost of the earthquake's damage varied greatly. 
Richard Krimm, associate director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, 
said it would exceed the $1.1 billion remaining in FEMA's disaster fund, 
already depleted by last summer's Midwest floods and last fall's wildfires 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government was the target of widespread criticism for slow and 
inadequate response to disasters before Clinton's watch -- most notably 
Hurricane Andrew -- and the President clearly wants to send a strong signal 
that his Administration is compassionate and efficient when it comes to 
providing emergency aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as bureaucracies sprung into action, individual response efforts emerged 
on various fronts -- sometimes in frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 Moz Dhanani, reservations manager for El Monte RV Center, said he offered to 
FEMA about 25 motor homes for use during the week, but the agency has expressed 
no interest in his offer. 
</P>
<P>
 He complained that despite having left numerous messages, officials had not 
returned his calls. The motor homes are heated, can accommodate six and have 
cooking facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see small children sleeping in parking lots . . . yet we have all these 
motor homes just sitting around," Dhanani said Tuesday. "We feel very 
frustrated." 
</P>
<P>
 Local charities said that, with Tuesday's improved telephone service, offers 
of help have begun to stream in from individuals and small groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "The shock is beginning to wear off and now we're getting a tremendous number 
of calls from people who want to help," said Susan Weight, spokeswoman for 
Catholic Charities, the social service arm of the Los Angeles Roman Catholic 
Archdiocese. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're asking for non-perishable food items, paper diapers, baby formula, new 
blankets and especially cash. Cash is absolutely what we need the most, because 
it can be converted into whatever is needed," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the early promise of public outpouring, Weight admitted concern for 
meeting everyone's needs, given the enormity of the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little concerned, because this is the largest disaster to ever hit Los 
Angeles, in terms of the number of people needing help," she said. "This is 
going to take all of us, everyone, coming together."

AMID RUINS, CLUES TO DEEP MYSTERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LEE HOTZ, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amid a cacophony of distant sirens, helicopters and sputtering gas mains, 
Caltech earthquake geologist James F. Dolan was taking testimony from the bowed 
picket fences, whip-snaked foundations and buckled sidewalks north of the 
epicenter of Monday's 6.6 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The evidence he collected told a story of how in a pre-dawn instant the full 
force of the Northridge quake surged up from a point 10 miles beneath the 
ground to break the surface almost two miles north, in the front yards of a few 
suburban households in Granada Hills. His findings also seem to indicate that a 
complex web of several faults -- rather than a single one -- were involved in 
Los Angeles' largest temblor in modern history. 
</P>
<P>
 This is urban geology on the fly, the art of reconstructing seismic mechanisms 
forever hidden deep in the earth. 
</P>
<P>
 From cracks in the asphalt, broken pipes and crumbled paving stones, Dolan 
identified what appeared to be a half-mile string of cracks and buckles several 
blocks north of the Simi Valley Freeway and one block south of the Mission 
Hills fault. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as anyone could tell so far, it was the only point where the earthquake 
literally surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
 In the widespread rubble left by the violent pre-dawn seismic spasm, the 
distinctive zig-zag imprint was easily overlooked. But Dolan, picking his way 
through debris in a battered pair of Italian hiking boots, had no trouble 
tracing the rupture, following the telltale signs like a trail of small crumbs 
dropped in the suburban wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
 In a gaping hole in the middle of Balboa Boulevard, it was evident to Dolan 
that gas mains and water pipes had been shoved together, crumpled and then 
jerked apart. Water bubbled from the gas main and the heady reek of gas spewed 
from the water main. 
</P>
<P>
 Two blocks away on Amestoy Avenue, the action of the rupture shoved Cindy 
Carter's house off its foundations and displaced one end of the hedge by her 
front door two feet to the west. Nearby, in front of Harold O'Hallorn's modest 
ranch house on Flanders Street, it buckled the sidewalk and popped the 
curbstones. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolan surveyed the site and told the two homeowners: "This is where all the 
energy of that earthquake came to the surface. I think you guys are at the 
proverbial ground zero. 
</P>
<P>
 "The upshot of all this," Dolan said, "is that the back of the house on that 
side of the street and the back of that house across the street are a foot 
closer." 
</P>
<P>
 Based on preliminary analysis, the evidence seems to suggest the quake 
involved the Mission Hills Fault, which runs north of the 118 Freeway. The 
easternmost portion of the extensive Oak Ridge fault system, which runs west to 
the sea, was the actual source of the vertical thrust that generated the quake, 
seismologists believe. 
</P>
<P>
 This implicates a new portion of the intricate pattern of faults underlying 
the Los Angeles basin. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Caltech Seismological Laboratory on Tuesday, scientists said the 
aftershock pattern also could involve portions of the San Fernando and Santa 
Susana fault zones. They even held out the possibility that last week's swarm 
of earthquakes in Santa Monica could have been precursors to the Northridge 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 They believe the actual stretch of the Oak Ridge fault system responsible for 
the Northridge quake is an offshoot called the Frew Fault, which apparently has 
not been active for half a million years. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltech seismologist Kerry Sieh described the 20-million-year-old Oak Ridge 
Fault in the San Fernando Valley as very steep, capable of rupturing in a quake 
as strong as Monday's temblor about every 200 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Seismologists Egill Hauksson of Caltech and Ken Hudnut of the U.S. Geological 
Survey cautioned that all of the ideas about what faults may have been involved 
in Monday's quake were still only informed speculation. 
</P>
<P>
 It may be months before scientists and earthquake experts like Dolan can 
assemble their educated guesses, insights and seismic data into anything 
resembling a complete picture of what happened so deep beneath surface in a few 
seconds Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, scientists hope that the information will give them an important 
insight into the inscrutable mechanisms driving the Pacific Plate past the 
North American plate and elbowing Los Angeles on its slow journey north past 
San Francisco to Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
 Earthquakes caused by thrust faults, like the one thought to be responsible 
for the Northridge quake, are especially difficult to analyze because they 
rarely cause any rupture on the surface. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to the dramatic fissures left in the aftermath of other earthquakes, 
the narrow rupture Dolan mapped Tuesday is no more than a snag in the earth's 
fabric. But to geologists trying to penetrate the veil of asphalt and concrete 
that normally masks clues to the dozens of faults buried deep beneath the Los 
Angeles basin, it may be invaluable. 
</P>
<P>
 "All these faults are paved," Dolan said. "In order to get access to the 
earthquake history normally, we have to dig up city streets." 
</P>
<P>
 As Dolan tramped through the debris around Balboa Boulevard in Granada Hills, 
he crossed paths with half a dozen senior state geologists studiously working 
the same area like field analysts trying to decipher the sedimentary bedding of 
the Grand Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 The small scars in the earth they were mapping will become the raw material 
for heated scientific arguments in the weeks to come. "A big earthquake like 
this really is a schizophrenic experience for us seismologists," Dolan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is really exciting scientifically, but the exhilaration of trying to 
understand what nature is doing wears off when you are staring at buildings 
that collapsed and killed people." 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Kenneth Reich also contributed to this story. Finding 
Faults 
</P>
<P>
 Some scientists at Caltech and the U.S. Geological Survey say Monday's 
Northridge earthquake probably occurred in the Oak Ridge Fault system. One 
quake geologist, Caltech's James Dolan, on Tuesday found a half-mile surface 
disturbance on the Mission Hills Fault in Granada Hills north of the Simi 
Valley Freeway and about two miles north of the epicenter in Northridge. Other 
scientists reported hat aftershocks have been occurring in two other fault 
zones, the Santa Susana and the San Fernando. These findings indicate that, as 
with several recent big quakes in California, more than one fault may have been 
involved Monday.

APARTMENT COLLAPSE PROBE RAISES QUESTIONS ON CODES; SAFETY: PLYWOOD 
CONSTRUCTION WAS NOT REQUIRED WHEN COMPLEX WAS BUILT. BUILDER SAYS RULES WERE 
FOLLOWED. 
</P>

<P>
 The San Fernando Valley apartment complex that collapsed and killed 16 people 
Monday was built like thousands of other structures throughout Los Angeles -- 
without plywood reinforcement that gives extra strength to walls during 
earthquakes, according to preliminary reports from city and state building 
officials Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Plywood reinforcing has been used to meet city and state building codes that 
were strengthened after the 1971 Sylmar earthquake, but it was not required 
when the apartment complex was built, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have not pinpointed the cause of the building's dramatic 
failure, but they said they will evaluate whether it was an isolated incident 
or one that indicates a widespread problem. 
</P>
<P>
 They also said they will examine whether old wood-frame buildings should be 
required to meet more stringent standards, as is now required of unreinforced 
masonry buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Heller, whose company built the apartment building that collapsed, said 
the building was constructed according to existing codes then and with "every 
earthquake device that was required . . . and I think that included plywood." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just awful," he said of the collapse. "I really have no idea what 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
 In a published report, the building's designer also said that he was at a loss 
to explain the collapse, but speculated that a violent upward thrust from the 
quake was to blame. "I feel terrible. . . . As far as I'm concerned, there's no 
way to attach blame to anybody," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When construction got under way in 1972, the 163-unit Northridge Meadows 
Apartments met existing codes, officials said Tuesday. Experts said the 
three-story wood-frame complex relied only on its exterior stucco and interior 
walls to withstand lateral shaking from an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "What struck me more than anything else was that the building used stucco and 
plaster or drywall inside, which provided the lateral resistance," said Richard 
Renous, senior structural engineer with the state Office of Emergency Services, 
after visiting the collapsed building. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't see any plywood," Renous said. "There may not be any plywood in that 
building at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Harder, manager of the city building department's office in Van Nuys, 
said: "The preliminary report (on the building) is that there was no plywood." 
But Harder said he was unable to locate architectural drawings. 
</P>
<P>
 The code, he said, now requires 50% more lateral strength in walls, resulting 
in "extra use of plywood throughout most buildings. . . . You can't build a 
three-story building without plywood." 
</P>
<P>
 The building's architect, Morris Brown of Lompoc, told Newsday that the 
building was designed to conform to the codes in force at the time and 
recollected that plywood was required. But he said that even the most stringent 
codes and modern construction techniques cannot protect a building hit by the 
full force of an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no such thing as earthquake-proofing them, only making them 
earthquake resistant," Brown said. "If you're on an epicenter, who knows what 
will happen?" 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say that although most apartment buildings survived Monday's 
6.6. temblor, the collapse of the Northridge Meadows apartments underscored the 
need to evaluate whether older buildings should be upgraded to meet modern 
earthquake standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "The codes are totally inadequate," said City Councilman Hal Bernson, whose 
district suffered the brunt of Monday's damage. "Maybe we can save some people 
in the next one." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Richard Alarcon separately introduced a motion Tuesday directing 
building officials to assess any damage across the city that may have resulted 
from code violations and recommend ways to prevent it. 
</P>
<P>
 Building officials said that inspecting all apartment buildings built before 
1973 would be a massive undertaking. Requiring owners to add plywood would be 
costly, they said, because walls would have to be opened. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said they will not immediately investigate why the Northridge 
complex collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a forensic problem," said Nick DelliQuadri, senior structural engineer 
for the city of Los Angeles building department. "Right now we're trying to 
sort out what other buildings are ready to fall down." 
</P>
<P>
 He said inspectors Tuesday morning ordered evacuation of six or seven 
buildings in the Northridge area, but he declined to describe them or identify 
them by address. 
</P>
<P>
 Renous cautioned that only a detailed investigation will determine the exact 
cause of collapse of Northridge Meadows. Soil condition may have been a factor 
in the building's failure, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He pointed out that the vast majority of similar structures did not collapse. 
"There are lots of three-story buildings built about the same time, probably 
built the same way, and they did not fail," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar building next-door to the Northridge Meadows complex, built about 
the same time by the same developer and architect, remained standing after the 
earthquake, though it was damaged by severe cracking. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is how we experience damage," said Steve Kiefer, senior building 
inspector with the Building and Safety Department. "You can have one block 
that's totally devastated, and an adjacent block where the pictures are still 
standing (on the walls)." 
</P>
<P>
 Conventional wisdom is that wood-frame buildings, especially apartments, tend 
to survive earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not the type of building that you would have expected to fail," said 
Warren O'Brien, head of the city Building and Safety Department. "Apartment 
buildings are pretty resilient to earthquakes because they have so many walls." 
</P>
<P>
 But fire officials said the first floor of the Northridge building, built 
partly over carports, moved several feet and collapsed, bringing the second and 
third stories down. 
</P>
<P>
 "It must have been some torque kind of force that moved the front about six 
feet north and the rear about six feet south," said Fire Battalion Chief Bob 
DeFeo. "When it did that, the bottom floor went like a house of cards." 
</P>
<P>
 Bodies of 16 residents were pulled from the wreckage by special 
search-and-rescue teams using electronic devices to detect victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Records show that on July 30, 1970, Heller Construction Co. of Tarzana took 
out a permit to build Northridge Meadows on Reseda Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The city granted a certificate of occupancy on the building in March, 1973, 
records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson said the city should consider taking measures to require apartment 
complexes like Northridge Meadows to meet stiffer seismic safety standards, 
just as the council has required for old reinforced masonry buildings. In 1981, 
a city ordinance was passed that compelled owners of the brick structures to 
reinforce their properties to meet tougher earthquake standards. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar effort involving pre-1974 wooden frame buildings, he acknowledged, 
may encounter political opposition from owners reluctant to make costly 
repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson said he is concerned that the Northridge Meadows apartments were 
constructed partially over carports, which may increase the danger of collapse. 
"I was the same type of construction they had problems with after the Loma 
Prieta collapse," he said of the 1989 quake in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Current codes in Los Angeles allow carports under apartment buildings but the 
construction standards are stiffer than during the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson also called for an investigation into the collapse of relatively new 
parking structures in his district -- one on the Cal State Northridge campus 
and two at the Northridge Fashion Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Mall officials could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 But George Snead, principal architect for California State University, said 
the Cal State Northridge parking structure that collapsed in the quake had met 
all building requirements then in force. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Cal State officials said the 2-year-old CSUN parking structure served 
as the model for a systemwide seismic inspection program. 
</P>
<P>
 Several sections of CSUN's four-story parking structure fell in a pile of 
cement rubble. No one was in the 2,447-car structure when it fell. 
</P>
<P>
 The parking garage was built with a combination of precast and cast-in-place 
construction methods, CSU officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Renous, with the state Office of Emergency Services, said the parking complex 
collapsed like a pancake, but pointed out: "It was right over the epicenter of 
the earthquake."

COLUMN ONE; THE LONG AND UNEASY NIGHT AFTER; DEMONS, REAL AND IMAGINED, HAUNT 
RESIDENTS IN THE WAKE OF MONDAY'S QUAKE. 'THE DAY IS MORE EASY,' ONE NEWLY 
HOMELESS WOMAN SAID. TO MANY, DARKNESS MEANT ANXIETY, ANGUISH AND AFTERSHOCKS.

<P>
 And then night fell. 
</P>
<P>
 The screaming sirens and staccato din of television helicopters had all but 
disappeared. Burned-out cars and buckled freeways lay silent. Homes lay in 
ruins. All that initial upheaval had subsided, leaving the city to bed down 
under curfew, on edge, alone in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
 After a day of catastrophe, many in Los Angeles worked their own twist on the 
words of the poet Dylan Thomas: They did not go gently. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, they entered a night of uncommon trepidation. They found themselves 
confronting demons both real and imagined. In the long hours before dawn, weary 
residents tried to find rest, sometimes amid homelessness and despair. All the 
while, they wondered if the darkness -- which had delivered Monday's temblor -- 
would strike again. 
</P>
<P>
 "The day is more easy," said Zoila Zuleta, who along with her three children 
curled up on flattened cardboard boxes in the parking lot of a Lucky 
supermarket in Sepulveda. "The night. . . ," her voice drifted off. "The night 
is awful." 
</P>
<P>
 Some left homeless huddled under blankets in store parking lots. Others slept 
in their own homes, but with one eye open, removing the mirror from above the 
dresser, wrapping the favorite vase in towels, putting the running shoes by the 
bed -- just in case. In Woodland Hills, shaken residents fought fears of the 
night in grand style: They threw a block party. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands camped out in parks, unwilling or unable to go home. Far-flung 
commuters got up in the wee hours -- 3 a.m. in the case of one Antelope Valley 
man -- to beat a freeway rush that was expected to be hellish but wasn't. 
Motels in Lancaster filled up, with Santa Clarita Valley residents hungry for 
electricity and hot showers. 
</P>
<P>
 Aftershocks rocked the region, making for restless slumber. Would the next one 
be the magnitude 5 that seismologists were predicting? Or would it be bigger? 
Would the terror grow only worse? 
</P>
<P>
 The military arrived, in the form of the National Guard, rumbling through 
Reseda in convoys of camouflage. People went to work -- as police officers, 
highway workers and hostesses in all-night diners. 
</P>
<P>
 And the rest? They just tried to make it until morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonio De La Cerda, paralyzed from the waist down and blind in his left eye, 
was not worried about himself. It was his sister, Adelaide, who kept him up all 
night. She is terrified of earthquakes. And so with every tremor, her 
63-year-old brother -- catnapping in his clothes -- hoisted his 168-pound frame 
out of bed and into his red wheelchair to check on her. 
</P>
<P>
 Each aftershock was like a mini-athletic contest for the Glendale man. With 
each, he improved his time. "Usually, it takes me a minute to get out of bed 
into the wheelchair," De La Cerda said. "But with the tremors, I had it down to 
30 seconds." 
</P>
<P>
 Others spent restless nights in makeshift encampments that sprung up 
throughout the San Fernando Valley, Downtown, Hollywood and wherever people 
were too afraid to go back inside. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sepulveda, a few miles east of the quake's epicenter, frightened families 
were drawn to the supermarket lights, unwilling to retreat into the shadows. 
With the red Lucky sign casting an eerie glow in the parking lot, a couple and 
their children huddled beneath a tent of bedsheets stretched between two cars. 
</P>
<P>
 At midnight, tiny fires in barbecue pits dotted Van Nuys' Woodley Avenue Park, 
glowing red and orange against an onyx sky. With temperatures dipping, children 
shivered in coats and blankets. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the huge Sears building in Hollywood, newlyweds Fantasia Owens and 
Gerald Jackson sat somberly in their Honda Civic, Fantasia clutching a large 
teddy bear. It was silly, she admitted, before anyone even asked, but the thing 
made her feel better. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, I kind of need one," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not far away, Anaiet Rezyan and her husband set up camp in their front yard, 
abandoning a two-story house filled with broken glass and badly cracked walls. 
A few neighbors had joined them, sleeping on mattresses laid out on the grass. 
Though scared, Rezyan clung to guarded optimism that no larger temblors were on 
the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life," she said, in English both broken and poetic, "will be continued." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Save for the huddled masses, the city's streets and open spaces were all but 
deserted. Here and there, in the glow of artificial light, human activity 
appeared in startling bursts. Highway workers toiled beneath the damaged span 
of the Santa Monica Freeway, bolstering it as best they could for fear it might 
fall in an aftershock. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Summit apartments in Warner Center, an impromptu block party broke out 
in the glow of a lamp carted outside. Elizabeth Reed, 33, who had lost $1,000 
worth of crystal to breakage, found herself dancing, grateful for the safety of 
her 4-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 The party, however, folded as quickly as it began. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the city, neighborhoods became neon-lighted ghost towns. The Los 
Angeles Police Department reported 73 arrests -- many of them for misdemeanor 
curfew violations -- far below the usual night's log. Fabled thoroughfares -- 
Melrose Avenue, Sunset and Hollywood boulevards -- stood eerily vacant except 
for an occasional passing car. 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Fernando Valley, long stretches of road were nearly black, 
illuminated only by tiny pink blazes of police flares. On La Cienega Boulevard, 
where the Santa Monica Freeway collapsed, there was a new sound: quiet. 
Residents who for years drifted off to the hum of passing cars found the 
silence unnerving. 
</P>
<P>
 Police accounted for much of the night's traffic. On the Hollywood Walk of 
Fame, four squad cars descended on three young men, who were handcuffed and 
whisked away for flouting the curfew. Yet in Van Nuys, patrons waltzed in and 
out of the only open spot for blocks around -- Perfect Donuts -- while four 
LAPD officers sat in the corner, sipping coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have to enforce it," one officer said, asked about the curfew. "You 
pretty much use your own discretion. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Hollywood, two off-duty officers found entertainment. They were 
guarding an aging, 40-unit building that had been evacuated and condemned. 
Yellow police tape and barricades outside blocked a sidewalk strewn with 
bricks. Inside, the officers had discovered a baseball bat and a plastic ball. 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed like a good night for a double-header -- or more. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're here till 6 in the morning," said Officer Don Ashley, 32, who then 
ripped a pitch against the far wall and shouted, "That was a home run!" 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after midnight, a convoy of six military trucks -- all loaded with 
National Guards troops -- rumbled down a freeway off-ramp in Reseda, escorted 
by police. 
</P>
<P>
 The trucks stopped at a deserted gas station, where four soldiers hopped out. 
They would reveal little about themselves -- no names or ages -- without the 
approval of their lieutenant. It soon became clear that these camouflage-clad 
soldiers were not quite certain what to do. 
</P>
<P>
 They murmured among themselves, donning flak jackets and riot helmets. One 
propped his rifle against a bus bench, only to watch it slip to the ground. 
"We're supposed to be a visual distraction," said one, puffing up his chest. 
"So as long as we're visible, we can stop the looting, stop the violent 
presence. We're the show of force." 
</P>
<P>
 However, there was little violent presence on the streets. In fact, the only 
people out for miles around were the Guard troops. 
</P>
<P>
 One said: "We're kind of in the twilight zone right now." 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of people felt that way. Writer Marianne Hooper, 32, who lives near the 
Rose Bowl in Pasadena, spent the afternoon loading the car with emergency 
supplies in case she, her husband and their two terriers had to evacuate. 
</P>
<P>
 As darkness closed in, with all its accompanying fears, Hooper took a Valium. 
That was at 7. At midnight, maybe 1 in the morning, she was still awake, just 
thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a sense of foreboding death," she said. "There were so many 
after-quakes. I thought maybe I was going to die. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Serrina Sims, 19, wasn't even trying to sleep. The young nightclub hostess, 
who lives just off glitzy Melrose Avenue, was sitting down for a midnight 
dinner at Canter's, "too scared to be in my own home." 
</P>
<P>
 She and three friends were planning to eat, then go over to one of their homes 
to watch rented movies -- "Rebel Without a Cause," "The Big Easy" and "The 
Grifters." 
</P>
<P>
 Friends and families yielded to a seemingly primal urge to gather together. 
Dan Woods' home in Santa Monica was damaged -- a fallen chimney, some cracked 
walls, a porch ripped away from the door. 
</P>
<P>
 So he, his wife, their three children and six guests from Australia descended 
on the home of a friend and slept on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Sleep came in fits and starts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, I got a few hours here and there," Woods reported later. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Feliz attorney Bill Moore picked up a roast in a jampacked supermarket 
and, along with his wife, served dinner for a friend whose Woodland Hills home 
was without electricity or a phone. 
</P>
<P>
 "We ate the roast, had some milk and cookies," Moore said, "and tried to think 
non-seismic thoughts." 
</P>
<P>
 But, of course, few found it possible to put quakes out of mind. The Pena 
household in Lincoln Heights was a model of preparedness. Vases were secured to 
cabinets with duct tape. Fresh batteries were popped into hand-held 
televisions. The gas was turned off. Tennis shoes were set by the beds. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone was issued a flashlight -- patriarch Pepe Pena, his wife, Rosie, 
their two sons and daughter-in-law. And everyone -- including 5-month-old 
grandson Alex -- went to sleep dressed in a jogging suit. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not the real Big One," Pena explained, "which is why we have to be 
prepared." 
</P>
<P>
 The reminders of the risks were not difficult to find. Against the darkness of 
the beleaguered city, one address was bathed in light: 9565 Reseda Blvd., the 
site of the crumpled Northridge Meadows apartment complex, where rescue crews 
spent the night in a desperate search for victims. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a surreal scene, with huge searchlights illuminating the sky, residents 
standing around in blankets and a Japanese journalist beaming shots back to 
Tokyo. Weary photographers, unshaved and unkempt, poised their lenses, readying 
themselves for the next development. 
</P>
<P>
 At precisely 1:27 a.m., it came. A rescue worker wheeled out a gurney carrying 
Victim No. 15. The body was wrapped in a white sheet. As the worker wheeled the 
gurney toward a dark blue coroner's van, the photographers clicked furiously, 
hustling for that perfect angle. One tripped over a police line, bringing a 
barricade crashing to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 A coroner's deputy, clad in a royal blue jumpsuit, opened the back doors of 
the van. The gurney was tipped up, the body deftly slid inside. The entire 
episode took less than two minutes. But it was more than enough to unsettle Pat 
Gould, one of the neighbors keeping vigil. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a good night for sleeping around here," she said.

PROBE TIES REAGAN, BUSH TO IRAN-CONTRA COVER-UP; INQUIRY: REPORT SAYS NEITHER 
BROKE LAW BUT ALLOWED EFFORT TO DECEIVE. EX-PRESIDENTS CALL CONCLUSIONS UNFAIR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Former Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush engaged in conduct that 
contributed to "a concerted effort to deceive Congress and the public" about 
the Iran-Contra scandal, according to the final report issued Tuesday by the 
independent counsel who investigated the affair. 
</P>
<P>
 In his findings, Lawrence E. Walsh concluded that neither Reagan nor Bush 
violated any criminal laws in connection with the affair -- in which the Reagan 
Administration secretly sold weapons to Iran in the mid-1980s in order to gain 
the release of American hostages in Lebanon and to generate funds to aid rebel 
forces in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
 But Reagan's "disregard" for limits imposed by Congress emboldened some of his 
Administration's highest-ranking officials to engage in illegal actions, Walsh 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He charged that Reagan "set the stage for the illegal activities of others by 
encouraging and, in general terms, ordering support of the Contras" during a 
two-year period when Congress had prohibited military aid to the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 As for then-Vice President Bush, Walsh said: "Contrary to his public 
pronouncements, . . . he was fully aware of the Iran arms sales. Bush was 
regularly briefed, along with the President (Reagan), on the Iran arms sales, 
and he participated in discussions to obtain third-country support for the 
Contras." 
</P>
<P>
 In separate statements released Tuesday, Reagan, Bush and several other former 
officials named in the report called Walsh's conclusions inaccurate and unfair. 
</P>
<P>
 Reagan termed the report "an expensive, self-administered pat on the back and 
a vehicle for baseless accusations that he could never have proven in court." 
</P>
<P>
 Bush said no one should try to criminalize what was "a political dispute 
between the executive and legislative branches over foreign policy." 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh's report, released by order of the panel of U.S. appellate judges who 
appointed him in December, 1986, marks the official end of a seven-year 
investigation that cost $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
 All told, 11 people -- including former White House aides Oliver L. North and 
John M. Poindexter -- were convicted of charges stemming from the 
investigation. North's and Poindexter's convictions were later overturned on 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 The report forecloses further legal action against any of the figures named in 
the probe and ends all scrutiny of them in conjunction with Iran-Contra 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 The final report, required of all court-appointed independent counsels, was 
written last August but kept under seal by the federal judges until those 
mentioned in it could state their objections and offer their views on the 
findings. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh, 80, a former judge and Wall Street lawyer with Republican credentials, 
said in an hourlong news briefing Tuesday that if facts now established had 
been known in 1987, Congress should have considered impeaching Reagan and his 
attorney general, Edwin Meese III. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Meese, Walsh said, who concocted a false account of key events in the 
scandal in order to protect Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 "It certainly should have been considered," he said of impeachment. "Whether 
it would ever have reached that point, I think, is doubtful. But the fact is 
Congress was deprived of that opportunity by the withholding of notes (by key 
officials)." 
</P>
<P>
 The report said senior officials and Reagan Cabinet members concealed notes 
about high-level deliberations and took part in a strategy to make lower-level 
staff members of the National Security Council, including North, the 
"scapegoats whose sacrifice would protect the Reagan Administration in its 
final two years." 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh's report, which is more than 1,200 pages long, concluded that "in an 
important sense, this strategy succeeded." He said he and his staff attorneys 
"discovered much of the best evidence of the cover-up in the final year of 
active investigation, too late for most prosecutions." 
</P>
<P>
 The arms sales to Iran during portions of 1985 and 1986, initially coming from 
U.S. stocks held by the Israelis, were kept secret from Congress and the public 
because they violated an arms embargo promoted by the United States on the 
grounds that Iran engaged in terrorism. Aid to the Contras -- prohibited by 
Congress -- was also kept secret. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House first acknowledged the arms sales and the diversion of profits 
to Nicaraguan rebels in a nationally televised news briefing in November, 1986, 
at which Meese presented results of an internal inquiry that he said he made at 
Reagan's request. 
</P>
<P>
 But Walsh's report charged that Meese, with help from Poindexter, "attempted 
to create a false account (of the arms sales) in order to protect the 
President." 
</P>
<P>
 Reagan steadfastly insisted during the last two years of his Administration 
that there was no connection between the arms sales and the release in 1986 of 
American hostages held in Lebanon by forces believed subject to control by 
Iran. 
</P>
<P>
 He also denied knowledge of any diversion of funds to the Contras. 
</P>
<P>
 "The evidence indicates that Meese's November, 1986, inquiry was more of a 
damage-control exercise than an effort to find the facts," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Congress held televised hearings into the matter in 1987, 
"congressional oversight alone cannot correct the deficiencies that result when 
an attorney general abandons the law enforcement responsibilities of that 
office and undertakes instead to protect the President," Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the news briefing, Walsh made clear that he thought the House and Senate 
investigations missed their mark widely. 
</P>
<P>
 "Congress didn't even call Vice President Bush or President Reagan," he said. 
"It didn't even ask for their depositions. . . . It went off on the theory of a 
runaway conspiracy, which proved to be an unsound thesis." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the report, former Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger was 
among key Cabinet members who were "consistently informed of proposed and 
actual arms shipments to Iran," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key evidence," it said, "was handwritten notes of Weinberger which he 
deliberately withheld from Congress and the OIC (Walsh) until they were 
discovered by the independent counsel in late 1991." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Weinberger's notes, as well as those of former White House Chief of 
Staff Donald T. Regan, disclosed that "Meese appeared to have spearheaded an 
effort among top officials to falsely deny presidential awareness of the Hawk 
transaction," a 1985 shipment of antiaircraft missiles to Iran, Walsh's report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then-White House Counsel Peter Wallison also "raised concerns about a conflict 
of interest" in allowing Meese, a presidential appointee, to investigate a 
White House affair, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring again to Weinberger's notes, Walsh said they "demonstrated that 
Weinberger's early testimony -- that he had only vague and generalized 
information about Iran arms sales in 1985 -- was false, and that he in fact had 
detailed information on the proposed arms sales and the actual deliveries." 
</P>
<P>
 Weinberger was among 14 people prosecuted by Walsh on such charges as perjury 
and conspiracy, but he was pardoned by then-President Bush before his trial, 
along with five others, on Christmas Eve, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharply criticizing Bush for the pardon, Walsh said in his report that 
Weinberger's case "marked the first time a President ever pardoned someone in 
whose trial he might have been called as a witness." 
</P>
<P>
 At his news conference, Walsh singled out Bush for additional criticism, 
saying "he will always have to answer for his pardons -- there was no public 
purpose served by that." However, he declined to characterize the Weinberger 
pardon as part of a cover-up engineered by the Reagan-Bush administrations, 
saying: "I had no proof that the pardon was conceived for that purpose." 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh was kinder in assessing Reagan's motives, telling reporters: "He was 
carrying out policies that he strongly believed in. 
</P>
<P>
 "He may have been willful, but he at least thought he was serving the country 
in what he did," Walsh said. "And the fact that he disregarded certain laws and 
statutes in the course of it was not because of any possible self-centered 
purpose." 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh's report noted that Weinberger and former Secretary of State George P. 
Shultz were the only members of Reagan's inner circle who opposed the arms 
sales. Yet, Walsh said, Shultz joined Weinberger in deceiving Congress about 
the extent of his knowledge about the arms sales, apparently to shield Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 According to notes taken by Charles Hill, Shultz's executive assistant, 
"Shultz knew that the shipments were planned and that they were delivered," 
Walsh said. But the report added that Shultz was never prosecuted "because 
there was a reasonable doubt that Shultz's testimony was willfully false at the 
time it was delivered." 
</P>
<P>
 Recounting notes from diaries obtained from Regan, Walsh said Shultz 
"expressed consternation over the Iran arms sales" shortly before congressional 
leaders were to be briefed on Nov. 12, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Regan's notes quoted Shultz as objecting that "this is swapping arms for 
hostages no matter what we say, and undercuts our efforts with allies, 
particularly Italians and (then-Italian Prime Minister Bettino) Craxi, who want 
to sell arms." 
</P>
<P>
 Regan's notes, according to Walsh, characterized Reagan, Bush and Poindexter 
as feeling that it was "too risky . . . to go public" at that point. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the arms sales had been publicly acknowledged, Regan's notes show that 
then-First Lady Nancy Reagan feared "we're risking the presidency." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked what that meant, Walsh said Regan told investigators: "That similar 
to Watergate, he (Reagan) might be impeached, that we were risking the 
President's tenure in office, his presidency and his reputation."

 * LOST LESSONS? Experts fear that scandal's lessons have been obscured. A27 
Iran-Contra Findings 
</P>
<P>
 Key findings of the report of independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh's 
investigation into the Iran-Contra scandal: 
</P>
<P>
 * There was no evidence that President Ronald Reagan broke laws, but he "set 
the stage" for illegal activities of his aides. He ordered "in general terms" 
the illegal efforts to aid the Contras. Reagan also authorized the illegal sale 
of arms to Iran in an effort to win release of American hostages in the Middle 
East. 
</P>
<P>
 * White House Chief of Staff Donald T. Regan, Secretary of State George P. 
Shultz and Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger withheld information that 
would have given Congress a clearer idea of the scope of the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 * Contrary to his public statements, Vice President George Bush "was fully 
aware of the Iran arms sale" and efforts to raise money for the Nicaraguan 
rebels from third countries. There was no evidence, however, that Bush broke 
any laws. 
</P>
<P>
 * Several Reagan Administration officials systematically withheld a large 
volume of documents relevant to the investigation. Notes kept by Regan, Shultz 
and Weinberger during the Iran-Contra scandal were withheld until late in the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese III falsely stated that Reagan did not know about a 
1985 Hawk missile shipment to Iran at the time. Walsh considered prosecuting 
Meese in 1992 for making a false statement but concluded that the passage of 
time would make it difficult to prove the case.

 The Scandal in Review 
</P>
<P>
 1985 
</P>
<P>
 JULY, AUGUST: Presidential aide Robert C. McFarlane receives a suggestion from 
an Israeli official that an arms deal with Iran -- using Israel as an 
intermediary -- might lead to release of American hostages held in Lebanon. 
McFarlane takes the message to President Reagan, and on Aug. 30 the first 
planeload of U.S.-made weapons is sent from Israel to Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
 SEPTEMBER: An American hostage, the Rev. Benjamin Weir, is released. 
</P>
<P>
 NOVEMBER: At McFarlane's request, the CIA ships a planeload of Hawk 
antiaircraft missiles to Iran without the legally required presidential order 
to authorize the action. 
</P>
<P>
 1986 
</P>
<P>
 JANUARY: Reagan signs a secret intelligence finding authorizing CIA 
participation in the arms deals with Iran but orders the process to be kept 
secret from Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 MAY: McFarlane and White House aide Oliver L. North fly to Tehran with a 
shipment of military spare parts, but negotiations break down on the release of 
additional hostages. 
</P>
<P>
 NOVEMBER: A second American hostage, David Jacobsen, is released. 
</P>
<P>
 NOVEMBER: The White House admits selling arms to Iran, but Reagan denies 
bargaining with terrorists or trading weapons for hostages. Atty. Gen. Edwin 
Meese III says $10 million to $30 million in arms-sale profits were improperly 
diverted to assist the Nicaragua contras, and asserts that no one in the White 
House knew about the diversion except North and national security adviser John 
M. Poindexter. 
</P>
<P>
 DECEMBER: Lawrence E. Walsh is appointed independent counsel by a panel of 
appellate judges, and both the Senate and House select special committees to 
investigate the affair. 
</P>
<P>
 1987-88 
</P>
<P>
 SUMMER, 1987: Congress holds nationally televised hearings on the scandal as 
Walsh pursues an independent criminal investigation with the assistance of FBI 
agents and a federal grand jury.  
</P>
<P>
 OCTOBER, 1988: Vice President George Bush runs for President, denying that he 
knew anything about secret arms-for-hostages deals with Iran, although other 
officials and White House documents contradict him. 
</P>
<P>
 1992 
</P>
<P>
 DECEMBER: Just leaving office, Bush grants Christmas Eve pardons to six major 
figures in the scandal, including McFarlane and former Defense Secretary Caspar 
W. Weinberger. 
</P>
<P>
 The Main Players 
</P>
<P>
 OLIVER L. NORTH: A retired Marine lieutenant colonel who worked at the 
National Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Iran-Contra connection: White House "point man" who arranged U.S. arms 
shipments to Iran and used the profits to assist Nicaraguan contras. Found 
guilty on May 4, 1989, of three felonies: altering and destroying White House 
records, accepting an illegal gratuity (a $13,800 home security system) and 
aiding and abetting in the obstruction of Congress. Sentenced to two years' 
probation, fined $150,000. The U.S. Court of Appeals later reversed his 
conviction on grounds that tainted evidence was used. A federal judge later 
dismissed the convictions at the request of independent counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently: Established a company that sells bulletproof vests; is planning to 
run for the U.S. Senate from Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 JOHN M. POINDEXTER: A retired vice admiral who was North's boss as national 
security adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 Iran-Contra onnection: Convicted on April 7, 1990, of two counts of lying to 
Congress, two counts of obstructing congressional investigators and one count 
of conspiring to cover up arms sales to Iran and diversion of profits to the 
Contras. He was sentenced to six months in prison. A three-judge appeals panel 
reversed the convictions on the same grounds as the North case, and the Supreme 
Court declined to review the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently: Runs a computer software firm in suburban Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
 CASPAR W. WEINBERGER: Secretary of Defense in the Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Iran-Contra connection: Highest former government official to be indicted in 
the scandal when he was charged in 1992 with obstruction and making false 
statements for allegedly impeding congressional and federal grand jury 
investigations of the scandal. Among the accusations were charges that as a 
member of the National Security Council he concealed handwritten notes relating 
to arms-for-hostages discussions. On the eve of trial, Weinberger -- who 
maintained his innocence -- was the chief beneficiary of Christmas Eve pardons 
granted by former President George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently: Chairman of Forbes Magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 ROBERT C. MCFARLANE: The White House national security adviser before 
Poindexter. 
</P>
<P>
 Iran-Contra connection: First top White House aide to work with North and led 
him on a secret trip to Tehran. McFarlane pleaded guilty on March 11, 1988, to 
four misdemeanor counts of withholding information from Congress. He was 
sentenced to two years' probation, fined $20,000 and required to perform 
community service. He was among those pardoned by Bush in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently: Washington consultant on international affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 WILLIAM J. CASEY: Director of the CIA during the years in question. 
</P>
<P>
 Iran-Contra connection: In appearing before congressional committees, he said 
no one in the U.S. government knew about 1985 shipments of U.S.-made arms from 
Israel to Iran, although later testimony by others -- as well as official 
records -- showed these shipments had been approved by Casey and other top 
officials. North testified at his trial that he kept Casey informed of his 
efforts to resupply the contras, but Casey never acknowledged that he knew of 
any diversion of arms profits. He died in May, 1987, before courts could 
determine his exact role in the scandal, and he never was charged with any 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 FAWN HALL: North's confidential secretary in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Iran-Contra connection: Testified that she systematically altered top-secret 
documents at North's direction in November, 1986, a day before Justice 
Department investigators began interrogating him. Testifying under a grant of 
immunity from prosecution, Hall also told of shredding some documents and 
smuggling out others in her clothing so North could keep them. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently: Recently married to author Danny Sugarman, she is living in Los 
Angeles and working on a book about her experiences.

INMAN QUITS AS NOMINEE FOR DEFENSE SECRETARY POST; CABINET: EX-ADMIRAL BLAMES 
PRESS AND POLITICS FOR HIS WITHDRAWAL. CLINTON APPARENTLY DID NOT TRY TO STOP 
HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Retired Navy Adm. Bobby Ray Inman abruptly withdrew Tuesday as President 
Clinton's nominee for defense secretary, saying he had been troubled by attacks 
on his reputation and by "reports" that Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole 
(R-Kan.) was preparing to begin a campaign against him. 
</P>
<P>
 The surprise withdrawal stunned official Washington and the defense community. 
It left the White House scrambling to minimize political damage to the 
Administration and to find a new candidate for one of the government's most 
important foreign policy posts. 
</P>
<P>
 Although aides said Clinton had known about Inman's intentions for several 
days, they said he had made no real effort to persuade the admiral to stay on, 
apparently believing it would be fruitless. 
</P>
<P>
 Inman's explanation came in a letter to the President and in an hourlong news 
conference from Austin, Tex., where he lives, that appeared to confuse 
Administration officials as well as those who the admiral said were attacking 
him excessively. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, Dole said he never opposed Inman's nomination nor had any 
intention of attacking him. "I have no idea of what's gotten into Bobby Inman 
or what partisan response . . . he is talking about," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Inman, elaborating on the issue at his news conference, said he had expected 
his nomination to win unanimous backing in the Senate Armed Services Committee 
and to be approved "handily" in the Senate, despite any opposition Dole might 
have mounted. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said that with a couple of exceptions, he found virtually all press 
and television coverage of his nomination to be fair. 
</P>
<P>
 Inman's principal complaint was about a Dec. 23 piece by New York Times 
columnist William Safire. It criticized Inman's performance as an intelligence 
officer and a businessman and called him a "tax cheat" for not paying Social 
Security taxes for a housekeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Inman alleged that Dole and Safire had made a deal under which 
the senator "would turn up the heat on my nomination" and "Safire would turn up 
the heat on Whitewater," the Arkansas land development and savings-and-loan 
flap involving President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Safire said Tuesday he would save any response for his column, scheduled to 
appear Thursday. Dole denied any suggestion of a possible deal between the two, 
snapping that Inman was "probably not qualified to be secretary . . . if he has 
fantasies like that." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have any habit of working out deals with the New York Times," Dole 
told a press conference on Cable News Network. "There's something strange about 
that letter," he said of Inman's withdrawal statement. "I don't know what it 
is, but it's not the real reason that he quit." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Administration's response was muted, it was obvious that the 
White House had been caught by surprise and that neither the President nor his 
senior staff had made any real effort to dissuade Inman from it. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials said outgoing Defense Secretary Les Aspin, who 
announced his resignation last month after prodding from the White House, will 
remain in office until the new nominee is installed. Aspin had set Thursday as 
his resignation date but was expected to stay on until Inman's confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
 While aides said White House officials began sounding out some candidates over 
the weekend, presidential Communications Director Mark D. Gearan cautioned that 
a replacement for Inman was "not imminent." The President "wants to talk to 
some people," Gearan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said two candidates now being considered are R. James Woolsey, 
director of the Central Intelligence Agency, and William J. Perry, now deputy 
secretary of defense, the Pentagon's No. 2 job. Each is widely experienced in 
defense issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Inman said Tuesday he had told a White House staffer about his decision on 
Jan. 6, but he did not deliver his letter to the President until Friday, to 
avoid disrupting Clinton's privacy after the death of his mother and his visits 
later to Europe and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials said Tuesday that Clinton "knew it was heading in this 
direction" before he left for Europe on Jan. 8, and did nothing to talk Inman 
out of it. 
</P>
<P>
 A White House official said Clinton and Inman talked by telephone for 10 to 15 
minutes Monday night, but the President made no effort to persuade the admiral 
to stay on. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President expressed his feelings but accepted the letter," White House 
Chief of Staff Thomas (Mack) McLarty said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Clinton sent Inman a terse, two-paragraph letter saying he would 
accept his withdrawal decision "with regret." 
</P>
<P>
 All told, the incident added another strange development to an Administration 
struggling with its public image. "At best, it's another problem for the 
President. At worst, it's a major embarrassment," said Joshua Epstein, a 
Brookings Institution analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), a member of the Armed Services Committee and a 
supporter of Inman's nomination, flatly denied Tuesday that either Dole or 
Senate Republicans had been set to oppose him. He compared the admiral's 
performance to that of Texas billionaire Ross Perot. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a theory that ranks right up there with Perot's allegation that Bush 
was going to disrupt his daughter's wedding," McCain told news services 
Tuesday, alluding to Perot's stated reason for withdrawing from the 
presidential campaign in 1992. Asked about a possible deal between Dole and 
Safire, McCain said: "I just find that very difficult to believe." 
</P>
<P>
 Inman, a retired four-star admiral, had been chosen to replace Aspin primarily 
to help Clinton restore credibility with the military and its backers on 
Capitol Hill. Inman had built a reputation in Washington as a skillful 
bureaucratic infighter. 
</P>
<P>
 But the former deputy director of the CIA and former director of the National 
Security Agency said Tuesday he had concluded that becoming secretary of 
defense was simply not worth all the criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the allegation about Dole and Safire is "true or not, I believed it 
was true on the (Jan.) 6th," Inman told reporters. "And that's the day I said, 
'I don't need this,' and made up my mind that, in fact, I was going to 
withdraw." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm simply not prepared to pay the current cost of public service in 
distortion of my record," he said at another point. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there was some speculation that Inman must have a deeper reason than 
he gave publicly for withdrawing from the nomination, longtime friends of the 
admiral's said they took his statements at face value. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert M. Gates, the former CIA director whom Inman defended in a contentious 
confirmation hearing in 1988, said he had "detected this frustration" -- over 
the Safire column and the Dole rumors -- in conversations with Inman. 
</P>
<P>
 "The important thing is not whether all those things are true," Gates said, 
"but the fact that they shaped his perception. I know there's a sense that 
something else is lurking there, but I think (what Inman said) is the story."

O.C. FREEWAY STRUCTURES TO BE REINFORCED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN and JEFF BRAZIL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like the 11 elevated highway sections toppled by Monday's earthquake in Los 
Angeles County, several of Orange County's busiest freeway overpasses run the 
risk of collapsing in a major earthquake, but officials said work is underway 
-- or scheduled -- to fix them. 
</P>
<P>
 The top priority now is the interchange of the San Diego and Costa Mesa 
freeways near John Wayne Airport, where work begins this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Of Orange County's 500 freeway structures, 80 have been identified as posing 
some risk and are included in the state's retrofit program. Seven reinforcement 
projects are underway and 12 more projects involving 48 structures are 
scheduled to begin this year, according to California Department of 
Transportation spokesman Albert Miranda. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's freeway structures are mostly of newer design and don't need to 
be "retrofitted" with extra support to minimize earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's two most vulnerable highway structures -- near the interchange of 
the San Diego and San Gabriel River freeways -- were reinforced after the 1989 
Loma Prieta quake in the Bay Area, according to Caltrans. 
</P>
<P>
 Retrofitting is also underway as of the installation of car-pool lanes on the 
Riverside Freeway where it crosses the Santa Ana River. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the remaining retrofits are also being scheduled to coincide with 
other freeway improvements, such as the massive Santa Ana Freeway widening 
project, in order to avoid changing things twice, Caltrans officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans launched a major program to inspect overpasses, bridges and highway 
interchanges after the disastrous Loma Prieta earthquake, when a double-decked 
segment of an interstate highway pancaked on a stream of rush-hour traffic in 
Oakland, sending the quake's death toll soaring. 
</P>
<P>
 Medhat Haroun, chairman of UC Irvine's civil and environmental engineering 
department, said that to the best of his knowledge none of the elevated highway 
structures that had been reinforced under the state's 5-year-old retrofitting 
plan had collapsed in Monday's quake, and this showed how important it was to 
carry on with the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bridges and overpasses will stand if they are retrofitted," he said. "But 
the only thing is, they should hurry up." 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Buchanan, a Caltrans project manager, said Caltrans engineers do not 
hesitate to issue change orders to get the latest and safest technology for 
ongoing projects, as they did on reconstruction of the Santa Ana-Garden 
Grove-Orange freeways interchange, where the contractor was told to add more 
reinforcing steel to decks and their supports. 
</P>
<P>
 And the same order went to contractors rebuilding other segments of the Santa 
Ana and Costa Mesa freeways, as well as the junction of the Santa Ana and San 
Diego Freeways, known as the El Toro Y. 
</P>
<P>
 But, warns Frank Weidler, Caltrans' deputy director for construction in Orange 
County: "There's no such thing as an earthquake-proof structure." 
</P>
<P>
 "At ground zero," said Weidler, "you're going to have a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Weidler said unmapped faults also pose a risk. "We look at the maximum 
credible earthquake from the faults that we know about" in designing the 
retrofits. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gone through and attacked this thing in a priority fashion, and we've 
retrofitted those structures (statewide) that were in imminent danger of 
collapse" in an earthquake, Weidler said. "I'm not particularly concerned about 
the structures (yet to be retrofitted) in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 Weidler explained that few if any structures here are based on old, 
single-column support designs. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith E. McKean, former Caltrans district director and now a consultant, 
agreed that the Northridge quake shows that new technology works. The Century 
Freeway survived; the Santa Monica Freeway collapsed. It hadn't been 
retrofitted. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are still several structures in Orange County that need to be done," 
McKean said. Taller structures are the most important, he added, because 
"they're subject to the most shear forces." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, guaranteeing structural survival would require a money-is-no-object 
approach, transportation experts agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can design a structure to withstand any earthquake, but you have to be 
willing to pay for it," said UCI's Haroun. "You can build to withstand (a 
magnitude) 8, but the expense is prohibitive. So what you do is you design it 
so if it's a 7, there will be some damage, but no collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me give you an analogy," said Haroun. "If I tell you to buy a car and 
money is no object, you go out and buy a Porsche. If I tell you to buy a car 
that will serve all of your needs, that will get you to work every day, you 
don't need a Porsche. The Porsche is available. It's out there. But you usually 
don't need it. Now if you're building a nuclear reactor or natural gas 
facility, you buy the Porsche . . . the consequences are great." 
</P>
<P>
 Haroun said most freeways, bridges and overpasses in Orange County would 
withstand a quake similar to Monday's temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 But he cautioned that it's the Newport-Inglewood Fault along the coast that 
poses the biggest threat, not the much-vaunted San Andreas fault out in the 
desert. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can get potentially more damage from a magnitude 7 on the 
Newport-Inglewood than an 8 on the San Andreas," which is much farther away, 
Haroun said. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Haroun: Monday's quake may serve a useful purpose if it reminds the 
Legislature of how much work remains. 
</P>
<P>
 "Memory about earthquakes is very short," Haroun said. "After a year or two, 
everybody says, 'Well, we have other things to worry about.' I think that was 
about to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Caltrans seized the moment after the Loma Prieta earthquake and they got the 
money for retrofitting. But I think if Caltrans had gone to the Legislature now 
and said they needed more money to do more retrofitting, the Legislature would 
have looked at the budget and said, 'Well, we have more pressing needs.' 
</P>
<P>
 "An earthquake every few years is good to remind people that this is a 
continuing problem that we need to be concerned about." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, he added, the wake-up call comes "too late for the Santa Monica 
Freeway," which was due to undergo retrofitting next month. 
</P>
<P>
 McKean, the former Caltrans district director, said projects such as the El 
Toro Y probably will not face delays because they have already been funded and 
are underway. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the tremendous financial burden of quake repair work may threaten 
projects that have not yet started, McKean said. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a result of what's happened they'll probably be looking at everything in 
terms of reorganizing priorities," McKean said. "And there simply isn't enough 
funding there to do everything and there's a lot of rebuilding that has to be 
done in L.A. County." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Caltrans announced Tuesday that it has completed a preliminary 
inspection of all bridges, overpasses and freeway construction projects on 
Orange County freeways in the wake of Monday's quake, and pronounced that all 
are open and safe to travel. Seismic Retrofitting 
</P>
<P>
 On seven Orange County freeways, 48 structures in 36 locations will be 
reinforced so they can better withstand an earthquake. The work will include 
outfitting with steel jackets or metal rods.

HOMELESS OR JUST FEARFUL, MANY CAMP OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

 Evoking images of Depression-era refugee camps, 20,000 people slept outside 
last night in more than 70 parks throughout the city. Officials say thousands 
more camped on front lawns and in driveways, parking lots and even median 
strips. 
</P>
<P>
 They huddled against cold and tried to cope with fears and indignities -- from 
aftershocks and the lack of food to roaming derelicts and an encounter with 
coyotes. 
</P>
<P>
 Cars were turned into bedrooms and sheets formed lean-tos in 
earthquake-ravaged parts of Los Angeles, from the hard-hit San Fernando Valley 
to neighborhoods scattered from Echo Park to the Westside. Many people simply 
refused to sleep indoors. Others without shelter did not know when they could 
return home. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have money, we don't have anything," said Marta Franco, who sat on 
shabby blankets in the park outside the Winnetka Recreation Center in the west 
Valley with her husband and five children. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake had split the walls and blown out the windows of their 
two-bedroom apartment nearby. It is likely they will never be able to move back 
in. They made it to the park with only a suitcase full of clothes, a stroller 
and the blankets. 
</P>
<P>
 Franco, 37, a nurse's aide and the family's sole provider, lifted the lid of a 
plastic cooler to reveal their entire food supply -- a package of hot dogs, a 
gallon of milk and a nearly empty jar of mayonnaise. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, dozens of other families were also camped out. Many were in cars they 
had driven onto the grass. Smoke from small charcoal grills wafted across the 
park. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a cruel deja vu for Franco. In 1976, an earthquake hit her native 
Guatemala City, leaving her family homeless for more than a month. But Franco 
said that experience was not as bleak. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything we had was destroyed," she said, "but the Red Cross came and 
brought food and camping equipment. My mother had a big stove and she was 
cooking for everybody. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was much better than this." 
</P>
<P>
 At Griffith Park, about a dozen families camped near the Los Feliz Boulevard 
entrance. Olga Gonzalez, 29, was there with her husband, Eddy Ortiz, and her 
five children. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time I've slept in a park," Gonzalez said. "I'm scared to 
death. The children slept, but they too were afraid." 
</P>
<P>
 The city Housing Department will dispatch bilingual workers today to try to 
persuade tenants to return to buildings that have been deemed safe by 
inspectors. They may not meet with great success, at least right away. One 
Building and Safety official noted that after the Whittier Narrows quake, it 
took the intervention of Catholic priests to persuade some renters to go back 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men in Ortiz's camp stayed up all night to protect the children. About 
3 a.m., two coyotes came within 30 feet of their tent, but the men held them at 
bay with sticks, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 As Gonzalez spoke, a homeless woman with a large dog came into the camp, 
rummaging though trash barrels for cans and cursing at the campers. Police 
occasionally drove past, warning them to be careful with their fires. 
</P>
<P>
 The 26 people camped out beneath two towering spruce trees are all relatives 
and friends, she said, adding that the adults didn't sleep a wink Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll stay 72 hours," she said. "They say that's when the earth should stay 
still." 
</P>
<P>
 She wouldn't stay longer, she said, because the children have not bathed in 
two days. Nine children are in the camp, including infants 3 months and 1 month 
old. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind a recreation center in a Granada Hills park, Suzanna Noyer, 23, and 
Donna Murillo, 29, stretched out on sheets of cardboard with their combined 
total of eight children, their husbands and Noyer's mother. All 13 of them live 
in a Granada Hills house, much of which they had seemingly brought with them. 
</P>
<P>
 There were stacks of blankets, a grill, several different kinds of cold 
cereal, wooden outdoor chairs, a couple of dogs and various kitchen implements. 
A sheet, hooked to a pickup truck and a couple of poles, was the only roof 
above their heads. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really could have stayed in the house," said Murillo, "but if there was a 
bad aftershock, can you imagine getting eight kids out of a four-bedroom 
house?" 
</P>
<P>
 As Murillo talked, her 1-year-old crawled into a patch of pancake syrup that 
had been spilled onto the cardboard. The older children played on playground 
equipment next to the closed, badly cracked recreation center, running over 
occasionally to grab the pancakes Noyer was making on the grill. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the pits," Noyer said, to no one in particular. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to those camping out, at least 4,000 people were sent to homeless 
shelters by the Red Cross and other agencies, officials from the Los Angeles 
Housing Department said. 
</P>
<P>
 All of those outside were not on lawns and in parks. With couches, milk-crate 
coffee tables and a television set -- powered by a network of extension cords 
running from an apartment building -- Ivan Mora and his neighbors made one 
corner of the parking lot behind a Lucky supermarket in Reseda feel a bit like 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's cool out here," said Mora as he leaned on his car and watched a Western. 
"We are better out here than inside." 
</P>
<P>
 There were at least three other TVs in the parking lot, which was filled with 
cars and lean-tos. Interior lights to cars revealed children crammed together 
under worn blankets. 
</P>
<P>
 One family had packed nine children and a functioning television set into a 
compact car. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the oddest camping scenes was the median of a busy six-lane street in 
North Hills, where more than 40 people gathered. 
</P>
<P>
 They were mostly residents of a nearby apartment building and said they wanted 
to be close by in case they needed to get belongings or to use the building's 
toilets, which they operated by filling the tank with water from the swimming 
pool. 
</P>
<P>
 The campers in Los Angeles' Echo Park lake had to endure numerous problems, 
including the stench of the freshly manured lawn, twice-a-day dousings by the 
sprinkler system and the lack of usable toilets. 
</P>
<P>
 Gladys Contreras, 32, was camping out with her three children, guarding them 
from unsavory park regulars. "One is always afraid of drunks who use drugs," 
she said. "We don't have anything to rob but they might do something to you if 
you don't have anything to give them. . . . I was afraid to be here but it was 
preferable to dying in that apartment." 
</P>
<P>
 There were no similar worries for Matt and Joyce Baker and some of their 
neighbors, who were sacked out on a front lawn in a Northridge cul-de-sac. 
There, amid ranch-style homes set off by carefully landscaped lawns in the 
upper-middle-class neighborhood, the children sipped juice drinks and snuggled 
in comforters. 
</P>
<P>
 A rented industrial light was powered by a portable generator. From a 
gas-powered grill came pork chops and hamburgers. 
</P>
<P>
 Homes there were not badly damaged. "We were just tired of rocking and rolling 
inside the house," Joyce Baker said. And she said that the families were 
actually having a nice time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who said you can't go outside at night in Los Angeles?" she asked with a 
laugh.

EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; QUAKE'S TIMING WAS BAD FOR BUDGETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH CONNELL and FREDERICK M. MUIR, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The timing of Monday's quake -- more than two hours before dawn -- was 
fortuitous in minimizing injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 But the disaster hit at a particularly bad moment for Los Angeles city and 
county governments, adding a tangle of financial unknowns to efforts to balance 
budgets and to put a better face on the area as a center of tourism and 
commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 While City Hall concentrated Tuesday on ensuring public safety and restoring 
essential services, there were growing fears that the crisis could drain scarce 
funds and complicate attempts to erase a looming $150-million budget deficit in 
1994-95. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's uncertainty on top of uncertainty, and it makes it very difficult to 
budget," said Deputy Mayor Robin Kramer, who coordinates legislative action for 
Mayor Richard Riordan. Both the city and county are in the process of drawing 
up their spending plans for the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, chairman of the council finance committee, said: 
"I don't think there's any question there will be a substantial financial 
impact. . . . All the budget assumptions are out the window." 
</P>
<P>
 Some officials said the costs could exceed those of the 1992 riots because of 
the extensive damage to highways, buildings and utilities across a wide area. 
County Assessor Kenneth Hahn estimated that the drop in assessed property 
values could be several times that resulting from the riots. 
</P>
<P>
 It was still too early to predict the city and county government costs. And 
the experience of some other natural disasters -- notably the 1989 Loma Prieta 
earthquake -- suggest that early fears of tax revenue losses may not 
materialize. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, city officials said the potential problems fall into two general 
categories: reduced tax collections, and coming up with the city's share of 
costs for emergency services and rebuilding public facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Damaged malls, stores and offices could mean a loss of sales tax and city 
business tax receipts, just when the stubborn Southland recession was showing 
signs of recovery, some officials and economists said. Also, taxes on utility 
use could be reduced by disruptions in services as well as by public response 
to pleas for conservation. Together, those levies account for about 25% of the 
city's $3.9-billion annual operating revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Department of Water and Power had restored electricity to more 
than 90% of its customers by Tuesday, power consumption was only about 60% of 
normal, Deputy Mayor Michael Keeley said. "That clearly has a financial 
impact," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, DWP spokesman Mike Moore said the preliminary estimate is that the 
utility will incur $150 million in added costs because of the earthquake. He 
said it is not clear how much of that amount will be eligible for reimbursement 
from the state and federal governments. Riordan has been hoping to tap the 
utility for funds, but Keeley conceded that the quake expenses may require a 
re-evaluation of the money potentially available. 
</P>
<P>
 Some warned that tourism and shipping, which also generates city tax revenue, 
could be at least temporarily discouraged by real or perceived problems with 
the area's transportation system, some officials and experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just couldn't have happened at a worse time," said professor Larry 
Kimbell, director of the UCLA Business Forecasting Project. "It could shift 
resources away from a city already under heavy budget pressure at a very 
vulnerable time." 
</P>
<P>
 With a strong show of support Tuesday by Clinton Administration officials, 
there was guarded optimism at City Hall that federal disaster relief programs 
will cover most earthquake-related overtime costs and damage to public 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, disaster relief programs for cities cover 100% of the added costs 
of emergency personnel for the first three days of a crisis, and 75% after 
that, said Pat Bennett, a spokeswoman for the Federal Emergency Management 
Administration. Reconstruction of public facilities is usually reimbursed at 
about 75% of the cost, she said. And various state programs can boost the 
reimbursement to more than 90%, said Ed Corser, a top city budget analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, given the potential scope of the losses, the city's share of personnel 
and rebuilding costs could be sizable, Yaroslavsky said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Los Angeles County Chief Administrative Officer Sally Reed said 
county costs of law enforcement and other services has reached tens of millions 
of dollars and will climb higher. At least 113 county facilities suffered some 
damage and at least 41 will remain closed for several more days, Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
 And Reed, who was the top county executive in Santa Clara County when the Loma 
Prieta quake struck, said recently adopted federal rules may reduce county 
reimbursements to half of the disaster-related costs. "It could be a problem, a 
real setback" for the already troubled county budget, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the earthquake may not have a significant adverse effect on tax revenue 
for the county, she said. After the Loma Prieta earthquake, Santa Clara County 
did not suffer serious reductions in tax collections, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the short term, "it's actually good for sales tax," she said. "People have 
to replace refrigerators" and other appliances and furniture.

EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; POLITICIANS TRY TO AVOID DISASTERS OF THEIR 
OWN; AFTERMATH: OFFICIALS MUST APPROACH CALAMITY AND HUMAN SUFFERING WITH JUST 
THE RIGHT MEASURE OF ACTION AND SENSITIVITY. WILSON HAS HAD HIS SHARE OF TESTS 
THIS TERM. 
</P>

<P>
 As Gov. Edmund G. Brown toured the devastation wrought by the raging Eel River 
on California's North Coast in late 1965, he reportedly summed up the awful 
flood scene with typical Pat Brown gusto: "This is the worst disaster since my 
election as governor." 
</P>
<P>
 The quotation became a Pat Brown legend in political circles, a classic 
example of the likable, well-meaning chief executive prone to verbal bumbling. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact is that the quote was remembered incorrectly. What Brown really said 
was: "It's the worst disaster I've seen since I've been governor." But the 
incident underscores the potential political disaster that can await any 
official who does not approach calamity and human suffering with just the right 
measure of action and sensitivity -- and choice of words. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier that same year, Brown's image suffered from the fact that he was 
vacationing in Greece when rioting broke out in Watts and from the perception 
that he dawdled in returning and was slow to mobilize the National Guard. 
</P>
<P>
 The potential for a political misstep can be magnified during disasters in a 
campaign, such as the one this year featuring Republican Gov. Pete Wilson and 
his potential 1994 Democratic challengers. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you handle a disaster coolly, it can help," University of Virginia 
political scientist Larry Sabato said Tuesday. "On the other hand, if you do 
something rash, it can hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has mastered the first rule of disaster politics by showing up promptly 
on the scene to assure people of government's concern and desire to do what it 
can to help. 
</P>
<P>
 If a politician fails to show in a timely fashion, Sabato said, "people resent 
the fact that you're not there sharing their misery." 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton will tour quake damaged areas today after getting assurances 
that his visit would not disrupt recovery efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has had plenty of practice responding to disasters. The extent to which 
California has been dealt a variety of catastrophes during his single term is 
becoming a political legend in its own. Wilson has issued disaster declarations 
covering 56 of California's 58 counties since taking office in January of 1991, 
said Dan Schnur, communications director for Wilson's campaign for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor inherited the impact of an ice storm and has gone through both 
drought and flood, toxic spills, the Landers, North Coast and San Fernando 
Valley earthquakes, and two rounds of devastating brush fires -- first in the 
Oakland Hills in 1991 and then the Malibu, Altadena and Laguna Beach fires last 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this comes atop the Los Angeles riots of 1992 and the worst economic 
recession since the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor's approach to disasters generally has been low-key and 
businesslike, beginning with an aerial tour of the affected region and 
briefings with federal, state and local officials on the magnitude of the 
problem and what's needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson promises to do whatever the state can to deal with the problem and help 
people recover. But he is cautious. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Wilson said it was too early to say whether any revenue increase 
would be needed even though the state budget currently is in the red. 
</P>
<P>
 "We simply do not know what the magnitude of the problem is yet," Wilson said 
on a television talk show. 
</P>
<P>
 On the day of the 1971 Sylmar earthquake, a touring Gov. Ronald Reagan quickly 
said he would support a temporary increase in the gasoline tax if that was 
needed to rebuild damaged streets and highways. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Wilson's handling of the 1994 earthquake creates any opening for his 
political opponents this campaign year will depend more on the pace of action 
in coming weeks in Sacramento and at the reconstruction sites in Los Angeles 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Failure to cope adequately with disasters has been blamed for the loss of 
mayorships in several major cities, governorships and other offices. 
</P>
<P>
 The venerable Richard J. Daley machine lost its grip on Chicago City Hall in 
1979 when Mayor Michael Bilandic's Administration failed to clear a heavy 
snowfall promptly. The Daley machine had boasted that its Chicago was the "the 
city that works." Maverick challenger Jane Byrne defeated Bilandic after citing 
the storm as evidence that "the city that works doesn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Testing in crisis has molded many political careers in California. Democratic 
Sen. Dianne Feinstein was on the verge of retiring from politics in 1978 -- at 
the time she was chairwoman of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors -- when 
Mayor George Moscone was assassinated and Feinstein became mayor. The keystone 
of her 1990 race for governor against Wilson was the "forged from tragedy" 
campaign ad showing her being sworn in as mayor after Moscone's slaying by a 
gunman. 
</P>
<P>
 Now seeking election to a full term, Feinstein promptly visited quake 
devastated areas this week and promised federal action as quickly and as fully 
as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, Sabato added: "It's hard to compete with a governor or a President 
in times of crisis because they have the troops. . . . They have to take the 
blame if things don't go well so it's only just that they take credit when they 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 Several California political experts said there is far more potential for 
suffering political damage than gaining credit. 
</P>
<P>
 Political consultant Darry Sragow said, "People have a legitimate expectation 
that government will do certain things, and when government delivers those 
services, it's only doing its job, so you're not going to win big points." 
</P>
<P>
 "On the other hand," he added, "history is replete with examples of officials 
who failed to do what people expected of them. They pay a price." 
</P>
<P>
 Sragow said he spoke on the basis of long experience working for political 
officials who have had to deal with such situations. He now serves as manager 
of state Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi's campaign for the Democratic 
nomination for governor, Wilson's job. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi on Tuesday made the rounds of Los Angeles television stations to 
discuss what earthquake victims could expect in terms of insurance claims and 
related topics. 
</P>
<P>
 But Garamendi also was making a broader statement about the need to repair the 
earthquake damage. "It's absolutely imperative that we do it, and do it 
quickly," Garamendi said in a pre-dawn appearance on KNBC-TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Was that, perhaps, a subtle or indirect challenge to Wilson to have the 
freeways up and running by next November, or face the wrath of slow commuting 
voters? 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson aide Schnur said: "We're going to rebuild and rebuild as quickly as 
possible, because that's what the people of California need. If someone thinks 
that isn't happening fast enough, they can be very hard-pressed to say how to 
do it faster." 
</P>
<P>
 As if to hammer home the point, Wilson chose the site of a freeway collapse -- 
the Golden State and Antelope Valley interchange about 25 miles north of 
Downtown -- to answer media questions Tuesday. As he spoke, state workers could 
be seen on television clearing the rubble in the background. 
</P>
<P>
 If there are political perils in dealing with a crisis, the risk can be even 
higher for a challenger or candidate, Sabato said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They risk appearing to be a scold or a grandstander, or even worse, as 
someone who's getting in the way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the overseer of insurance companies in California, Garamendi holds an 
office that has a direct stake in earthquake recovery, Schnur noted. Thus, 
Garamendi could seek media exposure without being accused of exploiting the 
disaster for political purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 The other major Democratic candidate for governor, Treasurer Kathleen Brown, 
was quietly touring earthquake-damaged areas, visiting with victims, and even 
helping give out food at Hollywood High School. Without notifying reporters, 
Brown went to a site of the Santa Monica Freeway collapse early Tuesday. 
Between stops she telephoned major bond-rating houses in New York to reassure 
them of the integrity of projects financed by state bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Wilson and Brown postponed major events planned this week in deference to 
victims of the earthquake. Brown had planned to deliver a political address 
Tuesday in San Francisco on her plans for the California economy. Although she 
could have tailored the speech to take account of the earthquake, she told a 
reporter: "I just didn't think that was the right thing to do. I live in Los 
Angeles. This is my town. My mind was on the crisis." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson postponed a long-planned "crime summit" in the Los Angeles area today 
and Thursday. It was to involve scores of top governmental and law enforcement 
leaders from around the state.

EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; SANTA CLARITA VALLEY BECOMES AN ISLAND; 
TRANSPORTATION: COLLAPSE OF OVERPASSES LEAVES MANY IN BEDROOM COMMUNITY 
STRANDED. JAMMED TRAINS OR HOURS-LONG ORDEALS ON CHOKED SIDE ROADS ARE MAIN 
ALTERNATIVES TO FREEWAYS.

 Fond of Western wear and their valley's rich cowboy lore, residents here like 
to think of themselves as an independent lot, comfortably insulated from the 
problems of their infamous neighbor to the south. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the wake of Monday's magnitude 6.6 earthquake, that coveted distance 
from Los Angeles has turned to isolation as the two main arteries south -- the 
Antelope Valley and Golden State freeways -- were closed with collapsed 
overpasses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just feel so cut off," said Linda Brader, who crowded into a Metrolink 
station Tuesday with her husband and scores of other trapped commuters, many of 
them sampling public transportation for the first time in an effort to avoid 
traffic jams and rumored six-hour trips Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 Power outages and faulty phone communication also contributed to a feeling of 
isolation, especially in the first hours after the quake. But transportation 
was the overriding issue Tuesday as thousands tried to leave this 
mountain-ringed bedroom community for jobs "over the hill" and quickly 
discovered a downside to their suburban lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 At 11:30 a.m., about 150 people jammed a local Metrolink station hoping to 
catch a ride on a specially scheduled train, diverted from its usual route 
between San Bernardino and Los Angeles to serve the Santa Clarita Valley 
exclusively. Instead of leaving on a regular schedule, the train waited to fill 
up, frustrating first-time Metrolink users trying to understand the system and 
decipher schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 Many would-be riders, like the Braders, gave up because they were not certain 
if they would snare a seat on the train or when they would reach their jobs. 
Others, like Louisa Menick, braved the wait rather than face time-consuming 
traffic jams on service streets such as the Sierra Highway, which runs parallel 
to the Antelope Valley Freeway but became treacherous with rockslides after the 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we looked at the TV and it sounded like a five-hour wait (by car), it 
doesn't sound like we have much of a choice," said Menick, who works as a 
bookkeeper in Hollywood and lives in a spacious, Spanish-style tract house in 
Canyon Country. Like many residents of the Santa Clarita Valley, Menick and her 
husband moved there so they could own a home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always thought that this is a marvelous community. The problem is that 
to afford it, you have to work in town because that's where the bigger money 
is," Menick said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half of the valley's 160,000 residents commute to jobs in Los 
Angeles, according to Santa Clarita officials, who were trying to make the 
two-lane Sierra Highway a one-way route -- south in the mornings and north in 
the evenings -- to ease traffic flow. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, getting from the Santa Clarita Valley to the San Fernando Valley 
has always been a problem, from the days of the Spanish Conquest to the 1971 
Sylmar earthquake, which also sent parts of the Golden State and Antelope 
Valley freeways crashing to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 The tenuous link between the Santa Clarita and San Fernando valleys evolved 
from a rocky Indian trail to a narrow hand-carved tunnel to its modern-day 
tangle of concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, though northbound freeways into the Santa Clarita Valley remained 
open, the southbound closures reminded residents and relief workers of the 
potential for shortages of food, gasoline and medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Insulin is my highest priority right now," said Donna Chesebrough, who was 
running a Red Cross shelter at Newhall Park, where 350 people spent Monday 
night. Many of those who sought refuge there and in other makeshift shelters 
Monday were the elderly, displaced from quake-damaged mobile homes and 
apartment complexes for senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Theda Jones, 76, said she normally requires insulin injections twice a day but 
had missed two doses since the quake because the drug requires refrigeration 
and power outages spoiled her supply. She took her situation in stride, though, 
saying, "I figure I can do for a few more days." 
</P>
<P>
 The urge to be with other people and leave home for a while drove many trapped 
locals to one of the few restaurants to stay open, The Famous Saugus Cafe, 
which bills itself as the oldest eatery in Los Angeles County. At lunch 
Tuesday, the cafe had a long line out the door and was packed with customers, 
including Canyon Country resident Ron Court, who was unable to get to his job 
as a film technician in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to get away from the house for a while and then go back and start 
cleaning up again," said Court, who ate with his wife and their five children. 
"It's a tough situation you have little control over. You just have to roll 
with it." Some saw the freeway closures as an advantage in keeping out 
post-quake sightseers and potential looters. Sheriff's Lt. Marv Dixon said 
Tuesday that there had been no arrests for looting and that reports of such 
crimes have so far turned out to be merchants checking on their businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's one of the prices you pay for living here," said Santa Clarita 
Mayor George Pederson of the transportation difficulties, adding: 
</P>
<P>
 "Cutting us off when this happens does keep out the looky-loos."

ON CALIFORNIA: A LOSS GREATER THAN THE SUM OF ITS PARTS

 Tuesday was a day for aftershocks. Dozens shook the basin, keeping everyone 
off balance. Not all aftershocks, however, rumbled up from the ground. Others 
were of a more personal nature, generated from within -- the shock of learning, 
absorbing, exactly what had been lost the day before. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I want," a young woman said bitterly as she stood in a courtyard below 
her damaged apartment, "is my stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 She spoke of her $10,000 china set, her new big-screen TV and other items. All 
damaged beyond repair. None insured. Of course she had known this before the 
sun came up Monday, after the first violent shaking. Still, a day later, she 
could not quite accept it and despite the dangers posed by the rickety building 
she felt driven to return to her apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to be able to see some of my stuff again," she told two of her 
neighbors. And then, fighting tears, she turned her face away. The neighbors, 
Joe and Hermine Cohen, seemed to understand the urge. They had just spent a few 
minutes wandering through their own apartment, taking stock of broken vases and 
furniture pieces, trying to sort out why they felt so bad. They knew it was 
about more than vases. They knew it was about more than stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 These people lived on Lassen Street in Northridge, right on the epicenter. 
Their block is one of large stucco apartment complexes, most thrown up a decade 
or so ago as part of a citywide dive into high-density dwellings. What the 
contractors threw up, the earthquake flung down. The apartments were still 
standing Tuesday, but most seemed only one good windstorm away from a 
knockdown. 
</P>
<P>
 All along the block, tenants were busy pulling what they could from their 
apartments. They came with friends and relatives, tiptoed into the wobbly 
structures and emerged with couches and kitchen sets and futons, with LeRoy 
Neimans and Little Tyke play cars, bird cages and barbecues. Their stuff. They 
worked fast. The building inspectors had not visited this block yet, and 
everyone seemed driven by the fear that once the buildings were condemned their 
belongings could be trapped behind the yellow police tape for a long, long 
time. Borrowed pickups and rented U-hauls were parked at crazy angles on lawns 
and curbs. Ignorant of the circumstances, the scene might have suggested that 
Cal State Northridge just broke for summer vacation and the students were 
heading home. Neighbor hugged neighbor and passed along temporary telephone 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Goodby, Angie," a young man in a Mighty Ducks jersey told the manager at the 
Lassen Village apartments. "It's been fun.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew the people who lived here," Angie Mendez said, passing out water and 
bagels in front of her building. "They were all lovely people. I had one man. 
His name was Vincent Delallio. Yesterday he went to every apartment and knocked 
and kicked down doors and made sure everybody got out OK. It's people like that 
that make this . . . understandable? Is that the right word?" 
</P>
<P>
 At other apartments the ambience was not so keen. Down the street, tenants 
stood in an angry cluster and railed about rent money and security deposits now 
owed them. "We got screwed!" one man shouted. Their complaints may or may not 
be legitimate, but their anger seemed like just one more psychic aftershock. 
Getting mad felt good. The tough part about an earthquake is that there is no 
one to blame. In the end, building inspectors and freeway engineers and stingy 
landlords make unsatisfactory patsies. The real "culprit" is nature, and what's 
the use of complaining about that? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The tenants on Lassen Street seemed strangely eager Tuesday to show off their 
damaged apartments. "Want to see inside?" they would ask. It seemed bad manners 
to turn the offer down, which meant several trips up dubious staircases, down 
shattered hallways, across twisted thresholds. Inside the apartments all looked 
alike, a terrible mess. To those who lived in them, however, there were 
important distinctions. 
</P>
<P>
 One man pointed to a demolished fish tank, and told all about the fish he'd 
kept in it for 15 years. Another lingered over a cracked dinette chair, 
explaining in detail why the rest of the set was in storage. Marred baseball 
cards, flattened beds, a glass bird with a broken beak -- all were on display. 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed what these tour guides wanted more than anything was outside 
acknowledgment of the dimensions of their loss. What they wanted to show was 
not just their stuff, but the stuff of their lives. See, they seemed to say. 
See how in just 10 seconds all of this was broken down, taken apart, scattered. 
And now, they asked, but again not in so many words, how are we supposed to 
pick up the pieces? Only a fool would pretend to know.

EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; MAN FREED FROM DEBRIS KEEPS FAITH; RESCUE: 
SURGEONS AVOIDED AMPUTATING THE LIMBS OF SALVADOR PENA IN A FIVE-HOUR 
OPERATION. THE MAINTENANCE WORKER WAS TRAPPED BENEATH A COLLAPSED PARKING 
GARAGE FOR SEVEN HOURS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Trapped under 20 tons of concrete for seven hours by the deadly quake, 
Salvador Pena never lost consciousness or faith. He prayed and he asked his 
rescuers to pray with him. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, it appeared that those desperate prayers, similar to prayers 
uttered all across Los Angeles in the moments and hours after the quake, had 
been answered. 
</P>
<P>
 In serious condition at UCLA Medical Center, Pena was alert, even cheerful, 
although still not out of danger. 
</P>
<P>
 Pena, 43, is struggling to recover from the damage wrought when the earth's 
shudder sent two floors of a parking structure at the Northridge Fashion Center 
tumbling onto him. Pena's doctor said five surgeons who operated for five hours 
Monday avoided having to amputate his crushed right hand and legs, but 
attributed their apparent success as much to luck as to medical skill. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this had happened during daylight hours, there would have been hundreds of 
Mr. Penas and not much we could do for them," said UCLA's chief of surgery, Dr. 
Michael Zinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Pena operated a power sweeper for a Van Nuys company under contract to the 
mall and was only 30 minutes into his shift when the quake hit, knocking the 
three-level structure's supporting columns sideways and trapping him on the 
first floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those who survived the quake, Pena was among the most severely injured. And 
his rescue, involving the will and ingenuity of dozens of firefighters and 
paramedics, was among the most dramatic. After drilling through two concrete 
slabs, rescuers dropped into the hole they had made and inflated four air bags 
-- each capable of lifting as much as 74 tons -- to move a concrete beam off 
his right arm and legs. 
</P>
<P>
 As bad as Pena's injuries were, rescuers had originally feared they were worse 
-- that his legs might have been severed, city firefighter Kurt Fasmer said. 
"He was absolutely scared stiff and so were we," Fasmer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the ordeal, paramedics remained at the injured man's side beneath 
the parking deck. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was in a lot of pain and he kept saying, 'Come down and pray with me, come 
down and pray," said Rey Lavalle, a Los Angeles City firefighter who spoke with 
Pena in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 Pena, a West Los Angeles resident, holds a $6-an-hour job with Industrial 
Janitor Service, based in Van Nuys. Jeff Starr, who owns the company, called 
Pena "a real conscientious worker" but said he knew little else about the man. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one can imagine how brave you'd have to be to get through that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pena is married and has at least one son, but his family was in seclusion at 
the hospital and unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Zinner said the five surgeons raced against time to save Pena's legs. They 
made incisions 8 to 10 inches long in his injured limbs to relieve swelling and 
reduce pressure in constricted blood vessels, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pena was still in danger Tuesday, both from possible kidney failure and 
from side effects of the damage to his limbs. Although Pena's legs will not 
have to be amputated, Zinner said he may not recover the use of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is still quite frightened because he can't move or feel his feet or lower 
legs," Zinner said. "But he's just remarkable -- bright and responsive. He's a 
wonderfully courageous man who is extremely lucky to be alive."

EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; POWER WEB FRAYED; SYSTEM IS SO INTERCONNECTED, 
QUAKE KNOCKED OUT ELECTRICITY IN IDAHO AND CANADA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG SMITH and THOMAS MAUGH, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the earth shook Monday morning, massive damage to vital power facilities 
in the northwest San Fernando Valley cut electricity from one end of Los 
Angeles to the other, the first time in history the whole city was blacked out. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was not all. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers in Alberta, Canada, lost their power too. In fact, as frantic Los 
Angeles Department of Water and Power officials were launching their battle 
with the city's worst power disaster, neighborhoods were flickering out from 
Nevada to Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside of Los Angeles, the most disruptive effects of the Northridge 
earthquake were in rural Idaho, where 150,000 customers lost power for three 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California's earthquake thus offered a dramatic illustration of how 
intimately the entire western states are interconnected in a gigantic and 
immensely complicated system that shuttles energy back and forth to protect the 
sockeye salmon of the Columbia River and help reduce smog in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the region's key role in the interdependence of the power system 
throughout the West, the quake could have triggered outages in much of western 
America. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the massive inconvenience experienced by Los Angeles residents as 
harried workers struggled through the day and night to reconnect the city, the 
big energy highways righted themselves almost without human intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never want this kind of test, but we had an awesome test," said Dulcy 
Mahar, spokeswoman for the Bonneville Power Administration, the agency that 
wholesales federal hydroelectric power from the Columbia River basin. "The 
system worked." 
</P>
<P>
 Of 1.3 million DWP customers blacked out immediately after the quake, all but 
60,000 in two pockets of the San Fernando Valley had service restored by 
Tuesday night, said Eldon Cotton, assistant general manager for power. Although 
the system will soon be fully running, the repair and replacement of damaged 
equipment will go on for more than a year and cost $200 million, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the entire city of Los Angeles, 600,000 customers of Southern 
California Edison from Montebello to Santa Barbara lost power, said Steve 
Conroy, communications director for the power systems division of SCE. Power 
had been restored to all but 150,000 by dusk and 1,500 by Tuesday morning, 
Conroy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Emergency crews were hoping only to rig up temporary connections to bypass a 
still-undetermined clutter of damaged equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to tie things together that aren't normally tied together," said 
Charles P. Serazio, who worked to come up with solutions. He is superintendent 
of the Rinaldi receiving station in Mission Hills, the largest of seven 
stations that distribute the city's power. "It's a lot of creative problem 
solving." 
</P>
<P>
 Monday morning, Serazio looked up disconsolately at long aluminum bars called 
buses that resemble railroad tracks suspended 40 feet in the air. They were 
twisted and bent toward the earth. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the damage had punched a hole in an electrical beltway that circles 
Los Angeles, mixing power from dozens of sources and moving it in all 
directions. 
</P>
<P>
 His immediate goal was limited: to energize a small part of the station to 
deliver power to the DWP's nearby water pumping station to help restore potable 
water to the city. Only then could he begin to think of getting power back to 
people's homes. 
</P>
<P>
 By midafternoon, Serazio's workers had strung a thick red cable along the 
ground to bypass damaged equipment. Then he waited for a switch operator at 
another station to energize the line. 
</P>
<P>
 By Tuesday morning, while large portions of the San Fernando Valley had yet to 
get electricity, a haggard-looking Serazio was still at it. He smiled wanly as 
a psssst sound rose from a bank of transformers where workers were busy 
connecting live wires. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a comforting sound," Serazio said. 
</P>
<P>
 The most devastating blow to the system occurred only a few miles to the north 
at a cinder-block building and caged yard of transformers called the Sylmar 
Converter, the southern terminus of an 846-mile, million-volt transmission line 
between the Southland and Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
 The control building of the Sylmar Converter, demolished in the 1971 Sylmar 
earthquake and rebuilt to tougher seismic standards, was once again badly 
damaged. Floors tilted, file cabinets tumbled across offices and complex 
electronic switching banks broke open, disgorging their circuitry. 
</P>
<P>
 By midday Monday, the building still did not have power, and work was going on 
inside under the glare of a generator-fed floodlight. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Brent Hollingworth said he thought it would be possible to get part of 
the plant running by the end of the day by connecting it to the city's 
coal-burning power plants in Utah, Nevada and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 The first hurdle, though, would be to get power into the building to run the 
controls. That power had to come from the Rinaldi receiving station, which had 
no power for its own controls. Until Rinaldi got its first line connected at 2 
p.m. there was nothing Hollingworth's crew could do. 
</P>
<P>
 That was only a sample of the interrelatedness that spread the effects of the 
Los Angeles earthquake across the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California was exporting power at the moment the lights went out. 
Through the night, when demand is low in the south, power moves north along the 
direct-current highway and three smaller alternating-current lines, to the 
colder areas where demand peaks at night, Mahar said. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar cycle occurs annually, as Southern California turns off its air 
conditioners and northern residents turn on electric heaters. 
</P>
<P>
 When the complex connections were severed in Los Angeles, the result was 
observed by sensors along the system as a loss of frequency. 
</P>
<P>
 "If your frequency doesn't match the equipment, you can blow out 
transformers," Mahar said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had 750 megawatts moving northward on the line," Mahar said. "When the 
quake hit, it couldn't move. It tried to reroute itself through the east." 
</P>
<P>
 That caused frequency changes in Arizona and Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 "A power island formed," Mahar said. "This island took itself off the 
inter-tie as a protection. It was like tripping a giant circuit breaker to 
protect our equipment." 
</P>
<P>
 Almost immediately, as load was shed from the system, generation was increased 
by building the flow of water through hydroelectric plants in the Columbia 
basin, Comish said. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, about 13 utility companies lost some service to hundreds of thousands 
of customers, said Bill Comish, director of dispatcher training for the Western 
Systems Coordinating Council, a Salt Lake City-based cooperative of 63 
utilities that exchange power across the west. 
</P>
<P>
 The blackouts, dispersed in pockets from Nevada through Alberta, Canada, 
ranged from 8,300 customers in Spokane blacked out for 20 minutes to the 
110,000 in Seattle for 30 minutes, Mahar said. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst blackouts hit southeastern Idaho near Treasureton, Comish said, 
because that is the location of a sophisticated protective program installed to 
disconnect the system in just such an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 The interdependence of the western power grid pays dividends to both north and 
south. 
</P>
<P>
 "The net benefit of all this interconnectedness is cheaper power," Mahar said. 
"Because we can swap power during peak times, we don't have to build idle power 
plants." 
</P>
<P>
 A protracted drought that has been depleted reservoirs since 1987 has 
aggravated the north's power needs. 
</P>
<P>
 The subsidiary benefits can be subtle. 
</P>
<P>
 "It helps us with our fish problem," Mahar said. 
</P>
<P>
 To protect the endangered sockeye salmon, the Bonneville Power Administration 
is required to guarantee specific levels of water flow during the spring 
breeding season. Power from Southern California allows the agency to save water 
behind its dams for the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's helped Southern California shut down fossil fuel generation," Mahar 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, Los Angeles generated 80% of its own power at four natural gas burning 
plants. As regional air pollution standards have tightened, the DWP has 
replaced those generators with coal-burning plants in Arizona and Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, one of those old plants, in Sunland, was running again. It had 
been fired up to get the city through its crisis. Restoring Vital Elements 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's quake left more than 1.3 million power users in the Los Angeles 
region without service. The priorities followed by the Department of Water and 
Power when restoring major outages: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Critical need: Service to customers serving a critical public need, such as 
hospitals, police and fire stations and airports. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Number affected: Service is restored to the greatest number of people. For 
example, a damaged circuit serving 800 users is assigned a higher repair 
priority than one bringing power to 10 users. Areas with large businesses have 
higher priority than those that are primarily residential. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Individual needs: Problems affecting individual homes and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 UTILITY PROBLEMS 
</P>
<P>
 * Without power: 95,000 users were without power as of late Tuesday afternoon. 
Areas still affected included Northridge, Tarzana, Encino and Sylmar and the 
Palms, Fairfax and Koreatown sections of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 * Preventing trouble: Those still without power are asked to switch off all 
nonessential electrical appliances to ensure that when service is restored, the 
sudden power draw does not overload circuits. 
</P>
<P>
 * Without water: 50,000 users remained without water as of late Tuesday 
afternoon, primarily near the Northridge epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
 * Purifying tap water: The earthquake knocked out all DWP water purification 
systems and shook loose sediment from pipes. It is safe to bathe and wash 
clothes in tap water, but do not drink it without boiling or treating it with 
chlorine bleach. The remaining sediment poses little harm, and can be strained 
out before drinking. Boil water vigorously for at least 10 minutes to kill 
biological contaminants. If you are without power and unable to boil water, add 
two to four drops of chlorine bleach per quart of tap water. 
</P>
<P>
 * Areas affected: Authorities broadened the areas in which residents should 
boil or bleach water before drinking it. The regions now include all of the San 
Fernando Valley, all of Los Angeles west of Fairfax Avenue, and neighborhoods 
north of Sunset Boulevard between Fairfax and Western avenues.

EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; TEAMS WITH HIGH-TECH GEAR PAY DIVIDENDS; 
MUTUAL AID: URBAN SEARCH-AND-RESCUE UNITS ARE CALLED IN TO ASSIST LOCAL FIRE 
CREW EFFORTS. 'IT WORKED BEAUTIFULLY,' A MANAGER SAYS.

<P>
 When the Loma Prieta earthquake collapsed a 1 1/2-mile span of freeway in 
Oakland four years ago, the city's search-and-rescue units were overwhelmed by 
the disaster and forced to rely on outside assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually the same situation occurred during Monday's massive temblor, when 
Los Angeles firefighters had to call outside units to help pull victims from 
the rubble of a Northridge apartment building and two other sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Had the earthquake been more powerful, dozens of similar structural collapses 
could have occurred and trapped countless victims who might have perished 
before being rescued, fire officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "People ought to realize that it could have been a lot worse," said Assistant 
Los Angeles Fire Chief Frank Borden. "We're lucky that we didn't have more 
structures collapse." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said no lives were lost as a result of delays resulting from calls 
for assistance to other agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire experts said the disaster showed that the city could benefit from 
additional urban search-and-rescue crews, which employ specialized training and 
equipment to move massive chunks of rubble and search for victims amid pockets 
of debris. 
</P>
<P>
 But the equipment and training cost money at a time when the Los Angeles Fire 
Department has suffered years of budget cuts. A councilman who represents one 
of the hardest-hit areas said he will seek federal funding to pay for more of 
the specialized teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "We obviously need more money for these things, and I would undoubtedly 
support it," said Councilman Hal Bernson of the San Fernando Valley. "What is a 
human life worth?" 
</P>
<P>
 The 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake focused nationwide attention on the need for 
urban search and rescue. Oakland firefighters faced one of the worst structural 
collapses in U.S. history when the Nimitz Freeway pancaked, killing 42 people. 
</P>
<P>
 After that quake, the state developed a network of eight of the special urban 
rescue teams, giving them $2.2 million in start-up costs, and $400,000 in 
annual funding since then, said Mark Ghilarducci, manager of the state urban 
search-and-rescue program. In 1990, the federal government modeled a national 
program after California's, now run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency 
and capable of sending the teams anywhere in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 City fire crews were forced to call for help from four urban rescue task 
forces that swept in from around the Southland with firefighters, engineers, 
paramedics and specially trained dogs to extricate the living and find the 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Using bags filled with compressed air, firefighters moved tons of rubble. 
Sensitive listening devices that monitor seismic vibrations were wedged between 
the wreckage to locate victims. And half-inch-wide fiber-optic lenses with 
lighting systems were dropped down holes to look for open spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 The search teams used their James Bond-like equipment to rescue Salvador Pena, 
who was pulled from the debris of the parking garage at the Northridge Fashion 
Center after being trapped in his crushed street sweeper for more than seven 
hours. Pena was in critical condition Tuesday with crushed legs and a partially 
dislocated spine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolutely, we saved his life," said Los Angeles Battalion Chief Richard A. 
Warford, who coordinated the USAR teams. 
</P>
<P>
 The rescue of just one victim absorbed a great deal of time, which gave fire 
officials and experts an indication of the resources that would be needed for 
rescues if a much larger quake strikes Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took more than seven hours just to rescue one person. What if there were 
100 people in there?" asked Gary Tokle, a rescue expert at the 
Massachusetts-based National Fire Protection Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 He said firefighters had their hands full with rescues at the Northridge 
shopping center and nearby apartment complex where 16 people died. 
</P>
<P>
 Borden of the city Fire Department agreed. He said victims could be trapped 
for up to 72 hours in a major earthquake. "If we can respond within 24 hours, 
we have a good chance of saving people," he said. "After that, their chance for 
survival decreases." 
</P>
<P>
 Ghilarducci said the urban search-and-rescue teams, which are funded by the 
state Office of Emergency Services, saved at least several lives at the 
Northridge Meadows apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Once at the scene, rescuers used TV monitors strapped to their chests to see 
what the search cameras were showing inside the rubble and high-tech devices to 
listen for anyone trying to scratch their way out. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after the quake was felt, the teams were mobilized. One team run by the 
Los Angeles City Fire Department was on scene right away, followed by teams 
from Orange County and Riverside. After the Los Angeles Fire Department took 
care of some emergency calls of its own, the Los Angeles County team responded. 
Four other teams from California and other states remain on standby at the 
National Guard base at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 Each team of 56 firefighters, paramedics, engineers and others work together 
at first and then split in half so they can work around the clock for 10 days 
at a time. Even though the teams carry 23,000 pounds of equipment, they can be 
mobilized and sometimes on the scene within six hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams' performance proved their value and showed how the city could 
benefit from additional units rather than waiting for outside agencies to 
respond, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's a need for it, departments should be prepared," said Edward Wall, 
a deputy administrator at the National Fire Academy in Maryland.

EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; IMPROVING COMMUTES; TRANSPORTATION OFFICIALS 
ARE GEARING UP TO OFFER ALTERNATIVES TO AUTOS

 Transit officials moved quickly Tuesday to expand bus and train service to 
relieve the crushing commutes on the Westside and in the Santa Clarita Valley, 
where roads were demolished by the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our challenge now is mounting additional service that we need to help people 
affected by the failure of the roads," said Frank White, chief executive of the 
Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's earthquake closed portions of six freeways, most notably the Santa 
Monica Freeway and the two major routes connecting the Santa Clarita Valley to 
Los Angeles. Caltrans officials vowed Tuesday to rebuild the collapsed bridges 
and overpasses within a year. 
</P>
<P>
 To help motorists avoid difficult commutes in the meantime, MTA officials 
announced that they will begin express commuter bus service connecting Santa 
Monica to Downtown Los Angeles on Thursday morning. Buses will run every 20 
minutes for the standard $1.10 fare. 
</P>
<P>
 The transit officials were still trying to determine the terminus for the new 
line but said it is likely to be at beach parking lots in northern Santa 
Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink, the local commuter rail line, has added extra cars to existing 
routes that serve the Santa Clarita Valley and is considering the creation of a 
line that would extend 35 miles into the Lancaster/Palmdale area, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The freeway damage -- while costly and inconvenient -- is an opportunity for 
transit planners, experts say. An excruciating commute may prove more 
successful in persuading Angelenos to use public transit or car pools than 
years of advertising campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 After the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake in San Francisco, for instance, 
ridership on the BART rail line and public buses increased dramatically. And 
BART gained an additional 35,000 passengers even after the roads were restored. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look what happened to us -- we were banging our heads against the wall to get 
these people to ride and then they had to," said BART spokeswoman Vicki Wills. 
</P>
<P>
 The key, Wills said, is responding to a catastrophe in a timely manner. In the 
case of BART, officials resumed running the train four hours after the 
earthquake, once workers had inspected the 71 miles of track. 
</P>
<P>
 Transportation officials say Metrolink will be crucial to relieving commuters' 
woes in the Santa Clarita Valley, which was cut off when the Antelope Valley 
Freeway connection to the Golden State Freeway collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 Five extra cars were added to trains on the Santa Clarita line, which 
increased capacity to 1,200 passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Santa Clarita-to-Los Angeles line could be disrupted if Caltrans uses 
dynamite to clear debris from a collapsed section of the Antelope Valley 
Freeway, said Pete Stanger, Metrolink's executive chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink officials halted service to Moorpark, Chatsworth and Simi Valley, 
however, because the tracks were damaged by the derailment Monday of a freight 
train, spokesman Pete Hidalgo said. That area also lost access to the Simi 
Valley Freeway, which was badly damaged in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Service to Moorpark is expected to resume Thursday, Hidalgo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink officials are trying to create a line running into the 
Lancaster/Palmdale area using existing freight tracks. Use of the line had been 
considered but discarded in the past because the route is filled with curves, 
which would mean costly rehabilitation or running the trains slowly, Stanger 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But with all the damage caused by Monday's quake, Stanger and others believe 
that commuters would take a train even if it traveled at 35 m.p.h. -- almost 
half the usual speed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may be that this earthquake changes conditions so we can run a slow train 
and people will still find it attractive," Stanger said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, county supervisors approved a motion to ask the MTA to consider 
extending Metrolink on this route. Supervisor Mike Antonovich, a longtime 
proponent of extending Metrolink, said federal disaster funds might be 
available to pay the costs. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, county officials will be working with the cities of Lancaster and 
Palmdale to locate office space from which county employees based in the Valley 
could work without commuting Downtown. Each county department will be asked to 
identify space for its Valley employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Across Los Angeles, transit officials said they intend to carefully monitor 
the plight of commuters, ready to assist where possible. Bob Ayer, assistant 
director of the Santa Monica Municipal Bus Lines -- which include the Big Blue 
Bus that runs between the beach community and Downtown -- said the agency is 
poised to use additional buses if they are needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the commuter bus line -- which used to zip down the Santa Monica 
Freeway for 12 miles -- will run mostly on side streets. The freeway caved in 
at the overcrossing of La Cienega Boulevard and is closed for about a five-mile 
stretch.

EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; STORES HIT BY FLOOD OF WATER-SEEKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 They were 40 miles from their usual grocery store, but Dennis and Cathy 
Vandervort weren't taking any chances. They needed water, and as they returned 
Tuesday to their quake-damaged Sherman Oaks home after spending the night with 
a friend in Santa Ana, they figured they'd better get it wherever they could. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided we'd better stop here on the way back," Cathy Vandervort said as 
she loaded three one-gallon jugs of Sparkletts water into her shopping cart at 
a Seal Beach grocery. 
</P>
<P>
 Water -- a precious commodity for an area hit by years of drought -- has come 
into even higher demand since Monday's 6.6-magnitude quake left the Southland 
in turmoil. The biggest rush came in the hours following the quake, store 
managers say, but even on Tuesday, demand appeared to continue in some areas. 
</P>
<P>
 At one Lucky supermarket here, half an aisle of empty shelves remained where 
bottles of Arrowhead, Nayas, Sparkletts and store-brand water had stood just 24 
hours before. Similar scenes played out across Orange County as residents have 
been lining up at grocery store cash registers and water vending machines in 
case another quake finds them in short supply. 
</P>
<P>
 A Vons spokeswoman said the grocery giant might even have to start looking for 
out-of-state water sources just to keep up with the demand. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very challenging to keep the supplies up. . . . Our manufacturing 
operations have been up and running continuously," spokeswoman Julie Reynolds 
said. "We expect the demand for water to remain very strong." 
</P>
<P>
 Predictably, flashlights and batteries have also been hot items as residents 
remain worried about getting caught in the dark after another power loss. 
</P>
<P>
 At Big A Drugs, a Long Beach store that sits just across the county line from 
Los Alamitos, people were buying $10 worth of batteries at a time, said 
employee Barbara Langley. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Frey, assistant manager at the Lucky store in Seal Beach, said residents 
were in a "panic-buying" mode after the earthquake. The rush, however, had died 
down there by Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was definitely busier (Monday) -- everybody had water," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Vons in Los Alamitos, the store's six rows of bottled water were half 
empty. The giant jugs holding several gallons were also noticeably absent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to be drinking that (tap) water," said Sandra Sylvia, who lives 
in a senior home near the store. "It's too close to L.A. County."  
</P>
<P>
 Clutching a jug of Arrowhead water, she added that she needed to get new 
batteries for her flashlight as well. 
</P>
<P>
 At Acords Market in Laguna Beach, eight shelves of bottled water had to be 
restocked Tuesday, as customers lugged home bags of bottled water.

EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; O.C. BOARD ORDERS NEW STUDY OF QUAKE RISK TO 
FIRE STATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors on Tuesday called for a new review of earthquake 
risks to the county's network of fire stations, many of which continue to 
languish in the same poor structural condition detailed in a 1989 engineering 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a review of county records shows that authorities have spent more 
than $7.3 million in the past four years to make some upgrades, they have been 
slow to approve major remodeling projects to high-risk stations, Fire 
Department records indicate. 
</P>
<P>
 In calling for the study, Supervisors Chairwoman Harriett M. Wieder said she 
was "shocked and embarrassed" that the county had not set deadlines to complete 
renovations to 14 firehouses deemed to be at "high" or "very high" risk for 
earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, county documents show that only two of the stations at risk were 
planned for renovation. Six of the stations were in the process of relocation 
or "potential relocation" and four were "city-owned" with remodeling 
responsibility falling to those cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The station listed in the 1989 study as needing the most attention was Fire 
Station 12 in Cypress. Others listed "high" or "very high" risk were in Orange, 
Sunset Beach, Lake Forest, Seal Beach, Villa Park and Placentia. The Cypress 
station is expected to be relocated and remodeling work has been scheduled for 
stations in Lake Forest and in the Tustin area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Architectural and operational issues as well as needed upgrades have 
increased the scope of work and thus delayed the original construction 
timetable," according to a county Fire Department report. 
</P>
<P>
 The new report was prepared in response to Monday's earthquake and in 
anticipation of questions by supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1989 study, by EQE Engineering in Costa Mesa, stated that the high-risk 
fire stations would be damaged so badly in an earthquake that they would be 
"very unlikely" to provide emergency services and posed threats to personal 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Wieder said Monday's temblor would be the impetus to "do something." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is simply not a good enough answer to say that we don't have any money," 
she said. "If something happens to those fire stations, what's the alternative? 
What's the impact to our population?" 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez said he was somewhat surprised at how few stations 
had been targeted for strengthening. 
</P>
<P>
 "Disaster preparedness is something I've been talking about for a long time," 
Vasquez said. "This may be the time for us to take a much broader view" of the 
county's preparedness. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Fire Chief Larry J. Holms said the department's response to 
needed structural improvements has been hampered by budget constraints. 
</P>
<P>
 Only last year, Holms said the department was considering closing some 
stations and reducing nearly half its work force when the state threatened to 
take away about $40 million from the local firefighting budget to help fund 
public education. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past two or three years, our number one priority has been to simply 
keep stations open with firefighters and paramedics on their equipment," Holms 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although last year's state and local budget crises ended with the Fire 
Department's finances intact, Holms said the department was preoccupied with 
budget matters through October, leaving little time for new projects. 
</P>
<P>
 County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider said the past three budget years 
have been "very tenuous" for the Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Fire Department made the call to put money in people rather than to 
retrofit fire stations for earthquakes," he said. "There were times when we 
didn't know whether we would be able to keep some stations open. The thought 
was, 'What good would it have been to retrofit those stations only to close 
them?' " 
</P>
<P>
 But Schneider said any characterization that the county has done nothing to 
prepare its fire stations to withstand earthquakes is without merit. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider said and documents show that the county has spent thousands of 
dollars to brace fire station doors and to anchor water heaters and radio 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the 1989 study showed that garage doors at numerous stations 
lacked adequate bracing. In an earthquake, the lack of support could trap 
firetrucks in the station, leaving them useless. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent Fire Department report stated that door systems had been addressed, 
among other "non-structural components." 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be unfair to say that the county has stood still in disaster 
preparedness," Vasquez said. The supervisor referred to last year's opening of 
the county's emergency operations center and plans for an $80-million radio 
system that promises to upgrade law enforcement communications during 
disasters.

EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; CITY OPENS INQUIRY INTO 'BIG A' SCOREBOARD 
COLLAPSE; ANAHEIM: 'OBVIOUSLY, A STRUCTURAL FLAW' CONTRIBUTED TO FALL OF 
JUMBOTRON, CITY MANAGER SAYS. THE $3-MILLION TO $4-MILLION REPAIR BILL IS ONLY 
MAJOR DAMAGE IN 30 MILES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 City officials said Tuesday they are investigating the cause of the collapse 
of the Anaheim Stadium scoreboard during the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, there was a structural flaw" that led to the collapse of the Sony 
Jumbotron, said City Manager James D. Ruth, who pointed out this was the only 
major quake damage reported within 30 miles of the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17-ton board, which was installed in 1988, tumbled from its rooftop 
moorings into the stadium's upper deck, crushing and damaging about 1,000 seats 
in the upper-deck left field stands. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to find out what happened," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To begin with, Ruth said, the city will examine its contract with Skidmore, 
Owens and Merrill Inc., which in 1979 built the part of the stadium where the 
signboard was later installed, to see if the firm is liable for the $3 million 
to $4 million in damage. Ruth said Skidmore was involved in the installation of 
the Jumbotron, which replaced a smaller scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are a good contractor, but there might have been a design problem," Ruth 
said, adding that "the rest of the stadium is in good shape. The damage from 
the sign is all there is." 
</P>
<P>
 Navin Amin, Skidmore's chief structural engineer, said he is unsure if his 
firm was consulted before the new scoreboard was installed or played a part in 
that work. His firm's addition enclosed the stadium, adding seats to lure the 
Los Angeles Rams football team to Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are looking into everything right now," Amin said. "We have sent an 
engineer to the stadium. We need to find out what has happened. There is a 
question of whether the new scoreboard was heavier than the original." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth said he did not know the details of the board's support structure and the 
city's inspections of it. Gary E. Johnson, the city's public works director, 
and Greg Smith, the stadium's general manager, declined comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the board remained where it crashed down. Plans were being made 
for its removal and replacement. 
</P>
<P>
 The huge video signboard showed replays of game action, scores of games in 
other cities and advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
 Had the collapse happened during an event, it could have caused hundreds of 
deaths. Several dozen seats were flattened in the upper deck and debris was 
strewn on the seats below. Only two security guards were in the stadium at the 
time and neither was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Contract requirements with advertisers who use the scoreboard require the city 
to replace it. The board is the major component of the stadium's billboard 
network, which generates $2 million annually. That is split among the city, the 
baseball Angels, the Rams, an advertising agency and Sony, which paid for the 
installation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't just not replace it," Ruth said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city also announced Tuesday that it had asked that the state declare 
Anaheim a disaster area because of the stadium damage, which would allow the 
city to apply for state and federal reimbursements for much of the cost of 
replacing the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Newton, a spokesman for the joint state and federal office that is 
handling earthquake relief requests, doubted whether Anaheim's request would 
succeed. Gov. Pete Wilson would have to declare all of Orange County a disaster 
area for the city to stand a good chance at federal or state assistance, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "How much other damage was there in Orange County? Not much," Newton said. 
"The state just doesn't give out disaster declarations if only one facility is 
damaged." 
</P>
<P>
 If the city does not receive reimbursement from Skidmore or another 
governmental agency, Ruth said the city might face a financial crisis. The 
$125-million stadium's earthquake insurance has a standard 5% deductible, 
meaning it doesn't kick in until $6.25 million has been spent. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will certainly compound our budget problems," Ruth said. The city is 
already forecasting an $8-million budget deficit during the next fiscal year, 
which begins July 1. This year's budget is $135 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Tuesday, the organizer of off-road motor races scheduled for Saturday at 
the stadium postponed the event until Feb. 12 because of the scoreboard 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 Mickey Thompson Entertainment's Super Cross motorcycle races remain scheduled 
for Jan. 29.

EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; COMMUTER RAIL SERVICE ALREADY BACK ON TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The sound of the Amtrak train whistle in the early morning darkness came as a 
relief to commuters standing Tuesday on the chilly platform at the San Juan 
Depot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ah, the whistle," said Mike Wagner of San Clemente, who relies on the train 
to get to work in Los Angeles each morning. "We have train. That's good news." 
</P>
<P>
 As transportation officials worked to get commuter rail service back to normal 
after Monday's devastating temblor, commuters were thankful for any means to 
avoid clogged highways in the earthquake zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want nothing to do with freeways today," said Wagner, 40, a program 
director for a Los Angeles radio station. "My feeling was, if the train wasn't 
running today, I wasn't going in." 
</P>
<P>
 Train service for thousands of commuters and travelers between San Diego and 
Los Angeles was suspended Monday while railroad tracks and bridges were 
inspected for damage. No problems were found in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 While buses replaced a commuter train operated by the Orange County 
Transportation Authority on Tuesday morning, Amtrak was able to resume full 
service between San Diego and Los Angeles by midmorning. 
</P>
<P>
 About 360 people rode the OCTA buses to Los Angeles in the morning, while an 
unknown number took Amtrak to work. 
</P>
<P>
 OCTA has operated a commuter train from San Juan Capistrano to Union Station 
in Los Angeles since 1990, and serves about 16,000 passengers a month. Amtrak 
offers longer-distance routes, but is also used by commuters between San Diego 
and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The OCTA commuter train was back running by Tuesday evening, spokeswoman 
Elaine Beno said. 
</P>
<P>
 Amtrak and OCTA officials said commuter rail service will be back to normal in 
Orange County this morning, barring any major new aftershocks. Each significant 
aftershock requires reinspection of the railroad tracks, which can cause long 
delays. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the sometimes uncertain schedules Tuesday, Victor DeFranco, 75, of San 
Juan Capistrano still preferred the train to his car. He has been commuting by 
train for 12 years to his job at a Los Angeles produce company. 
</P>
<P>
 "All you have to do is get caught in traffic for just an hour and it makes a 
wreck of you," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joann Flanagan, 49, of Dana Point was ready to brave the freeway to reach her 
job in Commerce when she decided instead to check the trains at the last 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was ready to drive," she said. "I didn't want to, but I have to get to 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 Like many commuters, Eli Quinones, 38, of Placentia says he expects train 
ridership to increase in Orange County because of post-quake traffic problems.

EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; O.C. VOLUNTEERS GET CHANCE TO FINE-TUNE RESCUE 
TECHNIQUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Just a few weeks ago, Al Arciniaga, a trauma technician at UCI Medical Center, 
watched a videotape of the devastation inside an Oakland hospital after that 
1989 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, he would see the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
 When Arciniaga walked into Granada Hills Community Hospital Monday, "It was 
like deja vu. All the destruction I saw in that video had come true. There were 
X-rays piled on the floor four feet high and rooms were completely destroyed." 
</P>
<P>
 Back at their hospital in Orange Tuesday afternoon, Arciniaga and other UCI 
medical personnel recalled how they spent 12 hours in Granada Hills helping the 
overwhelmed medical staff with earthquake victims, and working under some of 
the most adverse conditions of their careers: no electricity, no running water, 
a lack of medical supplies, and a fear that another quake could hit at any 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have as extensive a disaster plan as anyone, but until you experience it, 
you don't get to really test the system," said UCI's Dr. Mike Ritter. "The 
things that happened (at Granada Hills) pointed out the little things that we 
take for granted." 
</P>
<P>
 More than two dozen emergency room physicians, nurses and medical technicians 
from UCI Medical Center joined about 200 local firefighters and other rescue 
workers from Orange County in the relief effort to help disaster-stricken Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Many said the experience tested their mettle and gave them a better idea of 
what to do should a similar disaster strike Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's absolutely the best training," said Orange County Fire Capt. Dan Young. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Urban Search and Rescue Squad, which participated in a 
large-scale mock disaster drill at the Anaheim Plaza last year, had the 
opportunity to test their skills at the Northridge Fashion Center, where a 
parking structure and Bullock's store nearly had been reduced to rubble. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to search the mall to make sure no one was in there," Young said. 
"Anyone who would have been inside of the store would have been killed. We 
didn't know until 6 a.m. Tuesday that there was no one inside the mall." 
</P>
<P>
 Young and others said their rescue efforts would have been difficult enough 
without the series of unnerving aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Half the time I was there, the ground was moving," said UCI registered nurse 
Carerie Chapman. "It was scary. Horrifying. We worked with flashlights and 
limited supplies. But we all made do. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very anxiety provoking. But, I'd be back there in a minute." 
</P>
<P>
 Ritter said the hospital was not only without power and water, but also most 
of the medical supplies stored for a disaster had spilled onto the ground and 
become soaked with water. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ritter said there is nothing that prepares you for the horror of a 
disaster of such magnitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were working in a dark room with constant aftershocks and we had a lot of 
anxious people screaming," Ritter said. "It's hard to comfort them because 
you're working so hard."

EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; TEMBLOR IS REMINDER TO O.C. OF ITS OWN FAULT; 
SEISMOLOGY: IT UNDERLINES NEWPORT-INGLEWOOD FISSURE'S POTENCY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 According to Mark Johnson's personal seismic meter -- a stairwell chandelier 
that smashed against a window in his home during Monday's violent earthquake -- 
the 4:31 a.m. temblor was the strongest he has experienced in four years in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 For Johnson, manager of the Orange County Fire Department's emergency 
management division, the quake served as a powerful reminder of the destructive 
potential of the Newport-Inglewood Fault line, which stretches under some of 
the most populous areas of Orange and Los Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge quake, which rumbled up from a previously unknown fault in the 
San Fernando Valley, causing 40 deaths and extensive damage, should underline 
to Orange County officials and residents that they, too, sit atop a potentially 
deadly geological crease, Johnson and others said Tuesday. The two faults are 
not connected. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anytime we have an earthquake, it is a reminder of the threat that we face 
here," Johnson said. "But this one yesterday was a better lesson for us for 
several reasons -- because of its proximity and the way it impacted people 
here, and because of the similarity here to the population density in the 
valley." 
</P>
<P>
 Geologists have long warned that even a moderate shaker on the 
Newport-Inglewood Fault, which cuts a 40-mile subterranean path from Newport 
Beach through Long Beach and north to Beverly Hills, could result in a greater 
loss of life than a more serious quake along the better-known San Andreas 
Fault. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newport fault runs along the coastline, under more densely populated areas 
that sit atop sandy soil, which would prove unstable during a quake. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1988 report, experts with the state division of mines and geology warned 
that a quake of magnitude 7.0 on the Newport-Inglewood Fault "poses one of the 
greatest hazards to lives and property in the nation." 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone talks about the Big One and the San Andreas, but we are far away 
from the San Andreas," said Medhat Haroun, chairman of UCI's Civil and 
Environmental Engineering Department. "We can get potentially more damage from 
a magnitude 7 earthquake on the Newport-Inglewood than a magnitude 8 on the San 
Andreas." 
</P>
<P>
 The Newport-Inglewood Fault, the only major one in the county, is best known 
for causing the 1933 Long Beach earthquake, which killed more than 100 people 
and resulted in millions of dollars in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Davis, a geologist with the California Department of Conservation, the 
parent agency of the division of mines and geology, stressed that the Long 
Beach temblor, which measured 6.3 on the Richter scale, also was considered to 
be of moderate size. 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath of Monday's quake, which caused comparatively little damage 
in Orange County, Johnson said the emergency management division already had 
begun to study the preliminary seismic data and damage estimates in order to 
glean any information that might be useful to the county's emergency planning. 
</P>
<P>
 In terms of lessons for Orange County, the quake -- delivered by a fault that 
runs under populous areas of the northwest San Fernando Valley -- may provide a 
far more useful example than if it had occurred along the bigger San Andreas 
Fault, about 60 miles east of Los Angeles, Johnson said.

<P>
 The Newport-Inglewood Fault covers a relatively short distance, but is 
considered potentially deadly because it runs through a densely populated area.

EARTHQUAKE / THE LONG ROAD BACK; CLINTON PLANS TO GET FIRSTHAND LOOK TODAY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton plans to visit Los Angeles today to get a firsthand look at 
earthquake damage as federal officials begin toting up what they expect to be a 
multibillion-dollar bill for aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton decided to visit the city after an invitation by Mayor Richard 
Riordan."He wants to see firsthand the dislocation," White House chief of staff 
Thomas F. (Mack) McLarty said of the President. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials do not have an estimate of how much the earthquake will cost 
the government. But because of the extensive damage to the area's freeways, it 
could cost more than the $7.6 billion spent after the 1992 hurricanes in 
Florida, Hawaii and Guam, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 White House aides were still scrambling late Tuesday to put together Clinton's 
itinerary for the trip, which will probably have the President in Los Angeles 
for about six hours.

<P>
 Here are some facts and figures on Monday's magnitude 6.6 earthquake: 
</P>
<P>
 * AFTERSHOCKS: The Southland has been shaken by hundreds of aftershocks since 
the main quake struck at 4:31 a.m. The largest measured 5.5, at 3:40 p.m. 
Monday. The most significant Tuesday was magnitude 4.7, at 7:23 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * DEATHS: 40 
</P>
<P>
 * DAMAGE: Billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 * INJURIES: More than 2,300 people were treated and released at hospitals; 
about 530 were admitted for care. 
</P>
<P>
 * CURFEW: The need for an 11 p.m.-to-dawn curfew for Los Angeles will be 
evaluated on a day-to-day basis. 
</P>
<P>
 * ARRESTS: The Los Angeles Police Department took 73 people into custody in 
the 24-hour period ending at 3 a.m. Tuesday, an extremely low figure.

CHILD AILMENTS LINKED TO BREAST FEEDING, IMPLANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Researchers found a handful of children nationwide who developed serious 
digestive problems after being breast-fed by mothers with silicone implants. 
</P>
<P>
 The implants appear to be to blame, but studies of large numbers of children 
are needed to know how rare the cases are, researchers said in today's issue of 
The Journal of The American Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Jeremiah J. Levine, the study's lead author, said no blanket 
recommendation on breast feeding by women with implants should be made until 
more research is done. 
</P>
<P>
 The study involved 11 children, ages 1 1/2 to 13, born to women with silicone 
breast implants. Eight of the children were breast-fed, and three were fed 
formula as newborns. 
</P>
<P>
 All 11 later suffered from bouts of abdominal pain, plus other symptoms, such 
as vomiting, difficulty swallowing, intestinal pain and slow weight gain. Some 
also had joint pain or rashes. 
</P>
<P>
 Those symptoms are common to children's ailments. But in six of the eight 
breast-fed children, the symptoms arose from an uncommon origin -- loss of 
normal movement in the lower part of the esophagus, the tube that moves food 
from the mouth to the stomach. Loss of movement in the lower esophagus usually 
only arises from a disorder called scleroderma, an ailment that afflicts some 
women with silicone breast implants, Levine said.

 No charges will be brought against a wheelchair-bound German teen-ager accused 
of inventing a story about neo-Nazis carving a swastika into her face, a state 
prosecutor said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17-year-old girl was questioned about the alleged incident, which caused a 
nationwide uproar last week, but will not be charged with faking a crime, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The prosecutors have said that this girl needs to be treated medically and 
not legally," one police official said earlier.

ITALY SETS TWO-DAY VOTE TO END PASSOVER DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Italian government issued a decree Tuesday extending March 27 general 
elections to March 28 after Jews objected that they would have to vote on the 
first day of Passover, state television said. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure needs approval by Parliament, even though it has been dissolved. 
</P>
<P>
 The election date of Sunday, March 27, effectively disenfranchised many of 
Italy's 30,000 Jewish voters because observant Jews do not travel, write or 
carry out any task defined as work by Jewish law at the start or end of 
Passover.

LATEST BOSNIA TALKS OFFER LITTLE HOPE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A new round of Bosnia peace talks appeared doomed to failure Tuesday, after a 
day of fruitless wrangling over a map dividing the former Yugoslav republic 
into three ethnic ministates. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb, Muslim and Croat leaders agreed to prolong their negotiations 
into a second day today but held out little hope of an agreement to end the 
21-month-old conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 "The atmosphere around the negotiations has never been less conducive" to 
peace, U.N. mediator Thorvald Stoltenberg said before the talks. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is very small chance that the Muslims will accept (a deal)," Bosnian 
Serb leader Radovan Karadzic told journalists after more than 10 hours of 
discussions at Geneva's Palais des Nations. "They want more war." 
</P>
<P>
 The Muslims also said no headway had been made. "We have tried once again, but 
(the Serbs) still do not want to return territories seized by force," said 
Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnia's U.N. ambassador, Muhamed Sacirbey, even said the talks could 
collapse.

GENERAL PESSIMISTIC ABOUT SOMALIA

<TEXT>
<P>
 The departing U.N. commander said Tuesday that the Somalia operation has 
failed to disarm clans and militias and may never be able to leave this African 
nation with a lasting peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Gen. Cevik Bir of Turkey also said future U.N. humanitarian efforts will 
succeed only if nations such as the United States are prepared to place their 
soldiers under U.N. commanders and keep them deployed even if some are killed 
during the operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The world must decide the role the United Nations is to play in making this a 
better world," Bir said in a letter to U.N. Secretary General Boutros 
Boutros-Ghali, copies of which he distributed to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton ordered U.S. troops -- who spearheaded the operation and 
remain its linchpin -- to leave by March 31 after a clash with Somali 
militiamen left 18 U.S. soldiers dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Boutros-Ghali has urged other countries not to abandon Somalia, but many 
Western nations have ignored him and begun withdrawing their forces too.

RUSSIA TO KEEP TROOPS IN FORMER SOVIET LANDS; MILITARY: ASSERTION RAISES ALARM 
IN BALTICS. BUT MOSCOW SAYS REPUBLICS' APPROVAL WILL BE SOUGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD BOUDREAUX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a sign of resurgent Russian nationalism, Foreign Minister Andrei D. Kozyrev 
asserted Tuesday that Russia must maintain a long-term "military presence" in 
the former Soviet republics beyond its borders. 
</P>
<P>
 The statement, made to Russian ambassadors gathered in Moscow and reported by 
two Russian news agencies, raised alarm in Estonia and Latvia that President 
Boris N. Yeltsin might be reversing his pledge to withdraw the last 20,000 
former Soviet troops from those Baltic nations by the end of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 A Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Galina E. Sidorova, said later that Kozyrev's 
statement "has nothing to do with the Baltics." She said Russia plans to keep 
its troops only in those countries that agree to let them stay. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, his remarks were the strongest indication, though not the first, that 
Russia wants to have a permanent military role in what Russians call the "near 
abroad" rather than bring all its troops home by 1995 as Yeltsin once promised. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia inherited the bulk of the Soviet army that collapsed in 1991 and 
maintains an estimated 250,000 troops in 12 of the 14 other ex-Soviet republics 
-- all but Lithuania and Azerbaijan. Russian troops are a source of conflict in 
some, particularly Georgia and Tajikistan. 
</P>
<P>
 Kozyrev reasserted the army's intention to defend ethnic Russians and keep 
peace in such countries, despite Yeltsin's failure to win President Clinton's 
endorsement of a special Russian sphere of influence at their summit here last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 The foreign minister's speech may have been tailored to shifting political 
currents at home on the eve of a government shake-up. Key members of the 
government's reform wing are fighting for their Cabinet jobs in the wake of the 
stronger showing in last month's parliamentary elections by ultranationalist 
Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, who favors conquering Russia's neighbors by force. 
</P>
<P>
 Kozyrev, a reformer who opposes Russian bullying, has been voicing a more 
assertive position in foreign policy since the election and is widely expected 
to keep his post. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should not withdraw from those regions that have been the sphere of 
Russian interests for centuries, and we should not fear the words (military 
presence)," he told the ambassadors, according to accounts by the Itar-Tass and 
Interfax news agencies. "Although military domination is not in Moscow's 
interests, it would be dangerous to create a vacuum." 
</P>
<P>
 Because Kozyrev's audience included Russian ambassadors to the Baltic nations, 
officials in Estonia and Latvia assumed his remarks were aimed at them. His 
statement came a week after military commanders sent new orders to Russian 
troops in those countries to respond with gunfire to any provocations. 
</P>
<P>
 Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs said Kozyrev's statement meant "a 
serious change in the policy of Russia" and "a threat to Latvia's sovereignty." 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said the United States 
cannot accept a decision to station Russian troops in any former Soviet 
republic against the wishes of the local government. He said the U.S. 
government is seeking a clarification of Kozyrev's remarks, since Yeltsin had 
promised Clinton last week to withdraw from Estonia and Latvia. 
</P>
<P>
 As Yeltsin discussed the Cabinet makeup Tuesday with Prime Minister Viktor S. 
Chernomyrdin, the economic reform team identified with the president for the 
past two years was unraveling. The ruble plunged in value for a second day, 
dropping to 1,504 per dollar from 1,354 at the start of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Finance Minister Boris G. Fyodorov, the leading reformer still in office after 
Economy Minister Yegor T. Gaidar's resignation Sunday, was fighting what 
appeared to be a losing battle for his job. 
</P>
<P>
 Fyodorov, credited with stabilizing the ruble and cutting inflation from a 
monthly rate of 30% a year ago to 12% last month, threatened to quit unless he 
was given a higher rank than two of his foes -- Central Bank President Viktor 
V. Gerashchenko and Alexander K. Zaveryukha, who oversees agricultural policy. 
After Fyodorov was rebuffed, he insisted on the two men's resignation, but 
Itar-Tass said Chernomyrdin rejected that demand too.

INMAN ACCUSES MEDIA OF A NEW MCCARTHYISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS B. ROSENSTIEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The press coverage that Adm. Bobby Ray Inman said drove him to withdraw his 
nomination as defense secretary focused on setbacks in his business dealings, 
his failure to pay Social Security taxes on a domestic worker and his 
reputation as an inside-the-Beltway media operator. 
</P>
<P>
 A review of the coverage, however, shows that it was overwhelmingly positive, 
highlighting his substantial qualifications and the likelihood that he would be 
easily confirmed. These portrayals may have been helped by his friendship with 
many of the most powerful people in the press. 
</P>
<P>
 And at least one journalist whom Inman named said that Inman's account of what 
happened is at variance with the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 In explaining his decision to withdraw, Inman accused the media of a new 
McCarthyism, in which the media feel the need to write "bad things" about 
public figures every day and in which powerful columnists can wage unchallenged 
campaigns against them. 
</P>
<P>
 He cited the few skeptical stories written about his nomination, and three 
critical columns -- by William Safire and Anthony Lewis of the New York Times 
and Ellen Goodman of the Boston Globe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bobby Ray Inman seems to think that William Safire, Tony Lewis and I have 
been meeting in small offices plotting to ruin his daughter's wedding," an 
incredulous Goodman said Tuesday, in an allusion to Ross Perot's explanation 
that he dropped out of the presidential race in 1992 because George Bush 
allegedly was going to ruin Perot's daughter's big day. 
</P>
<P>
 Inman said that he "began to get a good flavor of what was coming" about his 
nomination when he received a call one Sunday from a young New York Times 
reporter, Steve Labaton. 
</P>
<P>
 Labaton asked about Inman's post-government business experience in the 1980s 
at Tracor Inc. in Austin, Tex., a company that eventually went bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
 Inman said that he asked what else Labaton was going to cover. "Was he going 
to deal with the boards I had served on, all the rest of it? And he (Labaton) 
very quickly told me he was writing exactly the story that his editors wanted," 
said Inman, who had gotten to know many prominent editors and producers when 
his job as the No. 2 official at the CIA involved offering to review news 
stories in advance to protect intelligence gathering methods. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview afterward, Labaton said that Inman had tried to use his 
relationships with Labaton's editors to pressure him to focus on the positive 
aspects of the nominee's business record. 
</P>
<P>
 Labaton said that when he called Inman about Tracor, Inman told him: " 'I have 
spoken to an editor of yours, and that is not the story you are supposed to be 
writing. Do I have to call one of your editors?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Labaton said he responded: "You are more than free to call an editor. This is 
the story I have been assigned." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked later Tuesday about Labaton's account, Inman said simply it was "not 
what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 A few days after Labaton's story appeared in December, CBS News reported that 
Inman had not paid Social Security taxes for someone who worked in his home. 
Inman did not dispute those facts Tuesday, but argued that he was not in the 
wrong legally, and suggested that the real victim of these reports was his 
employee who had "only a seventh-grade education" and had never paid income 
taxes in her life. 
</P>
<P>
 But Inman saved the bulk of his wrath for Safire. The most serious charge was 
that Safire had cut a deal with Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) under 
which Dole would oppose Inman's nomination if Safire would raise questions 
about President Clinton's Whitewater real estate venture in Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 Inman said he did not know if the story was true, only that "his state of 
mind" was that he believed it. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole later called the allegation "fantasies." Safire, declining comment, said 
he intends to deliver his answer in his column Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Safire wrote only a single column about Inman's nomination, but it was a 
scorcher: "As an executive he's a flop," Safire wrote, citing Tracor. "As a 
judge of character, he is a naif," he said, citing Inman's membership on the 
"proxy board" of a defense contractor that sold weapons to Iraq and South 
Africa. "As a taxpayer, he is a cheat," he wrote, citing the Social Security 
tax case, again. 
</P>
<P>
 A review of Safire columns over the last 13 years found that Safire mentioned 
Inman only five times, four only in passing, although always negatively. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Times Publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. said of Safire: "Certainly his 
opinions are strong -- that's what columnists do. Anyone who knows Bill knows 
he is a man of great decency, honor and integrity." Of the other two columnists 
singled out, Lewis' piece questioned Inman's staunch support for "right wing" 
forces in El Salvador and called him the personification of "the status quo 
inside the Beltway." 
</P>
<P>
 Goodman cited the same tax and business record as Safire and declared: "We 
know that Bob Inman slipped up on his housekeeping, but how's he going to keep 
house at the Pentagon?"

THE IRAN-CONTRA REPORT; REAGAN, OFFICIALS DENOUNCE REPORT AS 'FANTASY'; 
COUNTERATTACK: THEIR 1,149-PAGE REBUTTAL ACCUSES IRAN-CONTRA INDEPENDENT 
COUNSEL OF ENGAGING IN 'PROSECUTORIAL ABUSE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORMAN KEMPSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a scathing counterattack, former President Ronald Reagan and key officials 
of his Administration denounced the final report of the Iran-Contra independent 
counsel Tuesday as "fantasy . . . fiction . . . prosecutorial abuse" and the 
product of a Soviet-style inquisition. 
</P>
<P>
 Former President George Bush, vice president at the time of the Iran-Contra 
controversy, accused independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh of trying to make a 
crime out of normal political friction between Congress and the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 In an extraordinary 1,149-page volume, lawyers for Reagan, Bush, then-Atty. 
Gen. Edwin Meese III and 43 other people named in Walsh's report delivered a 
near line-by-line rebuttal of the independent counsel's conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the heart of this investigation was a political dispute between the 
executive and legislative branches over foreign policy," Bush said in a 
statement issued Tuesday by his Houston office. "We must be careful not to 
criminalize a constitutional dispute of this kind." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Walsh said there was no evidence that either Reagan or Bush violated 
any criminal statute, he said both men made misleading public statements about 
the controversy. Reagan, he said, "set the stage for the illegal activities of 
others." 
</P>
<P>
 Reagan's lawyers, in a separate 122-page analysis, said Walsh's conclusion "is 
demonstrably incorrect." The former President's attorneys said Walsh's theory 
of an Administration-wide conspiracy to cover up the scandal "is nothing more 
than the independent counsel's fantasy." 
</P>
<P>
 Bush's lawyers said he "has always acknowledged that he was aware that arms 
were sold to Iran. The report offers nothing new on this issue." However, Bush 
argued throughout his tenure as vice president and President that he was 
essentially "out of the loop" concerning details of the arms sales. Walsh 
maintains that Bush was well-versed about the operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Meese, accused by Walsh of conducting an investigation in November, 1986, that 
"was more of a damage control exercise than an effort to find the facts," 
called the report "fraudulent and dishonest." 
</P>
<P>
 In a telephone interview, the former attorney general said: "Any idea that 
there was any kind of cover-up by the Reagan Administration or any wrongdoing 
by the President or the Cabinet is totally false. 
</P>
<P>
 "The facts that (Walsh) relies on don't support his erroneous conclusions. At 
the time and since, independent people have commended the Administration and 
the team that I led for getting at the facts and getting them out so quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 Meese's lawyers added, "Walsh's report is patterned after the old Soviet model 
of justice: You're guilty because I say you're guilty, and damn the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the bitterest reaction came from former Defense Secretary Caspar W. 
Weinberger, who was pardoned by Bush just two weeks before he was scheduled to 
go on trial on charges of withholding evidence and misleading Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinberger, who opposed arms sales to Iran from the start, complained that he 
was a victim of Walsh's excessive prosecutorial zeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinberger's lawyer, Robert Bennett, said in a telephone interview that 
Walsh's report was "essentially a work of fiction." 
</P>
<P>
 "The only cover-up is what is in his report," Bennett said. "He covers up the 
terrible abuses of civil rights of loyal Americans like Mr. Weinberger. And he 
covers up the very poor investigation he conducted. . . . I am pleased that he 
finally says that President Reagan did not have any criminal intent. When 
Weinberger was under his microscope, he urged us to cooperate with him against 
President Reagan (in exchange for leniency) and Weinberger would not do it." 
</P>
<P>
 In their submission to the volume of rebuttals, Weinberger's lawyers argued: 
"A prosecutor, of course, should not use his position and resources as a forum 
to present his side of a case that never goes to trial." 
</P>
<P>
 During a Washington press conference, Walsh agreed that reporting evidence 
that was not presented in court "is a very disturbing position for a prosecutor 
to be in." But he said the independent counsel law, enacted in 1978, requires 
comprehensive reports, in part to prevent the staff from telling all later in 
books, as some Watergate prosecutors did. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Walsh said, people named in his report were given four months to 
file responses, which were published as an annex to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 The annex contains the responses of virtually all of the Iran-Contra 
personalities, bit players as well as stars. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, Gen. Colin L. Powell, recently retired chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, complained that Walsh "has seen fit to impugn my character." 
</P>
<P>
 Powell, who was Weinberger's military adviser at the time of the arms sales to 
Iran, was said by Walsh to have had knowledge of the operation, although he 
broke no law. 
</P>
<P>
 In his rebuttal, Powell said that he knew of a proposal to ship arms to Iran 
in 1985, but Walsh "confuses knowledge of the proposal with knowledge of the 
shipments themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 "Through innuendo and unfounded accusations, the independent counsel attacks 
my reputation . . . calls me a liar -- all while conceding I committed no 
offense," Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the rebuttals were couched in legal jargon. But Duane (Dewey) 
Clarridge, a former CIA operative pardoned by Bush after being indicted on 
seven counts of perjury and false statements, responded with a veiled threat. 
</P>
<P>
 In a two-page handwritten memo, Clarridge said, "I will deal with Walsh's 
allegations in the fullness of time on my own terms. At that time, may he 
recall from the here and now or from the grave that what goes around, comes 
around."

REHNQUIST ORDERS CITADEL TO OPEN DOORS TO FIRST WOMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Supreme Court Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist cleared the way Tuesday for 
the first woman to attend day classes at The Citadel, a 151-year-old state 
military academy in Charleston, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon Faulkner, 18, had applied and won admittance to the academy last year 
before school officials realized she was a woman. Although both a federal judge 
and a U.S. appeals court in Richmond, Va., ruled that she must be admitted, 
lawyers for The Citadel asked the Supreme Court to block the move. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Rehnquist unexpectedly granted a temporary stay halting Faulkner's 
enrollment. But without explanation, he lifted the order Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A single justice may grant a stay if he or she believes the full court is 
likely to agree with the action. But the chief justice may have learned over 
the weekend that a majority would not support The Citadel's men-only policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shannon's very, very excited," her mother, Sandy, told the Associated Press. 
"She grabbed her suitcase and started packing." 
</P>
<P>
 Faulkner plans to start classes on Thursday, which is her 19th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 Citadel attorney Dawes Cooke said he was disappointed with the decision, but 
that the school would not seek further Supreme Court review. 
</P>
<P>
 School President Claudius Watts III said Faulkner will be welcomed on campus 
and "The Citadel will adhere to the law of the land." 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1970s, the Supreme Court outlawed gender discrimination by public 
agencies. Until Tuesday, The Citadel and the Virginia Military Institute were 
the last remaining public colleges that have refused to admit women. A separate 
challenge to VMI's policy is pending. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,600 women now take evening classes at The Citadel.

TWO-TIER WELFARE PAYMENTS REJECTED; LAW: SUPREME COURT LETS STAND A RULING THAT 
MINNESOTA COULD NOT LIMIT BENEFITS TO NEW RESIDENTS. THE ACTION IS A SETBACK TO 
SIMILAR CALIFORNIA STATUTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a setback for California's campaign to limit welfare costs, the Supreme 
Court on Tuesday let stand a ruling that forbids states to pay lower welfare 
benefits to new residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The justices rejected appeals filed by Minnesota Atty. Gen. Hubert H. Humphrey 
III and California Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren, both of whom argued that fiscally 
strapped states should be permitted to employ a "two-tier system" for 
distributing state benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 The high court action appears to block efforts by lawmakers in California, New 
York and Illinois to restrict the levels of state aid given to new legal 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressing for this change in 1992, Gov. Pete Wilson decried the "welfare 
magnet" that draws poor people from other states to take advantage of 
California's relatively generous benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're extremely disappointed," said Amy Albright, a spokeswoman for the 
California Department of Social Services. "We had hoped the Supreme Court would 
reconsider this issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, the state Legislature reduced welfare benefits for newcomers to 
California, but that measure has been blocked by a federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent laws have run afoul of a series of Supreme Court decisions between 
1969 and 1981. Those rulings said that a state may not discriminate among its 
legal residents based on the length of time they have lived there. To do so, 
the court said, would violate the fundamental "right to travel" that is enjoyed 
by all Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on that rationale, the Minnesota Supreme Court in August struck down 
that state's new law, which limited welfare benefits for new adult residents to 
60% of the state maximum for six months. No one would have suffered a true loss 
of benefits by moving to Minnesota, however, since the state pledged to match 
the benefits paid by another state. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the Minnesota high court invalidated the law on the grounds that 
the Constitution "mandates that the state distribute benefits equally to its 
needy residents . . . without distinguishing between (them) on the duration of 
their residency." 
</P>
<P>
 Last January, U.S. District Judge David Levi of Sacramento blocked enforcement 
of the California statute on the same grounds. That law, enacted in 1992, would 
have limited the welfare benefits paid to new Californians for 12 months. 
During this period, the newcomers could not receive benefits that were higher 
than the benefits paid in their previous state. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, a needy mother with two children receives $607 a month, 
Albright said. By contrast, Texas would pay $221 a month to the same mother, 
Florida $364 per month, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 If enforced, the 1992 measure would have saved California an estimated $22.5 
million during this fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Levi invalidated the provision on the grounds that the Constitution "does 
not permit significant distinctions between new and old residents based on the 
duration of their residency." 
</P>
<P>
 In his appeal of the Minnesota decision, Humphrey, the son of former Vice 
President Hubert H. Humphrey, urged the high court to reconsider its precedents 
and to rule that the Constitution does not demand "an absolute ban on 
durational residency requirements" in state law. 
</P>
<P>
 Without comment or dissent, the justices rejected the appeal in the case of 
Steffen vs. Mitchell, 93-720. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren also filed a separate brief urging the high court to "recognize that 
the severe fiscal crisis (in California) is sufficient justification for the 
implementation of a two-tier system for the provision of public benefits." 
</P>
<P>
 California state attorneys have appealed Levi's decision to the U.S. 9th 
Circuit Court of Appeals. But after Tuesday's high court action, their chances 
for success are limited. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Supreme Court also let stand a ruling concluding that the 
California state government violated federal labor law when it delayed payments 
to state workers during the 1990 budget crisis. The paychecks were issued two 
weeks late. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to a lawsuit filed by 1,800 state highway workers, a federal 
appeals court in San Francisco said that state and private employers are 
required by law to issue paychecks on the regular pay day. 
</P>
<P>
 In its unsuccessful appeal in Wilson vs. Biggs, 93-772, state lawyers argued 
that the state Constitution precludes making such payments until a budget is 
approved.

STATES CALL OUT NATIONAL GUARD TO HELP BATTLE HUGE WINTER STORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The National Guard pitched in Tuesday to help dig out the Ohio Valley from 30 
inches of snow, while single-digit temperatures reached into the Deep South. 
</P>
<P>
 Temperatures in Mississippi and Alabama plunged to 7 degrees, and to 10 below 
zero in Louisville, Ky., weather officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't mind the cold, but God, this is unbelievable," said David O'Cull in 
Madison, Wis., where it was 27 below zero. With the windchill factored in, it 
felt like 70 below. 
</P>
<P>
 The weather has been blamed for 47 deaths since last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of people were without electricity after heavy snow and ice from 
Monday's storm weighed down power lines. 
</P>
<P>
 States of emergency continued in Ohio, Kentucky and West Virginia because of 
the snow. Interstate highways remained closed throughout Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohio officials sent more than 100 National Guard personnel and 50 emergency 
vehicles to help dig out counties in southern Ohio, where up to 30 inches of 
snow fell Monday. West Virginia National Guard troops cleared roads and helped 
in medical emergencies in seven counties. The Guard was also at work in 
Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
 In Parkersburg, W. Va., which received 18 inches of snow, two dozen tenants 
retrieved belongings Tuesday from a one-story apartment building whose 
snow-laden roof collapsed during the night. 
</P>
<P>
 In Pennsylvania, a 30-mile stretch of eastbound Interstate 80 was closed 
Tuesday between Bloomsburg and Hazleton because of jackknifed tractor-trailer 
trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota Gov. Arne Carlson ordered schools closed statewide to make sure that 
no youngsters had to wait at bus stops with windchills as low as 75 below zero. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it gets this cold, it's just too dangerous," said Robert Hanson, school 
superintendent in the Wisconsin town of Rhinelander. "If in this weather one of 
the buses goes down, you don't have much time to get those 60 to 70 kids 
somewhere with heat." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's record low temperatures for the date ranged from 34 below zero at 
Devils Lake, N.D., and 26 below at Green Bay, Wis., to 9 below at Lexington, 
Ky. Chicago's 21 below erased the record of 16 below that had been on the books 
since 1930. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday morning's coldest location in the Lower 48 was Tyler, Minn., with a 
low of 44 below zero. 
</P>
<P>
 The frigid air was pushing southward, and Tupelo, Miss., had a low of 7 
degrees. The forecast for today was for a low of about 4 degrees, the National 
Weather Service reported. 
</P>
<P>
 In Atlanta, several broken water mains prompted Mayor Bill Campbell to advise 
residents to conserve water by not bathing or washing dishes.

FROZEN 91-YEAR-OLD IS FOUND ALIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police sent to check on 91-year-old Victoria Moryn found a harrowing sight: 
The frail Polish immigrant was frozen in inch-thick ice on the floor of her 
unheated house. And she was alive. 
</P>
<P>
 When one officer touched her "she started moaning," said neighbor Chris 
Staszkiewicz, who accompanied police. "He nearly jumped out of his skin. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was saying, 'Oh God, Oh God' in Polish. I believe that's what pulled her 
through." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman was kneeling, with her knees, toes and bare feet frozen to the 
floor. Police had to chip at the ice to free her, Sgt. Michael McMahon said. 
Water from broken pipes formed the ice. 
</P>
<P>
 Moryn was hospitalized in critical condition Tuesday with severe frostbite on 
her hands and feet, hypothermia and unstable blood pressure, officials said. 
Moryn lived alone in the duplex that she owns on the city's near west side. 
</P>
<P>
 It was 10 degrees outside when she was found Monday.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; HOSPITALS STRAINED TO THE LIMIT BY INJURED; 
MEDICAL CARE: DOCTORS TREAT QUAKE VICTIMS IN PARKING LOTS. DETAILS OF SOME 
DISASTER-RELATED DEATHS ARE RELEASED.

<P>
 Grappling with serious structural damage and the onslaught of hundreds of 
injured people, many hospitals and clinics across Los Angeles continued Tuesday 
to buckle under the strain of Monday's shattering earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 In the hard-hit San Fernando Valley, doctors turned a hospital parking lot 
into an emergency room, desperate kidney patients sought alternative care after 
five dialysis clinics closed, and quake victims waited in line for hours for 
treatment of broken bones, mashed hands and cut heads and feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials released details of several quake-related deaths at Los Angeles 
hospitals, including two babies born dead to quake-stressed mothers and a car 
crash victim who died when a power outage halted his ventilator. 
</P>
<P>
 Psychiatrists told of traumatized quake victims, including one young man who 
was trapped under rubble at a collapsed Northridge apartment complex and was 
forced to listen as three of his roommates died after being pinned in the 
wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital officials reported Tuesday that more than 530 people were hurt badly 
enough to be admitted, while another 2,333 had been treated and released. The 
total casualties were almost 1,000 higher than the number of people injured 
during the 1992 riots, although more than 50 people were killed in the riots. 
The earthquake has claimed at least 40 lives. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 700 patients -- many of them in intensive care -- were moved out of 
quake-damaged facilities and transferred to other medical centers.  
</P>
<P>
 In the Valley, which bore the brunt of the temblor beneath Northridge, three 
hospitals -- the Veterans Administration facility in North Hills, Holy Cross 
Medical Center in Mission Hills, and Olive View-UCLA Medical Center in Sylmar 
-- were closed indefinitely because of structural damage and loss of water and 
power.  
</P>
<P>
 Among the dozens of others that sustained enough damage to require them to 
move out some of their patients were St. John's Hospital and Health Center in 
Santa Monica and the Kaiser Permanente Hospital in Panorama City. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of structural problems discovered late Monday, the county's 
psychiatric hospital, part of the County-USC Medical Center complex near 
Downtown, had to move out its patients and also close doors to a large number 
of outpatients. 
</P>
<P>
 Childrens Hospital Los Angeles suffered some structural damage, and, like 
several hospitals in the area, canceled elective surgeries.  
</P>
<P>
 At least eight earthquake victims were admitted to Childrens Hospital, 
including a 23-day-old infant with a broken leg. The baby's mother said it 
could have been caused when a clock fell on her while she was nursing the 
infant. 
</P>
<P>
 At Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, 25 patients had been admitted to the hospital 
for serious injuries by midday Monday, and at least 100 more were treated for 
lesser injuries and sent home.

 "The emergency room was jammed," said Ronald Wise, a spokesman for the 
hospital. He added that Cedars-Sinai is part of the countywide emergency 
response network, and its staff was well prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had 12 doctors and 15 nurses, plus technicians, and they immediately went 
into the disaster-response mode. Everything worked very smoothly. We were able 
to take on all comers," Wise said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the busiest hospitals in the region Tuesday were Northridge Hospital 
Medical Center, where doctors and nurses cared for patients in a parking lot, 
and Granada Hills Community Hospital, where there was no heat or water. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Northridge facility, near the powerful earthquake's epicenter, more 
than 300 people had been treated since the quake for broken bones, glass cuts, 
bad bruises and stress problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Tired nurses and doctors set up a makeshift emergency room in a parking lot 
where they evaluated patients under the hot sun, separating those who needed 
immediate care from those who could wait a while. A row of portable toilets 
stood nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most everyone slept here last night," Dr. Paul Karis, chief of emergency 
medicine, said of the hospital staff. "People haven't had a shower. There's no 
running water. The toilets are in the parking lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Karis said the quake also knocked out the hospital's CAT scan and magnetic 
imaging equipment, needed to diagnose head and spine injuries. "We don't know 
when they're going to be back up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As regular staffers grew exhausted, more than three dozen doctors, nurses and 
psychiatrists were brought into the hospital under a federal medical relief 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of them, Dr. Steve Salenger, chief of staff at Patton State Hospital in 
San Bernardino, said he counseled anxious earthquake victims as well as 
exhausted doctors and nurses Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Salenger said one victim, a young Desert Storm veteran, was trapped for more 
than three hours under the rubble of the Northridge Meadows apartment complex 
where 16 people died, including three of the man's roommates. 
</P>
<P>
 "He couldn't move, and he could hear one of his roommates slowly choking to 
death each time there was a slight settling of the rubble," Salenger said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since coming here, he's been withdrawn. He's afraid to be alone. He's 
sleeping in the hospital because he's afraid to go anywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 Karis said two babies were born dead at Northridge when their mothers went 
into quake-induced labor. 
</P>
<P>
 At Holy Cross, 20-year-old Lionel Ventura died when the earthquake knocked out 
power to his ventilator, according to the Los Angeles County coroner's office. 
Coroner's investigators were told that Ventura had been at the hospital since 
December, when he was injured in a car crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in the Valley, five kidney dialysis centers were put out of 
operation by the earthquake, affecting an estimated 300 patients who need the 
blood cleansing treatments to stay alive, health officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just wild and woolly," said Linda Black, administrator of the St. Joseph 
Regional Dialysis Center in Burbank. "Individual patients are wandering around 
. . . calling to find a place to get treatment. There are so many that just 
don't know what to do. I can't tell you how many people have called me, 
frantic." 
</P>
<P>
 Several hospitals canceled routine appointments and elective surgeries to 
handle emergency patients.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; CRIME TAKES A HOLIDAY -- L.A. ARRESTS PLUNGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is not often that the Los Angeles Police Department boasts about how few 
people it is arresting. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the 24 hours after the Northridge earthquake ripped through Southern 
California, the LAPD apprehended just 73 people -- one of the lowest one-day 
totals in modern memory. And police officials could not be happier. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's an incredibly small number," said Police Chief Willie L. Williams. "It 
would be great if it were like that all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 On an average day -- one without a riot, an earthquake or a raging inferno to 
tamper with the city's crime statistics -- the department arrests about 534 
people for all manner of criminal acts. That is eight times as many as it 
arrested in the day and night after Monday's quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The bulk of those arrested under normal circumstances are charged with 
relatively minor offenses, but the department apprehended 55,840 suspects last 
year for so-called Part 1 crimes -- murder, rape, robbery and the like. That 
comes to an average of 152 arrests a day just for those offenses, twice as many 
as for all crimes combined during the 24 hours after the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But where a precipitous drop in arrests usually would cause waves of anxiety 
at LAPD headquarters, Tuesday's statistics were a source of pride and relief 
for the department's commanders. 
</P>
<P>
 "What this speaks to is the tremendous amount of public cooperation and 
recognition of the seriousness of the problem," said Cmdr. David J. Gascon, an 
LAPD spokesman. "We've been very grateful for that reaction." 
</P>
<P>
 Other indicators from the 24 hours that followed the early morning quake also 
suggest that crime took a brief holiday during the earthquake and its 
aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
 Calls for service skyrocketed at first, officials said, but they quieted down 
by Monday night, and the vast majority were from people with earthquake-related 
troubles, not from people calling to report crimes in progress. By midnight, 
police had the situation so well in hand that no callers were holding for 911 
operators, a feat rarely accomplished on the calmest Los Angeles evening, much 
less in the wake of the region's most devastating earthquake in decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a curfew, and people in most of the city were just trying to assess 
what had occurred," Williams said. "There were not a lot of people traveling 
around." 
</P>
<P>
 While public cooperation may be responsible for much of the one-day crime 
drop, police officials and others said arrest statistics were greatly affected 
by the dusk-to-dawn curfew and increased staffing by the LAPD and the Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department. Both agencies went on alert and put 
additional officers on the streets within hours of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Their combined force was supplemented by 480 National Guard members, who were 
put to work guarding shopping centers and other retail areas against looting. 
By dawn Tuesday, looting was so sporadic that the Guard force was trimmed to 
about 400, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was not all good news: The city logged three homicides during the 24 hours 
after the earthquake, about average for an area that produces more than 1,000 
murders a year. Nevertheless, city officials were overjoyed by the dearth of 
looters and by the general respite from criminal activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last night, patrols were spectacular," City Councilman Hal Bernson said at a 
high-level city staff meeting Tuesday. "It just shows you what a few bucks and 
a few officers can do." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, who chaired the meeting, laughed. "Remember that around budget 
time," said the chief, who is lobbying for money to hire thousands more police 
officers in the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
 Police acknowledged that the curfew would give them considerable discretion 
about who to apprehend after dark: Theoretically, anyone without a legitimate 
work or emergency reason for being on the streets was in violation of the law. 
Police said they had no intention of arresting everyone they saw, but that 
meant officers could use their judgment about whom seemed to be a curfew 
violator. 
</P>
<P>
 As night fell Tuesday, Williams announced that the curfew had been successful 
and would be extended for at least another day. 
</P>
<P>
 At an afternoon press conference, Los Angeles Police Chief Willie Williams 
said residents who encounter price-gouging should contact police immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police expect to stay on alert for at least several days, working 
12-hour shifts and coming in on days off.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; SANTA MONICA DEALT HARD BLOW; WESTSIDE: 
DESTRUCTION SKIPS AROUND CITY, SERIOUSLY DAMAGING ABOUT 200 STRUCTURES. SOME 
LANDMARKS ARE DAMAGED. 
</P>

 Susan Kado stood in front of the ruins of her Santa Monica apartment Tuesday 
afternoon, waiting for a friend to pick her up. She had lost everything in the 
earthquake, including a sense of what to do next. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm undecided what to do right now. I guess I've got to get my wits 
together," she said. She chuckled, grateful for her borrowed clothes -- "at 
least the shoes fit" -- and neighborly kindness. 
</P>
<P>
 First her 14th Street building had moved, then it had exploded with a ruptured 
gas main. Finally it burned, one of about 200 structures seriously damaged in 
Santa Monica, the hardest-hit community on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 The destruction skipped around this seaside city from shops to homes to 
churches and a hospital, leaving 83 buildings uninhabitable, the majority of 
them commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 One tower of the Santa Monica Hospital Medical Center was evacuated because of 
damage. Broken glass and dislodged bricks kept scores of businesses along 
Wilshire Avenue and San Vicente Boulevard shuttered Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The popular Third Street Promenade pedestrian mall, bandaged in plywood, was a 
sedate version of its usuallyfestive self. More than 250 quake refugees spent 
Monday night in a Red Cross shelter at Santa Monica College. Some 17,000 
customers were still without gas service Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 At least two churches sustained major damage. The landmark steeple at St. 
Monica Church tumbled onto the street. And St. Augustine's by the Sea, an 
eclectic parish favored by the young, the politically active and the homeless, 
was closed pending an engineer's evaluation of an estimated $250,000 in 
structural damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Autos were banned from the Santa Monica Pier as inspectors scrambled to gauge 
foundation damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Next door to Susan Kado's building, a two-story Spanish duplex had moved off 
its foundation. The fireplaces had peeled away, leaving gaping holes in the 
walls. Caryl Millen, 42, sorted through the shambles of her upstairs unit, 
"trying to make sense of nonsense." 
</P>
<P>
 Millen awoke in the pitch black Monday morning to find herself trapped and 
just about blind without her glasses. The front door was blocked by a 
grandfather clock that had tumbled down the stairs. The back door was blocked 
by a fallen refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started screaming and somehow a neighbor heard me and he came up to help," 
said Millen, who runs a messenger service. "He pulled the refrigerator away 
from the door so I could get out and we ran out onto the lawn. I stood there on 
the lawn having an asthma attack. Finally a neighbor, Ken, crawled back in 
there and found my medication. 
</P>
<P>
 "People here were spectacular," she said. "We see them every day walking their 
dogs, picking up their mail, but we don't really know them until something like 
this happens. They comforted me and they helped me and they got me through a 
very terrifying time." 
</P>
<P>
 Patients had streamed into the emergency room of the Santa Monica Hospital all 
day Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everywhere you looked there were injured people -- broken bones, cuts, 
crush-type injuries," said Dr. Wally Ghurabi, the emergency room director. "It 
was like a war zone."  
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, hospital officials evacuated a nine-story building because of 
structural damage, transferring a number of departments into an adjacent 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said there had been several hundred gas leaks in the city, one 
causing a fire that prompted the temporary evacuation of two residential blocks 
on the city's north side. 
</P>
<P>
 Just over the border in Pacific Palisades, Andrew Wainrib gazed at the State 
Beach Cafe, which he co-owns. The second story of the 1930s brick building had 
collapsed. "It just gave out," said Wainrib, who is all too familiar with loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "My house in Los Flores Canyon above Malibu burned in the fire. . . . But I 
feel fantastic," Wainrib laughed. "It's only stuff and I'm still here."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; CASH-STRAPPED SCHOOLS COUNT ON STATE AND 
FEDERAL EMERGENCY AID; EDUCATION: SUPERINTENDENT ORDERS CAMPUSES TO REMAIN 
CLOSED TODAY. AT LEAST 170 FACILITIES SERVING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS 
HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY DAMAGED. 
</P>

<P>
 Struck with severe earthquake damage that may run into hundreds of millions of 
dollars, the cash-strapped and uninsured Los Angeles Unified School District 
will have to rely almost entirely on state and federal emergency money for a 
massive rebuilding effort.  
</P>
<P>
 As Supt. Sid Thompson ordered all schools to remain closed again today, 
authorities said at least 170 campuses serving tens of thousands of students 
have been seriously damaged and need further inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 "The impact of the quake on the school district has been catastrophic," 
Thompson said. "We have an incredibly ugly problem in terms of educating and 
housing the kids and paying for this. We are going to need help." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the most severe damage is largely contained in a swath of the San 
Fernando Valley stretching from the San Diego Freeway west to the city limits, 
district officials emphasized that the hardships will ripple through the entire 
640,000-student district.  
</P>
<P>
 About 18,000 students from overcrowded campuses -- in South-Central, the 
Eastside and the southeast cities, including South Gate and Bell -- are bused 
to other schools, many of which are in the Valley.  
</P>
<P>
 "Just as we are concerned about freeways and how much and how long its going 
to take to reconstruct them, we are equally concerned -- and the city ought to 
be equally concerned -- as to how we are going to reconstruct the schools," 
said school board President Leticia Quezada. 
</P>
<P>
 She said it is "very possible" that all schools will remain closed for the 
rest of the week because nearly half of Los Angeles students attend school in 
the Valley. The final decision on closures will be announced this afternoon.  
</P>
<P>
 Thompson indicated that some school buildings, including several at Kennedy 
High School in Granada Hills, may have to be torn down. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees are requested to report to work if conditions are safe, and are 
encouraged to call their employee union representatives if questions arise. 
</P>
<P>
 While no decisions have been made, school officials are discussing actions 
such as a longer school year and double sessions, in which one campus stays 
open twice as long daily to accommodate more students. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I have a message for parents, students and teachers, it's that we find 
ourselves in a situation where we have to be very flexible," said United 
Teachers-Los Angeles President Helen Bernstein. "We are not the first district 
to face some kind of emergency. We need to rise to the occasion together." 
</P>
<P>
 She said teachers will be instrumental in developing the district's response 
to the crisis. The 640-campus district, with its thousands of buildings, is not 
insured for earthquake damage. Even if a company would underwrite the system, 
the cost would be astronomical, said David Koch, head of the district's 
business services division. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has a $30-million emergency reserve, which will cover only a 
fraction of the repairs if Thompson's huge estimate holds true. The district 
has suffered more that $1.2 billion in budget cuts over the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 School officials will plead for emergency funds in Sacramento today. It will 
be up to the state Legislature and U.S. authorities to allocate emergency 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need money and lots of money now," Quezada said. "We have nothing, period. 
Zero. Unless school funding becomes a top priority we have no hope of repairing 
schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the city Tuesday, teachers, principals and even a few students 
concentrated on the work at hand: cleanup. For most schools outside the Valley, 
brooms and trash cans were the only tools needed for the job. But others will 
need jackhammers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been hard to see all this," said Reseda High School student Iman Dakhil. 
"I think it's going to be real hard to focus on education. I can't even think 
about studying and finals were supposed to be tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Although reports of structural damage at University High School on the 
Westside turned out to be only surface cracks, the destruction at Reseda High 
was anything but minor. The auditorium ceiling plaster laid like a white 
blanket on top of the chairs and splinters of light shone through the roof. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's beyond words, it's breathtaking," said Principal Bob Kladisko, who swept 
corridors. "Could you imagine what would have happened if we had been in 
school? Could anyone have gotten out in time?" 
</P>
<P>
 Scattered reports of damage also came from dozens of schools outside the 
Valley, especially in the neighborhoods near the Santa Monica Freeway. And even 
if schools escaped damage, water and electrical troubles affecting the rest of 
the city could keep campuses closed. 
</P>
<P>
 At hard-hit Kennedy High School, where authorities held a news conference, 
10th-grader Kelli Moorman couldn't resist the urge to go to her school, even on 
a day off. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really strange to look at it," she said of the collapsed walls and 
broken windows. "I'm wondering if we are ever going to go back to this school."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; AS WALLS TOPPLE, BRIDGES ARE BUILT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the earth shifted, the walls built to keep out, keep in and keep peace 
crumbled. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the San Fernando Valley, the walls, gates and fences that define this 
suburban sprawl and divide community from community and neighbor from neighbor 
collapsed under their own weight. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Monday morning's quake, the barriers had kept neighbors strangers, made 
neighborhoods into prisons and turned private homes into fortresses. But on 
Tuesday, security gates clanged uselessly in the breeze and once-massive walls 
had become dusty piles of bricks and mortar. 
</P>
<P>
 As they picked up the rubble that once separated them, some neighbors actually 
said hello for the first time and asked one another what they could do to help. 
Residents of gated communities were forced to leave their drawbridges down for 
the night, yet no looters stormed their luxury bunkers. 
</P>
<P>
 For a little while anyway, a city obsessed with security let its guard down. 
And survived. Their faith in nature betrayed, people were forced to turn to one 
another for support. And with the walls of distrust in pieces, many started 
building bridges of trust. 
</P>
<P>
 "The walls came tumbling down and people learned they could help one another," 
said Ed Blakely, a professor of urban planning at UC Berkeley. "Maybe there is 
some potential here. Maybe we might start learning to live together." 
</P>
<P>
 If so, it would buck the recent history of Southern California development: 
building more and more secure offices, residences and housing tracts. Planners 
and architects talk about "defensible space." Developers advertise their 
housing projects as offering "gate-guarded prestige." Urban historian Mike 
Davis has compared Los Angeles to an "armored honeycomb." 
</P>
<P>
 Driving down many major boulevards in the Valley often suggests a trip through 
one of the concrete flood-control channels that crisscross the region. Both 
sides of the street are the same uniform tan or gray or occasionally red brick, 
dotted with scraggly trees and luminescent patches of grass. 
</P>
<P>
 Their message, sent in a structural shorthand, is clear: Keep out. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the electricity went out, many walls kept residents in, stuck behind 
security gates that refused to swing open. Some residents of secure apartment 
buildings were unable to use their cars because garage gates were stuck. 
</P>
<P>
 Many more simply abandoned the notion of a secure garage and forced the doors 
open, holding them in place with electrical cord or rope. One Sherman Oaks 
apartment manager left a radio on all night to discourage looters from 
ransacking his complex's unsecured garage. 
</P>
<P>
 In Granada Hills, all three cinder-block walls around Art and Dorothy 
Roberto's modest home crumbled in the quake, leaving their back yard exposed 
for the first time in 42 years. The same thing happened to most of their 
neighbors, some of whom the Robertos had never met. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is an upside, this is it," Art Roberto said. Across the alley, 
crumbled walls exposed the neighbors' swimming pool and a lawn in need of 
mowing. Roberto met them for the first time Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Real nice people," he said, clearing a small pile of bricks from the flower 
bed. Walking across another brick stack, Roberto reminded a visitor to "make 
sure you close the gate." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his humor and the newfound friends across the alley, the Robertos plan 
to rebuild the wall -- or better, a wooden fence -- as quickly as possible. "It 
just takes everything away from you," Dorothy Roberto said. "It's like you 
don't own anything anymore. Now it's not my yard -- it's everybody's. We're 
unprotected now." 
</P>
<P>
 Blakely, who has studied the phenomenon of gated communities, speculated that 
many more people will respond as the Robertos did and rebuild their walls once 
the urgency of the moment fades. Property will regain its prominence over 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish we could be more optimistic," he said. "But I think the first things 
re-erected will be those walls. As time goes by, personal property becomes more 
important than people's neighbors. Your neighbor might be a nice guy, but what 
about everyone else?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That was the question that ran through Blake Clark's mind as he camped in the 
back yard of his home in Ridgegate, a gated community in Northridge. The 
community normally is surrounded by a six-foot brick wall topped with 
decorative metal spikes. Large portions of the barrier crumbled Monday morning, 
leaving a wall just high enough for Clark to sit on as he puffed a cigar. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark, armed with a gun, slept outside not just because he was afraid to stay 
inside but because he wanted to scare off looters. But he insisted that his 
neighborhood is as safe as it ever was. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no such thing as a secured area," he said. "A gate-guarded community 
only makes it more of an inconvenience to rob someone. It's like the old saying 
goes: 'A lock only keeps out an honest man.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Security is a state of mind," he said.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; GREEN AND RED TAGS SPELL OUT A HARSH FUTURE IN

 Building inspectors stepped over heaps of rubble and glass shards Tuesday to 
canvass the city's showcase old business district, trying to determine the 
structural safety of the turn-of-the-century shops. 
</P>
<P>
 As shopkeepers waited nervously behind yellow police tape, inspectors 
concluded each tour of the red brick and masonry buildings by attaching a 
colored tag: green if the structure was safe, red if there was significant 
structural damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Jesse Segovia's Fillmore Market had one of the red tags. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all have to make a living out of here," said a stunned Segovia, who heads 
the family-owned market. "This store has been around for 100 years and 
hopefully it will be around for another 100 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County suffered widespread damage in Monday's quake -- more than 800 
people injured, with a property toll over $400 million -- and no community was 
shaken more violently than rural Fillmore, which sits astride the Oak Ridge 
Fault.

 City leaders had recently poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into an 
effort to refurbish the old downtown district of this small city in Ventura 
County's citrus belt. But the city suffered an estimated $200 million in damage 
in the quake, with more than 50 injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like to call Fillmore the last, best small town in Southern California," 
City Manager Roy Payne said. "We had a very optimistic view of what we would 
accomplish this year. . . . Now we're back to Square 1." 
</P>
<P>
 In other parts of a 40-square-block area crippled by the quake, hundreds of 
newly homeless residents waited for word on whether they would be allowed to 
return to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 A 40-unit apartment complex and a two-story residential hotel that was home to 
more than 100 field workers were closed indefinitely by building inspectors.  
</P>
<P>
 The walls of the 65-year-old Fillmore Hotel crumbled and collapsed Monday, 
crushing a row of cars along Fillmore Street and leaving the one- and 
two-bedroom apartments exposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedro Barajas, 53, and his eight children lived in an apartment at the hotel. 
When the quake hit, they escaped -- partially dressed -- with only their lives. 
Sheriff's deputies will not allow them to return to the building. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't get anything -- not even shoes," Barajas said, surrounded by his 
children at a Red Cross shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout Fillmore, families spent the night outside, sleeping in tents or 
simply laying mattresses in their front lawns. Many homes throughout the city 
were left listing or knocked off their foundations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still nervous," said Leticia Quezada, 22, who spent the night on her 
mother's front lawn with her brother, sister and mother. The family had set up 
a barbecue grill and a table where they ate lunch and dinner Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We probably will stay out here tonight as well," Quezada said. 
</P>
<P>
 Down the block, the Wertz family had set up two pup tents and living room 
chairs on the front lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a mess in there, everything is on the floor and, besides, the 
youngest one is terrified," said Mary Jo Wertz, cradling her 6-year-old, 
Jeanie. 
</P>
<P>
 On California 126, on the eastern edge of Fillmore, highway construction crews 
Tuesday began patching a giant crater left when a natural gas line exploded. 
The blast ripped a 10-foot-wide crater in the highway, shooting a ball of fire 
into the sky. 
</P>
<P>
 The explosion lit a fire at a nearby mobile home park. One mobile home burned 
to the ground. Two adjacent trailers were badly damaged by fire and several 
others were shaken from their foundations during the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the mobile home residents spent the night at the emergency shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 The building inspections Tuesday focused on Fillmore's showcase business 
district, where the quake damaged about 60 historic buildings along the main 
thoroughfare and sent bricks crashing to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the downtown buildings are made of unreinforced masonry. "It's like 
most places," said Donald Jephcott, an Orange County structural engineer 
brought in to help determine whether downtown buildings were safe to re-enter. 
"These old buildings all come apart (when) they are shaken."

 One of the more dramatic moments in Andrew Lloyd Webber's "Sunset Boulevard" 
occurs when the massive set re-creating Norma Desmond's living room is raised 
off the stage and another scene is performed underneath. 
</P>
<P>
 That exercise in theatrical magic must have been on the minds of the show's 
producers after Monday's earthquake. Even if Tuesday night's performance hadn't 
been preempted by the extended curfew, the show at Century City's Shubert 
Theater would have been canceled after a day of inspection by engineers and 
careful checking of mechanical cues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sunset" spokesman Rick Miramontez said that although the engineers had deemed 
the theater safe for the audience, there had been some minor damage to the set 
and some backstage areas needed to be tidied up. He added that the power lines 
for the air-conditioning system had not yet been restored. "Everybody expects 
all of that to be in place" for tonight's performance, Miramontez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those temporary setbacks reflected the quake's effect on the Southland's arts 
and entertainment venues. Most major museums and theaters reported little if 
any damage, but Santa Monica galleries and small theaters in the San Fernando 
Valley were not so lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 Universal Studios reopened Tuesday, but the park's "Earthquake" attraction was 
taken off the tour.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's like flying the flag at half-mast," said Joan Bullard, vice president of 
public relations. "We did the same thing after the (1989) San Francisco 
earthquake."  
</P>
<P>
 The park's "King Kong" attraction was closed because of structural damage, but 
attendance was still brisk Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 "If they can have a safe day, we're open for them," Bullard said. "Maybe it'll 
take their minds off things." Universal's CityWalk was also open Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia operates only on weekends at this time of 
year and officials expect to be open Saturday and Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
 Most art museums reported only minor damage to their buildings and 
collections. The Southwest Museum in Highland Park lost four ceramic works from 
its 12,000-piece collection, and cracks reappeared in walls that had been 
patched after previous quakes. It will be at least four weeks before the 
Burbank satellite of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles can reopen. It 
suffered major damage to ceiling tiles and its sprinkler system went off during 
the quake and flooded the main gallery ankle-deep, administrator Mary Ann Dunn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's exhibition cases were damaged, 
but the 100,000 artworks on display and in storage are intact. Neither the 
Museum of Contemporary Art nor the Santa Monica Museum of Art reported any 
damage. The J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu removed four small sculptural 
objects for remounting after they shifted in display cases, but the works were 
not seriously damaged, press officer Lori Starr said. None of the Getty Trust's 
other facilities, including the Brentwood construction site for the planned 
Getty Center, was damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At many galleries, however, when earth shook, paintings flew off walls and 
artworks collided, windows broke, debris rained from ceilings and books pitched 
off shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took a pretty good hit," dealer Bryce Bannatyne said of his Santa Monica 
gallery. "The building is OK, but everything inside fell over." Several Santa 
Monica dealers who lease spaces in a gallery complex on Broadway also were 
faced with cleanup. At Robert Berman, Patricia Shea and Mark Moore galleries, 
many artworks were damaged and a few were destroyed, but the dealers declined 
to identify the works affected or to state their value. 
</P>
<P>
 At the James Corcoran Gallery on 5th Street, ceramic pieces by James Mason and 
Kenneth Price were damaged beyond repair, glass covering framed drawings was 
broken and paintings were jostled out of storage racks, according to gallery 
director Sandra Starr. The brick and glass building also suffered damage. At 
the nearby Shoshona Wayne Gallery, dealer Wayne Blank was distressed about the 
loss of a $150,000 Bruce Nauman sculpture but relieved that the piece was 
insured. 
</P>
<P>
 The curfew extension canceled Tuesday's preview performance of "Fool Moon" at 
the Ahmanson at the Doolittle in Hollywood, and a spokesman said the Wednesday 
night show would also be rescheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Lawrence Christon, Richard Cromelin, Lynne Heffley, Jeff 
Prugh, Sherry Stern and David Wharton contributed to this report.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; FOR FILM AND TV, THE SHOW CAN'T GO ON; DELAYS: 
PRODUCTION SCHEDULES FOR SOME PROJECTS WILL BE PUSHED BACK. EXECUTIVES USED THE 
DAY TO ASSESS DAMAGE TO OFFICES AND SETS.

 The earthquake didn't wake up members of one Los Angeles movie crew. They were 
in the middle of production, filming just miles from the epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I could think of was the movie 'San Francisco,' " said photographer Tony 
Friedkin, referring to the 1936 Clark Gable film set against the 1906 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedkin and the 100 other cast and crew members scrambled off a sound stage 
in Sylmar at 4:31 a.m. Monday, moments after they had completed a courtroom 
scene for "Murder in the First" at the Tri-Scenic Sound Studio. 
</P>
<P>
 "Director Marc Rocco had just gotten a take that he liked and the cast 
(including actors Christian Slater, Kevin Bacon and Gary Oldman) were just 
sitting there, and then this thing hit. The sets stayed up, but the building 
started to go and I got thrown like a trampoline into a metal cart," said the 
44-year-old, 170-pound Friedkin. "Other people had significant injuries." 
</P>
<P>
 "Murder in the First" was probably the only active production so close to the 
quake's epicenter and almost certainly the last in Southern California to roll 
cameras Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The film, TV and music industries were nearly at a standstill Tuesday as the 
day was used to assess damage to sound stages, studios and offices and to allow 
employees to avoid the damaged freeways and survey their own property. 
</P>
<P>
 Warner Bros., Walt Disney Studios and Universal Pictures, the three major 
studios in the San Fernando Valley, and therefore those closest to the 
epicenter, were closed for the day. The studios suffered flooding, broken 
windows and destruction of office interiors. Losses, including dollar 
estimates, are still being tallied. 
</P>
<P>
 For Hollywood's feature film studios, the timing of the quake could not have 
been more opportune. There was no shooting planned at the major studios and 
only limited work on locations around Los Angeles County. Fearing a strike 
several weeks ago by the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, 
the companies had deferred studio production months in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But not everything came to a standstill. Calls went out to crew members 
working on "The Crossing Guard," an independently made movie directed by Sean 
Penn (whose Malibu home was destroyed in the fall fires), that shooting would 
resume Tuesday. Jack Nicholson, the movie's star, was also expected to report 
to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Television production delays were more widespread and could eventually affect 
what viewers across the nation watch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Later in the season there may be an extra rerun or two or an extra preemption 
in the middle of the schedule," said one studio executive. "But it shouldn't 
affect viewing too greatly. It all depends on what the damage looks like when 
all is said and done." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the inconveniences on the sets were no different than those faced by 
residents, such as the plates that came crashing down in the kitchen on the NBC 
Burbank set of the sitcom "Fresh Prince of Bel-Air."  
</P>
<P>
 The damage was more severe on other shows, especially on those shooting in the 
Valley. On the set of Fox's ensemble drama "Melrose Place," which films near 
the quake's epicenter at the Santa Clarita Studios, overhead scaffolding 
crashed and the sets became a shambles. Production is expected to be delayed 
for up to two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Most incidents involved broken pipes, fallen sets and structural damage to 
buildings. A broken water line at Sunset-Gower Studios flooded the stage of 
NBC's "The John Larroquette Show" with four inches of water, setting production 
back a week.  
</P>
<P>
 Many shows were trying to find ways to continue production this week, but many 
employees could not even get to work because of freeway damage. At NBC, only 
20% of the employees were in Tuesday. "The priority has been put out to take 
care of your personal lives first," an NBC spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The syndicated "Arsenio Hall Show" will stop production for one week, although 
a Paramount spokesman did not know why. Sources speculate that shows shooting 
in the San Fernando Valley may be shut down for two weeks or more. The 
headquarters of the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences on Lankershim 
Boulevard in North Hollywood will be closed the rest of the week after the 
ceiling of the main conference room collapsed and the glass doors at the 
building's entrance shattered. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, the recording industry was shut down Tuesday, with just a 
trickle of staffers coming in to clean up their offices or check their phone 
messages. There was no word on buildings that had been damaged, but inspections 
were planned for, among others, Warner Bros.' Burbank headquarters, Sony 
Music's new Santa Monica complex, Virgin Records' offices in Beverly Hills and 
the A & M lot in Hollywood.  
</P>
<P>
 Around Hollywood, events were being rescheduled. A dinner Thursday at the 
Beverly Wilshire Hotel, where Clint Eastwood was to receive a humanitarian 
award from the American Jewish Committee, was postponed and a new date will be 
set. 
</P>
<P>
 The headquarters of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences in Beverly 
Hills was closed Tuesday as workers tried to clean up a water leak. The 
academy's board of governors postponed until next Tuesday a meeting to 
determine the future of short-subject Oscars.  
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn., which hands out Golden 
Globe Awards for film and television, said the annual dinner show will go on as 
scheduled Saturday night.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; SUFFERING LIKE THEIR OWNERS, MANY PETS ARE 
LOST, INJURED; ANIMALS: SOME DISORIENTED CATS AND DOGS ARE KILLED ON ROADS. 
OTHERS ARE RESCUED BY STRANGERS, WHO CARE FOR THEM OR TAKE THEM TO BUSY 
SHELTERS.

<P>
 For thousands of pets, as well as their owners, the earthquake was a nightmare 
of pain, heartache and terror. 
</P>
<P>
 In the chaos of the hours after the quake, an untold number of dogs, cats, 
horses and other animals became separated from their owners, left to wander the 
streets, spooked by the trembling earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Many were killed by cars and trucks on darkened roads and freeways while 
others became strays, their owners looking desperately for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps nowhere was that more evident than at the West Valley Animal Shelter 
in Chatsworth, where a stream of animals and their owners have arrived since 
the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pandemonium out there," said Los Angeles City Animal Control Lt. Richard 
Felosky. "It's terrible, the worst I've ever seen. When I got here (Monday) the 
animals that were already here -- we've got sheep, horses, pigs, dogs, cats, 
everything -- were going crazy. Some of the (kennel) doors had been jarred 
loose and some dogs were wandering around inside. Now people are coming in 
nonstop with animals, or looking for their animals, by the dozens." 
</P>
<P>
 By late Tuesday afternoon, about 300 animals had been brought to the shelter, 
and an equal number to the East Valley shelter in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Animal control officers also worked frantically to provide water for horses in 
canyon areas where utilities were out. Department of Water and Power tankers 
reached more than 700 rapidly dehydrating horses. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the animals arriving at shelters and clinics were brought in by 
strangers. Cats had been injured by flying bricks and timbers. Dogs' paws were 
sliced open as they ran in panic through broken glass. Birds had feathers torn 
off as they were tossed around in their cages. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a little hamster that was injured when a book fell on it," said Bill 
Thomas, co-owner of the Southern California Veterinary Hospital in Woodland 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Still other pets were struck by cars on darkened, unsignaled streets. Some 
were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, hundreds -- perhaps thousands -- of pets were believed to be 
wandering the streets or the makeshift camps that earthquake refugees set up in 
parks throughout the San Fernando Valley and the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the disoriented animals helped by people were normally wild ones. At 
the West Valley shelter, animal control officers were brought 26 opossums and 
one raccoon, which they released in a mountain canyon Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's raining possums," said Gary Olsen, general manager of the Department of 
Animal Regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Fix, 28, of Woodland Hills, seemed surprised when asked why he picked up 
an injured female Airedale lying in a gutter and brought the dog to the West 
Valley shelter in his car. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a dog in need of help," Fix said simply.  
</P>
<P>
 About half of the animals brought to the West Valley shelter had been claimed 
by Tuesday afternoon, Felosky said.  
</P>
<P>
 "There he is!" shouted Eddie Blair, 29, of Reseda, as he spotted his 
bloodhound, Red, who ran away when a fence was knocked down in the quake. "I've 
been looking all over. . . . I was afraid I'd never find him." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Others took lost pets into their homes and put up homemade signs seeking the 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Found, Black Dog," said one posted on Topanga Canyon Boulevard. "Earthquake 
Cat Found," said another. "Horse Found" said a third. There were dozens like 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirsten Thye and Todd Smith put up a sign by Topanga Canyon Boulevard asking 
drivers to watch for disoriented animals wandering in the traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Slow -- Pets Out," the sign announced in large, bright-pink letters. 
</P>
<P>
 "People just aren't thinking about dogs being freaked out and wandering in the 
street," said Thye, who has two dogs. "We thought if we put up the sign people 
might think and slow down a little." 
</P>
<P>
 Some panicked pets caused accidents -- and not merely when they were struck by 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
 One woman rushed to Thomas' clinic with her stricken bird, who in its distress 
pecked her repeatedly as she drove -- causing her to wreck her brand-new car.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; GOUGING ON PRICES REPORTED; LAW ENFORCEMENT: A

1992 ORDINANCE PASSED IN THE WAKE OF RIOTING.

 Some residents of quake-ravaged communities became victims of a different sort 
Tuesday as some merchants boosted prices on everyday necessities such as milk, 
water, gasoline, batteries and disposable diapers. 
</P>
<P>
 At a temporary shelter set up for victims at Sylmar High School, a woman told 
aides to Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) that a convenience store had 
charged her $1.50 for a cup of water. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Fernando, police persuaded the manager of an Arco station to lower 
gasoline prices after boosting them 140% in the hours after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 There were other reports around the region of price gouging on plumbing 
supplies to repair broken water pipes and water heaters, and plywood needed to 
board up broken storefronts and windows. 
</P>
<P>
 Anticipating further reports, law enforcement officials in Los Angeles on 
Tuesday established a task force to handle quake-related complaints about price 
gouging, charity fund-raisers and public insurance adjusters, among other 
things. The number is (800) 897-6677. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles merchants can be prosecuted for price gouging, defined as boosting 
prices by more than 10% above pre-disaster levels. The ordinance was adopted 
after the 1992 riots, when local authorities found they had few legal tools to 
fight gouging. 
</P>
<P>
 At an afternoon press conference, Los Angeles Police Chief Willie L. Williams 
said residents who encounter price-gouging should contact police immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Atty. Ruth Kwan, who chairs the task force, said she has received 
unconfirmed complaints that two convenience stores in the San Fernando Valley 
charged $6 for a gallon of water, and of a construction supply company selling 
four sheets of plywood for $1,000, more than 10 times the usual price. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our officers are coming back with reports from citizens all over the city," 
said Robert Parks, public information officer for the San Fernando Police 
Department. "The most ridiculous price I've heard is $8 for a gallon of milk." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Police urged the owner of an Arco station at Brand and Laurel Canyon 
boulevards to lower his prices after angry customers complained that they were 
being ripped off. Immediately after the quake, the station raised the price of 
regular gasoline to $2.50 a gallon from $1.04. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our officers persuaded him to use better judgment," San Fernando Police Chief 
Dominick Rivetti said.  
</P>
<P>
 Police said the station's gasoline was back at pre-quake prices today. 
</P>
<P>
 Complaints about quake-related gouging were not limited to the epicenter area 
in Northridge. Los Angeles attorney David Bricker said that one plumbing supply 
store in Mar Vista wanted to charge him $30 for a flexible copper pipe normally 
priced at about $7. The pipe was needed to repair a water heater.

 The stucco skin of Joanne Foley's Woodland Hills home looked like the shell of 
a hard-boiled egg that had been tapped with a spoon. 
</P>
<P>
 As Allstate Insurance claims adjuster Dale Weimer walked around the property 
at noontime Tuesday, Foley pointed out balky doors and a horizontal crack that 
bisected the first and second floors for more than half the circumference of 
the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole house is tweaked," Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weimer jotted notes and murmured reassurance. Inside the hillside home, he 
surveyed the piles of smashed glassware and plaster, a fissure two fingers wide 
that separated the rustic fireplace from the wall, the cracks that spread out 
like spider webs from every doorjamb and wall joint. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene was re-enacted hundreds of times throughout the San Fernando Valley 
and other parts of Los Angeles as insurance companies contacted policyholders 
and began the work of documenting the destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Their task was made more difficult by power outages, spotty telephone 
communications, damage to many insurance company offices and the frequent 
aftershocks that made it impossible to enter many homes and commercial 
buildings to catalogue the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 At Allstate's regional office in Woodland Hills, falling ceiling panels and 
structural cracks had rendered the building unusable.  
</P>
<P>
 20th Century Insurance Co.'s 11-story headquarters in Woodland Hills was 
closed. State Farm Insurance shut down regional claims offices in Woodland 
Hills, Northridge, Mission Hills and Santa Monica. Farmers Insurance Group's 
Los Angeles regional office in Simi Valley was badly damaged and unusable. 
Safeco had to close its Van Nuys office. Many other carriers faced similar 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Allstate, like some of its rivals, improvised by parking a large mobile home 
outside its Woodland Hills office. Card tables and folding chairs were set up 
on the cracked pavement for employees to collect preliminary claims information 
from policyholders. 
</P>
<P>
 Other loss reports were fielded over emergency toll-free lines that Allstate 
and other insurers have established. 
</P>
<P>
 The reports were passed on to a small army of claims adjusters such as Weimer, 
who visited homes and attempted to keep in touch via mobile phone. Even that 
proved difficult, however, as cellular phone traffic was heavy enough to jam 
the airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Weimer's visit to Foley's home was a preliminary sortie and something of a 
hand-holding session. He wanted to get a quick firsthand look, answer Foley's 
questions and write her a check to cover initial living expenses while she is 
away from the home where she has lived for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "My heart and soul is in this house," said Foley, who was anxious that the 
house would be condemned. 
</P>
<P>
 Weimer told her that as bad as the damage looked, it appeared to be mainly 
broken plaster without severe structural damage. He said they would know for 
sure when a full-fledged inspection followed in a few days. After that, 
Allstate will estimate the repair costs and offer a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Weimer told Foley that she should keep receipts and take note of any unusual 
expenses, such as additional mileage driven, utility hookup fees, and the cost 
of securing the home while it is empty. 
</P>
<P>
 "Keep a paper and pen handy and keep jotting down things as you think of 
them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most earthquake insurance policies, Foley's carries a 10% deductible, 
which means the destruction could end up costing her $16,000.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was thinking of retiring in a couple of years," said Foley, who teaches 
fifth and sixth grade at the Parkview Center School in Simi Valley. "Now I 
won't be able to." 
</P>
<P>
 Weimer shook hands with Foley in her driveway and offered some final words of 
support. Just then, a motorist called out from her car, "Any sign of the 
insurance people?" 
</P>
<P>
 The woman hurriedly spilled out a tale of a sick baby at her quake-damaged 
home and her difficulty reaching Allstate. Weimer jumped into his pickup truck 
and followed the woman to her house.

BERLIN PASSES THE HAT FOR QUAKE VICTIMS; ASSISTANCE: A LOS ANGELES SISTER CITY 
SAYS IT OWES A GREAT DEBT TO ALL AMERICANS. RESPONSE IS SAID TO BE STRONG.

 Declaring that it owed a debt to all Americans for their protection during the 
Cold War, the city government here launched a campaign Tuesday to collect 
donations for victims of the Los Angeles earthquake. Contributions quickly 
started coming in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Berliners will never forget the way the United States helped our city and our 
country in the hour of our greatest need," said Berlin Mayor Eberhard Diepgen 
in a letter to his Los Angeles counterpart, Richard Riordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles has had a sister city link with Berlin since 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 The city Tuesday established a special account at the Berliner Bank entitled 
"Earthquake Victims" and distributed the account number to the region's media. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlin government spokesman Klaus Hetzel said one of the city's most popular 
radio stations, called 100.6, donated 10,000 German marks ($5,800) and the 
Museum on Checkpoint Charlie pledged 1,000 marks ($580). 
</P>
<P>
 Response from the public reportedly has also been strong. 
</P>
<P>
 Several thousand American soldiers have been stationed in the western part of 
the German capital since the end of World War II, keeping the city from being 
strangled by Soviet forces in 1948 by operating the famous Berlin airlift, then 
facing off against Soviet troops across Checkpoint Charlie during one of the 
Cold War's most tense periods in the early 1960s.

MAN WOUNDED IN GANG PEACEMAKER'S DEATH IS CHARGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of two men wounded in a shootout that left gang peacemaker Tony Thomas 
dead last week has been charged as a suspect in the killing, police said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodney Compton, 20, was arrested outside St. Francis Hospital on Saturday, the 
day after Thomas' death, and booked on suspicion of murder.Compton had returned 
to the hospital for treatment of a wound sustained in the shootout, which 
allegedly erupted after Thomas confronted some suspected drug dealers in the 
Imperial Courts housing project in Watts. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Sergio Robleto, commander of the LAPD's South Bureau homicide detail, said 
officers went to the hospital Saturday to question Compton for a second time. 
Compton had been questioned Friday as a victim in the shooting incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Robleto said police do not have a motive in the slaying of Thomas, who helped 
orchestrate the Watts truce between Crips and Bloods.

MUTUAL FUND INDUSTRY RECOGNIZING GENDER GAP; INVESTING: FINANCIAL-SERVICES 
GROUP, WITH THE VIEW THAT WOMEN HAVE DIFFERENT OUTLOOKS, OFFER INVESTMENT 
SEMINARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHET CURRIER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the game of mutual-fund investing, questions of gender seldom come up. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, the numbers in the quarterly statements and performance tables tell 
exactly the same story whether an investor is male or female. Access to a wide 
variety of funds is, without question, open to anyone of either sex whose money 
is the proper shade of green. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the eyes of fund executive Bridget Macaskill, all this misses some 
important issues about women as managers of their own and their families' 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 "A woman's investment dollar is just as valuable as a man's investment 
dollar," says Macaskill, president and chief operating officer of Oppenheimer 
Management Corp., adviser to a $26-billion family of more than 50 funds. "But 
neither the financial services industry nor women themselves have focused much 
attention on women's potential as investors." 
</P>
<P>
 Even in the mid-1990s, she says, many women still lack the knowledge and sense 
of self-determination to take charge of their personal finances. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see many women, particularly middle-age and older, who have not a single 
idea of how to go about managing their finances," Macaskill said in an 
interview in her World Trade Center office. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a growing awareness that this is something they've really got to 
take control of." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past couple of years, Macaskill and other Oppenheimer officials have 
conducted hundreds of investment seminars for women around the country, as part 
of a "Women & Investing" campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very tough message that you sometimes have to deliver," she says, 
especially in cases where women need to learn "the cost of delaying making 
decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 In retirement planning, she says, a good many women "don't save enough, they 
don't set up retirement plans soon enough, and when they do they are so 
conservative they tend to underinvest in equities." 
</P>
<P>
 But if women in general need to get better informed, she says, most aren't 
reluctant to admit it. At the seminars she has held, she says, "the turnout has 
been incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 "Women will ask for help," she says. "It's a stereotypical response, but it 
happens. Somehow it is not demeaning to us to ask for help. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a real fundamental difference in the way men and women approach 
financial decisions. Men tend to say 'I make the decisions.' Women tend to ask 
'How do I know whom to trust?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The whole subject of comparing and contrasting sexes, she acknowledges, can be 
touchy. In an era when financial books, products and services aimed at women 
are proliferating, it's not always easy to distinguish genuine concern and 
idealism from opportunistic marketing ploys. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we started this whole thing, we had a lot of internal debate," Macaskill 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "In terms of investment solutions, there isn't a difference. You don't need 
separate funds for women. But there are differences. Women go about this 
process differently." 
</P>
<P>
 Macaskill says she has talked with a good many financial advisers in the 
business of selling fund shares who acknowledge that they "don't know how to go 
about talking to women." 
</P>
<P>
 "They need to address women's concerns," she says. "They need to approach 
women differently, not because of any discriminatory thing, but because, even 
if you have identical financial situations, in some cases it is very 
appropriate to give men and women very different advice." 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, she says, many women are much warier than men of trusting 
financial advisers, especially on the telephone. Where men often are interested 
in financial products, she adds, women tend to focus more on goals and overall 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Above all, Macaskill urges women to "have the courage to get started." 
</P>
<P>
 At the seminars she holds, Macaskill says, "the age range is from the early 
20s to 70 and 80. It's in the early 20s age group where that 
knight-in-shining-armor image, the idea that someone else is going to take care 
of all this, seems to be dissolving. They are not going to leave it to somebody 
else."

LOS ANGELES TIMES SPECIAL REPORT; ON THE FAULT LINE; SOUTHERN CALIFORNIANS TAKE 
STOCK OF THE EARTHQUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 4:31 a.m. Monday morning. A subterranean wave rolls across the Los Angeles 
Basin and millions of people are simultaneously jolted from sleep.The intensely 
communal experience of shared disaster begins, a ritual that has become all too 
common for Southlanders. For most, the day starts with calming the children's 
jitters and checking for broken plates and glasses. The less fortunate begin to 
sift through the rubble of their homes, to search for lost pets. And yet for 
others, victims of nature's savage and irrational hand, the morning does not 
begin at all. Soon the toll stands at 34 dead, hundreds injured and thousands 
more homeless. Monumental freeway overpasses are toppled like building blocks 
slapped down by an angry child; apartment buildings collapse onto themselves; 
whole neighborhoods are without water and electricity. But the day also brings 
out the best in people. Firefighters risk their lives to save a man crushed 
beneath 20 tons of parking-structure concrete; motorists display an 
uncharacteristic politeness at darkened intersections; neighbors bring their 
camping lanterns out of storage and share their food and water at impromptu 
block parties. In this section, five Times writers share their impressions and 
thoughts about a day as troubling, and as ennobling, as Southern California 
itself.

LOS ANGELES TIMES SPECIAL REPORT; ON THE FAULT LINE; SOUTHERN CALIFORNIANS TAKE 
STOCK OF THE EARTHQUAKE; THE STATE FROM HELL?; SOUTHERN CALIFORNIANS DEBATE THE 
RISK-REWARD RATIO OF LIFE IN THE LAND OF THE SHIFTING SAND

<P>
 So which is it: Do we live in Eden or in a hellhole? 
</P>
<P>
 Is this place trying to shake us off, or is it only doing this to test the 
worthy? 
</P>
<P>
 Has Southern California made a Faustian bargain with a devil wearing Ray Bans 
and slouching behind the wheel of a BMW ragtop? 
</P>
<P>
 The ground had not yet stopped quivering when the long-distance calls from the 
frost zones commenced. After "Are you all right?" came the importuning: "Move 
back here, where it's safe, move back here, where there are no riots, no 
fires." Where you can get hypothermia just retrieving your newspaper from the 
lawn. Where, in Rochester, Minn., 24 hours after the earthquake, the wind chill 
factor was bottoming out at 74 below. 
</P>
<P>
 Within hours of the 6.6 at 4:31, a Connecticut expatriate living in the 
Fairfax district got a phone call that promised her everything -- free meals, 
free rent, free heat -- if she would just come back to the Constitution State. 
Her mom would move all those clothes out of her old bedroom. Her dad would put 
his barbells somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 Another New England woman who came here in 1989 fended off calls -- more 
insistent than post-riot, post-flood, post-fire calls -- demanding that she 
return home immediately. The woman answered her L.A. friends more delicately: 
"Hell, no! We've suffered through the worst L.A. has to offer. I'm not leaving 
till I get a taste of paradise. Southern California owes us!" 
</P>
<P>
 From Minneapolis, early on quake day, a woman wheedled her Los Angeles friend: 
"At least with 40-below weather, you can plan . And you know it's not going to 
hit you in August. . . . So for at least part of the year, you're safe. But 
you're never safe. Guess you'd better think about moving back home, eh?" 
</P>
<P>
 Think again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Disaster is not an enduring discomfort -- cold weather is an enduring 
discomfort. Cold weather emptied the Midwest and filled California," said 
author and California sage Kevin Starr. "I do think there's a special ability 
to live in high-reward, high-risk situations. That's different from a long, 
steady winter." 
</P>
<P>
 After Monday's latest basic training exercise in Southern California 
connect-the-dot disasters, brace yourselves for another kind of shock: the 
usual death-of-California pronouncements in any publication with offices east 
of the Continental Divide. 
</P>
<P>
 This one came Tuesday from a news service, solemn, even elegiac in tone: "The 
covenant was once fun in the sun. Now Southern California's promise seems to 
have turned methodically bleak: fire, flood, riot, drought, stubborn recession 
and reprise earthquakes." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The first action-news report of a Southern California earthquake -- from the 
Portola expedition of 1769 -- set the style for civic nonchalance that was to 
hold for 200 years. Juan Crespi's diary from Aug. 1, 1769, a Thursday: "At ten 
in the morning the earth trembled. The shock was repeated with violence at one 
in the afternoon, and one hour afterwards we experienced another. The soldiers 
went out this afternoon to hunt, and brought an antelope . . . it was not bad." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1924, a German geographer ruminated that an earthquake might one day 
fulfill Southern California's singular destiny, cutting it free from the rest 
of the continent so it could drift into the South Pacific, there to become a 
little tropical paradise. 
</P>
<P>
 John Weaver, Los Angeles' unofficial historian, watched the latest goings-on 
from his new Nevada home. "I think it's in the genes. It's the kind of people 
who come to California -- they're the ones who are not satisfied at home. 
People like that don't give up. . . . If one thing goes wrong, they'll try 
something else." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the neo-pioneers of Southern California lay bravado bets on the 
strength of aftershocks and go on, in aplomb and denial and eternal risk, 
buoyed by the odds -- two score people dead among millions -- and the same 
adrenal exaltation Winston Churchill described from his soldiering days in the 
Boer war: "Nothing in life is so exhilarating as to be shot at without result." 
</P>
<P>
 The exhilaration -- and the worry -- sent people to Roberta Goldfeder's 
Extend-a-Life store in Pasadena on Tuesday, where clerks handed out "Don't 
Panic" buttons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some who are coming into the showroom have heard their neighbors say (they're 
leaving). We heard it after Whittier Narrows (quake), we heard it after Loma 
Prieta -- 'We're going to leave.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't understand that psychology," the former nurse said. "I would never go 
back to New York. California is still, as far as I can see, the place to live. 
Anywhere you go you have problems. I lived through Hurricane Donna in 1960. I 
was stuck in a subway during the great blackout in New York. It's your daily 
life that makes the difference -- to wake up in January and walk outside with 
no coat on." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet another New Yorker -- an actor who just moved to Sherman Oaks and wouldn't 
give his name -- was waiting in the emergency room at Cedars-Sinai Medical 
Center on Quake Day. His wife, an actress, had cut her forehead and wanted it 
stitched up so it wouldn't get in the way of her getting parts. 
</P>
<P>
 A few seconds of earthquake, he said with a laugh, were more frightening than 
anything he'd experienced in his years in the Big Apple. There, he said, you 
just have to worry about the constant shootings on the streets or subway. Here, 
you worry about a seemingly endless onslaught of floods, fires and quakes. He'd 
rather face the risk of human violence -- unless he gets a part. 
</P>
<P>
 From a gurney at Granada Hills Community Hospital, Michael Jafari, 27, of 
Northridge, decided he would finally relent. For years his relatives in New 
Mexico have chided him to get out of this place. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone tells me the Big One is coming and that I should move to New Mexico. 
But I always laugh at them." The physician began suturing Jafari's leg wound. 
Now it has happened. "I'm out of here." 
</P>
<P>
 The new U.S. Attorney for Los Angeles matched the city's resilient, quotable 
self perfectly. In the wreckage of her Studio City townhouse, Nora M. Manella 
remarked: "My place looks like a broken pinata, except that instead of candy, 
there are shards of glass all over the floor." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No less pithy was Valley resident Richard Goodis. After the quake had crushed 
his red Isuzu Impulse and a lot more and sent them fleeing, he returned to 
retrieve some things. On the floor lay "Meditations on Philosophy" by Rene 
Descartes, the "I think therefore I am" man. Goodis glanced at the book. "I 
quake, therefore I am!" he declared, and tossed it into a box to take with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Queen Elizabeth II, whose visit here more than 10 years ago coincided with 
some of the worst storms in memory, sent condolences. Filipinos -- recent 
survivors of coup and volcano -- offered help. 
</P>
<P>
 Listen to the residents of Moscow, a city that survived fires, Napoleon and 
Stalin. 
</P>
<P>
 Igor D. Bespaly, 36, a businessman: "They have an earthquake or a riot in L.A. 
about once a year. Big deal! It is nothing for them because they live in bliss 
the rest of the time. . . . I would gladly go and live and work in L.A. even if 
they had earthquakes more often than that." 
</P>
<P>
 Tatiana V. Statsenko, 22, a medical student: "I admire these Americans! They 
have this terrible earthquake in the middle of a densely populated megalopolis 
and there are only 29 people dead. Of course I am sorry for those who died, but 
the whole thing just shows the great security potential this nation has. They 
would easily survive five Chernobyls, God forbid. Look how organized they are! 
They are not moaning or whimpering. They are not asking anybody to help." 
</P>
<P>
 Irina B. Makarova, 49, a vendor: "Americans have too good a life to complain 
of earthquakes. Their life is so good that maybe this is the price they have to 
pay for it. On the other hand, I can't understand people who live in constant 
danger of earthquake and don't try to move. Their life must be really great if 
they prefer to stay and wait until the roof caves in on their heads." 
</P>
<P>
 Any one of them could have made an ad for the Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Remy is the L.A. Chamber of Commerce, a man paid to be of good cheer, and 
it's easier in some ways to be upbeat about an earthquake than a riot. His 
family came here from Boston in 1852 -- "They left Ireland because the potatoes 
weren't grown anymore, and I think they must have left Boston because they 
couldn't get the potato out of the cold ground." 
</P>
<P>
 His mother and grandmother went through the 1906 San Francisco quake, and he's 
ridden out many shakers here. "My family has enjoyed and prospered in this 
state, and so have 32 million other people." 
</P>
<P>
 Poet Robert Frost, fed up with California boosterism, penned this verse: "I 
met a Californian who would/talk California -- a state so blessed, he said, in 
climate, none had ever died there/a natural death." 
</P>
<P>
 The narcissism and mythology of our own stamina are powerful but not 
altogether untrue. 
</P>
<P>
 "This quake," Starr said, "may be the disaster that turns L.A. around. . . . 
There's something depressing about an urban riot because that shows human 
failure. . . . But an earthquake is an act of God, it's nobody's fault, nobody 
can be blamed for it, and we have behaved so beautifully. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is like the Olympics of 1984 -- a turnaround event, not a 
doom-and-gloom event."

LOS ANGELES TIMES SPECIAL REPORT; ON THE FAULT LINE; SOUTHERN CALIFORNIANS TAKE 
STOCK OF THE EARTHQUAKE; MARKET IN MOTION; SAN FERNANDO VALLEY REALTORS BELIEVE 
THEY CAN STILL SELL, SELL, SELL -- EVEN IN SHAKY TIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Glickman, boy-wonder real estate broker, doesn't believe in earthquakes. 
Or floods. Or typhoons. Or riots. Or devastating fires. Or even dry-gulch 
stretches in the Southern California home sales market, for that matter. 
</P>
<P>
 What he does believe in is the Market, that whimsical force of economic nature 
that can make a crafty realtor millions and millions, then take it all back in 
a heartbeat. He believes in lofty things like the American Dream, the perhaps 
misguided idea that Americans are just not content to rent, that they all want 
that suburban split-level or canyon-nestled estate to call their own -- temblor 
or no temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 And so, as most Southern Californians spent a second straight day watching the 
gory, televised images of Mother Nature's quaking destruction, Mike Glickman 
was all business, ready to sell, sell, sell. 
</P>
<P>
 He's making wild predictions -- such as that he can sell any reasonably priced 
home in the Valley in eight weeks or less, puckishly unfazed by the fact that 
he has a property listing on "virtually every street in the San Fernando Valley 
where something fell yesterday." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, this boyish-looking man who resembles a shorter-locked version of 
shock jock Howard Stern is prepared to look any would-be home buyers dead in 
the eye and, without even the slightest trace of a smile, tell them that: 
</P>
<P>
 This is "the time" to go house-hunting; 
</P>
<P>
 A killer time to close escrow; 
</P>
<P>
 An awesome moment to assume that new mortgage at rock-bottom prices. 
</P>
<P>
 No fooling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because people go on. They dust themselves off from things like this and they 
don't look back," says the bespectacled, curly haired realtor, leaning back in 
a black leather swivel chair in his Encino office. "I live in Malibu. Remember 
the place where they had all those devastating fires just last year? 
</P>
<P>
 "As amazing as it may seem, the housing market there is back to normal, just 
like those fires never happened. It's the same with earthquakes. Other things 
happen -- the Menendez verdicts, the Bobbitt trial, the Olympic skater snafu, 
Michael Jackson. People forget. And then they go back to buying houses." 
</P>
<P>
 He stops for a moment, his voice lowering an octave like a conspirator 
hatching a secret plan: "If I were a home buyer, I'd be out looking. Right now, 
you can get people who are freaked out. They'll sell for next to nothing. In 
two weeks, they'll be back to normal and the prices will go back up." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the 33-year-old Glickman spent much of Tuesday putting the jangled 
nerves of homeowners to rest, doing disaster control on many of the 40 homes he 
has in escrow throughout the San Fernando Valley, making sure that despite a 
cracked ceiling or crumbling foundation, a shaky deal is still a deal. 
</P>
<P>
 And, of course, he wheeled and dealed. He rocked and rolled. But what else 
would you expect from the onetime whiz kid of San Fernando Valley real estate, 
a man who before age 30 had an army of 1,800 agents and became the 
personification of the booming California housing market? 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, the story of Mike Glickman runs parallel to the aftermath of 
Monday's 6.6-magnitude quake. In 1990, when an inflated regional housing market 
crashed like so many aftershocks rumbling through a living room, Glickman 
buckled with it. 
</P>
<P>
 He filed for bankruptcy. He lost Mike Glickman Realty, the company he built 
from the ground up, starting in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he started over, taking a job for Jon Douglas Co., one of his former 
competitors. Like some fast-talking phoenix, he is once again marketing houses 
and condominiums and 10-story castles from Sylmar to Studio City, selling an 
impressive 170 homes in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 On Day Two after the Northridge earthquake, the man known as the Comeback Kid 
is on the telephone, asking customers to do the same thing in the now shaky 
real estate market. 
</P>
<P>
 A broker representing a buyer informs him that, due to damage caused by the 
quake, they are canceling their offer on a Northridge home. He takes the news 
in stride, asking if they would accept the home at a lower price. 
</P>
<P>
 He covers the receiver. "They're open," he says. "See what I mean? We're going 
to sell. We're still going to sell." 
</P>
<P>
 Across the Valley, inside a tree-shaded hillside home, broker Teri Young 
performs her own version of earthquake damage control: As a gesture of 
goodwill, she has stopped to console a couple who suffered extensive damage to 
the Woodland Hills home they bought just a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary and Shelley Hammer are nearly in tears as they race in and out of the 
eggshell of a home for which they paid $415,000, pointing out to the 14-year 
realty veteran the huge cracks that meander along their walls and foundation 
like a waterless river bed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," Gary Hammer says in despair, his voice breaking. "I've 
survived tornadoes, hurricanes and even wars, but nothing like this. Teri, my 
body is still shaking. My family is in shock. I don't know what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Young, a robust 45-year-old dressed in purple shirt and slacks and white 
sneakers, offers a bear-hug embrace: "Gary, you're OK. Your family's OK. I know 
what you're going through. My house was damaged, too. But like my husband says, 
all this stuff around you, they're just things." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Young has become friends with the couple, their anguish and anger 
surfaces uncontrolled, momentarily aiming at her. Outside, 53-year-old Gary 
Hammer levels his eyes at his realtor, wondering how he'll ever unload his 
house now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teri, this is the end. You're a real estate broker. What are you going to do 
to earn a living?"  
</P>
<P>
 Her answer is swift and sure. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not the end. All of us, we're going to continue to do good work," says 
the Jon Douglas Co. realtor. "Look at it this way, I was able to come over here 
and you didn't throw me out. That's a start, isn't it? You've got to go on. 
This just cannot take over your life. I'll tell you, I'm going on. Are you 
coming with me?" 
</P>
<P>
 Young has spent the last two days putting out such emotional fires, answering 
calls late into the night from sellers, their damaged homes now in danger of 
falling out of escrow, asking, pleading: "Teri, what do I do? What do I do?" 
</P>
<P>
 She has heard stories of the would-be buyer who, after entering into escrow on 
a Woodland Hills home, visited the house in the hours before dawn Monday, 
demanding to be let in for a white-glove foundation inspection. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, like many brokers trained in public relations and fueled by their own 
personal chutzpah, this realtor -- who has sold more than 1,100 properties here 
-- doesn't buy the newest, earthquake-fueled bad rap on the Southern California 
housing market. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, we get earthquakes but, really, what bad thing can happen here that 
can't happen back East? In Florida, they have hurricanes. In the Midwest, 
tornadoes whip out of nowhere. So why is California so different from the rest 
of the country? We don't have the market cornered on disasters, you know." 
</P>
<P>
 When the quake struck, Young recalled jumping to a few wild conclusions 
herself: "I started screaming 'I'm getting the hell out of California.' But my 
husband shook me for a while and forced me to get a grip on myself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I'm all better. And that's what it's going to take for everyone else who 
owns a home in this area. They've got to get a grip on themselves. I just don't 
know how long it's going to take." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Glickman has an idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Glickman was a schoolboy when the famed Sylmar quake hit in 1971. But Monday, 
in the midst of the chaos, he got on the phone to retired realtors and asked 
about how the real estate market fared after that disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "To a person, they told me that the market was soft for about three months 
while people got their homes back into shape. Then the market went back to 
normal. Houses sold like hot cakes again." 
</P>
<P>
 Glickman, the eternal optimist, sees history repeating itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I give the market eight weeks to bottom out, tops, before it picks up again," 
he says. "This summer, we're going to have the best real estate market in the 
history of the San Fernando Valley, you can bet on it. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is, unless something unforeseen happens -- like a fire or maybe another 
earthquake."

STOCK OF THE EARTHQUAKE; TOO CLOSE TO HOME; YES, QUAKES COME WITH THE 
TERRITORY, BUT THIS TEMBLOR WAS DIFFERENT

 Linda Gordon, a math teacher at Bird Middle School, shrugged when asked about 
the odds of her survival. 
</P>
<P>
 "It happens or it doesn't," she said. "Fifty-fifty." 
</P>
<P>
 Anat Laskier couldn't help but wonder about a higher authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone -- God or someone -- took care of us," she said, keeping an eye on 
her two children. "I don't have any other explanation." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the Northridge Meadows apartments, the survivors had gathered Tuesday 
morning in hopes of salvaging belongings from the ruins of a buildings they 
used to call home. Sixteen of their neighbors perished here as the ground floor 
units in the three-story buildings collapsed beneath the upper levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, the difference between life and death was a single flight of stairs. The 
survivors lived to tell the tale of the Northridge Meadows apartments and their 
own narrow escape. 
</P>
<P>
 Their stories may be more dramatic, but all of Los Angeles can speak of a 
narrow escape. This was a disaster that killed 40 people, put hundreds in the 
hospital, caused an estimated $1 billion in damage. Yet in a town famous for 
living life on the edge, for producing high drama in fiction and in fact, we 
avoided catastrophic death by a few hours on the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 Tens of thousands of us drive freeways daily that buckled and broke; yet the 
number of freeway fatalities was not unlike a normal day. This past Christmas 
season, thousands of us did our shopping at Northridge Fashion Plaza. We parked 
in a garage that was turned into 20 tons of rubble, pinning a man underneath it 
for nine hours Monday morning. We browsed Bullock's, now a ruin. 
</P>
<P>
 What are the odds that the quake would have struck us in our sleep? 
</P>
<P>
 Not even fifty-fifty. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Laskier family vividly recalls when the floor fell out from under them. It 
was like a sudden drop in an airplane, but with more of a jolt. Much more. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in the parking lot!" an astonished Anat told her husband, Michael. The 
unit beneath their second-story apartment was crushed. Michael broke glass from 
a window and went into the cold night darkness. The Laskier's children -- 
9-year-old Ron and 6-year-old Sheer -- jumped into their father's arms. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went to see if our grandmother was dead. But she wasn't," Sheer said. 
Their grandmother lives a few blocks north. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Gordon lived on the ground floor apartment in a building identical to 
the Laskiers'. Her building tilted severely but did not collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 Why did one structure collapse and another not? The residents want to know 
what the building and safety inspectors will find. But on Monday and Tuesday, 
as they waited to see whether they may be able to salvage their belongings, 
their conversation focused more on the fickleness of earthquakes and fate 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything happened so fast," said Gabriel Pelaez, who moved here from 
Chicago recently and was living with his brother, Marco. "Like for two or three 
minutes, everyone was screaming for help." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pelaez brothers lived in a second-floor apartment of a building that 
tilted but didn't fall. Outside, he recalled, they tried to help the less 
fortunate. Gabriel and Marco pulled a man and a woman from a small opening in 
one flattened apartment. They helped another man out, but his wife was missing. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way to get in there," Gabriel said. "There was no more first 
floor. . . . There was one lady -- all I could see were her legs. . . . I 
couldn't see anything else. I've seen it in movies, but never up close. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Near Pelaez stood Gustavo Garcia, 27. Garcia managed to get himself and his 
wife to safety. Now he was more concerned about reports concerning a friend and 
co-worker, who was feared to have been trapped in his first-floor apartment. It 
wasn't until Tuesday night that the coroner confirmed that Adam Slatnick was 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia survived a larger quake -- the Mexico City temblor of 1985. But this 
time, he and his neighbors were close to the epicenter. "It was just bouncing 
and bouncing," Garcia said, jerking his hands up and down and sideways to 
describe the motion. 
</P>
<P>
 Nature's unpredictability wasn't the only danger at Northridge Meadows. 
Firefighters, who weathered the worst aftershocks, were placed in jeopardy due 
to poor coordination with the Department of Water & Power. 
</P>
<P>
 An anxious moment came in the early morning when the electricity was 
unexpectedly restored. Exposed wire created a risk of electrocution and caused 
several small fires, said Engineer Frank McCarthy of the Los Angeles County 
Fire Department.  
</P>
<P>
 "We were in the middle of recovering a victim" when electrical power was 
restored, McCarthy said, adding that it was "very possible" for firefighters to 
have been trapped. Fire prompted rescue workers to abandon the ruins until the 
flames were extinguished. An hour later, Department of Water & Power shut off 
the electricity, enabling county firefighters to resume their work. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Northridge Meadows provides perspective. Some survivors talked buoyantly of 
the good feeling of being alive. "The last thing I'm going to worry about is 
losing a CD collection," said Donald Hall, an English professor at Cal State 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Others lost much more. At her home, my colleague Ann O'Neill had lost a 
collection of Waterford crystal, a family heirloom. Her loss was put into 
context, she says, as she witnessed paramedics at Northridge Meadows inform 
Hyun Sook Lee, who managed to escape with one son, that another teen-age son 
was dead. Lee's husband also died.  
</P>
<P>
 For me, the moment came Monday afternoon as I shared my 
there-but-for-the-grace-of-God factoids with Marge Reichwaldt, 55, and her 
daughter Diana Sisson, 24. Immediately I felt pretty foolish. They had been so 
much closer, living above others that had died. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed like it lasted forever," Diana said. "We didn't know we'd gone down 
to the second level until we were out of the building."  
</P>
<P>
 She told me that on Monday afternoon as we stood among the fire engines and TV 
trucks on Reseda Boulevard. At that moment, a 5.5 aftershock hit. The earth 
rolled beneath our feet. The trucks rocked and footing was uncertain. 
Firefighters scrambled out of the apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 Marge and Diana reached out for each other, pulling me and a bystander into 
their shuddering embrace. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hold me," Diana said. "Please. Just hold me."

LOS ANGELES TIMES SPECIAL REPORT; ON THE FAULT LINE; SOUTHERN CALIFORNIANS TAKE 
STOCK OF THE EARTHQUAKE; STIRRED, NOT SHAKEN; A FEW REFLECTIONS ON TECHNOLOGY 
AND EARTHQUAKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL AKST, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cyberspace is the last refuge of the sleepless. Staring up into the darkness 
in the wee hours Monday morning, I wrestled with that classic insomniac's 
choice: whether to lay there some more or just give up and see what was 
happening on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake hit before I could get out of bed. Afterward, my wife and I 
inspected our house with flashlights. The place was built during the Harding 
Administration by a minister whose idiosyncratic carpentry has withstood the 
test of time, and when it seemed clear that we still were stuck with his 
tenacious handiwork, we settled down to wait for day. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday appeared to be a setback for technology in Los Angeles, a reassertion 
by the forces of nature that their forbearance is always temporary. We can see 
this from the dead, and from the devastation and dislocation the quake has left 
behind. But we can also see it among the living. 
</P>
<P>
 All over town, the TVs and hair dryers, Stairmasters and steam irons, 
computers and cash machines sat silent, and in the pre-dawn hours my wife and I 
huddled like refugees from the 20th Century around the dim light of some 
yahrzeit candles I had idiotically purchased for back-yard barbecues, on the 
theory that the little glasses the candles come in would make them wind-proof. 
</P>
<P>
 As the day wore on, shopping foreclosed, the young deprived of MTV, everyone's 
high-tech paraphernalia inanimate for a change, it seemed that what the 
insurance companies love to call an act of God had reimposed, however briefly, 
the one thing technology and the pace of our lives had previously made 
impossible: the Sabbath. 
</P>
<P>
 We weren't ready for it, of course. My wife and I didn't sing songs or recite 
to each other the poetry of Emily Dickinson. We have a nice domino set, but 
neither of us could remember how to play. It was too dark to read and we were 
too wound up for Scrabble. Instead we hugged and talked and sniffed around like 
bloodhounds for gas leaks. We set up our earthquake supplies and inventoried 
the batteries. We tried calling family with the cellular phone, then finally 
sat down and accustomed ourselves to the tinny drone of a transistor radio, 
idle but not at rest. 
</P>
<P>
 I, dare say, felt likewise. Thus did Los Angeles pass a day without 
technology, sort of. Oh, the hospitals functioned, the news got out, and the 
Delphic seismologists at Caltech, using all their sophisticated equipment, 
affirmed with their usual perspicacity that, yes, there had been an earthquake, 
and, yes indeed, there might well be another. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the everyday sense, this earthquake was a Luddite's dream, smashing 
freeways, cutting off power and phone service, and rendering the elaborately 
abstract tasks that most of us perform impossible -- or at least ostentatiously 
useless. It threw us back on yesterday's technologies (there is always a 
technology), like radio. 
</P>
<P>
 Even real work had to wait. To the relief of some of my wife's more anxious 
patients, dentistry at her office was postponed; the compressor that runs the 
high-speed equipment was temporarily knocked out of commission. Toothaches 
would have to submit to palliatives. 
</P>
<P>
 It struck me that we were prepared for the earthquake, but not necessarily for 
the technological interregnum that it would bring, which was not unlike the 
times in the middle of the night when you can't sleep. I imagined that a 
bourgeois couple like us 100 years ago would take turns singing arias and 
playing the piano. We'd have duets all worked out, a whole routine. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, technology is what has made it possible for us to be a 
bourgeois couple, instead of eking out a living thatching houses or selling old 
wool. Technology made room in the bourgeoisie for lots of people like me and 
helped see that we reached adulthood to take our places there. Like the romance 
of the outlaw, the lamentation of technology is largely an indulgence of the 
privileged. 
</P>
<P>
 And so I'm not ashamed to say that what I missed most during the night of the 
quake was my computer. I imagined sending a single wryly evocative but 
ultimately reassuring piece of E-mail to a whole list of friends and relatives 
around the world. And what was going on in news groups -- forums, really -- 
like alt.california and la.general? 
</P>
<P>
 Surely there must be an Internet mailing list on seismology; inquiring 
insomniacs want to know. 
</P>
<P>
 It should be obvious by now that the capacity of computers for wasting time is 
unsurpassed. Yet who's to say what's really a waste? Consider that one Calvin 
Ogawa posted the following to alt.california, unerringly date-stamped Jan. 12 
by the Internet: 
</P>
<P>
 " In the past three days, Santa Monica and Los Angeles in general have 
experienced a swarm of minor earthquakes, ranging from 2.0 to 4.0 (I'm not sure 
of the specific numbers, so don't kill me . . . ) I think we're in for a 
sizable one, if not the big one. The latest happened here in L.A . at 3.7 at 
11:30 p.m. Granted I'm not a seismologist, but I don't buy the "small quakes 
relieve the pressure" theory of earthquake-think. I personally feel that the 
minor faults fail first, like a domino effect, and then the biggie happens. 
This might be the case. If you don't think this is valid, then watch Slow-Mo 
films (if you're into tedious things) of structural fails. Usually, it's the 
weaker flaws that fail first, then major structures fail. So get your water and 
pocket radios ready. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 " with a nervous twitch, Cal. "  
</P>
<P>
 I've been disciplined lately; I haven't been cruising the 'net much, and so I 
missed this when it appeared. Not that I would have heeded Cal's warning 
anyway; his initial respondents scoffed. 
</P>
<P>
 But its presence on my screen, in my home for me to take or leave as I wish, 
is striking. A few years after our house was built, in 1925, Alfred North 
Whitehead probably used a pen to write that things never really took off in 
human history until mankind learned that it was more important "to measure, and 
thus to express quality in terms of numerically determined quantity," than to 
classify the world around us. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitehead's insight has proved more durable than my house, which has required 
a lot more care, but they both describe kinds of knowledge. The minister's 
know-how kept us alive and safe through this week's quake and the erratic 
aftershocks that continue to rock Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 But the knowledge Whitehead describes shook the earth in its own right and 
shakes it still. The notion that lots of things can be expressed in terms of 
ones and zeros has made possible the revolution brought about by the microchip, 
an earthquake of global rather than local proportions, and one that will alter 
the landscape for most of us far more than the Northridge quake has done. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the conclusion to draw from Monday's earthquake isn't that the veneer of 
technology on which we live is so thin. That veneer is more likely to be torn 
away by people, as in Sarajevo, than by nature anyway. Nor is the point that 
technology has led us astray, boohoo, impoverishing the spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 The point, I think, is that technology is part of who we are, despite the 
occasional seismic setback, and that even when it makes earthquakes less 
meaningful, as it someday surely will, different quakes will take the place of 
shaking ground in the endless parade of disruptive mysteries for us to quantify 
and misunderstand and conquer, in order to make room for the next.

LOS ANGELES TIMES SPECIAL REPORT; ON THE FAULT LINE; SOUTHERN CALIFORNIANS TAKE 
STOCK OF THE EARTHQUAKE; AN IMPERFECT 10; THE SANTA MONICA FREEWAY TOOK ITS 
TOLL ON THE NEIGHBORHOODS IT IMPALED AND THE COMMUTERS IT ENSNARED. BUT HOW 
WILL WE LIVE WITHOUT IT?

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I visited a critically injured business acquaintance Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the Santa Monica Freeway, crippled in Monday's earthquake when an 
overpass collapsed around La Cienega Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue, a key part 
of my commuting route for the past 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
 I say business acquaintance because this freeway is no friend. Our 
relationship is strictly business, a way of getting to and from work on an 
ugly, utilitarian structure that exemplifies the worst of California's highway 
builders. 
</P>
<P>
 For me, it has meant slow driving and foul air, relieved occasionally by a 
dazzling smoggy sunset on the way home. The Santa Monica's only attractive 
feature is the dramatic bridge connecting it to the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing its history and aware of the inconvenience all of us commuters will 
suffer because of its disabling, I had mixed emotions when I saw the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica, built by straight-line '50s and '60s engineers, slashed 
through Mid and West Los Angeles without regard to the social and economic 
impact on neighborhoods and individuals. Thousands of homes were torn down and 
thousands of families were forced to move. Neighborhoods were divided, odd 
dead-end streets were created. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse yet, the freeway added to the racial segregation of an already badly 
divided Los Angeles and Santa Monica. In fact, the highway created a vast new 
racially segregated area, "South of the Santa Monica Freeway." 
</P>
<P>
 And, as we saw Monday, it was not even given the strength to withstand the 
powerful earthquakes that are a predictable part of Southland life. I talked to 
a team of University of California researchers, who showed me twisted steel 
bars and support columns crushed into the shape of mushrooms -- evidence, they 
said, of how the old freeway builders failed to prepare. 
</P>
<P>
 The freeway will recover, but not before it leaves another miserable legacy 
for L.A.: many millions of dollars lost in traffic delays and the astronomical 
price of restoring it to health. 
</P>
<P>
 When I visited the ruins, I could see restoration would be months away. 
</P>
<P>
 Graduate students Dawn Lehman and Sylvia Mazzoni of the UC Berkeley Earthquake 
Engineering Center showed me how sections of the overpass had separated and 
crashed downward. Eighteen-inch bars embedded in concrete support columns 
failed. As Caltrans associate bridge engineer Pete Elliott told me: "The 
earthquake lifted the bridges up and the bridges came down, crushing the 
columns like they were aluminum beer cans." 
</P>
<P>
 I walked under a portion of the collapsed overpass that had not hit the ground 
and reached up and touched it. Scores of cracks covered the surface. I climbed 
the embankment to the empty freeway. One section of the overpass was 3 1/2 to 4 
feet higher than the one I was standing on. 
</P>
<P>
 From that vantage point, it was easy to see the vast amount of land the 
freeway occupies, something not apparent to the preoccupied, car-bound 
commuter. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the need for such huge tracts of land that disrupted long-established 
neighborhoods during the 1960s. Construction required a broad swath of land 
from Downtown Los Angeles to Santa Monica. In one stretch alone, from Vermont 
Avenue to La Cienega Boulevard, more than 2,000 structures were removed and 
about 10,000 people displaced.  
</P>
<P>
 In some places, the freeway route devoured poor and middle-class 
African-American neighborhoods, displacing their residents. The highway also 
sliced through other neighborhoods, lowering property values. 
</P>
<P>
 White residents moved away. The freeway became a physical barrier, separating 
whites and blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the result of a state highway policy that dismissed advocates of 
neighborhood preservation as unreasonable. 
</P>
<P>
 As a young reporter in the state capital, I had observed the process. State 
rights-of-way agents prowled neighborhoods, buying houses under threat of 
eminent domain. L.A. was a prime target, the center of a contemplated freeway 
network that had one goal: Move goods and people as quickly and as cheaply as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The state highway engineers were supported by local business people, the auto 
club, politicians and construction companies. This combination, known as "the 
Highway Lobby," reigned supreme in city councils and in the Legislature, where 
its leading spokesman was a crusty old senator, Randoph Collier, known as "the 
Father of California's Freeways." 
</P>
<P>
 West Hollywood was to be ripped apart by a freeway between Los Angeles 
International Airport and the Ventura Freeway. Another route across the Santa 
Monica Mountains would have cut through Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 But not even the Highway Lobby could touch Beverly Hills. In one of 
Sacramento's great confrontations of the '60s, the lobby lost, and the state 
killed the Beverly Hills Freeway and the West Hollywood Freeway along with it. 
</P>
<P>
 The defeat helped touch off a statewide revolt that ended the era of unlimited 
freeway construction in California, an era that spawned a romanticized vision 
of the few highways that had been built. Each acquired its own set of legends. 
The Pasadena Freeway was the oldest and the stateliest. The Hollywood linked 
the Valley and the city's growing center. The I-10 symbolically linked the 
wealthy Westside and the heart of old L.A. and soon won putative honors as the 
world's most heavily traveled thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Much like Santa Monica itself, the freeway was a laboratory for innovations. 
The controversial diamond lane for three or more commuters debuted on the 
thoroughfare in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica was the experimental theater setting for those lighted 
freeway signs, which used slogans and verse ("Car-pool is bliss for lad or 
miss") to tout fuel conservation and to warn of traffic problems. Such signs 
made the big time with a megawatt role in the film "LA Story" -- the only 
speaking role on record for a freeway sign. 
</P>
<P>
 The country-Western song "You're the Reason God Make Oklahoma" boasted a line, 
"Santa Monica Freeway sometimes makes a country girl blue, oooh oooh oooh." 
</P>
<P>
 And the 10 figured large in Joan Didion's classic L.A. novel, "Play It As It 
Lays." Maria Wyeth drove her Corvette through "Maria's loop," the angular 
embrace of freeways -- the "flawless burning concrete" -- that circle the city. 
</P>
<P>
 I thought of that history while I watched the workers begin to dismantle the 
wreckage of the Santa Monica Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing near me, talking to a Caltrans worker, was State Treasurer Kathleen 
Brown, who is running for governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Her father, Gov. Pat Brown, had been one of the most enthusiastic advocates of 
more and bigger freeways. When an early section of the Santa Monica was 
dedicated in 1962, he said: "Now, for the first time, we will have freeways 
that will relieve other freeways." 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen Brown and I looked at the wreckage of her father's freeway. She shook 
her head. "I'm thinking of the enormity of putting it back together," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 That is the next job. When the work is completed, the freeway will look as it 
did when Pat Brown finished it. The long-term costs will be so great that much 
of the responsibility will fall on the governor elected this year, whether it 
is Gov. Pete Wilson, Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi or, in an ironic 
touch, the daughter of the man who built it. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the earlier generation of politicians, they are all proponents of a 
balance in transportation, a belief that buses, trains and car-pools must 
supplement freeways. Perhaps they also have learned another lesson from the 
Santa Monica and freeways like it: that the best road between two points is not 
a straight line that tears the fabric of a community.

 What lucky number comes after 7? It's 11, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 Virgin Interactive Entertainment Inc. in Irvine and Oregon-based Trilobyte 
Inc. showed an early version of "The 11th Hour" computer compact disk game, 
which is a sequel to "The 7th Guest," which Computer Gaming World magazine 
ranks as the most popular game on the CD-ROM (compact disk, read-only memory) 
format. 
</P>
<P>
 Virgin and Trilobyte showed scenes from "The 11th Hour" at the Consumer 
Electronics Show two weeks ago in Las Vegas. Virgin's booth, a simulated bar 
scene where 19 computer and video games were on display, was not lost inside 
three dazzling pavilions where row upon row of games were on display. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 11th Hour" game returns the player to the haunted mansion of mad toy 
maker Henry Stauf, who is the mystery host of "The 7th Guest." It picks up the 
story 70 years later. 
</P>
<P>
 As reporter Carl Denning, the game's player must search for his girlfriend and 
solve an array of puzzles in the now-decayed Stauf mansion. The 22 rooms of the 
house were redrawn using three-dimensional computer animation, and the story is 
set to a chilling musical score. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 11th Hour" will feature 60 minutes of video stored on CD-ROM, which is 
based on the same technology as music CDs and can store text, graphics, video 
and sound. The game is scheduled for release this spring.

FIRING BASED ON AGE, EX-MITSUBISHI MANAGER SAYS; COURTS: BUT PLUMMETING 
COMPUTER SALES CAUSED THE MAN, NOW 58, TO BE LAID OFF IN 1990 ALONG WITH 38 
OTHERS, AN ATTORNEY FOR THE CYPRESS-BASED U.S. SUBSIDIARY CLAIMS IN OPENING 
ARGUMENTS OF TRIAL.

<P>
 Blaming its ill-fated venture of selling complete computer systems, Mitsubishi 
Electronics America Inc. on Tuesday defended itself against a fired manager who 
sued the Cypress-based company for $700,000, claiming age discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 George O'Mary, 58, accused Japanese-owned Mitsubishi of singling out older 
managers when it terminated him and 38 other people as it cut back its U.S. 
computer business in November, 1990, after massive losses. 
</P>
<P>
 The former technical support manager is suing for $700,000 in lost wages and 
compensation for emotional distress. Attorneys for the company denied the 
allegations in the opening arguments of a trial that began Tuesday in Superior 
Court in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Dirk Bruinsma, O'Mary's lawyer, said that company managers held two meetings 
in early 1990 in which Japanese executives reportedly told employees that the 
company planned to eliminate managers over 40 and replace them with "younger, 
more aggressive managers."  
</P>
<P>
 "While it may happen often, it is not often said," Bruinsma said. "I suppose 
someone made a critical mistake. . . . Mr. O'Mary started over and built 
himself up again while someone else did his job." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite what O'Mary described as promises of lifetime employment at 
Mitsubishi, the terminations occurred six months later. 
</P>
<P>
 Of 14 managers fired, 13 were over 40, Bruinsma said. O'Mary, a 10-year 
employee whose salary was $100,000 a year, was allegedly replaced by a 
29-year-old manager. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Mary, a Sierra Madre resident who received a $78,000 severance check, said 
he hunted for a job for 18 months. He was reduced to selling cemetery plots for 
$100 a month before landing a job as a software engineering trainer for 
McDonnell Douglas in Huntington Beach for half his pay at Mitsubishi 
Electronics. 
</P>
<P>
 But O'Mary's story regarding the staff cuts, while sympathetic, isn't true, 
said Barclay Edmundson, outside counsel for Mitsubishi Electronics America, a 
subsidiary of electronics and auto giant Mitsubishi Electric Corp. in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that although lifetime employment has been a common practice in Japan 
among young hires, it was never more than a hope for the company's workers in 
America and therefore was never included in any employment contracts, including 
O'Mary's. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Edmundson said, the alleged statements of senior executives was hearsay 
-- the statements were either never made or were misinterpreted. Instead, 
Edmundson said that Michael Foster, a senior vice president of the company, 
would testify that business reasons were used to determine each person to be 
let go. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmundson said Foster had to cut 30% of his 144 employees in the Information 
Systems Division subsidiary because Mitsubishi had decided to abandon its 
computer systems business after accumulating years of losses that totaled $65 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitsubishi, which entered the personal computer market in the United States in 
1981, reached a sales peak of $175 million by 1986, according to Edmundson. 
</P>
<P>
 During that period, O'Mary received raises every year and steady promotions to 
the point where he managed a crew of four traveling technicians who helped 
customers deal with computers and supervised a manager with five technicians. 
</P>
<P>
 But in 1987 the division lost two major contracts to supply computers to other 
manufacturers, including Leading Edge Computers, which placed their own brand 
names on the PCs and resold them. In 1990, Mitsubishi lost $17.5 million on 
lower sales of about $25 million, Edmundson disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 Pointing to a chart with red bars representing losses, he told jurors, "No, 
this bar chart is not upside down. The losses on these computers were 
staggering for this company. (Mitsubishi Electronics) had to decide to get out, 
and that resulted in layoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitsubishi's computers were consistently inferior in technology and price, 
Edmundson said. It pulled the plug on computer system sales in 1990, deciding 
instead to focus on manufacturing components, such as monitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster decided to cut O'Mary's traveling technical support staff because 
complete computer systems would no longer be sold, Edmundson said, adding that 
the technical staff occupied about two-thirds of O'Mary's work time. 
</P>
<P>
 He chose to retain another manager, Kathy Woods, over O'Mary because she had 
hands-on experience managing the in-house technical support staff and, though 
supervised by O'Mary, had two years more seniority. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods then began reporting to Ray Roque, 29, who supervised three other groups 
of engineers that O'Mary was not qualified to manage, Edmundson said. 
</P>
<P>
 He told jurors that 29.5% of the company's staff is 40 or older, compared to 
30.4% before the staff cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "That does not suggest a grand scheme for discrimination," Edmundson said.

COMMERCIAL CENTER BANK EXPECTING TO FIND BUYER AT LAST; FINANCE: INSTITUTION 
HAS SOLVED MANY PAST PROBLEMS, AMASSED IMPRESSIVE ASSETS WHILE BECOMING 
COUNTY'S BIGGEST COMMUNITY BANK. HOPES ARE HIGH FOR SELLING IT THIS YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Commercial Center Bank has become Orange County's biggest community bank in 
spite of a dubious distinction that sets it apart from all other local 
financial institutions: It has been up for sale longer than many bankers care 
to remember. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, though, the Canadian operators of the bank are getting serious about 
completing a deal this year, and they have hired a Wall Street investment bank 
to solicit bids, mainly from out-of-state banks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have two or three excellent prospects," said C. Garth MacGirr, a Price 
Waterhouse Ltd. partner in Canada who acts as the bank's chairman and chief 
executive. He wouldn't identify the prospective buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank, with nearly $400 million in loans and other assets, has enough cash 
for a bank twice its size. Though plagued by problem loans throughout the 
1980s, it now has none that are past due. And it has revamped its computer 
software, which has allowed the bank to reduce staff size 10% through attrition 
to 280 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana bank also has an unusual branch network. Instead of expanding to 
fill its geographic base, as community banks typically do, it has branches in 
Walnut Creek, San Jose, Beverly Hills and San Diego. That statewide spread 
might appeal to a larger Eastern bank looking for a broad, established base in 
California, MacGirr said. 
</P>
<P>
 But because the bank doesn't dominate any community in which it operates, that 
could be a detraction, said Gary Findley, an Anaheim banking lawyer and 
consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial Center also has a more nettlesome problem: holding onto good 
talent. David T. Blankenhorn left this week as president and chief operating 
officer to join Bank of Newport as president and chief executive. The main 
reason for the switch, Blankenhorn said, was his own uncertain status at 
Commercial Center should a sale go through soon. His departure is part of the 
bank's relatively high turnover rate of about 20% a year among employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Holbrook, the bank's executive vice president, was promoted Tuesday to 
interim president and chief operating officer to take on administrative duties. 
MacGirr will oversee marketing and credit duties. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a sale doesn't work out this year, we'll talk about a much more permanent 
position," MacGirr said. "But we think something's going to happen in 1994." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One thing that won't help, he said, is an expected loss for last year. 
Commercial Center lost $6 million on its mortgage servicing operation, which 
sends bills to borrowers and collects loan payments. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank acquired that operation 18 months ago and, like many financial 
institutions that have bought servicing rights, had to write down the value of 
those assets as recent mortgages were paid off in the flurry of refinancing 
last summer and fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank, which has had only four money-losing years since 1982, has not yet 
reported its results for 1993. For the first nine months of the year, however, 
it lost $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "You base your sale price on earnings. People pay a price for something that 
will give them a good return," MacGirr said. "Fortunately, this loss on 
mortgage servicing should be a one-shot deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the bank's plan for this year projects a profit of $5.5 million, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's difficulties seem almost inconsequential considering the bank's 
cat-like ability to survive a series of near disasters. Founded as Westlands 
Bank in 1970, the institution has had three brushes with insolvency. It avoided 
a merger with a businessman later accused of raiding treasuries of other banks 
he controlled, and it got through a $70-million run on deposits caused by a 
computer error. 
</P>
<P>
 It was sold in early 1984 to Canadian Commercial Bank of Edmonton, in Alberta, 
and its name was changed. But its rescue was short-lived. Late in 1985, the 
Canadian bank became that nation's first bank failure since 1923, and its 
collapse sent shock waves throughout Canada's financial community, MacGirr 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, Commercial Center already had enough cash on hand that it no 
longer needed the Canadian bank. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But it went on the block again when Price Waterhouse of Toronto, the 
court-appointed liquidator, began selling Canadian Commercial's $2.5 billion in 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
 MacGirr, who is based in Toronto, spends about 60% of his time on bank 
matters, including a visit to Santa Ana one week a month to oversee the 
operation and occasional trips to seek out potential buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was impossible to sell the bank at first because there were too many 
issues unsettled," he said. "The bank had some loans that were not really bad 
loans in the sense that they were non-paying. They were very unfocused, 
troublesome loans." 
</P>
<P>
 Westlands had lunged into real estate lending, especially in the office 
construction field, and was hurting not just from the 1981-82 economic downturn 
but also from its customized loan documents. Each major loan had different 
terms and conditions, and each one seemed to have some clause that no banker 
should ever use, MacGirr said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some construction loans, for instance, gave borrowers the option of invoking 
built-in extensions. Borrowers then could ignore payments and give themselves 
more time to repay loans. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not good banking," MacGirr said. "Those loans became an albatross." 
</P>
<P>
 The bank standardized its loan application forms, and by 1989 Commercial 
Center had cleaned itself up enough to attract suitors. MacGirr said another 
Canadian bank, Central Guaranty Trust Co. in Toronto, had been on an 
acquisition binge and was poised to pick up Commercial Center, but directors 
decided they had bought enough banks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We pulled out of the market for six months after that, and when we came back, 
the market had turned against us," he said. "I'm convinced there's good value 
here, and I'm not prepared to give it away." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the bank has $51 million in capital -- about twice what is considered 
an adequate cushion against losses -- MacGirr figures that $20 million or so 
could be moved to the bankruptcy estate of the Canadian bank and that 
Commercial Center could be sold with $25 million to $30 million in capital. 
Price Waterhouse, he said, is able to structure a deal almost any way. 
</P>
<P>
 But, banking lawyer Findley notes, the deal would probably have to be in cash, 
and not many banks have money available to acquire a medium-size community bank 
that doesn't dominate any of its markets. Stiil, he said, prospects for a sale 
this year are "reasonable." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's got a franchise. It has a large market share. And they're not asking an 
exorbitant price," Findley said. "I just haven't seen other financial 
institutions come into Orange County recently." 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial Center has profited and lost from its close association with real 
estate over the years. While no payment problems exist now in its portfolio of 
more than $240 million, it still relies heavily on real estate loans and on the 
mortgage servicing operation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A big chunk of its assets -- about $50 million -- is devoted to construction 
and land development loans, which are among the riskiest that banks make. It 
also has about $55 million in home mortgage loans and more than $85 million in 
commercial and industrial real estate mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
 About $45 million is invested in business loans, the kind that help 
manufacturing companies buy equipment and give professionals operating capital. 
The loans are typically secured by inventory, machinery and other assets 
borrowers might have. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1923, when Home Bank failed, the Canadian government said, and I remember 
reading the exact quote, 'Excessive lending on overpriced real estate' was the 
reason for the bank's failure," MacGirr said. "The same could be said of 
Canadian Commercial 62 years later," as well as some of the problems Commercial 
Center once had. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it is not real estate that kills banks," he said. "It's bad lending." 
</P>
<P>
 That, he hopes, has been corrected at Commercial Center. A Profit Roller 
Coaster 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, earnings at Commercial Center Bank have been volatile. With 
its bad loans erased and with what it hopes will be a one-time loss from 
servicing mortgages, the Santa Ana bank sees nothing but profits ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Net income (loss) in millions: 1982: $0.4 1983: (3.2) 1984: (15.8) 1985: 2.4 
1986: (4.8) 1987: 1.4 1988: 3.0 1989: 5.2 1990: 3.8 1991: (0.9) 1992: 3.9

ROCKWELL PROMOTES 3RD EXECUTIVE TO SENIOR POSITION; MANAGEMENT: DON H. DAVIS' 
ASCENSION MAY SET HIM UP AS ONE OF THE POSSIBLE SUCCESSORS TO THE CHIEF 
EXECUTIVE JOB.

<P>
 Rockwell International Corp. on Tuesday promoted a third executive to a senior 
post with overall responsibility for running the $11-billion company's diverse 
technology businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Beall, chairman and chief executive, said that Don H. Davis, 54, a 
subsidiary president, has been promoted. He becomes the second person to 
jointly hold the titles of executive vice president and chief operating 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've operated with multiple COOs for some time (in the past) and this move 
is simply a matter of timing," Beall said. "We're fortunate to have a talented, 
diverse management team and Don Davis is a very talented executive." 
</P>
<P>
 Kent Black, 54, retains his titles as executive vice president and chief 
operating officer. That means the three, along with an established seven-member 
corporate strategy committee, will guide the future of Rockwell, which produces 
defense electronics, aerospace components, avionics gear, automation systems, 
telecommunications, auto parts and printing presses. 
</P>
<P>
 Beall, who was overseeing two divisions, will now return to a position as 
overall strategist for the entire corporation, spokesman Bill Mellon said. The 
changes will help the company diversify its management team, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beall, 55, does not have any immediate plans to retire, Mellon said. But 
Davis' promotion may set him up as one of the possible successors to the chief 
executive job. Black and Davis will report to Beall. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis was formerly a Rockwell corporate vice president and president of 
Rockwell's Allen-Bradley factory automation division in Milwaukee. He will now 
move to the company's headquarters in Seal Beach and oversee the company's 
automotive parts and factory automation businesses, which account for nearly 
45% of total sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Black will oversee the company's space systems, Rocketdyne rocket 
engine unit, defense electronics, Collins commercial aircraft components 
businesses, telecommunications and newspaper printing press businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Succeeding Davis as president of Allen-Bradley will be Jodie Glore, 46, who 
has been senior vice president of the unit's automation group in Highland 
Heights, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 The management shuffle returns the Rockwell suite to a structure it had until 
June, 1993, when Sam Iacobellis gave up the title of chief operating officer to 
become executive vice president and deputy chairman for major programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Iacobellis, 64, in effect became Rockwell's primary executive dealing with the 
federal government on major programs such as the space shuttle.

 TH&M Advertising Inc. has moved from the airport area to smaller offices in 
Old Town Irvine.The agency is in a former pinto bean warehouse, said Jim 
Hughes, president and creative director. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the move reflects a shrinking staff. The agency is down to a dozen 
people, from 35 at one point. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes said he started consciously whittling the staff last summer so he could 
offer clients a pay-as-you-go service instead of charging a retainer fee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I put senior staff people in charge of key departments" and they hire 
contract workers as needed, he said.

 In the tight ratings battle this season, ABC pulled out another close victory, 
finishing one-tenth of a ratings point behind leader CBS last week and pulling 
within two-tenths of a ratings point behind CBS for the entire season, 
according to A.C. Nielsen Co. figures released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC finished the week with a 13.4 rating and five of the top 10 shows, led by 
the season's top-rated program, "Home Impovement," at No. 2. CBS averaged a 
13.3 rating for the week, followed by NBC's 11.5 and Fox's 7.3. (Each ratings 
point represents 942,000 TV households.) 
</P>
<P>
 NBC scored huge on Thursday night with two episodes of the surging sitcom "Mad 
About You," which won the 8-9 p.m. time period. More impressively, the two 
following episodes of "Seinfeld" were repeats from 1991, but they finished as 
the No. 4 and No. 5 programs of the week and ranked as the second and third 
highest-rated "Seinfeld" telecasts ever.

<P>
 Fox premiered two new shows last week. "Monty," starring Henry Winkler as a 
conservative radio talk-show host, finished No. 79 out of 94 prime-time 
programs, but posted Fox's highest Tuesday-night performance to date with an 
8.6 rating. "The George Carlin Show" did even better, finishing No. 43 last 
Sunday night while holding onto 94% of the lead-in audience provided by 
"Married. . .With Children." Southland Ratings
