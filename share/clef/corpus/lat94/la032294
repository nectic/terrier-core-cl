ONLY IN L.A.

<P>
 The news from L.A. Woebegone: "Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult" obviously 
finished filming before Jan. 17 because it contains no earthquake references. 
</P>
<P>
 But the latest movie about a bumbling L.A. police squad is filled with other 
jabs at Angeltown, which is depicted as teeming with assassins, terrorists and, 
perhaps most frightening of all, a roving gang of armed postal workers. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Officer Frank Drebin (Leslie Nielsen) goes undercover as an 
inmate in a prison, where he observes that he is "surrounded by pimps, rapists 
and murderers." He adds: "It was like being in the stands at a Los Angeles 
Raiders game." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, "Naked Gun" isn't the final insult: As part of an effort to persuade 
the city to grant police officers pay raises, the Police Protective League has 
begun an unfunny billboard campaign to scare tourists, not to mention 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now, to our asexual crimes file: Anne Berkovitz of West L.A. found this "just 
say no" warning in a potted plant. Surely, it's time for the owners of dogwoods 
to keep them from reproducing irresponsibly. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We really stepped in it this time: Gilbert Kemp and several other readers 
razzed us about a quote in our recent discussion of the Razzies, the 
anti-Oscars awards show. Founder John Wilson told us that actor Tom Selleck 
accepted his 1993 Razzie on a talk show "in the middle of a conversation about 
artificially inseminating a bull on Selleck's ranch." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, sure, the idea of artificially inseminating a bull seems unlikely. But 
we figured it was just another outrageous talk show topic. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The wit behind the marquee: This column mentioned the recent closing of the 
Radisson (formerly the Hyatt) Hotel in the City of Commerce, thereby depriving 
bored motorists on the Santa Ana Freeway of the building's humorous message 
board. That prompted a letter from writer Frank Calcagnie of Artesia, whose 
specialties include marquee writing. 
</P>
<P>
 Calcagnie, who listed Holiday Pies, Don Steves Used Car Lot, Don Steves New 
Car Lot and Zaby's Motor Lodge among his credits, enclosed some of the quips he 
composed for the old Hyatt's marquee. They include: "S-h-h-h Rosemary's Baby is 
sleeping" (Sept. 30, 1968), "Hong Kong flu brings us back to hoarse and buggy 
days" (Jan. 6, 1969) and "Astronauts earn extra pay by moonlighting" (Jan. 16, 
1969). 
</P>
<P>
 Funny stuff. But that one-liner he listed for Jan. 1, 1969 -- it seems as 
though we've heard it elsewhere. It was: "Happy New Year." miscelLAny: 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Webster Real Estate in Taos, N.M., announced the hiring of Bill 
Jensen, a onetime surfer identified as "the role model for the character 
'Moondoggie' in the original 'Gidget' movies. He even appeared on (TV's) 'Good 
Morning America' with James Darren, who starred as Moondoggie, and Kathy 
Kohner, upon whom the character 'Gidget' was based." You know the exodus from 
L.A. is serious when cultural icons such as Moondoggie are leaving.

CAMPAIGN FINANCING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Joseph Farah (Column Right, March 15) is way off base! Public financing of 
political campaigns would be a bargain for "we the people." 
</P>
<P>
 The most important aspect of campaign financing is who is granted access to 
elected officials. The clearest example of what is wrong with the present 
system is the S&L fiasco, which cut across party lines. It is said that we will 
pay for the S&L bailout to the tune of about $3,000 each! 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Supreme Court has already ruled that it is unconstitutional to 
limit the amount a candidate can spend, there is no reason why we can't make 
public funds contingent upon voluntary spending limits and some demonstration 
of popular support. 
</P>
<P>
 If we had funded the campaigns of Alan Cranston and others who intervened with 
regulators on behalf of the S&Ls, we all would have saved ourselves billions of 
dollars! 
</P>
<P>
 JOHN D. BALTIC 
</P>
<P>
 Topanga 
</P>
<P>
 * Farah's deluded solution to political prostitution is . . . more money. 
Money will get rid of the incumbents. But lobbyists don't discriminate between 
Democrats or Republicans. Ideology doesn't matter, incumbency does. Reform will 
oust more career politicians than term limits will. Farah would not let unions 
raise money from working people but would allow expensive dinner fund-raisers. 
Of course no one is coerced to attend $20,000-a-plate dinners. But can anyone 
truly be that hungry? Yes, if one has a special interest to push. Absurdly, 
Farah thanks campaign contributions for paving the political super-information 
highway. C'mon. Sound-bite campaign slogans and slick mailers are hardly 
educational. Besides, campaign contributions are increasingly spent on 
consultants, image doctors, and other campaign bureaucrats, not voter 
communication. 
</P>
<P>
 The politics of ideas is dead. A candidate's ability to raise money is more 
important than strength of convictions and community leadership. State party 
machines anoint local candidates. Alienated voters stay home wondering how 
their vote compares to a lobbyist's cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign finance reform is a neither-party issue. It is a voter issue. Tom 
Hayden has decided to champion campaign finance reform. While he may not be the 
perfect messenger, the message could not be more critical for California's 
future.

CHRISTOPHER TRIP TO CHINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher was humiliated at Beijing and he 
deserves it ("U.S., China Trade Embittered Words on Human Rights," March 13). 
This is exactly the result of the mixed signals the United States has been 
sending to China. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite China greeting Christopher's visit with arresting dissidents, the 
State Department withdrew its objections of the past six months to the 
launching of an Australian communications satellite, made in the U.S. by Hughes 
Aircraft, on a Chinese rocket. And the Defense Department announced earlier 
this month that it is interested in having closer ties to the Chinese People's 
Liberation Army, the same army that killed the pro-democracy students at Tian 
An Men Square on June 4, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder China has the impression that the United States had already decided 
to renew preferential trade privileges, the most-favored-nation trading status. 
 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton's credibility is on the line. China has called the U.S. a 
paper tiger. The Clinton Administration has to demonstrate that the paper tiger 
can bite. 
</P>

<P>
 * I'm with China on this one. The U.S. will lose this argument. The U.S. has 
been dealing with China since the early 19th Century and in all this time and 
with all its experts, it still does not understand the Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
 The party bosses do not run China, the People's Liberation Army runs China. 
The PLA does not like city workers, students and intellectuals. The bulk of the 
so-called dissidents come from this so-called privileged class. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. in the present and in the past has allied itself with the worst kind 
of repressive governments, so how can the U.S. pretend to be highly moral when 
it comes to human rights? For example, our Congress and our President just 
passed the NAFTA agreement with one of the most undemocratic countries (Mexico) 
in the Americas. We are no paragon of virtue. 
</P>
<P>
 We don't protect our own citizens from crime, from the ravages of management 
against workers and the environment that our people need to live with. We 
should stop being godlike and moral throughout the world. It is hypocritical.

 * Regarding Christopher's trip to lecture the Chinese: The Chinese see maodun 
(contradictions). Christopher criticizes Tian An Men Square. The Chinese see 
our Kent State. In both incidents the ruling government sought to preserve 
itself by intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher criticized the Chinese treatment of dissidents. The Chinese 
remember that Martin Luther King Jr. was repeatedly jailed and that the FBI 
sought to destroy him.

 * I note where a group of 200 American businessmen publicly opposed our 
government's position regarding China's egregious civil rights violations. I 
would be interested in knowing which 200 companies these were. American 
businesses expressing a public display of opposition to our government's 
legitimate demands for civil rights progress, while on foreign soil, is 
appallingly callous.

 * China's most prominent political dissident, Fang Lizhi, argues that the U.S. 
government should revoke China's most-favored-nation trading status 
(Commentary, March 16). 
</P>
<P>
 It makes me sick every time I hear these political dissidents trying to drive 
a wedge between the U.S. and China without regard for the two peoples and their 
economic welfare. They would enjoy it if the U.S. and China get at each other's 
throats instead of working out their differences and getting ready for a 
prosperous Pacific century.

ARMS SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The ironies of the "news" paper. On the one hand, we read about talks for 
treaties of peace between Arabs and Jews, and talks for treaties having to do 
with nuclear disarmament.Then we read that "the industrial powers flock to this 
small but wealthy nation in the post-Cold War push to sell weapons" ("Targeting 
Taiwan for Arms Deals," March 14). 
</P>
<P>
 We arm small nations to the teeth and then expect peace. If it were impossible 
for nations to acquire arms, then they could only attack each other with rocks 
and sticks. Why is it legal for any nation to produce and sell arms? They (the 
buyers) should be spending that money on building or rebuilding their 
infrastructures, their industrial bases, and above all else, their educational 
systems, not wasting it on weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Why are we not in the midst of treaty talks that ban the production of all 
weapons, and the trade between nations of same?

QUAKE RECOVERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * "Quake Seen Speeding Recovery of Economy" (March 7) adds an entirely new 
dimension to the term oxymoron .The "facts" and opinions set forth therein 
would lead one logically to conclude that to facilitate a rapid and complete 
recovery, what this economy really needs is for the "Big One" to materialize 
and totally devastate the entire Southern California area. One salivates in 
contemplation of the massive assistance for which the survivors might be 
eligible in the aftermath of that catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
 This kind of reasoning is about on a par with that of the military genius who 
concluded during the Vietnam fiasco that the only way to save a village was to 
destroy it.

WHY PRIORITIZE PYONGYANG?; THE NUCLEAR STAKES OVERRIDE EVERYTHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The ante has gone up again in the North Korea nuclear poker game. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week Pyongyang, reneging on an earlier promise, barred inspectors of the 
International Atomic Energy Agency from visiting facilities that could be 
involved in making nuclear weapons. A few days later its delegate stalked out 
of a can-we-talk meeting with South Korea, tossing over his shoulder the casual 
threat that North Korea might decide one of these days to incinerate the 
capital city of Seoul, home to more than 10 million people and only 30 miles 
from the boundary between the two Koreas. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday the IAEA voted to ask the U.N. Security Council to get involved. 
President Clinton, reaffirming the U.S.-South Korea security pact, then 
announced that U.S. Patriot antimissile missiles would soon be headed for South 
Korea "purely as a defensive measure." South Korea at the same time put its 
650,000-man army on a state of heightened alert. Democratic and Republican 
congressional leaders say they would support a buildup of U.S. power in South 
Korea. The North Korean nuclear threat, said Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole 
(R-Kan.), is "probably the most serious thing on the radar screen now." 
</P>
<P>
 Serious, certainly, but is it an imminent threat to peace? Are North Korea's 
threats, which play to fears that its leaders may be madly unpredictable, 
propaganda or policy? While anything may be possible, do the odds favor North 
Korea's inviting national destruction by starting a war that its leaders know 
can't be won? The truth is that Pyongyang, thanks to years of shrewd bluffing 
and cheating, has taken every hand so far in this nuclear poker game. It's time 
for the Security Council to demand a new deal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Security Council should vote economic sanctions against the North to force 
it to comply with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty's goals and obligations. 
The key player in this approach will be China, which more than any other 
country can control the flow of goods into the North. Will China go along? 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher, fresh from a disastrous visit to 
Beijing, says he's confident China won't block U.N. action. But political 
favors, especially one of this importance, aren't given for free. Washington 
may have no choice now but to start soft-pedaling its emphasis on human rights 
in China and its threat to take away most favored-trading-nation status, if 
that's the price for getting Beijing's vital cooperation on this momentous 
issue.

A MILESTONE FOR EL SALVADOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Given that El Salvador's bitter civil war ended only two years ago, it was 
inevitable that Sunday's national elections would be tense and marred by 
mistakes and possibly even fraud. But the voting was peaceful, and that is a 
hopeful sign. 
</P>
<P>
 The final results are still several days off, but preliminary tallies show the 
right-wing Nationalist Republican Alliance, or ARENA, falling short of a clear 
majority in the presidential election. That is unlikely to change as the count 
continues, independent election observers say. 
</P>
<P>
 If ARENA candidate Armando Calderon Sol indeed does not win a majority, a 
runoff must be held within a month. That would pit Calderon Sol against the No. 
2 vote-getter, Ruben Zamora, the candidate of a coalition of nine leftist 
parties that includes former guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a ballot-box confrontation would involve the same two factions that waged 
the 12-year-long civil war, a stalemate that cost 75,000 lives. ARENA's leaders 
include former members of El Salvador's military, while Zamora's coalition 
includes the five guerrilla factions that made up the Farabundo Marti National 
Liberation Front. 
</P>
<P>
 There may be an almost poetic symmetry here, but a runoff would put a great 
deal of added stress on El Salvador's electoral machinery, still new and faced 
with many difficulties as it tries to bring democracy to a nation that has 
never known it. 
</P>
<P>
 Voting next month also would add to the burden of the United Nations, which 
brokered the negotiated settlement that led to an uneasy cease-fire in El 
Salvador. The United Nations sent 900 election observers to El Salvador to 
monitor Sunday's voting, and they noted many problems that may have affected 
the results. The United Nations now must prepare to mount an effort to make the 
final round of voting as honest and open as possible -- and to make sure that 
both sides accept it as such. In that effort the world body would need support 
from the United States. The Clinton Administration has tried to keep its 
distance from these elections, but in view of the key role U.S. aid played in 
the civil war, Washington's influence cannot be underestimated. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Washington and the United Nations must work to prevent the left and the 
right from again trying to win power with guns. Because if that happens there 
will no winners in El Salvador, only losers.

CHARTING THE RIVER OF MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's nothing illegal about paying a lobbyist to try to influence the voting 
of Los Angeles City Council members. Some City Hall watchers would even argue, 
cynically, that some council members wouldn't know how to vote on issues if the 
lobbyists weren't there to tell them. 
</P>
<P>
 But the public has the right to know who is paying whom, and for what purpose. 
That is why there is a city law that requires those who are paid to influence 
legislation to report how much they earned and who paid them. Problem is, there 
are loopholes in the law. A big one has to do with lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers (and at City Hall some of the most active lobbyists happen to be 
lawyers) argue that they are not legally required to report lobbying activities 
because of the privacy accorded the attorney-client relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 To get around this, the council's Rules and Elections Committee has suggested 
that clients who hire lawyer-lobbyists be required to report how much they pay. 
However, that assumes all companies and individuals would disclose their 
lobbying activities; they might not, so it would be easier for the City Ethics 
Commission to enforce a law that focused on the lobbyists, not their many 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Treating lawyers different from other lobbyists stems from a 1970 California 
Supreme Court decision. State law, according to the city's longtime 
interpretation, preempts the city from regulating attorneys who represent 
clients in so-called "quasi-judicial" proceedings, which could be anything from 
routine zoning board hearings to planning commission meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 The upshot, as the City Ethics Commission has pointed out, is that current law 
often is interpreted as requiring, for example, more public disclosure from 
Sister Diane Donoghue, a nun who advocates for the poor, than from former 
Councilman Arthur K. Snyder, a top lawyer-lobbyist with big-money clients. 
</P>
<P>
 That makes no sense, especially when you consider some facts released Monday 
by the Ethics Commission: In 1993 lobbyists reported $5.8 million in fees, and 
top lobbying interests gave more than $230,000 to candidates seeking public 
office. Again, all this is legal. But the public has a right to information 
that would help it sort out who is influencing whom in City Hall.

HISTORY WATCH; SUGIHARA'S LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In chronicling its World War II history, Japan long has edited out various 
incidents, both good and bad. Chiune Sugihara, Japan's version of Oskar 
Schindler, was one of those left out until well after his death eight years 
ago.Like the German industrialist Schindler, he is remembered gratefully for 
following his heart and conscience to save thousands of lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Sugihara, while consul general in Lithuania, defied the Japanese Foreign 
Ministry's order not to help Jewish refugees, personally writing an estimated 
1,600 exit visas for Jews fleeing Poland. The transit visas, many covering 
whole families, enabled 2,000 to 6,000 people to flee the Nazis from the 
eastern port of Vladivostok to Japan and, from there, to other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 For his defiance, Sugihara was reassigned to Berlin. Upon his return to Japan 
in 1947 he was fired by the postwar government. He was a modest man and for 
nearly 50 years was virtually unknown in his own country, even though in 1985 
he was given Israel's version of the Nobel Peace Prize. Not until 1991 did 
Japan officially praise Sugihara.  
</P>
<P>
 There is no acclaimed movie such as "Schindler's List" to tell the world of 
Sugihara. The Japanese Education Ministry, however, recently approved the first 
textbook that includes his case. Robert Barram, a Boston University 
communications professor, is leading an effort to broadcast on U.S. television 
a 1992 Japanese docudrama about Sugihara called "Visas for Life" and to 
circulate it among colleges, libraries and study groups. Sugihara should not be 
forgotten in his country, or here.

By PRESIDENT CLINTON, at Washington's annual Gridiron Club dinner Saturday, 
interrupted his own speech with a surprise homemade video in which he and First 
Lady HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON parodied Harry and Louise, the middle-class couple 
in commercials opposing their health-care reform plan.

 ANNOUNCER (From the Gridiron Club Dinner): And now a message from Harry and 
Louise. 
</P>
<P>
 PRESIDENT CLINTON, "Harry": Hi, Louise. How was your day? 
</P>
<P>
 HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON, "Louise": Well, fine, Harry, until now. 
</P>
<P>
 PRES. CLINTON: Gee, Louise, you look like you've seen a ghost. 
</P>
<P>
 MRS. CLINTON: Well, it's worse than that. I've just read the Clinton Health 
Security Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 PRES. CLINTON: Health-care reform, sounds like a great idea to me. 
</P>
<P>
 MRS. Clinton: Well, I know, but some of these details sure scare the heck out 
of me. 
</P>
<P>
 PRES. CLINTON: Like what? 
</P>
<P>
 MRS. CLINTON: Well, like, for example, it says here, on page 3,764, that under 
the Clinton Health Security Plan, we could get sick. 
</P>
<P>
 PRES. CLINTON: That's terrible! 
</P>
<P>
 MRS. CLINTON: Well, I know, and look at this. It gets worse. On page 12,743 . 
. . no, I've got that wrong, it's page 27,655, it says that eventually we are 
all going to die. 
</P>
<P>
 PRES. CLINTON: Under the Clinton Health Plan? Do you mean after Bill and 
Hillary put all those new bureaucrats and taxes on us, we're still all going to 
die? 
</P>
<P>
 MRS. CLINTON: Even Leon Panetta. 
</P>
<P>
 PRES. CLINTON: Wow! That is scary! I've never been so frightened in all my 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 MRS. CLINTON: Me neither, Harry. 
</P>
<P>
 PRES. and MRS. CLINTON: There's got to be a better way! 
</P>
<P>
 ANNOUNCER: Paid for the the Coalition to Scare Your Pants Off.

PERSPECTIVE ON NORTH KOREA; DEMANDING TO BE LEFT ALONE; SANCTIONS WOULD FURTHER 
ISOLATE A COUNTRY ALREADY STRIVING MIGHTILY AGAINST INFECTION BY THE WEST.

 Should efforts to bring Pyongyang to heel over the nuclear-inspection issue 
fall through and the United States manages to persuade the United Nations to 
invoke sanctions against North Korea, the action will have, on the country's 22 
million inhabitants, precisely no effect. The North Koreans will scowl and bear 
it, just as they have scowled and borne the vicissitudes of the half-century of 
ill fortune that have dogged their remarkable little country. For we are 
dealing here with a people who are, if nothing else, as tough as steel; they 
know only too well how to tolerate the disapprobation of the outside world. 
They will soldier on. 
</P>
<P>
 I hold no particular brief for the country or its leadership, other than an 
abiding affection for Korean people as a whole. The tragedy of their division, 
now 40 years old, is almost as overwhelming as it is dangerous; and one can 
only cling to the belief that one day -- as with all partitioned countries -- 
the Koreas will be reunited. But in the meantime it is perhaps reasonable, 
especially at this critical moment when the whole world seems to be glaring 
down on Pyongyang, to consider the realities of the division, and wonder 
whether what Kim Il Sung (the longest-serving national leader on the planet) 
has created is really as bad as the White House and the State Department would 
have us believe. 
</P>
<P>
 I am certain that it is not. Few of those who speak of North Korea have been 
there; the knowledge that they claim to have is based on the persuasive 
propaganda of the South Koreans, the gap-riddled intelligence of Langley and 
Fort Meade or the tales of escaped dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
 I am only too aware that on my several visits in recent years to Pyongyang, 
Wonsan, Nampo, Kaesong and some smaller North Korean towns, what I have been 
permitted to see has been sanitized, the people to whom I have been permitted 
to talk have been selected, all my observations have been screened through 
Northern doublespeak. But even so, there are some inescapable realities: This 
is a nation that does not wish to be affected or infected by the Western -- and 
more specifically the American -- way of life. It is a country that just wants 
to be left alone. It is a country that doesn't want any outsiders to presume to 
tell it what to do. And in that context, even Pyongyang's pained complaints 
over the nuclear issue have a vague reasonableness: Why, they say, should 
anyone presume to tell them what they might do within the privacy of their own 
frontiers? 
</P>
<P>
 Remember that Korea, as a peninsular entity, has had those frontiers crossed 
and recrossed with grim regularity -- and that as a nation it was invaded and 
colonized by the Mongols, the Manchus, the Chinese, the Japanese. In South 
Korea today, there is an enormous influence -- almost a colonial influence -- 
by an America that retains troops there, provides CNN there, offers McDonald's 
there. The attempts to retain traditions are fast waning in a South Korea that 
is, in many ways, becoming much like everywhere else -- a part of the 
borderless world, host to all foreign influences and victim of their dubious 
gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 But in North Korea, all is purely and solely Korean, and there is a grim 
determination to remain so. There are no Chinese characters in their language 
-- only Korea's own hangul script. There are no advertisements for Japanese 
cars -- only exhortation to ride on the country's own dubiously engineered 
buses. You will not hear Madonna on the radio, only the pleasantly enduring 
music of the kayagum and the rather less pleasant paeans to the party 
leadership. The philosophy of juche -- socialist self-reliance -- may be an 
incomprehensible melange, but it has kept North Korea utterly and completely 
Korean. 
</P>
<P>
 The people I have seen over the years are reasonably well sheltered and 
clothed and fed; they have work; they have some knowledge of the outside world 
(I lunched recently with a North Korean diplomat in New York, and he spoke 
fondly of reading Charles Dickens' "Dombey and Son" at his school in Sinuiju 
town. They have no freedoms, true. But then again, there will be no tragedies 
such as befell Polly Klaas or British toddler James Bulger, no Hustler 
magazines on the newsstands, no need for a drug czar or a Brady Act. And the 
freedom whose loss in Pyongyang we deride will seem perhaps less significant to 
a homeless women shivering in the cold of a Second Avenue doorway or to someone 
just felled by a stray bullet in the Bronx. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankly, in many ways I applaud North Korea's insistent defiance, its 
steadfast decision to march to the beat of a different drummer. Providing that 
it leaves the rest of the world alone -- and with the possibility of atomic 
weapons in its arsenal, that is a crucially important caveat -- then the rest 
of the world should perhaps leave it alone. North Korea is perhaps not so much 
a menace as talking makes it so.

COLUMN RIGHT/ VIN WEBER: DEFENSE CUTS IGNORE CHANGE IN REALITIES; WE CAN'T 
CLAIM ANY 'PEACE DIVIDEND' WHILE FACING NEW AND MORE COMPLICATED THREATS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIN WEBER, Vin Weber, a former six-term Republican congressman from 
Minnesota, is vice chairman of Empower America, a conservative advocacy group 
based in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the end of the Cold War, a consensus emerged in Washington that, with the 
Soviet threat removed, America could cut defense spending and enjoy a "peace 
dividend" in the 1990s. It is becoming increasingly clear, however, that our 
rush to claim this peace dividend may have been premature. 
</P>
<P>
 Events over the past several years have shattered the illusion that the 
post-Cold War world will be one of increasing peace, security and stability. 
From the war with Iraq (and the discovery of Iraq's advanced nuclear-weapons 
program) to our current nuclear showdown with North Korea, we are finding that 
the United States will face new and much more complicated threats to its 
security as we approach the dawn of the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarmingly, the debate over how to restructure our national defenses on the 
post-Cold War era has not kept up with this changing reality. The President's 
defense budget, which the House Budget Committee voted to cut by an additional 
$225 million this month, recklessly slashes spending on areas of increasing 
importance such as conventional preparedness and strategic defense. The 
Administration's critics, for the most part, are busy arguing that with the 
Soviet threat gone, the Clinton plan does not cut deeply enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of debating how deeply we can cut our defenses, we should be 
discussing what the emerging threats to our national security will be in the 
new millennium, and how we must prepare to meet them. These threats are ominous 
indeed. Consider some of the new realities of the post-Cold War world: 
</P>
<P>
 * The quickening spread of high-tech "super weapons" (nuclear, chemical and 
biological) means that, in the not-too-distant future, small terrorist states 
armed with advanced weapons of increasing range and lethality will be capable 
of posing a direct threat to the continental United States. Until now, the only 
potential adversaries ever to possess this capability were the Soviet Union and 
China.  
</P>
<P>
 * Increasing access to nuclear technology means we will soon enter the age of 
nuclear terrorism. We should heed the words of Abul Abbas, leader of the 
Palestinian Liberation Front, who on the eve of the Gulf War warned America: 
"Revenge takes 40 years; if not my son, then the son of my son will kill you. 
Someday we will have missiles that can reach New York." 
</P>
<P>
 * As Russia's democratic future looks increasingly uncertain, we face a very 
real risk that Russia's imperialist impulse could flare anew one day -- and 
with it the security threat posed by the former Soviet Union's nuclear arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all these nuclear threats, the recently released Clinton budget 
reduces spending on strategic defenses by $22.9 billion -- a cut of more than 
half. Programs designed to protect the United States from nuclear attack have 
been all but eliminated.  
</P>
<P>
 These deep cuts will seriously undermine America's basic ability to fight and 
win even one conventional conflict. A secret study recently conducted by the 
Army's Training and Doctrine Command warns that shortages are looming in such 
mundane but vital areas as fuel pumps, fuel trucks, chemical-weapons detectors, 
medical-evacuation helicopters, amphibious barges for landing troops and 
equipment, scanners for reading bar codes on ammunition shipping containers and 
mine-clearing equipment.  
</P>
<P>
 We cannot allow such deterioration. It is time to begin a dialogue over the 
wisdom of this defense build-down, and to consider the possibility that 
protecting our national interest in the post-Cold War era may require a 
greater, not lesser, financial commitment.  
</P>
<P>
 Is the United States today prepared to deal with a future Saddam Hussein 
armed, not with weak and inaccurate Scud missiles, but with nuclear ICBMs? 
Could we respond to a North Korean invasion of South Korea or a North Korean 
nuclear assault on Japan? Could we fight and win simultaneous conventional 
conflicts in Korea and, for example, Iraq? Could the Untied States even repeat 
its performance in Operation Desert Storm today? 
</P>
<P>
 These are the questions we should be focusing on -- not how much savings we 
can get from the defense budget. Assuring our military preparedness for the 
national security challenges of the 21st Century cannot be done on the cheap. 
If we do not refocus the debate to address questions of security instead of 
savings, we may soon find America's military capacity inadequate to ensure our 
peace and safety in the new millennium.

NO ONE MAKES IT ON $212 A MONTH; WELFARE: WHAT HAPPENS TO PEOPLE WHO DROP OFF 
GENERAL RELIEF ROLLS? THEY'RE ON THE STREETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Shelter in San Pedro and a member of the City of Los Angeles Homeless Steering 
Committee.

<TEXT>
<P>
 With its reductions in the stipends paid to the most destitute unemployed 
among us, Los Angeles County is saving large sums at an enormous human cost. 
</P>
<P>
 A report this month from Los Angeles County's Chief Administrative Officer, 
Sally Reed, to the Board of Supervisors projects a $56.9-million savings in the 
General Relief program. In the past, the program supported more than 100,000 
unemployed Angelenos who, if able, had to work for the county in exchange for a 
small monthly grant. Little more than a year ago, the general-relief grant paid 
a maximum of $341 per month to these single individuals. But due to county cuts 
last fall, general-relief payments now cannot total more than $212 per month -- 
well under the minimum rent for a single room in Los Angeles. Some 10,000 
recipients have faded out of the system and into the encamped streets, 
alleyways and hillsides of L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed claims that she is "unable at this time to determine the root cause of 
the caseload reduction" that produced the huge county savings. This may be 
because Reed does not have to sleep on a street corner when her county check is 
not enough to provide her shelter for an entire month, much less bus fare. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed does not have to bring a shopping cart or milk carton of belongings along 
to work. Or choose between carrying or surrendering all her worldly belongings 
each time she pushes a lawn mower or wields a hoe for the county in order to 
receive her $212 check. 
</P>
<P>
 This may explain why Reed recommends not spending a dime of the additional $57 
million "savings" to help put roofs over the heads of general relief 
recipients. Last fall's Draconian cuts had already produced $70 million in 
"savings" for the county. Meanwhile other department heads continue to spend 
beyond their means and the Board of Supervisors continues to allocate surplus 
dollars to them. These departments will continue to feed on the bones of 
general relief recipients unless something is done now. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed may scratch her head at why so many people have left the system but 
general relief recipients can tell you why: They're homeless. The Supervisors, 
our elected officials, should move immediately to use the $57 million in excess 
general relief "savings" to help raise payments to a level that is at least 
adequate to provide recipients with housing for a month. The County should not 
hoard money made on the suffering of so many unemployed, sometimes mentally and 
physically impaired Angelenos who are currently left out in the cold.

COLUMN LEFT/ RUTH ROSEN: UC ISN'T IN THE WIDGET BUSINESS; 'DOWNSIZING' THAT 
STARVES EDUCATION WHILE PLUMPING UP BUREAUCRATS IS A RECIPE FOR DISASTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH ROSEN, Ruth Rosen is a professor of history at UC Davis. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What will it take for the people of California to realize that their 
once-premier public university is being systematically dismantled? 
</P>
<P>
 Many parents imagine that their children will someday enjoy an inexpensive but 
superior education at the University of California. They're wrong. If they 
allow the Board of Regents to squander valuable resources and if they refuse to 
be taxed for higher public education, by the time their children graduate from 
high school, UC will be a "downsized" institution, stripped of its former 
reputation, unable to accept all qualified students, incapable of offering the 
quality education of past generations. 
</P>
<P>
 In another display of conspicuous cynicism, UC President Jack Peltason 
promised "golden parachute" retirement bonuses to nine top UC executives during 
a closed video teleconference with his chancellors. A confidential source gave 
the verbatim account to the San Francisco Examiner, providing a rare glimpse 
into the inner world of UC politics. During the meeting, Peltason worries how 
it will look when the public learns that he will give each executive a bonus of 
a year's salary -- at an average of $189,000 -- upon their leaving their 
present positions. Peltason should worry. Sooner or later the public is going 
to rebel against policies that feed administrators and starve students and 
faculty. In January, the regents authorized -- in closed session, of course -- 
a series of salary increases for 60 administrators throughout the system. 
Meanwhile, they awarded faculty a 3.5% pay cut and Peltason called on students 
to "share the pain" through higher fees (a $620-hike spread over three years). 
</P>
<P>
 The regents have it backward: The university does not exist to serve its 
administrators. Yet it is the bloated bureaucracy that siphons off valuable 
resources from the students and faculty who constitute the true core of a 
university. The salaries of the administrators who received "equity 
adjustments" were already high: $125,000 is more than twice what most full 
professors at UC earn. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is a university like a corporation; it can't downsize, streamline its 
production and retain its former reputation. (In fact, if it were a 
corporation, a savvy CEO would have fired half of UC's management yesterday). A 
public university is a nonprofit institution. It doesn't produce widgets; it 
engages in the labor-intensive enterprise of educating thousands of young 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 Three cost-cutting, voluntary early retirement programs have devastated vast 
portions of the university. Offered irresistible golden handshakes, prestigious 
faculty have left, many to other universities. Because of the lack of funds, 
only a few are called back for part-time teaching. The result: Fewer senior 
faculty train graduate students, fewer courses are offered to undergraduates. 
The remaining professors are overwhelmed and overworked. Meanwhile, elite 
universities across the nation dangle offers before UC's demoralized faculty, 
aware that their salaries lag 7.5% behind comparable institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 For current students, the university is often a nightmare. Fewer courses, 
taught by an overburdened faculty, result in even less contact with professors. 
With fewer graduate-student assistants, courses are capped or scrapped. 
Students roam the campus, in search of courses that will complete their major. 
</P>
<P>
 For prospective students, the future looks grim. With enrollments cut and 
graduate admissions reduced, we are turning away students who once easily 
qualified for admission to the University of California. 
</P>
<P>
 For the business community, the trashing of the public university must be 
viewed as a disaster. Who, after all, has trained the skilled work force, 
managers and professionals that made the California dream possible? If the 
state is ever to rebound from the recession, it needs an expanded, not a 
shrunken, university. 
</P>
<P>
 For the state of California, the dismantling of a great public university is 
not only a heinous crime but a violation of the social contract that made 
public education available to all qualified Californians. Public universities 
in California have long given the children of poor, minority or immigrant 
families an opportunity for upward mobility. In the last 20 years, those 
expectations have only intensified; blocked mobility is a recipe for class 
strife and race riots. 
</P>
<P>
 If sacrifice is needed, then let it be shared all around. An outcry of 
indignation greeted former President David Gardner's outrageous retirement 
package. Once again, the regents -- and now Gardner's successor -- have stuffed 
the pockets of administrators while shrinking the future of our youth. 
Californians must not let their actions go unanswered.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; CONNECTING ON CHILD ABUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Few things are more horrific than child abuse, so it's upsetting that one out 
of every four callers to an Orange County hot line hung up after receiving a 
busy signal or being put on hold. The problem must not be allowed to recur. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Grand Jury reported last week that 11,591 of the 46,313 
callers to the county Child Abuse Registry in an 11-month period last year 
never got through. As one grand juror correctly noted, it is impossible to know 
what prompted the calls that were unanswered but the threat that they suggest 
is certain. 
</P>
<P>
 The registry was established in 1975 as the central repository for reports of 
child abuse, involving either beatings or sexual mistreatment. Over the years, 
the number of reports to the registry has climbed enormously, in part because 
of tougher state reporting requirements for doctors, teachers, police officers 
and others. 
</P>
<P>
 A good recommendation from the grand jury panel that studied the registry's 
operations was to have those professionals who are required to report abuse use 
facsimile machines as much as possible. That would keep telephone lines open 
for neighbors, relatives and others willing to overcome the reluctance to get 
involved in reporting abuse. For many, it takes courage to call the hot line, 
and it might be even harder to gather that courage again when the phone line is 
busy or when doubts creep in while one is on hold. 
</P>
<P>
 The county Social Services Agency already has recognized the problems and 
taken some steps to correct them, but the report provides an independent look 
at what happened to calls during 1993. The agency added more telephone lines 
and clerks and expects to have more social workers at the registry in the next 
few weeks. The social workers screen the phone calls to determine which 
situations require an immediate response and which do not. 
</P>
<P>
 The steps already taken are laudable, but the agency must be sure to monitor 
changes to see that they work, and it must remain committed to keeping 
improvements in place.

BOOK REVIEW / BIOGRAPHY; LOST LINEAGE AND A MAN WHO WON'T TALK; JACK'S LIFE: A 
BIOGRAPHY OF JACK NICHOLSON BY PATRICK MCGILLIGAN ; W.W. NORTON & COMPANY $25, 
320 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN STABINER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's an odd juxtaposition: A lengthy biography of actor-director-writer Jack 
Nicholson, published just as Vanity Fair magazine makes him its cover boy, 
resplendent in his wolf-man makeup and sporting a newly trim, 
Californians-are-immortal physique. 
</P>
<P>
 The book implies that most of what's interesting about Nicholson's life has 
already happened, while the magazine suggests that the best is yet to come. 
</P>
<P>
 And Vanity Fair addresses the one scoop that Patrick McGilligan clearly hoped 
would give his book "Jack's Life" a news peg -- that Nicholson was raised by 
his grandparents, masquerading as his parents, and that the woman he thought 
was his sister was, in fact, his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Shades of "Chinatown," which, in a nice coincidence, was released in 1974, the 
year he found out his true lineage. 
</P>
<P>
 So McGilligan is hobbled in the PR sweepstakes by the monthly press, which 
beat him to the headlines. A temporal disappointment, but not the central 
problem he faces. Nicholson refused to cooperate with McGilligan, and 
reportedly persuaded some of his intimates to keep mum, besides. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the author's yeoman efforts -- he has interviewed everyone who would 
sit still, and read the clips on everyone who wouldn't -- the book too often 
reads like an account from the sidelines. The details can be fascinating, but 
they are observations at a distance; McGilligan gives us information but rarely 
makes it feel like we're reading a life. 
</P>
<P>
 What's lacking, aside from Nicholson's own reminiscences, is a novelist's 
sense of story. McGilligan has done his homework, particularly when it comes to 
Nicholson's early life, but he presents it in a fairly dry fashion. Jack's 
grandmother/mother, nicknamed Mud (for Mudder), made sure that Jack lived in as 
decent a neighborhood as her income from hairdressing would allow. 
</P>
<P>
 His real mother and aunt, the two women he thought were older sisters, were 
happy-go-lucky dreamers who kept tabs on him without letting him know exactly 
why (his mother died in her early 40s without ever divulging the truth, and his 
"sister" only confessed when a man wrote to Nicholson and identified himself as 
the actor's father). 
</P>
<P>
 There's some lovely detail about the young flirty Nicholson in the company of 
Mud's clients -- and about going to school with better-off kids whose mothers 
didn't have a row of hair dryers in the house. But the material reads too much 
like a list; there is no resonance to the physical descriptions of the 
neighborhood and only intermittent glimpses of young Jack in context. 
</P>
<P>
 When the author has sources who like to talk, he can go on endlessly, but when 
he needs word from Nicholson, or from an intimate, he has to gloss over an 
incident. It can be a choppy read. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is not to say that film buffs won't find what they do get fascinating. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening story, of the making of "Easy Rider," is a funny look at how 
coincidence can jump-start a faltering career. The mere notion that Nicholson 
had knocked around Hollywood for a decade, and was nothing but a glorified 
kibitzer when the project got underway, is a sobering reminder that there is no 
such thing as an overnight star. 
</P>
<P>
 McGilligan has performed a useful service, as far as moviegoers are concerned 
-- he has rounded up all extant anecdotes about Nicholson's films and put them 
in one place, so that the reader can simply flip to the section of the text 
that talks about a favorite film and learn pretty much all there is to know. 
</P>
<P>
 Except, of course, what Nicholson himself has to say. There are plenty of 
Hollywood biographies about subjects who refuse to cooperate, but in this case 
the omission seems particularly glaring. Perhaps it's because Nicholson has 
talked about himself so much in the past -- usually to magazines, where he can 
get off easier than with a biographer, who's going to demand more time and a 
greater level of honesty. 
</P>
<P>
 He's truly one of those larger-than-life stars, who has clearly spent time 
trying to make sense of it all -- and sometimes he has failed rather 
spectacularly, as evidenced by his occasional flings with drugs, weird 
theorists and an amusing ability to glorify serial infidelity. 
</P>
<P>
 This book is hardly the definitive work; it seems like a way station, halfway 
toward the book someone will write, someday, either when Nicholson chooses to 
cooperate or when mortality prevents him from asking his friends to keep quiet.

MICHAEL HUFFINGTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I read the article describing the supposed power of Rep. Michael Huffington's 
money in his quest for a Senate seat (March 13) with mixed feelings of sadness 
and disgust. 
</P>
<P>
 When he first outspent and defeated incumbent Robert Lagomarsino in the 1992 
Republican primary, I felt relief.Lagomarsino and his archaic beliefs were 
thankfully banished from our district by someone who was pro-choice, pro-gay 
rights and against the powerful PACs that had eaten up Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 However, by the time he entered office, he was working under a cloud of 
scrutiny because of his seemingly bottomless political wallet. He was not heard 
from often in the district once he had moved to Washington. His major 
accomplishment, he said (on a visit to a community college) was an electric bus 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 If the people of California are foolish and ignorant enough to vote for a man 
who has done nothing for this state, what they will get is a reduction from two 
to one senators representing them on Capitol Hill. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 I'm glad that incumbent Sen. Dianne Feinstein, like Michael Huffington, is 
also a millionaire. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't worry about the outcome of this race; either way, we Californians are 
assured the best U.S. senator that money can buy!

 Hakeem Olajuwon scored 13 of his 35 points in the final 10 minutes, leading 
Houston to a 128-112 victory over Washington on Monday night and clinching a 
playoff spot for the Rockets at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Olajuwon also had 14 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston guard Vernon Maxwell sprained his left knee on a drive down the lane 
in the third quarter. His condition was listed as day to day, but the team said 
he will not accompany it on the trip to Minnesota tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston became the third team to clinch a playoff spot, joining Seattle and 
San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 100, Utah 96 -- Stacey Augmon's dunk with 28 seconds to play broke a 
96-96 tie and Kevin Willis made two free throws with three seconds left as the 
Hawks edged the Jazz in overtime at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the third victory in a row for the Hawks and the fourth consecutive 
loss for the Jazz, who completed a four-game trip.

 George Bakewell finally got his wish last Thursday, to play softball with his 
son. Bakewell is a member of the Three-Quarter Century Softball Club in St. 
Petersburg, Fla., which doesn't let anyone younger than 75 join. 
</P>
<P>
 George's son, Elton, is now eligible, having turned 75. George is 101.

 Trivia time: Who is the last American male to have held the world record in 
the mile?

<P>
 Of course: Tom Lasorda once asked Dodger outfielder Kenny Landreaux what kind 
of soup was being served in the clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of the day," Landreaux replied.

 The real pits: Track & Field News reported that Australian high jumper Chris 
Anderson was beaten up at a nightclub. Worse, his takeoff foot was severely 
injured when an ambulance ran over it.

 Discreet: In an interview in the Sporting News, Danny Manning, now with the 
Atlanta Hawks, was asked to describe his feelings for Clipper owner Donald 
Sterling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Sterling is a very eccentric man," he replied. "He really wants to win. 
Things just haven't fallen into place for him." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Reversal of fortune: Don Nelson, coach of the Golden State Warriors, is 
reportedly under fire for not being able to relate to some of his players, 
namely prize rookie Chris Webber. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm 53 years old. I'm not obsolete," Nelson told the San Francisco Chronicle. 
"They were comparing me to Bobby Knight, for God's sake, and Red Auerbach, and 
all of a sudden I can't coach."

 Looking ahead: Shaquille O'Neal is already talking about a career beyond his 
NBA playing days.

'Shaq's Views.' I'll just write the facts, no speculation."

 Wait a minute: Writing for Inside Sports magazine, Tim Matheson recalled: "My 
first image of baseball was seeing Warren Spahn and the Milwaukee Braves play 
against Maury Wills, Duke Snider and the original Los Angeles Dodgers at the 
L.A. Coliseum in 1958."

 Wills didn't join the Dodgers until 1959.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This March is so mad that a Pacific 10 Conference team might actually reach 
the Final Four. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The easiest way to Charlotte probably is through L.A., where Arizona is 
stationed in the West Regional. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats have the best backcourt in the nation, Khalid Reeves and Damon 
Stoudamire, and a coach, Lute Olson, eager to show that he can be as successful 
in the postseason as in the regular season. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, Olson took Arizona to the Final Four, where it lost to Oklahoma. That 
was the first and last appearance for a Pac-10 school since UCLA was beaten by 
Louisville in the 1980 championship game. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Olson's highly regarded teams were eliminated in the first round in 1992 and 
1993, and newspaper letter writers treated him as though he were, well, Jim 
Harrick. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The joke at Olson's on Broadway in Tucson was, "After you have one round of 
drinks, you have to leave." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 But now the Wildcats are on a two-game tournament winning streak and on 
Thursday will be asked to beat Louisville, something UCLA did as recently as 16 
days ago. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Then they would play the Missouri-Syracuse survivor on Saturday. Missouri is 
seeded No. 1, but still doesn't get much respect. The same for Syracuse Coach 
Jim Boeheim, although he might be doing his best job ever. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Playing at the sold-out Sports Arena, home of Pac-10 rival USC, could be an 
advantage for Arizona. However, the Wildcats haven't appeared there since 1992, 
when they were upset by the Trojans. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The last two Arizona-USC games in the Southland have been played at the Forum. 
The Jan. 22 date was switched because of earthquake damage to the Sports Arena. 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats qualified for the West Regional the same day that a 5.3 
aftershock rattled L.A., but the Sports Arena is not on the disabled list this 
time. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The arena has been the site of two NCAA championship games. UCLA won both, 
78-55 over North Carolina in 1968 and 81-76 over Florida State in 1972. The 
most famous game, though, was the Bruins' 101-69 rout of Houston in the 1968 
semifinals, the Lew Alcindor-Elvin Hayes rematch. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Most college coaches are afraid to call timeouts early, even when a game is 
getting out of hand. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 As of today's NBA standings, the Lakers have the second-best record among 
draft lottery teams and the Clippers the third-best. Under the new system, if 
the lottery were held today, the Lakers would have only an 0.8% chance of 
getting the first pick and the Clippers a 1.5% chance. The team with the worst 
record, Dallas, would have a 25% chance. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The drawing of numbered Ping-Pong balls decides the first three choices only. 
The rest of the selections will be according to won-lost records. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Ewing belongs right up there with David Robinson and Hakeem Olajuwon 
on any list of NBA most-valuable-player candidates. I mean, where would the New 
York Knicks be without Ewing? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the loss of John Starks might be a blessing to the Knicks. Rolando 
Blackman and Derek Harper are working some of the same magic they used to with 
the Dallas Mavericks. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I liked the way Brocco re-rallied on the deepest part of a muddy track to 
overtake Valiant Nature for second behind Soul Of The Matter in the San Felipe 
Stakes Sunday at Santa Anita. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "We got what we needed out of the race," said Brocco's trainer, Randy Winick. 
"Other than winning, I'm as happy as I can be." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Jack Nicholson, who lived in Inglewood and was a Hollywood Park regular after 
moving out from New Jersey, presented the trophy in the winner's circle, but 
hadn't made a wager on the race. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 On April 22, the night of the Evander Holyfield-Michael Moorer heavyweight 
championship bout, Caesars Palace in Las Vegas will be staging its 100th title 
fight. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 In the first one, lightweight champion Roberto Duran scored a 12th-round 
knockout over Esteban DeJesus on Jan. 21, 1978. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Look for Ruben Sierra of Oakland and Marquis Grissom of Montreal, who are 
playing well this spring, to have exceptional seasons. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Free agency lessens the importance of the NFL draft, which used to be the 
surest way for a team to improve. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 CBS commentator Bill Raftery on Indiana's trip to Miami for the East Regional: 
"This is one team that won't get any sun."

 Los Amigos, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
 Volleyball / Outside hitter 
</P>
<P>
 Los Amigos, which finished third in the Garden Grove League last year, is 
showing improvement, thanks in large part to Tran.He had 25 kills in the Lobos' 
8-15, 15-3, 15-4 victory over El Modena in the title match of the Laguna Hills 
tournament Saturday and 17 kills Wednesday in a three-game sweep of Rancho 
Alamitos. Los Amigos Coach David Avalos said Tran is an excellent passer, but 
it's his hitting that sets him apart. "Even if he's in the back row, they 
better keep an eye on him," Avalos said, "because he can attack from anywhere."

<P>
 Rancho Alamitos, Sr. 
</P>
<P>
 Softball / Pitcher 
</P>
<P>
 Otto was the Vaqueros' backup pitcher last season but didn't get much action 
because Destiny Mollison was the starter.Mollison has graduated and Otto is now 
excelling beyond most expectations. Last week, she had a no-hitter in a 9-0 
victory over Century, a one-hitter in a 6-0 victory over Valencia and a 
two-hitter in a 6-0 victory over Aliso Niguel. She faced 65 batters in 20 
innings and struck out 31, including 15 of the 19 Century batters she faced. 
Otto, who started at first base last season, also batted .375 for the week. 
Other notables: 
</P>
<P>
 * Nicole Erickson, Brea-Olinda, had 16 points, five steals and five assists in 
a victory over San Jose Archbishop Mitty for the State Division III title. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gina Heads, Newport Harbor, won the shotput in 40 feet 8 inches and the 
discus in 124-2 1/2 in a 81-42 victory over Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 * Kathy Ponce, Ocean View, pitched a no-hitter, two-hitter and three-hitter in 
the Laguna Hills softball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stefanie Ruiz, Aliso Niguel, went four for four with a grand slam and six 
runs batted in in a 20-5 victory over Southern California Christian.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE NOTEBOOK / STEVE KRESAL: CYPRESS' FRANCE THINKS HARD, THROWS 
HARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Aaron France, a sophomore pitcher at Cypress College, spends a lot of time 
thinking about his performance. 
</P>
<P>
 He pores over the scouting report, carefully considering the way he plans to 
pitch each hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 The results have been impressive so far this season. 
</P>
<P>
 He is 6-0 with a 1.53 earned-run average. France, a right-hander who relies on 
his fastball, change-up and curve, has 48 strikeouts and 15 walks in 47 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite France's success, Cypress Coach Scott Pickler said he still gets 
too caught up in the mental side of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "He gets into his own head sometimes," Pickler said. "He has no idea how good 
he can be . . . He really doesn't understand how well he's doing. He needs to 
throw to his own strengths more and worry less about the hitter's weaknesses." 
</P>
<P>
 France explains it this way: "Coach Pickler and Coach (Bill) Pinkham tell me 
that I'm a psycho sometimes. But I'm a perfectionist . . . The team's No. 1 
goal is to win the (Orange Empire) Conference and I want to help all I can."  
</P>
<P>
 Cypress is 18-5, 5-2 in conference and a game behind first-place Riverside. 
France is expected to start against host Riverside at 2 p.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering his past, France can almost be excused for his struggles with 
success. In his three years of varsity baseball at Loara, the Saxons were 
25-50. He was impressive at times but also had his share of poor outings. He 
was bothered by a sore right elbow that required surgery in October of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Pickler saw France pitch early in his senior year and was impressed with his 
velocity and fluid arm motion. A Toronto Blue Jays' scout also took notice of 
France that season and he was drafted. 
</P>
<P>
 But France said he wasn't ready to play professionally and enrolled at 
Cypress. He was the only freshman in the starting rotation and finished with a 
5-3 mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore drafted France at the end of the season, but again he wasn't ready 
to sign so he returned to Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he's being recruited by Miami, Long Beach State, Arizona, Arizona State 
and the University of San Diego. Several professional scouts also are still 
interested. 
</P>
<P>
 He's happy with his accomplishments but is quick to point out that two-thirds 
of the conference season remains. France, who has taken pitching lessons since 
he was 8, knows he faces some difficult decisions in the coming months about 
picking a college or accepting a professional offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard for me to understand how playing baseball amounts to all this," 
France said. "I'm just thankful I have the talent that it takes to get this 
far." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Track and field showdown: The five local men's and women's track teams -- 
Fullerton, Golden West, Orange Coast, Rancho Santiago and Saddleback -- meet in 
the first Orange County Classic starting at 9 a.mr. Saturday at Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 The meet was the idea of Jim Kiefer, Fullerton's coach and men's athletic 
director. Kiefer, with sponsorship help by the Fullerton Rotary Club, was 
finally able to get the meet started this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something I've wanted to do for a long time," Kiefer said. "It's fun 
to bring everyone together like this. We can showcase the talent our county has 
to offer." 
</P>
<P>
 The first final, the women's distance medley relay, is scheduled for 9:20 a.m. 
A majority of the final events are between noon and 2 p.m.

COLLEGE DIVISION / ARA NAJARIAN: 'STRUGGLING' HAS ENDED FOR CS BAKERSFIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARA NAJARIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maybe Cal State Bakersfield needed a little fear-generated motivation. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a 24-6 record, the Bakersfield men's basketball team struggled, star 
point guard Tyrone Davis says. 
</P>
<P>
 From his perspective, maybe losing six games is struggling. After last 
season's 33-0 national championship season and an NCAA record for most 
victories in an undefeated season, Bakersfield finished second in the 
California Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakersfield had its five starters back from last season, but never looked as 
sharp as it had in '92-93. 
</P>
<P>
 But the struggling ended after Bakersfield lost to UC Riverside in the CCAA 
tournament final two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakersfield received an at-large invitation to the NCAA Division II West 
Regional anyway, but the fear of a quick exit from the playoffs became a 
motivator. In the regional last week, Bakersfield defeated Alaska Anchorage, 
92-61, then Riverside, 75-62. That was the same Riverside team that had beaten 
the Roadrunners two of three times this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Bakersfield is back in the tournament's round of eight for the fifth 
consecutive season. On Wednesday, the Roadrunners will play Indiana (Pa.) 
(27-2) at Springfield, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 Was this season more of a struggle because of last season's success? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, not really," said Davis, who was chosen most valuable player of the CCAA 
and the NCAA tournament last season. "Last year, we just took every game one at 
a time, so we didn't really feel pressure. We did that this year too, but we 
just lost some games." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Center Jeff Kuehl: "(Before the regional) it wasn't do or die. We knew we 
would be going to the playoffs anyway. I wouldn't say we took things lightly, 
but we know there is no tomorrow in the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis thought it might have been more pride than fear. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very proud, and we have a tradition," he said after the Riverside 
game. "We like to go to Springfield -- anything else would have been a 
disappointment." 
</P>
<P>
 A key player at Springfield could be Roheen Oats. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Oats led Bakersfield in scoring and rebounding. He was an 
All-CCAA player, was MVP of the Western Regional and was also named to the NCAA 
all-tournament team. But this season he was in and out of the starting lineup 
and did not even get an honorable mention in the CCAA. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the last six games, he has worked his way back into the starting lineup 
and was a key player in the West Regional victory over UC Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last couple of weeks, I got more confidence," Oats said. "I wasn't as 
strong earlier in the season. But the guards have been giving me the ball more, 
and that helped my confidence and focus." 
</P>
<P>
 Oats and Kuehl give Bakersfield a 1-2 punch at the post position that was too 
much for Riverside. Riverside center Bob Fife was the CCAA's player of the 
year, but Oats and Kuehl got him into foul trouble in the West Regional final.  
</P>
<P>
 Oats is optimistic about repeating as national champion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, we were a bunch of players who hadn't played together before the 
season. This year it's the same players, so we should know what we're doing." 
</P>
<P>
 They should, but a little fear couldn't hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Diver up: Brian Foster of Pomona-Pitzer won the one- and three-meter diving 
competitions at the NCAA Division III swimming and diving championships at 
Williams College in Massachusetts on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster also was named the Division III diver of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 He rallied to win both events, scoring 441.50 points in the one-meter 
competition and 487.00 in the three-meter. Last year, he finished second in 
both.  
</P>
<P>
 He is only the third Pomona-Pitzer men's team member ever to win an individual 
event at the NCAA championships. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran lost in the Division III men's basketball regional March 11, then 
lost its coach. 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, Mike Dunlap stepped down to pursue a coaching opportunity in 
Australia. When the Kingsmen lost to Greensboro (N.C.), 104-99, it marked the 
end of a successful five-year run for Dunlap. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlap's teams were a combined 80-55, and won at least a share of the 
conference title in all three of its Southern California Intercollegiate 
Athletic Conference seasons. This season, the Kingsmen tied with Pomona-Pitzer 
for the SCIAC title and finished with a 25-3 record. 
</P>
<P>
 Rich Rider was named the new coach last Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
 Rider, 47, was district athletic director for the Boise Unified School 
District last year in Idaho. Before that, he was the associate men's basketball 
coach for nine years under Bobby Dye at Boise State. Rider also coached under 
Dye at Cal State Bakersfield in 1982-83, after having been head coach at 
Chapman from 1973 to 1982. At Chapman, he was 136-94. 
</P>
<P>
 College Division Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Tisa Read of Pomona-Pitzer was selected SCIAC women's basketball player of the 
year. Damon Ridley of Cal Lutheran was selected men's player of the year. . . . 
John Masi of UC Riverside was voted CCAA men's basketball coach of the year. 
Kim Young of Cal State San Bernardino and Mildred Conston of Cal Poly Pomona 
were selected as the CCAA women's basketball co-players of the year. Also in 
women's basketball, Luvina Beckley of Cal State San Bernardino and Van Girard 
of Cal State Dominguez Hills were selected co-coaches of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Fick of Cal Lutheran is off to a fast start in baseball. Through 10 
games, Fick has a batting average of .500, with seven home runs, 23 runs batted 
in and 15 runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Although The Master's, Azusa Pacific and Westmont all lost in the first two 
rounds of the NAIA tournament last week, that is not necessarily an indicator 
that West Coast basketball is on the decline at the NAIA level. It might be 
that the contrary is true, considering that it was the first time three teams 
from California had been invited to the NAIA tournament in the same season. . . 
. Six of Westmont's winter sports teams qualified for postseason play -- men's 
and women's cross-country, men's and women's soccer, men's volleyball and men's 
basketball.

VALLEY / VENTURA ROUNDUP; NORTH HOLLYWOOD'S OLLIE AND LEE NAMED TO CITY 4-A 
TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In what could be interpreted as a snub of City Section basketball in the San 
Fernando Valley, only two players from the region were selected to the All-City 
4-A Division boys' basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior center Damon Ollie of North Hollywood High was named to the team for 
the second year in a row. Teammate Arthur Lee, a junior guard, was also 
selected. 
</P>
<P>
 Ollie averaged 20.1 points, Lee 17.7 for the Huskies, who won the East Valley 
League. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior forward Tremaine Fowlkes of Crenshaw -- which won the State Division I 
title last weekend in Oakland -- was selected player of the year. Four Crenshaw 
players were named to the 16-member team. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 3-A Division, senior guard Trenton Cross of Reseda, senior swingman 
Charles Adams of El Camino Real and senior swingman Kenyatta Niles of Monroe 
were repeat all-City selections. Senior forward Lamarr Thompson of Sylmar was 
also named to the 16-player team. Senior guard Jason Pickett of Banning was 
selected 3-A player of the year. COLLEGE SOFTBALL 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas 3-0, Cal State Northridge 1-1 -- Amy Windmiller (8-1) pitched her third 
consecutive no-hitter for the sixth-ranked Matadors (17-3), a perfect game in 
the second game of a nonconference home doubleheader against the 11th-ranked 
Jayhawks. COLLEGE BASEBALL

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; LEITER CARRIES AN EXTRA BURDEN TO CAMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was one of the most troubling flights of Mark Leiter's life. He spent the 
five hours wondering if he really should be doing this. 
</P>
<P>
 It always was difficult for Leiter to leave his family, but now the pain of 
separation is excruciating. 
</P>
<P>
 Leiter, who arrived in Tempe, Ariz., on Monday to join the Angels, would give 
anything for this job opportunity to be his only worry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, life doesn't work that way," Leiter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to live the dream of being a starting pitcher in the major leagues, 
Leiter must face ruthless reality. His and wife Allison's 9-month-old son, Ryan 
Alexander, is dying. 
</P>
<P>
 He cannot move his hands. His legs are limp. His neck is not strong enough to 
support his head. He is being fed through a tube in his navel. Another tube 
removes saliva. 
</P>
<P>
 The ailment is a progressive form of neuro-muscular atrophy called 
Werdnig-Hoffman disease. In essence, Leiter said, it's an infant's form of Lou 
Gehrig's disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been told that most babies suffering from this disease don't live past 
a year," Leiter said. "The longest on record is two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, we're trying to enjoy him every day we can." 
</P>
<P>
 That is why it was so difficult for Leiter to board the plane from Florida. 
His family will rejoin him on Thursday, but he has no idea whether they will 
all be packing their bags again in 10 days for a new place of employment. 
</P>
<P>
 Leiter, 31, signed a one-year, non-guaranteed contract for $300,000, plus 
$300,000 in incentives, after being released a week ago by the Detroit Tigers. 
The Angels will decide by March 29 if he will stick with the team. If he 
doesn't, they will pay him $75,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really excited about this opportunity because I think I'll get a chance 
to start," said Leiter, who was 6-6 with a 4.73 earned-run average last season. 
"I know I can still pitch." 
</P>
<P>
 Angel Manager Buck Rodgers said that Leiter will pitch in at least two games 
before a decision is made. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Joe Magrane is expected to pitch batting practice this week for the first time 
since he had arthroscopic surgery on his left elbow last month. If he has no 
setbacks, Magrane might rejoin the rotation by late April or early May. BOB

FORMER FULLERTON COACH ANDREAS DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Andy Andreas, a former Indiana assistant who spent several of his 38 years as 
a basketball coach in Orange County, died of lung cancer Sunday in Destin, Fla. 
He was 76. 
</P>
<P>
 Andreas, who last coached at Fullerton High School in 1990-91, married former 
Cal State Fullerton Associate Athletic Director Leanne Grotke in July, 1991, 
and the two retired to Destin that year. He was diagnosed with cancer last 
August. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was one of those things that happened by script," Grotke said. "He was 
terminally ill, and the pain was beginning to set in. This was a blessing, 
because we didn't want him to suffer any more." 
</P>
<P>
 After playing at Kent State, Andreas coached on the high school level for 23 
years in Michigan and Ohio, twice leading Kent Roosevelt High to the Ohio state 
championship game. He was an assistant under Bobby Knight at Indiana in 
1975-76, when the Hoosiers won the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Andreas left Indiana in 1977 and became something of a vagabond coach, 
spending time at Edison Community College in Florida, Chapman College, Cal 
State Dominguez Hills, Riverside City College, UC Irvine and Rancho Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
 A family memorial service for Andreas was held Monday in Destin. Besides 
Grotke, Andreas is survived by two daughters, Nancy Hoinski of Dallas and Lori 
Murray of Columbus, Ohio, and three grandchildren. MIKE DiGIOVANNA

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; PARK, DREIFORT STRENGTHEN CHANCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two rookie pitchers showed their stuff again Monday in West Palm Beach, Fla., 
and once again showed why they could make the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan Ho Park pitched four scoreless innings in the Dodgers' 6-1 victory over 
the Montreal Expos, and Darren Dreifort gave up one run and struck out three in 
two innings. 
</P>
<P>
 With the season two weeks away, Dreifort appears certain to make the team as a 
reliever. And Manager Tom Lasorda, saying he already has five starters, added 
that he wouldn't have a problem putting Park in the bullpen, but he gave no 
indication what the club might actually do. 
</P>
<P>
 Park, 20, is beginning to make the decision easier. Even though Park is a 
starter, the Dodgers are leaning toward putting him in the bullpen to nurse him 
along rather than starting him at triple-A Albuquerque. With Ramon Martinez 
inconsistent the last two seasons and Kevin Gross coming back from shoulder 
tendinitis, the Dodgers seem to be trying to find a way to put Park in the 
rotation. He has been in it all spring, twice pitching instead of regulars. He 
could make the team as a reliever and be ready to take over if a starter 
falters. A trade is also possible. 
</P>
<P>
 When Park faced the Expos last, he was nervous. That game was televised back 
to Korea, and his four innings were marked by confusion. But there was none of 
that Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Over pasta Sunday night, Lasorda told Park not to hesitate in his delivery 
anymore, for fear of balk calls. Park then showed he didn't need tricks to 
deceive the hitters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like the Dodgers made a good investment," Expo Manager Felipe Alou 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Dreifort was equally impressive. 
</P>
<P>
 "His fastball moves better than any right-hander's I have ever seen," pitching 
coach Ron Perranoski said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When light-hitting shortstop Rafael Bournigal homered to left field, he 
stopped at second base. The umpire had to tell him the ball went out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not used to hitting homers," Bournigal said. "When I got back to the 
bench, those guys were all over me." 
</P>
<P>
 Third base coach Joey Almalfitano told Bournigal: "When it leaves the park, 
then it's a home run." MARYANN HUDSON

 Michael Jordan had an RBI single and dropped an easy fly for Class-A Prince 
William in his first game as a minor league baseball player. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan, the three-time NBA most valuable player, was sent to the minors on 
Monday by the Chicago White Sox after going three for 20 in 13 spring games, 
but there is still some question as to where he will begin the season. 
</P>
<P>
 He was given today off, might play for triple-A Nashville on Wednesday and 
might work out with double-A Birmingham later this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's wherever we can get him in games, where we can get him the most 
at-bats," said Ron Schueler, White Sox general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan took his demotion well. 
</P>
<P>
 "More or less, it's something I need to improve my skills," he said. "It 
doesn't bother me personally. I don't think like I failed at anything."

 Baseball's top executive, Bud Selig, clashed with U.S. senators who accused 
owners of lying and gutting the power of the vacant commissioner's office.

 During a contentious 2 1/2-hour session in St. Petersburg, Fla., Selig 
repeatedly tried to avoid direct answers to questions from Sen. Howard 
Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) and said the commissioner "has as much authority in this 
industry as any human being in the United States of America."

 Replied Metzenbaum: "I say BS."

Harrick has been assailed for UCLA's 112-102 loss to underdog Tulsa last Friday 
in the first round of the NCAA tournament. 
</P>

 One of Harrick's harshest critics has been former UCLA great Bill Walton, who 
played for Wooden from 1972-74 and led the Bruins to two NCAA championships and 
an 86-4 record over three seasons.

NHL ROUNDUP; PANTHERS TIE, MAKE HISTORY IN EXPANSION

<TEXT>
<P>
 John Vanbiesbrouck turned away 40 shots Monday night at Miami and the Florida 
Panthers rallied for a 3-3 tie with the New Jersey Devils that made the 
Panthers the most successful first-year expansion franchise in NHL history. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida surpassed the expansion mark for points in a season with 74.The 
Panthers shared the mark with the Hartford Whalers of 1979-80 and the 
Philadelphia Flyers of 1967-68. 
</P>
<P>
 "Really, oh good," Panther Coach Roger Neilson said of the record, which he 
and his players downplayed. "Now the tough part of this is starting. We've got 
to get some points on the road." 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Lowry's tying goal in the second period moved Florida even with the 
Washington Capitals for the seventh playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "After we scored that goal, we got back to our style," Lowry said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers, 5-1-2 in their last eight games, are five points ahead of the 
Flyers and the New York Islanders for the final playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
 The Devils are 9-1-3 in their last 13 games and have moved to within one point 
of the New York Rangers, who have the NHL's best record and are in first place 
in the Atlantic Division.

THE NHL / HELENE ELLIOTT; DEADLINE DAY IS GOOD FOR CANUCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Craig Janney was sent back to a team that gave him away, the Chicago 
Blackhawks continued a dizzying succession of deals, the Boston Bruins added 
offense to their defense but grew thin at center, and the New York Rangers sent 
Mike Gartner, one of six NHL players who have scored 600 goals, to Toronto for 
Glenn Anderson in a curious move that didn't address Coach Mike Keenan's 
demands for toughness. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's trading deadline produced a flurry of deals, including Janney's 
return to St. Louis. He had been awarded to the Vancouver Canucks as 
compensation for the Blues' signing of free agent Petr Nedved, but refused to 
report. Asked last week if he would play for St. Louis again if the teams 
agreed on a deal, he said: "I don't think from my side or their side either of 
us wants me in a Blues uniform." 
</P>
<P>
 While the Blues try to soothe ruffled feelings, the Canucks -- who might have 
gotten nothing for Nedved if they had not been able to work out a trade -- 
emerge stronger. Although Nathan Lafayette, 21, isn't the proven playmaker they 
wanted at center with Pavel Bure, he has promise. They also get prolific 
defenseman Jeff Brown and steady Bret Hedican. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Vancouver probably ended up doing the best business of anybody, as 
far as I'm concerned," King General Manager Nick Beverley said. "They picked up 
two defensemen, good-sized guys who are mobile." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers, who had long sought a center, also got Edmonton's Craig MacTavish 
for 20-year-old Todd Marchant, who played for the U.S. Olympic team at 
Lillehammer. Adding former Oilers MacTavish and Anderson gave them seven 
members of the 1990 Stanley Cup-winning team. The Maple Leafs had so little use 
for Anderson that they tried to foist him off on the Canadian Olympic team. 
Gartner is still flourishing at 34, with 28 goals this season and 611 for his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blackhawks added scoring punch in right wing Tony Amonte, who has scored 
68 goals the last two seasons. They gave the Rangers two pluggers, right wing 
Brian Noonan and left wing Stephane Matteau. The Blackhawks started the day 
with six players who had been acquired since opening night and will have to 
give players scorecards to identify one another. 
</P>
<P>
 The Washington Capitals did some shuffling, too, fortifying their defense by 
adding Joe Reekie from Tampa Bay and Jim Johnson from Dallas at minimal cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Prize for the most puzzling deal goes to the Bruins, who sent center Joe 
Juneau to the Capitals for defenseman Al Iafrate on the day they learned right 
wing Cam Neely will sit out the rest of the season because of a torn right knee 
ligament. Iafrate and Ray Bourque will produce sparks on the power play, but 
Boston has only Adam Oates, Ted Donato, Daniel Marois and minor league recall 
Andrew McKim at center. Already in an 0-5-1 slump, the Bruins may sink in the 
playoff rankings. NOT USING THEIR HEADS 
</P>
<P>
 The NHL won't allow players to use sticks that might shatter easily and 
endanger their safety, but its standards for helmets are shockingly lax. 
</P>
<P>
 A substantial helmet might have spared Blackhawk winger Michel Goulet the 
massive concussion he suffered last week, when he lost his balance and slid 
into the end boards at the Montreal Forum. Goulet is still in a Montreal 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 His helmet, said Montreal's Vincent Damphousse, is "like a piece of cardboard, 
there's no protection." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Montreal goalie Patrick Roy: "With the kind of helmet he had on, I knew 
he was hurt bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Gretzky wears a similar helmet, which has little padding to soften the 
impact of a blow. 
</P>
<P>
 Those helmets are legal because former NHL President Gil Stein made it 
possible for players to go bareheaded if they signed waivers absolving the NHL 
of responsibility. Because players aren't required to wear helmets, the NHL 
can't set rules for headgear beyond the minimums for such equipment set by a 
Canadian safety standards panel. 
</P>
<P>
 But even those standards are being ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have people using helmets that haven't passed those tests, but we don't 
have the right to tell them they can't," said Jim Gregory, the NHL's vice 
president for hockey operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to, through the general managers, tell them the equipment has gone 
through tests and they can't take the sponges out of the helmets and still be 
assured of the helmets' being safe. . . . This is a tough one, one we've 
wrestled with and we've recommended that we take another look at it." 
</P>
<P>
 How about making helmets mandatory and ensuring they're safe? Only one player, 
MacTavish, plays without one. Advances in technology have made helmets light 
but sturdy. It's stupid to skimp on safety. MISGUIDED RULES 
</P>
<P>
 The NHL can't keep players from wearing flimsy helmets, but we can rest easy, 
knowing that league officials are doing their best to keep players from 
celebrating milestones. 
</P>
<P>
 When Brian Propp recorded his 1,000th point Saturday, his Hartford Whaler 
teammates mobbed him happily. Sorry, that's a delay-of-game penalty. The 
Rangers, anticipating that problem, have gotten special dispensation to 
celebrate when Adam Graves scores his 50th goal. 
</P>
<P>
 What really delays the game are those flow-killing, 70-second timeouts 
inflicted on us four times a game. Recognizing a player's achievement isn't a 
delay, it's a moment to rejoice. TAKING CARE OF BUSINESS 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations on a new collective bargaining agreement went nowhere last week, 
according to Commissioner Gary Bettman. He will update the Board of Governors 
on Thursday in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman said owners won't lock players out before the playoffs -- "If we 
wanted to get involved in a lockout, we had all season to do it," he said -- 
and he doesn't foresee a strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they wanted to force a deal by threatening a strike, they've got to do it 
with enough time left to discuss everything," he said. "If they said, 'If 
there's no agreement by April 1, we're walking out,' then it would be clear 
they had no intention of agreeing and all they intended to do was strike. . . . 
We're talking. We need each other to grow as a sport." 
</P>
<P>
 Gartner, president of the NHL Players Assn., said players aren't seeking a 
confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm certainly not giving any deadlines, as we did two years ago," Gartner 
said, alluding to a strike before the 1992 playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Free agency and the owners' move for a salary cap remain the most contentious 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will not be a salary cap," NHLPA head Bob Goodenow said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman also said the board will decide whether to appeal a Canadian court 
ruling ordering the NHL to pay $45 million to the players' pension fund. 
SLAPSHOTS 
</P>
<P>
 Gordie Howe, absent during Gretzky's pursuit of his NHL goal-scoring record, 
will take part in a pregame ceremony at the Kings' first home game after 
Gretzky scores his 802nd goal. . . . The Quebec Nordiques won't get Swedish 
Olympic standout Peter Forsberg for about another week, while his Swedish 
League team competes in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The seizure suffered Sunday by the Islanders' Brian Mullen might end his 
career. It's a shame. The gritty winger was recovering rapidly from a stroke 
and was medically cleared to play, but the seizure -- said to be common among 
stroke patients and not hockey-related -- is a grave setback.

PROPERTY VALUES: OME FACE PAPER CHASE GETTING QUAKE CHECKS; INSURANCE: 
HOMEOWNERS MAY FIND THAT THEIR CHECKS FOR REPAIRS ARE ALSO MADE OUT TO THEIR 
MORTGAGE LENDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousands of local homeowners are starting to receive eagerly awaited checks 
from their insurance companies for repair and reconstruction of properties 
damaged in the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of you may be surprised, however, to find that these checks are made out 
to you and your mortgage lender. Without consent of such a mortgage holder, the 
checks can't be cashed and the money can't be spent on repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Lenders and other lien holders are named on insurance company checks for two 
reasons. While residential lenders don't generally require borrowers to get 
earthquake insurance, earthquake coverage is usually just a rider or 
endorsement to general casualty policies in which lenders demand that they be 
named as payees. Also, insurance companies want to avoid lawsuits by lenders 
that might claim an insurer ignored the lender's interest in the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, insurance companies and lenders don't follow any 
across-the-board policy in handling earthquake checks, which only adds to the 
paper chase nightmare that many homeowners with quake damage are already going 
through. Some insurance companies include the policyholder and all lien holders 
on all their earthquake damage checks. Other companies include lien holders 
only if the check is for more than a certain amount of money arbitrarily set by 
the insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
 Lenders have differing policies too. Depending on the size of the check, a 
lender may simply endorse the check and hand it back to the borrower, or the 
lender may place the check proceeds into an escrow account and release the 
funds only after the borrower offers proof that quake repairs have been made. 
The lender, however, can't generally keep the money. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lenders are supposed to be named in all checks regardless of the amount, but 
this isn't done," said Marlyn Dinon of Western Insurance Information Service, a 
nonprofit trade group funded by insurance companies in the 10 Western states. 
"Where the damage is small, the lien holder is hardly ever named." 
</P>
<P>
 20th Century Insurance Co. in Woodland Hills, however, is naming all known 
lien holders on its earthquake checks, said Rick Dinon, vice president at 20th 
Century and the husband of Marlyn Dinon. Lenders holding a second mortgage on 
the property will not appear on the check if their mortgage contract didn't 
require that they be named as a loss payee, he said. Otherwise, "a loss payee 
endorsement to the insurance policy ensures that the lender will be on the 
check." 
</P>
<P>
 Cashing an earthquake insurance check may be further complicated for borrowers 
who have refinanced, or who have had their loan sold in the so-called secondary 
market, Dinon said. If the name of the old mortgage holder is on the check, the 
policyholder has to send the check back to the insurer, along with information 
about the new mortgagee. Homeowners who haven't received a check in the mail 
yet should call their insurer and find out in advance about any joint payees, 
Dinon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, there is a lot of confusion about earthquake damage checks. For 
instance, a friend of mine in Woodland Hills who has earthquake insurance with 
20th Century was told that he would get a $1,000 check for his earthquake 
damage. A 20th Century claims employee also told him that because his check was 
for less than $1,500, it would be made out directly to him and would not 
include his mortgage company. The 20th Century person said the $1,500 cutoff 
was required by state law. In fact, there is no such law, according to the 
California Department of Insurance. And my friend did get his $1,000 check made 
out directly to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Safeco Corp., an insurance company based in Seattle, has a more lenient policy 
regarding insurance checks than 20th Century. Earthquake damage checks issued 
for less than $5,000 by Safeco will generally not include any mortgage 
companies, said Robie Baker, catastrophe manager for the insurer in Glendale. 
But putting lenders' names on larger checks "keeps people from walking away 
from their homes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most mortgagees will bend over backward to work with catastrophe victims," 
Baker said. "But we can't force them to hold by any standard." Unfortunately, 
he said, some mortgage companies "will sometimes put our policyholders in a 
Catch-22 because they won't release insurance proceeds to a homeowner until the 
work is done. I try to referee these situations and get the parties to work the 
situation out." 
</P>
<P>
 At California Federal Bank, any earthquake checks from insurance companies for 
less than $10,000 can be endorsed over to the homeowner on the spot by a branch 
manager, said Donald L. Black, senior vice president, while checks of more than 
$10,000 are "handled on a case-by-case basis." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In deciding whether to endorse a larger check or place the funds in escrow, 
Black said, the savings and loan looks at the borrower's past relationship with 
the institution, the value of the property and the size of the loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Fed won't use its power to withhold funds as a way to force certain 
troubled borrowers to pay up on their loans. "We would not require that a 
borrower bring the loan payments current before endorsing a check," Black said. 
"We've chosen not to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 At Lomas Mortgage USA in Dallas, most insurance company earthquake checks for 
$10,000 or less are being endorsed and sent back to borrowers to spend at their 
discretion. But checks of more than $10,000, or checks being forwarded to Lomas 
by a borrower who is behind in payments, will be placed into a separate 
interest-bearing account, with the money released in stages, said Kelly Eckels, 
a Lomas assistant vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Some real estate loan documents state that the lender can demand that any 
insurance proceeds be used to reduce a borrower's debt, rather than repair the 
property. Despite what the documents say, courts generally won't allow such a 
provision to be enforced, said John H. Kuhl, partner in charge of the real 
estate finance practice at the Century City law firm Cox, Castle & Nicholson. 
According to the 1978 California appellate court case of Schoolcraft vs. Ross, 
a borrower is entitled to use insurance proceeds to rebuild premises that have 
been damaged. A lender has to show that its security is being "impaired" before 
insurance proceeds can be used to reduce the debt. 
</P>
<P>
 A lender may be able to argue that its security is being impaired, however, if 
the property cannot be restored to its condition and value just prior to the 
casualty, Kuhl said. "Only an extremely aggressive lender would try to deny a 
borrower the money to rebuild," he added. "And a court would most probably 
decide in favor of the homeowner." 
</P>
<P>
 The net effect of Schoolcraft and provisions in California's Civil Code is 
that mortgage lenders may have the right to receive and control earthquake 
damage proceeds. But lenders are still required to make those proceeds 
available to pay the cost of repairing the damage that caused the money be 
available, Kuhl said. "Surprisingly, we are not hearing about too many disputes 
between borrowers and lenders. It seems that most borrowers and lenders are 
able to agree without resorting to the lawyers."

Financial Ground." 
</P>
<P>
 Really, my heart bleeds for Sally and Jack Nissenbaum for their apartment 
problems.Reza should have done his homework. I would like to be in the same 
place as these "unfortunate" landlords. 
</P>
<P>
 With 50 units at approximately $600 per unit, their return is $30,000 per 
month. With a mortgage of $12,000 per month, not a bad return. 
</P>
<P>
 They bought the place in 1979. So tell me, with all the profit they have made 
since 1979, why should I bleed? 
</P>
<P>
 Don't get me wrong, I do not like to see anyone suffer. However, there are 
individuals that have never had that kind of an income, or will ever have it. A 
payday-to-payday existence for most.

 For 15 years the Nissenbaums have had a very nice, secure return on their 
units. Nothing is forever.

JONES WINS SUPPORTING OSCAR FOR 'FUGITIVE' ROLE; MOVIES: 'SCHINDLER'S LIST' IS 
THE EARLY FAVORITE TO CAPTURE ACADEMY AWARD FOR SPIELBERG AS BEST DIRECTOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT W. WELKOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Veteran character actor Tommy Lee Jones, who thrilled audiences with his 
portrayal of Dr. Richard Kimble's dogged nemesis in "The Fugitive," was named 
best supporting actor Monday night as the 66th Academy Awards got under way in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, a Texas-born Harvard graduate, thanked his "dear, courageous" family 
and friends, and his co-star, Harrison Ford. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, two movies directed by Steven Spielberg, a heavy favorite in 
several categories, collected early Oscars. Allan Starski and Ewa Braun won for 
best art direction for their work in the black-and-white Holocast epic 
"Schindler's List." 
</P>
<P>
 And Dennis Muren, Stan Winston, Phil Tippett and Michael Lantieri took home 
the visual effects award or their work on the summer dinosaur blockbuster 
"Jurassic Park." Gary Rydstrom and Richard Hymns, who did the sound editing 
work on that movie, also won an Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
 The makeup team from "Mrs. Doubtfire -- Greg Cannom, Ve Neill and Yolanda 
Toussieng -- won the best makeup award. 
</P>
<P>
 And the best animated short and live action short film awards went to Nicholas 
Park for "The Wrong Trousers" and Pepe Danquart for "Black Rider," 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 For Spielberg, who has created some of Hollywood's most popular movies, from 
"E.T.: The Extraterrestrial" to "Raiders of the Lost Ark," the story of Oskar 
Schindler was seen as his best chance to win his first Academy Award as best 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 Vying for best picture against "Schindler's List," which garnered 12 Oscars 
nominations overall, were "The Piano," "In the Name of the Father," "The 
Remains of the Day" and "The Fugitive." 
</P>
<P>
 The evening's early acting award went to Jones, who picked up his first Oscar 
for his role as the relentless federal marshal Sam Gerard in "The Fugitive," a 
film based on the popular 1960s TV series. The actor had been the favorite 
going in, having won the Golden Globe and the Los Angeles Film Critics awards. 
</P>
<P>
 In accepting his golden statuette, the actor, his head shaven, quipped that 
the only thing he could say at such a was, "I am not really bald." 
</P>
<P>
 In her debut run as the show's first woman and first African American solo 
host, Oscar-winning actress Whoopi Goldberg added the expected accent to the 
show with acerbic remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, she joked about "Jurassic Park," saying Spielberg wanted to call 
the movie about a failed amusement park where everything runs amok "Euro 
Disney." 
</P>
<P>
 ABC-TV, which broadcast the show, wanted to impose a three-second delay to 
avoid any off-color remarks that might be made, but the academy fought it in 
the name of spontaneity. 
</P>
<P>
 In the best actor category, Tom Hanks, who portrayed a lawyer with AIDS in 
"Philadelphia," was considered a front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
 The other nominees were Daniel Day-Lewis, for his role as a Belfast youth 
imprisoned for an IRA bombing ("In the Name of the Father"); Laurence 
Fishburne, a first-time nominee for his role as rocker Ike Turner ("What's Love 
Got to Do With It"); Irish actor Liam Neeson, another first-time nominee, for 
his portrayal of German industrialist Oskar Schindler ("Schindler's List") and 
Anthony Hopkins for his role as a proper English butler ("The Remains of the 
Day"). 
</P>
<P>
 In the best actress category, Holly Hunter, who plays a mute mail-order bride 
in "The Piano," was the clear favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 Other nominees were Angela Bassett, for her role as singer Tina Turner 
("What's Love Got To Do With It"), Stockard Channing, a first-time nominee, for 
her role as a New York society matron ("Six Degrees of Separation"); Emma 
Thompson, for her role as a lovelorn housekeeper ("The Remains of the Day") and 
Debra Winger, for the role of American poet Joy Gresham ("Shadowlands"). 
</P>
<P>
 Nominated in the race for best supporting actress were Winona Ryder ("The Age 
of Innocence"), Rosie Perez ("Fearless"), Anna Paquin ("The Piano") and double 
nominees Hunter ("The Firm") and Thompson ("In the Name of the Father"). 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Spielberg, the nominees for best director included Jane Campion 
("The Piano"), Robert Altman ("Short Cuts"), James Ivory ("The Remains of the 
Day") and Irish director Jim Sheridan ("In the Name of the Father"). 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremonies were held at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, a day after a 
5.3-magnitude aftershock from the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake rumbled under 
Los Angeles.

 AND THE OSCAR WENT TO: The eyes of the world may have been on Hollywood on 
Monday night, but the Valley didn't come up empty-handed at this year's Academy 
Awards. Technical Oscars were awarded three weeks ago to Tarzana-based 
Panavision, for camera lens development, and to Manfred G. Michelson, president 
of Chatsworth-based Technical Film Systems, for a souped-up film processor. . . 
. Reached in his car Monday afternoon, Michelson said he was "delighted" at the 
honor. "What else can I say?" he chuckled.

 POST-SHOCK BLUES: For most, Sunday's 5.3 aftershock caused little more than a 
temporary case of frayed nerves. For others, the effects were more permanent -- 
and heartbreaking (B1). . . . "Now I'm homeless," said 85-year-old Mary Bond 
after a city crew flattened the Studio City home she'd built with her late 
husband. "Otherwise, I'm doing OK." 
</P>
<P>
 NOT-SO-GOLDEN STATE: Business is booming for Valley companies like the 
Cheesecake Factory, International House of Pancakes, Superior Industries and 
Players International, but don't expect the local economy to rebound any time 
soon. Thanks to restaurants, factories and casinos operated out of state, the 
businesses are reporting record profits everywhere but here. "Southern 
California is the only region where we're negative in sales," said IHOP's Fred 
Silney. . . . Still, most say they haven't given up on California -- yet.

 QUAKE-UP CALL: Residents with earthquake insurance got a jolt of another kind 
Monday -- this time from the insurance industry. Quake victims faced the 
possibility of having to meet their deductible all over again if damage caused 
by Sunday's temblor is classified as a separate incident (D1). . . . In 
addition, many of the largest insurers, including Woodland Hills-based 20th 
Century Insurance Co., suspended writing new policies in the area for up to 30 
days.

 ARMY OF LOVE: It began in 1991 as a kind of therapy -- a group of veteran 
comedians gathering to lift the spirits of actor Dick Yarmy, who was dying of 
lung cancer. Nicknamed Yarmy's Army, the gang would assemble once a week at a 
Sherman Oaks restaurant to cheer up their ailing friend (E1). But while Yarmy 
lost his battle with the disease nearly two years ago, the Army marches on. . . 
. "We realized we could not let go," said comedian Harvey Korman. "We had to 
keep meeting. It was no longer just for Dick." David E. Brady

 MELLOW MUSIC: Snoop Doggy Dogg may never get to lay down his rap at Thousand 
Oak's new Civic Arts Plaza. Heavy metal rockers could be banned as well. . . . 
Wary of attracting rowdy crowds, the city's theater commission on Wednesday 
will consider prohibiting rap and heavy metal concerts at the cultural center 
(B4). . . . Alternative music fans wonder why the fuss? "There are problems 
everywhere and I don't think music has anything to do with it," said Zorba 
Cruz, a guitarist with the local rock group Ska Daddyz.

 SOAP STAR: Emmy-winning actor Macdonald Carey, who died Monday of cancer

had a tremendous record of service to the elderly, " said Sister Jane Kelly 
with Caregivers Inc., which honored Carey last month. "He was a real talent and 
a good man." The actor, best-known for his role on "Days of Our Lives,"

 FLOWN HOME: Three endangered California condors, captured near Fillmore and 
relocated to Santa Barbara's backcountry, have returned to Ventura County (B1). 
. . . The vultures were raised in captivity and released into the Sespe Condor 
Sanctuary near Fillmore. But after the death of four condors, the birds were 
relocated to a remote area of the Los Padres National Forest. . . . Biologists 
will monitor the birds, and hope they return on their own to the Santa Barbara 
wilderness. "The ideal situation is they'll get hungry enough and go back to 
where they know food is," said Michael Wallace, an L.A. Zoo biologist and 
California Condor Recovery Team member.

WILSON TALKS WITH RAPIST PROTESTERS; PAROLE: DELEGATION FROM MODOC COUNTY MEETS 
WITH GOVERNOR OVER PLACEMENT OF SEX OFFENDER IN THEIR AREA. HE SAYS HE DID NOT 
CHOOSE THE LOCATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson sought Monday to soothe angry feelings of residents of Modoc 
County, where officials shipped a paroled rapist because of its location in the 
state's isolated northeast corner. 
</P>
<P>
 At first saying he would not meet with a Modoc County delegation that traveled 
to the capital, Wilson later invited the group into his office to hear them 
out. The group consisted of law enforcement, county and school officials and a 
contingent of high school girls. 
</P>
<P>
 The effects of Wilson's efforts to explain why ex-convict Melvin A. Carter was 
transferred to Modoc County after his release were not known. The Modoc group 
remained temporarily unavailable to reporters as they continued discussions 
with officials of the Department of Corrections, the agency that picked 
Carter's destination. 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to meeting with the delegation, the governor, in his first extended 
comments on the case since Carter's release, stood by the decision, noting that 
nowhere in California would such an infamous criminal be welcomed. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter, 49, who was convicted of raping 12 women and confessed to dozens more, 
was paroled Thursday after serving half of a 25-year prison sentence. He is 
housed at the Devil's Garden Conservation Camp, a state minimum security 
facility outside Alturas, the Modoc County seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, asked if the meeting between the Modoc County residents and 
corrections officials would result in Carter's transfer to another part of the 
state, replied at his news conference: "I would greatly doubt it." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Modoc County residents have aimed their anger Wilson's way, the 
governor said he did not target their county as the place to put Carter. Wilson 
said he only told the Corrections Department not to put Carter in a "densely 
populated" urban area. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't give them a specific instruction as to where," Wilson said. "I set 
up the kind of circumstances I thought would provide maximum protection. The 
department found this particular location." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also dismissed a report that one of Carter's victims now lives in Modoc 
County, not far from the state-run work camp where the onetime engineer has 
been placed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a man who claims he raped a hundred women, and they are probably all 
over the state," Wilson said. "We don't know where they are. We have to put him 
somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Modoc County Dist. Atty. Ruth Sorensen said the woman contacted her Friday 
through a mutual friend. Sorensen said the woman was a student at Cal State 
Hayward 16 years ago when a man broke into her home and raped her. 
</P>
<P>
 "She moved to Modoc County in hopes of finding peace of mind, feeling safe," 
Sorensen said. "She married. She'd managed to put things back together, then 
heard about this." 
</P>
<P>
 Tip Kindel, a spokesman for the Corrections Department, said his office needs 
to hear directly from the victim. "This took the department completely by 
surprise," Kindel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sorensen said the woman, whose name was not released, is sending a statement 
to the department. With the state rejecting the county's more general pleas, 
the prosecutor said the victim's complaint may be the last opportunity to have 
Carter sent elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Sorensen obtained a Modoc County Superior Court order barring 
Carter's release in the region. Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren quickly sought to 
invalidate the order, and Friday won a temporary stay of its enforcement from 
the 3rd District Court of Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Sorensen filed a reply, asserting that corrections officials had 
violated state law by failing to make written findings for sending Carter to 
Modoc and failed to provide local authorities with notice of his parole.

CLINTON'S NORTHWEST FOREST PLAN DRAFTED ILLEGALLY, JUDGE RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A team of scientists formed to prepare the Northwest forest plan for the 
Clinton Administration violated open meeting laws, a federal judge ruled 
Monday. But the judge stopped short of declaring the entire proposal illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ruled that the team appointed a 
year ago by President Clinton to develop the plan "was convened and did its 
work in violation of" the Federal Advisory Committee Act. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson also found that the makeup of the team "at least suggests . . . that 
the vast majority of (the team members) were pro-ecosystem management, having 
minimal sympathy for the forest products industry." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the judge did not grant the timber industry's request for an 
injunction prohibiting the Administration from implementing the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan calls for dramatic cutbacks in the logging levels of the 1980s and is 
scheduled to be presented to another federal judge in Seattle next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry lawyers said they expect the ruling will have the effect of forcing 
the panel to start over in developing a management plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is inconceivable to us that the President could adopt a plan that has been 
ruled illegal," said Ralph Saperstein, vice president of the Northwest Forestry 
Assn. in Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
 Interior Department spokesman Kevin Sweeney disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson's decision to not grant the request for an injunction "is an 
indication we can move forward. He acknowledges the good faith effort we have 
made in bringing good science to bear in trying to move forward and end the 
gridlock," Sweeney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Department lawyers had argued the team of scientists was made up 
largely of government workers and not subject to the law. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling further complicates Clinton's attempt to walk a fine line in 
resuming some logging on national forests in the Northwest while complying with 
environmental laws protecting the northern spotted owl, a threatened species. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration is scheduled to present its plan to U.S. District Judge 
William Dwyer in Seattle next month in an attempt to resume some logging.

CRIME RATE FALLS 9.1% IN COUNTY, HITS 15-YEAR LOW; STATISTICS: A DRAMATIC 13.7% 
DROP IN OXNARD, THE LARGEST AND MOST DANGEROUS CITY, PLAYS A ROLE IN THE 
OVERALL DECLINE, OFFICIALS SAY. 
</P>

<P>
 Crime in Ventura County fell by 9.1% in 1993, to a rate of 38.3 serious crimes 
per 1,000 residents -- the lowest in at least 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The rate was driven downward by a dramatic 13.7% drop in crime in Oxnard -- 
the county's largest and usually its most crime-ridden city -- and by 
double-digit percentage drops in crime in Port Hueneme, Fillmore and Simi 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County still enjoys one of the lowest crime rates for an urban area in 
the United States, but the statistics released by its law enforcement agencies 
show that the county grew even safer overall in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The 9.1% decrease in serious crimes countywide followed an increase in crime 
of 15.9% from January, 1990, to December, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Violent crime fell by 3.4% countywide, the first time since 1989 that Ventura 
County has enjoyed a decline in the number of homicides, rapes, robberies and 
aggravated assaults. The rate had actually increased by 27.1% from 1990 to 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 And property crimes fell off by 9.8% in 1993, after increasing by 14.4% during 
the previous three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Law officers across the county took some credit for the property crime 
decrease, saying they arrested more drug suspects than ever before, cleaning 
the streets of people who often steal. 
</P>
<P>
 Undersheriff Richard Bryce said deputies made 390 more drug arrests last year 
than in 1992 in the unincorporated areas of Ventura County and in the five 
cities that his department covers -- Camarillo, Fillmore, Moorpark, Ojai and 
Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The drug arrests and more cooperation from the public have helped cut property 
crime, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet while crime decreased overall countywide, the contract cities and 
unincorporated areas protected by the Sheriff's Department suffered a 4.9% 
increase in violent crimes in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 That was not as steep as the 15% increase in violent crimes in those areas 
reported to the sheriff in 1992, but it is "a great concern," Bryce said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just think we're becoming more of a violent society and acting out our 
frustrations," he said. "You especially see that in the home." 
</P>
<P>
 Seven out of 10 violent crimes reported to the Sheriff's Department were 
aggravated assaults, nearly one in four springing out of domestic disturbances, 
he said. In one out of 12 aggravated assaults, a deputy sheriff was the victim, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Taken as a whole, however, the 3.4% decrease in violent crimes across Ventura 
County was a welcome turnaround from an 8.5% increase reported in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Port Hueneme enjoyed the steepest decrease of serious crime of any Ventura 
County city, dropping 21.2% in 1993, followed by Fillmore with a 20% decrease 
and Simi Valley, where crime fell by 18.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Port Hueneme residents and businesses reported 36.4% fewer burglaries and 
26.4% fewer thefts in 1993 than the previous year, according to statistics the 
city reports each year to the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 Port Hueneme may also have fared better than usual in its number of property 
crimes because a rash of residential burglaries that traditionally afflicts 
people at Christmastime failed to develop, Port Hueneme Police Chief John 
Hopkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't have that until after the first of the year this year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore residents also reported less property stolen in 1993, with a decrease 
of 22.2% in burglaries and 24.1% fewer thefts. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet one of the most dramatic turnarounds occurred in Oxnard, where crime 
decreased by 13.7% in 1993 -- the lowest crime rate in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard remains the most violent city in Ventura County. While 21% of Ventura 
County residents live there, 43% of all violent crimes are committed there. 
</P>
<P>
 But that trend may be reversing. Just two years ago, 47% of the violent crimes 
in Ventura County were committed in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 There were 1,446 violent crimes reported in Oxnard in 1993 -- a drop of 180 
from the previous year -- and 7,244 property crimes, a decrease of 1,194 from 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's been a lot of hard work by the officers on the street, as 
well as support from neighborhood patrols and Neighborhood Watch groups," 
Oxnard Police Chief Harold Hurtt said. "You've got to count on a little luck, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Paula, however, violent crimes reached a six-year high in 1993. The 
crime rate there swelled to the highest in the county -- 59.5 crimes per 1,000 
Santa Paula residents, compared with 58.1 per 1,000 Oxnard residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of robberies in Santa Paula increased 24% to 223 in 1993, and 
assaults jumped 47% to 149. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Moorpark, with a population of 26,700, enjoyed the lowest crime 
rate in Ventura County -- 19.4 crimes per 1,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark, Camarillo, Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks remained the county's 
safest cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley had only 28.1 serious crimes per 1,000 residents, while Thousand 
Oaks had 29.9 per 1,000. The statistics promise to keep the two cities among 
the safest in the United States with populations of more than 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Both rates were better than the lowest crime rate recorded last year by the 
FBI -- 30 crimes per 1,000 in Amherst Town, a suburb of Buffalo, N. Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley's violent crime rate remained about the same, but it reported 
19.6% fewer property crimes than in 1992, due in large part to more police 
work, Capt. Jerry Boyce said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing we've done differently is we've doubled the size of our 
Special Enforcement Detail (to six)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura, violent crimes decreased markedly, from 453 in 1992 to 396 last 
year -- with almost all of the drop occurring in robbery, which dropped from 
186 to 139. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they are encouraged by the decrease, but they noted that crime 
patterns fluctuate from year to year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things go down and things go up," said Sgt. Bob Anderson, supervisor of the 
Ventura Police Department's major crimes unit. "I don't know if you can count 
on any particular reason or credit any particular effort." VENTURA COUNTY CRIME

3 RELOCATED CALIFORNIA CONDORS FLY BACK HOME; WILDLIFE: ENDANGERED BIRDS RETURN 
TO SESPE SANCTUARY. THEY HAD BEEN MOVED TO SANTA BARBARA BACKCOUNTRY IN THE 
FALL FOR SAFETY REASONS.

 Three endangered California condors that were captured in the Sespe Condor 
Sanctuary near Fillmore last fall and relocated to a remote area in the rugged 
hills above Santa Barbara have flown home, wildlife officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists hope that the wandering birds will be unable to find food in the 
Sespe and return to the Santa Barbara backcountry. But if they do not, the 
troublesome vultures could be moved again or captured and kept as breeding 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
 "They stayed over there for quite a long time," said Robert Mesta, condor 
project coordinator for the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service. "It was last week 
that they moved back. They have a tendency to wander." 
</P>
<P>
 The renegade female birds were born at the Los Angeles Zoo and released into 
the Sespe Condor Sanctuary in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 They are three of four condors moved to a distant ridge along Lion Canyon in 
Los Padres National Forest in the fall when scientists decided that the Sespe 
site had become too hazardous. 
</P>
<P>
 Three condors were killed in recent years after colliding with power lines, 
and another died in 1992 after drinking antifreeze near Pyramid Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Wallace, biologist curator of birds at the Los Angeles Zoo and a 
member of the California Condor Recovery Team, said a group of scientists met 
in Los Angeles last week to discuss the wayward birds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to wait and see what they're going to do," Wallace said. "The 
ideal situation is they'll get hungry enough and go back to where they know 
food is, in Lion Canyon." 
</P>
<P>
 But "if they're not going to behave, then they'll be brought back into 
captivity," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the nine condors now in the wild, the oldest, Xewe, stayed in Lion Canyon 
with a group of five young birds released there in November. Wildlife experts 
are concerned that the three wandering vultures could lead the younger birds to 
the Sespe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having them come to the Sespe is not the problem, but we don't want them 
escorting younger birds over there," Mesta said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace said biologists think that the older birds may be reluctant to leave 
their original home. 
</P>
<P>
 "That tie is so strong that they may refuse to go back," he said. "We're 
watching their behavior very carefully. We don't know if what they're doing is 
normal behavior or not." 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace said signs of refusal to fly or "moping around" might indicate the 
reluctance of the birds to return to Lion Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 If the condors do not return on their own, scientists will move the birds back 
to Santa Barbara County or capture them for use as breeding stock at the Los 
Angeles or San Diego zoos. 
</P>
<P>
 Biologists decided to give the condors until the end of the week before taking 
any action. They believe that the condors left Lion Canyon around March 12 or 
13. 
</P>
<P>
 "They fed on either Saturday or Sunday morning, did a pit stop on Monday at 
Madulce peak," which is near Pine Mountain north of Ojai, Wallace said. "By 
Tuesday, they were back at the ridge along the Sespe where they were originally 
released -- their original home." 
</P>
<P>
 The condors had taken a few exploratory flights in recent months, Wallace 
said, adding that it was not surprising that the birds had found their way back 
to the Sespe. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'd made some tentative flights to the north . . . made a flight to the 
south. They were exploring the wilderness area," he said. "Then they got wind 
of or sight of the Sespe area. Hopefully, they will be able to fly back."

JUDGE BACKS OJAI VALLEY GOLF RESORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge Monday refused to stop development of an exclusive Ojai 
Valley golf resort, ruling that the private links would use far less drinking 
water than the landowner has available. 
</P>
<P>
 After final arguments that stretched over three court days, Judge William A. 
Peck decided against the Environmental Coalition of Ventura County, which 
argued that allowing the Farmont Corp. to develop the site would violate county 
water laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Peck said Farmont, which owns 2,000 acres on the hillside, could legally use 
five times the amount of water a golf course needs if it opted instead to plant 
citrus groves on the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, the land has used 407 acre-feet of water a year, but the company 
has water rights of up to 2,000 acre-feet each year. 
</P>
<P>
 The golf course, however, would need only 236 acre-feet annually, and 
conditions in its approval limit the water usage to the 407 acre-foot average, 
Peck said in explaining his ruling. An acre-foot of water is 326,000 gallons, 
roughly the amount a family of four uses in a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "To deny a project which uses less water than its present (land) use because 
of an ordinance enacted to save water seems to me to make no sense," the judge 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition sued last year after the County Board of Supervisors refused to 
overturn the county Planning Commission's unanimous approval of the resort, a 
200-acre private club nestled in the foothills along California 150. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit claimed that Farmont was wrongly given permission to use domestic 
water to irrigate the golf course until 2001, instead of using reclaimed or 
treated sewer water as called for in the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 But staff planners recommended that the golf course be allowed because Farmont 
made numerous concessions and mitigations, including an agreement to supply up 
to 200 acre-feet of reclaimed water for irrigation by 2001. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The developers also agreed to give up water rights to more than 1,500 
acre-feet annually and to set aside 1,650 acres of its land as permanent open 
space. 
</P>
<P>
 But coalition members said the water policy -- adopted in 1990 at the height 
of the drought to prioritize water uses -- requires that golf courses use 
reclaimed water to irrigate the tees, greens and fairways. 
</P>
<P>
 Peck said the law states that golf courses must use reclaimed water for 
irrigation. But he ruled that the intent of the policy is to save water, which 
he said the Farmont project would do. 
</P>
<P>
 In making his ruling, however, Peck urged county planners to draft a more 
flexible water policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is torture," he said. "It's taken me a while to work my way through it. 
That's why I'm telling the county: Please amend this ordinance." 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsay F. Nielson, the attorney representing the Farmont Corp., said that 
even if Peck had sided with the coalition, the project would still move 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "The worst case would have been to redraft the (water) ordinance," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nielson said he was confident that the judge would support the project because 
it saves water and permanently sets aside a vast stretch of hillside. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Planning Commission, the Board of Supervisors and now a trial court all 
say (Farmont) is copacetic," said Nielson, adding that the course could open by 
late next year or early 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Philip A. Seymour, who represents the environmentalists, said he 
would recommend that his clients appeal the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we would prevail on appeal, but it's a matter of cost and 
priorities," he said outside court. "The language of the policy is very 
explicit." 
</P>
<P>
 Seymour also lost his argument that a 19,000-square-foot clubhouse should not 
be allowed on the site. He said that it is too big and that it will create 
traffic and noise problems not allowed under the open-space zoning, but Peck 
disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of what goes on at a golf course is what happens before and after the 
game," Peck said. "I don't think anyone can build a golf course without 
expecting all the amenities." 
</P>
<P>
 Neil Moyer, president of the environmental coalition, said his group would 
probably file an appeal, which must be done within 60 days.

ANNEXATION OF CABRILLO VILLAGE IS BACKED; VENTURA: THE UNANIMOUS COUNCIL VOTE 
WILL START PROCEEDINGS TO BRING THE 32-ACRE COMMUNITY WITHIN THE CITY'S 
BOUNDARIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PEGGY Y. LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura City Council on Monday gave initial approval to annexing Cabrillo 
Village, a neighborhood of about 1,000 residents on Ventura's east end. 
</P>
<P>
 The 32-acre community, which began in the 1930s as a farm laborers camp, is 
just west of Saticoy Avenue, between the Santa Clara River and the Southern 
Pacific railroad tracks. City leaders want to annex Cabrillo Village to reduce 
confusion in providing police protection for the area, an unincorporated island 
surrounded by the city of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were already going out there on a lot of emergency calls," Councilman 
Gregory L. Carson said before the meeting. "It's something we have to do." 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted unanimously to initiate annexation at the request of the 
Local Agency Formation Commission, a state-sponsored county panel that oversees 
changes in boundaries for cities. LAFCO said Cabrillo Village needs to become 
part of the city so that Ventura's boundaries do not gerrymander around the 
area, which already receives many city services. 
</P>
<P>
 Hal Slade, housing administrator for Cabrillo Village, said he thinks that the 
annexation will make little difference to daily life in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't been pushing for it," Slade said. "It's more of a map maker's game 
than anything." 
</P>
<P>
 The city has been providing the village with water, sewer, trash services and 
fire protection for several years. The biggest change that will occur from the 
annexation is the change in law enforcement service: Instead of Ventura County 
sheriff's deputies, Ventura police officers will be responsible for the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents in the small community said the impending annexation has created 
some tension between older and younger residents. Parents and older residents 
say they want to become residents of the city because they will receive more 
police protection. 
</P>
<P>
 Some youths say the increased police presence will mean confrontations with 
cops. Many are unhappy about an announcement by police that they will enforce a 
10 p.m. curfew for juveniles -- the same curfew in effect for minors throughout 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
 But some residents say they welcome the change. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be helpful in regard to the gangs," said one resident, who asked not 
to be identified. "The sheriff's deputies come, but they don't come very 
often." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies and Ventura police say they do not consider the area a major crime 
problem. Residents, however, say there has been increased gang activity in the 
low-income neighborhood since the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 youths in Cabrillo Village call themselves a gang, known as the 
Cabrillo Campers. The gang has an ongoing rivalry with Ventura Avenue 
Gangsters. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Martinez, who is not in the gang, said the Campers are not very violent, 
and most of the neighborhood's trouble stems from other gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mostly people come here from outside," he said. "Sometimes they'll come in 
and flash their signs." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura police said residents should see more law enforcement in the area 
because the department patrols a smaller area than sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials do not expect Cabrillo residents to be affected in any major 
way because of the annexation. Residents would continue to maintain their own 
streets, and any new construction would be subject to city codes, said Karen 
Bates, associate city planner. 
</P>
<P>
 The 154 apartments and houses in the village are owned by the first 
cooperative housing association formed in Ventura County. The association is 
run by a seven-member board elected by residents for two-year terms. Residents 
pay the association $220 to $450 in monthly rent. 
</P>
<P>
 The annexation is expected to be approved by LAFCO later this spring and given 
final council approval as early as May. 
</P>
<P>
 * NO CHANGE

boundaries to include the Ventura Avenue neighborhood. B2

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: ROCK CLIMBER KILLED TRYING TO SCALE CLIFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Taft man died in a rock-climbing accident in the Los Padres National Forest 
Monday after he fell while trying to scale a 250-foot-high cliff, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Sheriff Department's search-and-rescue unit later 
successfully plucked the victim's brother from the same cliff where he 
apparently was stranded, said Lt. Mike Gullon.The identities of the two Taft 
residents were not available late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a preliminary account, the two men -- both believed to be in 
their 20s -- were attempting to climb the Sespe Wall, a sheer, 250-foot 
precipice in the Sespe Gorge, an isolated area that is popular with rock 
climbers. 
</P>
<P>
 One brother nearly made it to the top of the cliff before he fell, Gullon 
said. Sheriff's deputies were summoned to the gorge shortly after 4 p.m., when 
they received a report of an unconscious fall victim. 
</P>
<P>
 After the accident, the victim's brother remained 135 feet up the side of the 
cliff, until rescuers reached him with the aid of a helicopter, Gullon said.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; FOES OF RADAR TOWER SEEK TO HALT JUDGMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of Ojai residents intent on moving a 98-foot radar tower from atop 
Sulphur Mountain said Monday that they have filed papers urging a federal judge 
not to issue a summary judgment in their case against the National Weather 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Actor Larry Hagman, resident David Hedman and the Environmental Coalition of 
Ojai sued the government in early January, claiming that it had not done 
adequate health studies before erecting the weather-tracking station on Sulphur 
Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 But a federal judge in January refused to grant an injunction to stop the 
project, and the U. S. attorney's office subsequently filed a motion urging 
Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr. to issue a summary judgment in the government's 
favor. 
</P>
<P>
 Enclosed in the motion opposing summary judgment are declarations from Ventura 
County Supervisors Maggie Kildee and Susan K. Lacey, who said the Weather 
Service misled them when it notified the county about the tower. 
</P>
<P>
 But Assistant U. S. Atty. Donna Everett said the supervisors' declarations are 
"not relevant to this case." 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing is scheduled April 4 in federal court to hear arguments for and 
against the summary judgment. JEFF McDONALD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: BLUE LIQUID IN DITCH BELIEVED TO BE DYE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After initial concern that 500 gallons of blue liquid found standing in a 
drainage ditch south of Oxnard might be toxic industrial waste, authorities 
said Monday that they believe it is a type of dye used to color flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 A state agriculture employee alerted the hazardous materials unit of the 
Ventura County Fire Department at 10:30 a.m. after stumbling across the spill 
in a ditch by Nauman and Dufau roads, a department spokeswoman said.The liquid 
formed a pool 12 inches deep and a quarter of a mile long. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fire Department's hazardous materials team suited up in protective gear 
and used a long-handled probe to test the liquid before determining that it was 
harmless. 
</P>
<P>
 Because trace amounts of copper were found in the liquid, investigators also 
believed that it might be a nontoxic fertilizer, said Steve Mattren, a Ventura 
County environmental health specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 But after talking with area farmers, Mattren said he believes that the 
water-soluble substance is a dye used in the flower processing industry. No 
toxic gases were discovered and no evacuations were ordered, he said. PATRICK

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; COUNCIL TURNS DOWN DOWNTOWN EXPANSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura City Council on Monday rejected a proposal to stretch the city's 
downtown boundaries to include the Ventura Avenue neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 5-2 vote, the council decided to maintain the city's downtown boundaries 
and allocate 400 more housing units to the city's old commercial center. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Rosa Lee Measures and Jim Monahan opposed the measure. They 
had instead endorsed a plan to expand the city's downtown more than 20 blocks, 
from West Park Row Avenue to Delaware Drive. That plan would have siphoned off 
some housing allocations from downtown to the Avenue area to help developers 
who want to build a 330-townhouse project in the city's old industrial sector. 
</P>
<P>
 But a majority of the council pushed for keeping allocations in the downtown 
area, which city leaders want to revitalize. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to make a commitment," Councilman Gregory L. Carson said. "Downtown 
needs to be a priority." 
</P>
<P>
 Pro-growth council members who backed the proposal argued that no developers 
have stepped forward in the last year to apply for the downtown allocations and 
that the boundaries of what is considered the city's downtown should be 
expanded to benefit other developments. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're retarding our progress by withholding some allocations," Measures said. 
</P>
<P>
 Measures and Monahan said they were in favor of expanding the boundaries 
because it would help fast-track a development by the Neel and Huntsinger 
families of Ventura, who want to build townhouses and offices in the upper 
Avenue neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Gary Tuttle said the council could decide to fast-track the 
project without dipping into allocations set aside for housing downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 The council last year set aside 500 allocations for downtown housing on a 
first-come, first-served basis to developers, hoping to encourage development 
in the city's old commercial center. 
</P>
<P>
 But few developers have shown interest in building downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 Now other developers, including the Neels and Huntsingers, would like part of 
those downtown allocations to be used in areas outside the traditional downtown 
boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 The council has 2,128 housing allocations to dole out in the next six years. A 
developer is not allowed to build without receiving housing allocations from 
the council first. PEGGY Y. LEE

facilities at the Camarillo-based chapter of the Assn. for Retarded Citizens, 
any and all financial help is welcomed. 
</P>
<P>
 Gatewood, a spokesman for the group, said that he and other public service 
agency representatives will ask the Camarillo City Council on Wednesday for a 
share of an estimated $400,000 in federal community development block grant 
money provided to the city each year. 
</P>
<P>
 The association has been at its current location since 1968, and buildings are 
in need of repair, expansion and renovation, Gatewood said. Additionally, he 
said new sewer lines and an irrigation system are needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to get to the most critical needs first, like renovating the 
bathrooms and the heating and water systems," Gatewood said. "Overall, we're 
looking at what will be a $220,000 project." 
</P>
<P>
 Gatewood said the association, which is asking the city for $9,900 in funding, 
now provides services to 160 people, including about 30 Camarillo residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo City Manager Bill Little said the council never has a problem 
finding takers for the federal grant money. "It's the same every year, we 
always have more requests than money," Little said. "The council and the staff 
usually give first priority to Camarillo-based organizations and then work from 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Little added that this will be the second time this year that the council has 
dealt with the distribution of the government grants. The council voted in 
January to pledge all of its grant funding to earthquake relief efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Little said the council will choose from among 17 agencies that have filed 
requests for the federal money. Some of those 17 groups include the Salvation 
Army, county senior nutrition programs, the county's Fair Housing Council and 
Interface Children and Family Services. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will meet Wednesday at 5 p.m. at City Hall, 601 Carmen Drive. J.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; PLANNER WILL HEAR AHMANSON REQUEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A request from developers of the Ahmanson Ranch housing project to extend 
Thousand Oaks Boulevard from Los Angeles County 1,000 feet to the Ventura 
County line will be the subject of a hearing before a Los Angeles County 
planning official today. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ahmanson Land Co. wants to extend Thousand Oaks Boulevard from Mountain 
Gate Drive in Los Angeles County across the Ventura County line, which would 
also require a permit to remove nine oak trees. 
</P>
<P>
 The extension would be one of two main entrances into the development, which 
calls for 3,050 dwellings, two golf courses and 400,000 square feet of 
commercial space to be built in the rolling hills southeast of Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ahmanson project, approved by the Ventura County Board of Supervisors in 
December, 1992, has been stalled because of lawsuits filed by Los Angeles 
County and others who would be affected by traffic created by the project. 
</P>
<P>
 A Ventura County judge, however, earlier this month upheld the Board of 
Supervisors' decision to approve the project and ruled that the development's 
environmental impact report met all state guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Los Angeles County planning officials want to use the issue of the 
roadway extension to try to force Ahmanson Land Co. to pay for major traffic 
improvements in the area -- beyond what the developer has proposed -- that 
could run as high as $18 million, Ahmanson officials charge. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to us that the county of Los Angeles is asking too much," said 
Steven Weston, Ahmanson's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Weston said there is also a dispute among different jurisdictions as to 
whether Thousand Oaks Boulevard should be widened in Los Angeles County. 
Officials from the city of Calabasas and Los Angeles County have already 
expressed concerns about how traffic from a major thoroughfare would affect 
their communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Regional Planning Hearing Officer Ray Rastic will preside over today's hearing 
regarding Ahmanson's request. If the developer's proposal is rejected, Ahmanson 
can appeal the decision to the Regional Planning Commission. CARLOS V. LOZANO

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: STORM EXPECTED TO HIT REGION BY END OF WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Morning drizzle expected today along the coast should give way to rain later 
this week as a cold front from the Gulf of Alaska moves into Southern 
California, forecasters said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm is expected to bring cooler temperatures and spring showers, leaving 
as much as .75 inch of rain along the coast, 1.5 inches inland and up to three 
inches in the mountains, said National Weather Service meteorologist Brad 
Fujii. 
</P>
<P>
 Fujii said the chance of rain is slight Thursday and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we should get wet by Saturday," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Temperatures in the upper 50s to low 60s on Thursday and Friday should drop 
into the low to mid-50s Saturday, said Curtis Brack, a meteorologist with 
WeatherData, which forecasts weather for The Times. But warm temperatures are 
expected to return after the weekend, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like after this little bout of rain, an upper-level ridge will keep 
things dry," Brack said. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters said air quality should be good this week because of the oncoming 
storm, but as April approaches, air quality could worsen, said Kent Field, a 
forecaster with the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're about done with the rain, and when we get high pressure in here it 
could mean ozone again," Field said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the smog season does not officially start until May 1, forecasters 
say unseasonably warm temperatures have caused increases in ozone levels. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ozone doesn't always follow the political rules," Field said. "We start 
watching when the weather patterns start changing and we're starting to get 
into spring weather." TRACY WILSON

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: COUNTY ISSUE RADAR TOWER OPERATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The National Weather Service recently completed building a 98-foot Doppler 
radar tower atop Sulphur Mountain. Nearby residents have already lost a lawsuit 
filed 
</P>
<P>
 against the government claiming that more studies should be completed before 
the tower becomes fully operational next month. Should the radar tower be 
allowed to operate? 
</P>
<P>
 * Tom Johnston 
</P>
<P>
 Private climatologist , Ventura  
</P>
<P>
 I would say yes, but it's not next to me, either. I don't have any expertise 
in the Doppler radar system, but I have some faith in the government that they 
have done enough study to assure the public that they are safe in urban areas. 
I've seen some of the pictures that come off them, and it's a very definite 
upgrade than what the National Weather Service has been using. The major 
objection to this radar system being installed is that the government is 
intruding on people's private domain. But I have known this was going up for at 
least a year or 18 months. They're going to do it anyway, regardless of what 
the community thought, because it's a good location. 
</P>
<P>
 * Larry Hagman 
</P>
<P>
 Actor, Ojai Valley resident, a plaintiff in federal suit  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It ought to be moved. It has no business there. There are plenty of places 
where it won't cause harm to populations. I think they're just using Sulphur 
Mountain because it's convenient. There are other places on federal land where 
it could be located. I don't want to be a test bunny. I don't want to feel like 
a rat. It was successfully defeated in New York in two different places. The 
weather service said they never had trouble like this before, but they were 
lying. They have, and it's costing millions in litigation. Why didn't they come 
to us before they moved it in? 
</P>
<P>
 * Alan Fox Oxnard resident, contract meteorologist  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The real question I have as a meteorologist is not whether it should be 
allowed to operate, but whether the radar should have been placed on Sulphur 
Mountain in the first place. At its location, 2,700 feet above sea level, the 
radar's ability to detect precipitation off the coast will be greatly reduced 
in typical winter storms for this area. I have read the reports that justify 
locating the radar on this mountain, and neither study adequately addresses the 
limitations in measuring rainfall from this site. It's a wonderful system. The 
only problem with this thing is that it's incorrectly situated. The NEXRAD 
system has capabilities far beyond any other radar system to date. It's a 
research-grade tool. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jerry McDuffie 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard area manager, National Weather Service  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I don't have any doubt about whether it should be allowed to operate. It 
should be allowed to and, as far as we're concerned, it will. The tests we 
conducted showed the radiation levels are well below the federal standards. In 
my opinion, there's no reason to fear anything from this radar. The benefits 
are going to be for all the people of Ventura County, Los Angeles County, Santa 
Barbara County and others. Since we really feel there's absolutely no health 
risk at all, it's going to provide a big benefit through possibly saving lives 
over the next several years. Last year, we lost 98 people to flash floods. If 
we can save one or two of them through this system, it's well worth it. It also 
will benefit the agricultural industry, the aviation people, the media as far 
as better forecasting and the public for better warnings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Elton Gallegly 
</P>
<P>
 Congressman, 23rd District * 
</P>
<P>
 No, not until we know that it poses no threat to health or safety. That's why 
I introduced legislation that would require the prestigious and completely 
independent National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study to answer once and 
for all the questions posed by the residents of Ojai. My bill would also 
prohibit the radar tower from being operated until the safety of the radar was 
completely assured. I am pleased that Sens. (Barbara) Boxer and (Dianne) 
Feinstein (D-Calif.) have joined me in supporting the people of Ojai, and I 
would urge them to introduce similar legislation in the Senate.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY, MOORPARK; HOME SALES INCREASE 24% FROM 
YEAR BEFORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Home sales in Simi Valley and Moorpark in February jumped 24% over the same 
month last year, an increase realtors said is a sign that the economy is well 
on its way to recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the Jan. 17 earthquake that caused major property damage in Simi 
Valley, residents are eager to buy before interest rates get too high, said 
Barbara Schebler, a member of the board of directors of the Simi 
Valley-Moorpark Assn. of Realtors, which released the figures. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, 102 homes and condominiums were sold in Simi Valley, Moorpark and the 
Santa Rosa Valley in February, up from 82 sold in February, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is definitely good news," Schebler said. "The earthquake disoriented 
people for a little while, but things picked right back up again." 
</P>
<P>
 The February total was 32.5% higher than the January sales total, Schebler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The average resale price of all property sold in Simi Valley over the last six 
months was $208,409, virtually unchanged from a year ago. In Moorpark and the 
Santa Rosa Valley, the six-month average was down 4.7% to $244,932. SARA

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; HEALTH AGENCY TO TEST 500 FOR VALLEY 
FEVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A team of physicians with the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention and local public health officials have begun testing Simi Valley 
residents for valley fever. 
</P>
<P>
 The CDC epidemiologists hope to test as many as 500 residents as part of a 
study aimed at determining how many people have come in contact with the 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, about 170 cases of valley fever have 
been reported in Ventura County and at least half of those have been in Simi 
Valley, public health officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley fever, clinically known as Coccidiodomycocis, is spread by a fungus 
found in the soil. Health experts have speculated that Ventura County residents 
inhaled fungus-laden dust that was kicked up by the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The CDC and Ventura County Health Department have notified about 300 randomly 
selected Simi Valley residents by mail, and planned to send out an additional 
200 letters Monday, CDC physician Rana Hajjeh said. 
</P>
<P>
 The letters request that residents make voluntary appointments at the public 
health office in Simi Valley to be tested for valley fever, Hajjeh said. 
</P>
<P>
 A skin test will determine if an individual has ever been infected with valley 
fever. Sixty percent of those who contract the illness develop no symptoms, 
which makes determining infection rates difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "It tells you if you've ever had valley fever before, even without knowing 
it," Hajjeh said. The people who have positive skin tests will be asked to take 
a blood test that will determine when they were infected. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need all age groups, but we definitely need more people between 10 and 
20," she said. "We also need people in their 40s and 60s." 
</P>
<P>
 Three physicians with the CDC and 10 to 20 nurses will conduct the tests 
throughout the week. The CDC expects to have initial results from the tests in 
a few weeks. TRACY WILSON

OFFICIALS TO CONSIDER BAN ON RAP; THOUSAND OAKS: PANEL WILL CONSIDER PLAN FOR 
NEW CIVIC ARTS PLAZA AUDITORIUM. PROMOTERS PREFER MORE GENTEEL ENTERTAINMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Leery of the booming, crashing music that attracts hordes of sometimes-rowdy 
teen-agers, Thousand Oaks theater commissioners Wednesday will consider banning 
heavy metal and rap concerts from the new Civic Arts Plaza auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 From head-banging rock to peppy rap, shows that draw mainly teen-age crowds 
require room for fans to jump around and rush the stage, city officials said. 
Furthermore, they added, the hip-hop dancing and wild screaming that often 
punctuate such shows do not belong in an elegant concert hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, talent promoters have proposed filling the Civic Arts Plaza's 
inaugural season with more genteel entertainment, such as the Conejo Symphony. 
For younger crowds, they might present magician David Copperfield or comic Bill 
Cosby. 
</P>
<P>
 Such shows would better suit the quiet suburban image of Thousand Oaks -- and 
better match the plush 1,800-seat auditorium, with its purple upholstered 
seats, matching carpeted aisles and glimmering gold curtain, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "To the horror of my 18-year-old," theater Commissioner Larry Janss said, "I 
do agree." 
</P>
<P>
 But some local musicians contend that city officials will be cutting out a 
segment of the Thousand Oaks population by banning certain sounds from the 
cultural center's auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of young adults who find Thousand Oaks an excellent place to 
live, but still like rock 'n' roll," said R. Scott Horn, a guitarist for the 
Newbury Park-based band Lizards of Wizdom. "A civic arts plaza should encourage 
all of a community's musical preferences." 
</P>
<P>
 As for his band, which blends elements of folk music with hard rock, Horn said 
the seven musicians are "chomping at the bit to play in the Civic Arts Plaza." 
</P>
<P>
 Lizards of Wizdom, like other local rock bands, would probably play in the 
adjacent 400-seat forum theater, rather than the 1,800-seat auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if commissioners agree to ban heavy metal and rap from the larger 
auditorium, they could still open the forum theater for local groups. 
</P>
<P>
 But that compromise wouldn't satisfy everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Itching for a little excitement in their safe suburb, several high school 
students said they crave big-name bands in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know they don't want to bring anarchy here," said Dustin Mackey, a 
sophomore at Thousand Oaks High School. "But those kind of concerts would show 
people where T. O. is." 
</P>
<P>
 For exactly that reason, Sheriff's Cmdr. Kathryn Kemp supports a ban on 
rough-edged concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 Rap shows have sporadically attracted violent youths at venues throughout 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 In this county, Ventura's now-defunct Mayfair Theatre experienced some trouble 
last year during punk shows and rave dance concerts. City officials closed the 
popular night spot in May after neighbors complained about raucous, disruptive 
crowds.

RESIDENTS AIR THEIR GRIPES AT COUNTY TRANSIT HEARING; GOVERNMENT: AN OFFICIAL 
SAYS THEIR CONCERNS WILL BE CONSIDERED IN DECIDING HOW TO SPEND $13 MILLION IN 
STATE FUNDS.

 When Metrolink train service was extended to Camarillo in February, Leisure 
Village resident Mimi Chuntz was ecstatic. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chuntz's enthusiasm was quickly squelched when she discovered that the 
trains only ran in the early morning and evening, not in the middle of the day 
when she needs to travel. 
</P>
<P>
 So on Monday, Chuntz took her concerns to the annual Ventura County hearing on 
unmet transit needs held at Camarillo City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "All these things are little minor problems, but they're big to us," Chuntz 
told the county's Transportation Policy Planning Committee, made up of elected 
officials from the county and each of its 10 cities. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 Ventura County residents packed the hearing to air their gripes 
about getting around, commenting on everything from seat belts to potholes to 
bus service. 
</P>
<P>
 But the hearing was more than just an exercise in letting off steam, said Mary 
Travis, spokeswoman for the Ventura County Transportation Commission. "We take 
these comments very seriously," she said. "Many good ideas come out of this." 
</P>
<P>
 The committee will compile residents' concerns and present them to the 
commission, which will consider them when figuring out how to spend more than 
$13 million in state transit funds for the next fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 Hearings over the past several years have prompted the commission to launch a 
new bus service linking cities throughout the county. The federally funded 
service, called the Ventura Intercity Transit Authority, or VISTA, is scheduled 
to begin in July. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It will replace Interconnect, the county's existing service. VISTA will 
consist of four new bus lines connecting cities in Ventura County and western 
Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people were unhappy with the bus service, so this is what we came up 
with to address that," Travis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bus service was just one of the concerns on the minds of residents who 
attended Monday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Saliba, executive director of the Ventura County Taxpayers Assn., 
appealed to the committee to divert transit revenue to pay for improvements to 
roads and highways instead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking for a bang for our buck, and that means spending as much as 
possible on roads and highways," Saliba said. "The savings will help everyone 
because it will not only help cars, but also will reduce wear and tear on 
buses." 
</P>
<P>
 But Nancy Smith, president of the Ventura County chapter of the National 
Federation for the Blind, said she was offended by Saliba's comments because 
they imply that people who take the bus don't pay taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most blind people do pay taxes," Smith said. "I think it's reasonable for 
blind people to have public transportation to get groceries." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Russ Smith, executive director of the Ventura Visitors and 
Convention Bureau, asked the committee to consider running a trolley service 
from the city's train station to the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be great for the city's appeal and great for getting to and from the 
train," Smith said. "Right now, unless you call a cab or have a friend come get 
you, you have to schlep your suitcase yourself." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 Residents who were unable to attend Monday's transit hearing but would like to 
make a comment, complaint or suggestion should call the Ventura County 
Transportation Commission at (800) 438-1112. Written comments should be sent to 
the commission at 950 Country Square Drive, Suite 207, Ventura 93003. The 
deadline for comments is March 31.

SIMI VALLEY LIBRARY REOPENS FOR FIRST TIME SINCE QUAKE; RECOVERY: WORK TO 
REPAIR SHATTERED WINDOWS AND RE-SHELVE BOOKS WILL CONTINUE FOR SEVERAL WEEKS. 
AUTOMATED CHECKOUT SYSTEM MAKES ITS DEBUT. 
</P>

<P>
 There were garbage bags over the windows and mounds of rubble piled by the 
door, but that didn't stop the reopening of the Simi Valley Library on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After two months of repair work and several delays, the library opened at noon 
sharp for the first time since the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The ongoing repairs include reinforcing patio pillars, replacing shattered 
windows and re-shelving more than 70,000 books that were shaken to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Repairs will continue for several more weeks, said Alan Langville, a manager 
with the Ventura County Library Services Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't want to delay the opening any longer," he said. "I think we'll be 
able to work around the patrons." 
</P>
<P>
 To help celebrate the reopening, the Rotary Club of Simi Sunrise presented the 
library with a $2,500 check to buy books. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will go for new books to be added to the branch's 140,000-volume 
collection, library supervisor Dale Redfield said. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance money will pay to replace the 1,500 books irreparably damaged in the 
Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a wish list and this is a big help," Redfield said. "We're getting a 
smattering of fiction, health, self-help and children's books." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks Library, also severely damaged in the quake, could be closed 
for at least two more weeks, Redfield said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're glad to be open now, so people from Thousand Oaks have a place to go 
until their library reopens," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the earthquake, the Simi Valley library's 65,000 card holders have had 
to make do with a tiny bus-like bookmobile parked outside. Many of them greeted 
the library's reopening with enthusiasm, waiting at the door to be among the 
first inside. 
</P>
<P>
 For Rena Morrissey, the reopening offered welcome relief. "I have two small 
children, so it's really hard to study," she said, cracking open a thick 
textbook on management. "It's so quiet here, it's great." 
</P>
<P>
 Five-year-old Chelsea Peterson ran to the children's section and immediately 
pulled two furry baby seal puppets over her hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the puppets," she said. "The bookmobile was too small to play." 
</P>
<P>
 Matthew Freeman, 4, quickly selected half a dozen storybooks. "I like to 
read," he said. His favorite story? 
</P>
<P>
 "David and Goliath, where the little man hits the big, bad man in the head and 
knocks him down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The library will hold a reopening celebration April 4, when it will extend its 
hours and formally present two newly installed automated checkout machines -- 
the first in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By then, the bugs should be worked out of the computerized system, allowing 
the library to extend its hours because fewer workers will be needed to check 
out books by hand, Langville said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to give ourselves a couple weeks to test it out before extending 
the hours and having the formal celebration," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Until April 4, library hours are noon to 8 p.m. Mondays and Tuesdays, 2 to 8 
p.m. Wednesdays and Thursdays, and 1 to 5 p.m. Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 New hours, scheduled to go into effect April 4, are 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Mondays 
through Thursdays and 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor Vicky Howard, on hand for the reopening, tested the new 
automated system to check out "Lasher," a novel by Anne Rice. 
</P>
<P>
 She placed her plastic library card on a slot at the base of the computer's 
screen and slid the book along a special track. Then, after a quiet clunk, a 
receipt slid out the side. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's that simple? Is that ever wonderful," Howard said, marveling at the ease 
of the procedure. "Now I only need one thing -- time to read the book."

PROSECUTORS SEEK DEATH PENALTY FOR CONVICTED MURDERER; CRIME: CHRISTOPHER JAMES 
SATTIEWHITE IS DESCRIBED AS A 'VICIOUS PREDATOR' IN THE FATAL SHOOTING OF 
GENOVEVA GONZALEZ IN 1992. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Imploring a jury to send an Oxnard man to the gas chamber, prosecutors 
described convicted murderer Christopher James Sattiewhite on Monday as a 
"vicious predator" who realized a childhood fantasy when he fatally shot a 
mother of four. 
</P>
<P>
 But defense attorneys pleaded for mercy, saying Sattiewhite is a former abused 
child who suffers from a lifelong brain defect that kept him from comprehending 
the consequences he would face for shooting 30-year-old Genoveva Gonzalez two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Pointing at an emotionless Sattiewhite, defense attorney Willard P. Wiksell 
begged the jury to spare the 24-year-old man's life. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is gone. He is done. He's finished," Wiksell said dramatically. "The only 
question is when does he die? Does he die in the gas chamber? Or in prison of 
old age?" 
</P>
<P>
 The daylong remarks from both sides brought to a close all but the jury's 
final verdict on the punishment for the defendant in Ventura County's first 
death-penalty trial in more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury convicted Sattiewhite last month of first-degree murder and special 
circumstances that require Sattiewhite's punishment to be either life in prison 
without parole or a date with the gas chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 Sattiewhite shot Gonzalez in the head three times Jan. 26, 1992, and left her 
body in a drainage ditch along Arnold Road in Oxnard. Prosecutors say the 
murder occurred after Sattiewhite inadvertently called out the name of a man 
who had raped and kidnaped the woman. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To send Sattiewhite to the gas chamber, the jury essentially must find that 
the circumstances of the crime -- including its severity and the defendant's 
criminal history -- outweigh factors favoring the prison sentence, such as the 
defendant's family history. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors were equally as passionate as the defense in their attempts to 
land a verdict of death. 
</P>
<P>
 Conceding that Sattiewhite suffers from "a mental impairment," Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Donald C. Glynn said the defendant can nevertheless understand right from 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 He argued that Sattiewhite has displayed extraordinary sophistication during 
his criminal career, which also includes convictions for rape, robbery and drug 
possession in cases unrelated to Gonzalez's murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Glynn, for instance, noted that Sattiewhite once bragged to a psychologist 
that he earned $600 to $900 a day selling drugs. "When you think about it, that 
takes a fair amount of savvy," Glynn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Glynn also said Sattiewhite chose to murder Gonzalez, but not to rape her -- 
an illustration of his ability to distinguish between two acts. Sattiewhite was 
convicted of aiding and abetting the rape of the woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Glynn discounted a defense contention that Sattiewhite was manipulated by two 
of his ex-associates -- Bobby Rollins and Frederick Jackson, both of Oxnard -- 
in both the Gonzalez murder and an earlier rape and robbery on an Oxnard beach. 
All three men were convicted in the beach case and are serving prison terms 
stemming from it. 
</P>
<P>
 While he never raped Gonzalez or the woman in the beach case, Sattiewhite 
"chose to be the enforcer," Glynn said. "He chose to be the guy with the gun." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Glynn referred to court testimony in which Sattiewhite allegedly told 
a psychologist that he has had fantasies of killing someone since he was a 
child just to see if he could get away with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "And now, Christopher Sattiewhite wants you to grant him mercy," Glynn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiksell accused Glynn and a co-prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Patricia A. 
Murphy, of appealing to the jury's sense of anger and vengeance with anti-crime 
rhetoric and misstatements. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the murder of Gonzalez was a terrible incident, but added that "there 
is no such thing as a nice murder." 
</P>
<P>
 He also said life in prison would not be lenient treatment for Sattiewhite. 
"All the king's horses and all the king's men are not going to save him from 
being punished," Wiksell said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added later: "He will never see another summertime out of prison." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wiksell noted that an autopsy showed that Gonzalez was unconscious when 
Sattiewhite pumped three bullets into her head, saying his client never 
tortured the woman. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said Gonzalez, a convicted drug trafficker, was a prostitute who put 
herself at risk by walking the streets and getting into cars with different 
men. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a case where somebody crawled through a window, grabbed a 
housewife and deliberately kidnaped and raped her," Wiksell argued. "If you 
play with fire, you're going to get burned." 
</P>
<P>
 Wiksell said Sattiewhite would never have killed had it not been for a brain 
defect caused by a car accident his mother had during her pregnancy with him. 
He said Sattiewhite now cannot write and believes that there are 84 weeks in a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has no judgment. He has no sense," Wiksell said. "Why does the D. A. want 
to make him (appear) smarter? Because they know it is morally wrong to execute 
someone who is retarded. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he never had a break, give him one now," he added. "Lock him up and throw 
away the key. Just don't kill him." 
</P>
<P>
 The jury will begin deliberating this morning.

INDICTMENT SAYS HARDING INVOLVED IN KERRIGAN PLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tonya Harding, who escaped a jail sentence in a plea bargain last week, was in 
on the plot to attack rival figure skater Nancy Kerrigan, a Portland grand jury 
concluded after more than two months of investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 An indictment issued Monday named Harding along with the four men who have 
admitted their roles in the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding was not charged in the indictment only because of her plea agreement, 
prosecutor Norm Frink said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three men who have admitted carrying out the attack -- Shawn Eckardt, Shane 
Stant and Derrick Smith -- were indicted. They pleaded innocent Monday to 
racketeering, conspiracy to commit assault, assault and unlawfully obtaining 
communications. 
</P>
<P>
 The indictment said the three agreed with each other, Harding and her 
ex-husband, Jeff Gillooly, "to unlawfully, intentionally and knowingly cause 
physical injury to Nancy Kerrigan by means of a dangerous weapon." 
</P>
<P>
 Grand jury foreman David Holt said he believed there was enough evidence to 
indict Harding for participation in the assault plot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like Mr. Frink said, there was a great deal of evidence pointing toward the 
fact that she was involved from the beginning or very close to the beginning," 
Holt said. "I think she would have been indicted on all counts." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he couldn't talk about any specific evidence but that virtually all 
the material the grand jury had was made public. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe she was so close to a lot of things that were going on that there's 
no way she could not have known," Holt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding has admitted helping to cover up the plot but denies having knowledge 
of the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 She pleaded guilty last week to conspiracy to hinder prosecution. In another 
plea bargain, Gillooly pleaded guilty Feb. 1 to one count of racketeering and 
is free pending sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 Eckardt also was indicted on charges of conspiracy to hinder prosecution and 
hindering prosecution. Smith also was charged with conspiracy to hinder 
prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 The communications charge stems from a secretly taped meeting involving those 
who participated in the conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for Smith and Stant met with prosecutors and Circuit Judge Phillip 
Abraham on Monday afternoon. Smith's attorney Clayton Lance said he was 
optimistic his client would reach a plea agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Eckardt and Smith were arrested Jan. 13. Stant surrendered to authorities in 
Arizona the next day. All three remain free on bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Eckardt, 26, is Harding's 310-pound would-be bodyguard and a friend of 
Gillooly's since childhood. He has admitted helping to plan the attack and 
contacting Smith to carry it out. 
</P>
<P>
 His attorney, Mark McKnight, said he expected the case to go to trial. He said 
Eckardt admits to conspiring to assault Kerrigan but is not guilty of 
racketeering. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is interesting that the person for whom all this was done received no jail 
and an enormous amount of money from a variety of sources," McKnight said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Eckardt "is now facing more jail time than any of the other 
players," McKnight said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if his client is being set up as the fall guy, McKnight said, "It's 
shaping up that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Stant, 22, is Smith's nephew and shares his uncle's interest in paramilitary 
activity. Stant went to Massachusetts to carry out the attack, but when that 
plan fell through he followed her to Detroit, where she was preparing for the 
U.S. championships. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 6, Stant struck Kerrigan above the right knee with a metal police 
baton, then escaped Cobo Arena by breaking through a plexiglass window of a 
locked door. With Kerrigan out of the competition because of injury, Harding 
won the U.S. title. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, 29, was the intermediary who funneled money from Gillooly and Eckardt 
to Stant and drove the getaway car. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prior to and certainly a short time after the attack I was numb," Smith said. 
"I felt remorse, just, 'What have I done?' I wish I could go back and live a 
few hours over, even to the point of something catastrophic happening to 
myself." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of Gillooly's plea agreement, prosecutors are recommending a two-year 
prison sentence and $100,000 fine. Under Oregon sentencing guidelines, 
Gillooly, who is free pending sentencing, would serve 19 months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding spent the weekend in central Oregon on a ski trip. Despite her 
reported financial troubles because of her plea agreement and what must be huge 
attorneys' fees, she was shopping for ski equipment on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Stant and Smith have established a telephone "900" number that a person can 
call and hear them talk about the case. Smith said the information would be 
about Harding's involvement.

 One of European women's most revealing secrets will soon be shared with 
Americans.The tempest in a B cup is over the Wonderbra, a feat of fashion 
engineering that creates cleavage where none existed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I swear even I can get cleavage with them," Kate Moss, the model who embodies 
the curveless waif look, said in Vanity Fair. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wonderbra has been made and sold in Britain for more than 30 years. Now 
Sara Lee Intimates, makers of the Playtex "cross-your-heart" bra, will start 
selling it in the United States on May 1.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; RATES CLIMB, DOW OFF AS FED MEETING NEARS

<P>
 Stocks fell and interest rates rose Monday as the markets braced for the 
possibility of another credit-tightening move by the Federal Reserve Board. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrials fell 30.80 points to 3,864.85, reversing Friday's 
30.51-point gain. But trading was slow. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds rose to 6.96% from 
Friday's 6.90%, and short-term rates also jumped. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed's policy-making committee meets today, and many analysts believe the 
central bank will decide to raise short-term interest rates another quarter of 
a point to reflect the strengthening economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed tightened credit a quarter of a point on Feb. 4, the first official 
interest rate hike in five years. At that time, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan 
said the central bank felt that short-term interest rates needed to be higher 
to restrain the economy and thus inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan hasn't said for sure that another rate hike is imminent, but 
investors have pushed short-term T-bill rates up in recent weeks to reflect 
another quarter-point tightening. 
</P>
<P>
 Yields on longer-term bonds rose Monday partly on speculation that the Fed 
could take a more dramatic step, some traders said. That could include raising 
the discount rate, the rate at which banks borrow from the Fed, from 3% to 
perhaps 3.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Fed's goal is to fight inflation -- a plus for bonds in the long 
run -- traders are concerned that a faster-than-expected rise in short-term 
interest rates could push long-term rates up as well, at least initially. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stock market, meanwhile, some of Monday's selling was related to 
Friday's surprise rally, which was affected by the quarterly expiration of key 
stock options and futures contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're seeing is the flip side of Friday's close," said analyst Trude 
Latimer of Ferguson, Andrews & Associates. 
</P>
<P>
 Slow trading volume Monday suggested that many investors were simply sidelined 
rather than bearish. While losers topped winners 1,588 to 614 on the New York 
Stock Exchange, turnover was just 247 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaller stocks, which led the market higher last week, gave back some of their 
gains. The Nasdaq composite index fell 6.63 points from its record close 
Friday, to 797.30. 
</P>
<P>
 One report Monday suggested that any surprise market rally in the weeks ahead 
could become explosive: The NYSE said "short" interest rose to a record 1.37 
billion shares as of March 15, up from 1.32 billion in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Short interest measures the number of borrowed shares sold, a bet on lower 
prices. In a rally, short sellers are often forced to buy shares to cover their 
wrong bets, giving a further boost to prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Monday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Profit taking hit many industrial stocks. PPG Industries lost 1 1/8 to 78 
1/4, Phelps Dodge fell 1 1/2 to 58, Chrysler eased 3/4 to 57 1/4, Boeing 
dropped 1 to 46 and International Paper gave up 1 5/8 to 68 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Financial stocks were broadly lower on interest rate jitters. Twentieth 
Century Industries lost 1 1/4 to 20 1/4, Countrywide Credit sank 1 to 23 3/4, 
Merrill Lynch fell 7/8 to 42 1/8 and NationsBank was off 1/2 to 47 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sellers also targeted casino stocks, though there was no particular news. 
Caesars World fell 1 7/8 to 51, Circus Circus dropped 1 1/4 to 36 3/4 and 
Hilton sank 2 to 67 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Technology stocks were mixed. Advanced Micro Devices rose 1 1/8 to 30 7/8, 
Powersoft leaped 3 1/4 to 66 3/4 and Micron Technology surged 4 1/4 to 92 3/4. 
But Lotus tumbled 3 3/4 to 80 1/4 and Microsoft lost 1 1/2 to 83 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among the day's big losers, Amtech plunged 11 1/8 to 21 3/8. The company, 
which makes electronic tag reading systems, said it did not get a contract 
awarded jointly by New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania for a new electronic 
toll-collection system for key roads. 
</P>
<P>
 * Latin American shares trading in U.S. markets were trounced, continuing to 
follow their home markets lower on worries about interest rates, inflation and 
political issues. Among closed-end funds, Brazil Fund dropped 2 1/8 to 24 3/4, 
Chile Fund sank 2 to 42 1/2 and Mexico Fund slid 1 1/8 to 30 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 NYSE-traded Latin company stocks declining included Grupo Tribasa, off 2 3/4 
to 28 1/2; Telefonica de Argentina, down 3 7/8 to 63 3/4; Telmex, down 1 7/8 to 
58 3/4, and Chilean Telefon, off 3 3/4 to 89 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 In foreign markets, Mexico City's exchange was closed for a holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 In London, the FTSE-100 index dropped 20.1 points to 3,198.0. Frankfurt's DAX 
index lost 24.33 points to 2,131.28. In Tokyo, the Nikkei index slid 122.71 
points to 20,469.45. 
</P>
<P>
 Hong Kong shares had a particularly bad day: The Hang Seng index plunged 
465.28 points, or 5.1%, to 8,667.03, its lowest close since Oct. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 In other markets: 
</P>
<P>
 * Crude oil climbed to a six-week high ahead of Friday's OPEC meeting in 
Geneva. The cartel will discuss possible production cuts to boost prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Light, sweet crude oil for April delivery shot up 49 cents to $15.37 a barrel 
on the New York Merc. 
</P>
<P>
 In metals trading, gold eased $1.30 to $385.80 an ounce on the Comex; silver 
rose 0.7 cent to $5.42. 
</P>
<P>
 * The dollar dropped slightly against most currencies, as many participants 
stayed on the sidelines or sold dollars because of uncertainty ahead of the Fed 
meeting.

SMALL BUSINESS / JANE APPLEGATE: N.Y. WORKSHOP OFFERS INSIGHTS INTO NEEDS OF 
ENTREPRENEURIAL WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE APPLEGATE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Patricia Jaeger left a lively workshop on managing cash flow a changed woman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to replace my accountant," she declared. "I need him to educate me and 
he hasn't really been sitting down with me to explain anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Jaeger, founder of Patricia Jaeger Salon on West 58th Street, was among the 
thousands of entrepreneurial women attending the 14th national women's 
conference sponsored by the American Women's Economic Development Corp. AWED is 
a nonprofit group that provides affordable training and counseling services to 
thousands of American businesswomen a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many other women at the two-day meeting, Jaeger had worked for many years 
in her profession but was unprepared for the challenges of small-business 
ownership. Since opening her Manhattan salon 18 months ago, she's been trying 
to keep the books as well as keep her clients and co-workers happy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a tremendous block when it comes to subjects like cash flow," she 
admitted. "I would have loved to avoid that cash flow workshop, but I'm glad I 
went." 
</P>
<P>
 Cash flow management was just one of the nearly 150 workshops offered during 
the high-energy conference. Keynote speakers ranged from sex therapist Dr. Ruth 
Westheimer to law professor Lani Guinier, who was forced to withdraw her 
nomination for a key Justice Department post after critics charged she was a 
racial "quota queen." 
</P>
<P>
 The women who descended on the workshops avidly took notes and asked 
questions. Although there are no hard statistics to prove it, business experts 
say, female entrepreneurs are, in many cases, more likely to succeed than men 
because they admit they don't know everything and eagerly solicit outside help. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's suicide to do everything yourself," said Kathryn Barrios, manager of 
AWED's new training program in Stamford, Conn. She said AWED programs focus on 
teaching business fundamentals so women can increase their chances of success 
from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gaining technical knowledge increases a woman's confidence, and then her 
customers take her more seriously," Barrios said. 
</P>
<P>
 Entrepreneurial women who complete AWED's intensive business training programs 
often increase their gross receipts by as much as 60%, according to Ellyn 
McKay, manager of AWED's Washington training program. 
</P>
<P>
 McKay spends much of her time recruiting experienced business people and 
professionals willing to volunteer their time as instructors and counselors.  
</P>
<P>
 "The volunteers do it because they believe in giving back to the community," 
McKay said. "They really want to support the women behind them." 
</P>
<P>
 AWED also stresses the importance of peer group support and collective problem 
solving. "It's great for a woman business owner to be able to come to a safe 
place once a week," McKay said. 
</P>
<P>
 When former radio broadcaster and political press secretary Tamu Fitzgerald 
lost her last job in March, 1992, she vowed that she was "never going to work 
for another soul as long as I live." 
</P>
<P>
 With AWED's help, Fitzgerald now operates not one but two small businesses 
from her Alexandria, Va., home. While her main business is public relations, 
she also designs and sells ethnic jewelry.  
</P>
<P>
 Sitting behind a colorful display of beaded necklaces and earrings in the AWED 
exhibit area, Fitzgerald said she owes much of her success to the advice she 
received from AWED programs. For example, she established a solid relationship 
with a banker after an AWED counselor urged her to go into the bank and meet 
with the branch manager. That relationship proved essential when Fitzgerald 
applied for a merchant account to process credit card transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, my banker didn't want to give me a merchant account because I 
worked at home," Fitzgerald said. "But I did the research, made a convincing 
argument and finally got the approval." 
</P>
<P>
 AWED, which has been around for nearly 20 years, also helped Fitzgerald find 
an experienced business attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "The programs are the most productive business programs I've attended, 
compared with just sitting around listening to 'feel-good' stuff," she said. 
</P>

Ave., Suite 230, New York, N.Y. 10169.

 Music: MCA Music's UNI Distribution Corp. has won a hotly contested bidding 
contest among the major music companies to domestically distribute Miami-based 
Rodven Records, one of the nation's top Latin music labels. The deal represents 
MCA's first move into the fast-growing Latin music field.Rodven, a 
Venezuelan-owned label whose roster includes artists such as Los Fantasmas del 
Caribe, Los Fugitvos, Maggie Carles and Little Joe, has about 10% of the 
$150-million Latin market in the United States. The move is expected to boost 
Rodven's album sales significantly by putting its products for the first time 
in major music retail chains. Zach Horowitz, MCA Music Entertainment Group 
executive vice president, confirmed that MCA also plans to form a Latino music 
division soon and is planning a major push shortly into the South American 
market.JAMES BATES

NEW OUTLOOK ON LABOR HELPS IN CHRYSLER RENAISSANCE; AUTOS: EXECUTIVES LIKE 
DENNIS PAWLEY STRESS OPENNESS, ACCOUNTABILITY. THE UAW HAS RESPONDED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN L. ADLER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dennis Pawley, one of the executives responsible for Chrysler Corp.'s 
car-making renaissance, knew the easy way out when problems surfaced with the 
new Neon cars. 
</P>
<P>
 He figured it was the wrong way out. 
</P>
<P>
 "The easiest thing would have been a coverup," Pawley said of the engine 
problem that resulted in Chrysler's Feb. 4 recall of all 15,000 Neons -- the 
No. 3 auto maker's highly praised new subcompacts. 
</P>
<P>
 Pawley and other Chrysler managers decided that if they publicized the problem 
and recalled the cars voluntarily, customers would have more faith. 
</P>
<P>
 Pawley, 52, the auto maker's executive vice president of manufacturing, knows 
from experience that building lemons and fixing them later helped the domestic 
auto industry earn a reputation for shoddy quality. 
</P>
<P>
 The voluntary recalls, he says, are evidence that accountability by workers 
and managers is taking root at Chrysler. 
</P>
<P>
 When Pawley was told of the Neon problem, he ordered the Belvidere, Ill., 
factory shut down for a week until enough replacement parts could be made. Then 
he toured Chrysler's Acustar parts-making plant in Huntsville, Ala., to find 
the problem, not fix the blame. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to turn that into a learning experience, rather than go down there 
with a rope like we would have in the past and hung somebody," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pawley acknowledges that his tactics in dealing with workers have shifted 
dramatically since his days as a young General Motors Corp. plant foreman in 
the mid-1960s. Back then, shop floor supervisors were chosen as much for brawn 
as for brains. Pawley's burly 6-foot-1, 230-pound frame made him perfect as a 
shop floor sentry to keep the United Auto Workers in line. 
</P>
<P>
 By his own reckoning, Pawley was good at "walking tall and carrying a big 
stick." His enthusiasm earned him promotions and enemies. 
</P>
<P>
 One was Jerry Lewis, whose budding career as a UAW official paralleled 
Pawley's advancement at GM. Neither man could initially stand the other, but 
slowly they realized they needed each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came to me before one of my elections and he said, 'You know, we're going 
to be here together. Maybe there's some things we can do to make things better 
around here,' " Lewis recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Pawley's word became good as gold on the shop floor. Lewis said he was 
fired once for stopping a production line because workers complained of danger 
from faulty machinery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Denny told me if I would keep my guys on the job, the problem would be fixed 
the next morning, and it was fixed the next morning," Lewis said. He was 
reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
 As production manager at the Pontiac Fiero plant, Pawley and UAW Local 653 
Chairman Bob Farley "built probably one of the closest mutual trusting 
relationships in the history of the union and GM," Farley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before GM discontinued Fiero in 1987, the modern operating agreement forged by 
Pawley, Farley and Lewis foreshadowed today's GM-UAW labor agreement at Saturn 
Corp., which is considered a critical part of that division's success. Lewis is 
now UAW business manager at Saturn. 
</P>
<P>
 Pawley, who eventually rose to be plant manager at Fiero, saw the demise of 
the two-seat, plastic-bodied sports car coming when GM investment dollars began 
to dry up. His choices: stay with GM and likely be moved to another plant in a 
lesser position, or take a chance on Mazda Motor Corp.'s offer to run its new 
plant in Flat Rock, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 It was there that Pawley was schooled on one of today's business buzz terms: 
worker empowerment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned how to put the structure together to make empowerment happen, and 
then I saw it miserably fail because the Japanese wouldn't truly empower an 
American to do anything meaningful," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 What Pawley couldn't start at Mazda he has been given freedom to try at 
Chrysler, which recruited him in 1989. So far, 28% of the hourly work force in 
Chrysler plants functions in self-directed work teams. Consequently, the number 
of salaried foremen and supervisors has shrunk 20% in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting my manufacturing guys to really back off and let it happen, that's 
been a struggle," Pawley said. "Part of the way you do that is you reduce the 
management work force to the extent that there aren't enough of them to stand 
there and look over their shoulder." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of taking only plant managers on trips to evaluate products and 
processes, Pawley takes union representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one thing for management to go over and look at something in Japan and 
then come back and try to tell the UAW how far we've got to go," he said. "You 
might as well take 'em with you so you all see the same picture. We're trying 
to do more and more of that." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, trust seems to be growing between the UAW and Chrysler. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a pretty good relationship, and that's what counts working in this 
kind of business," said Frank (Moon) Massey, president of Local 7 at Chrysler's 
Jefferson North plant in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 John Franciosi manages the inner city factory, where the popular Jeep Grand 
Cherokee sport utility vehicle is built by workers who average 24 years on the 
job. They embrace a modern operating agreement: fewer job classifications and 
work rules in exchange for greater input on how the plant is run. 
</P>
<P>
 Pawley's greatest contribution, Franciosi said, has been "driving fear out of 
the organization." When 115,000 Grand Cherokees were recalled in January to fix 
a steering problem, Pawley led the process that traced the problem -- a sheared 
bolt in the steering column. 
</P>
<P>
 "He makes it easier for us to do what's right rather than what's easy," 
Franciosi said. "When we talk about problems, we talk about what happened in 
the process, not who screwed up."

VARIABLE ANNUITIES BEING TOUTED AS A NATURAL FOR '90S; INVESTING: COSTS ARE 
HIGH, HOWEVER, AND BUYERS ARE ADVISED TO MAKE CERTAIN THEY DON'T OUTWEIGH THE 
BENEFITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Wrap a mutual-fund investment in a tax-shelter package, and what do you have? 
</P>
<P>
 Variable annuities, a financial product being billed by its backers as a 
natural for the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 But before you rush to get in on this seemingly good thing, you should do some 
detailed spadework: Ask yourself whether the costs you must pay and the time 
commitment you must make won't outweigh the benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "The advantages sound very compelling, but be sure you consider all the 
variables," says William Brennan in the newsletter Financial Planning Reporter, 
published by the accounting firm of Ernst & Young. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless you hold mutual fund shares in a tax-favored plan such as an individual 
retirement account, fund investments can often present tax headaches. Income 
taxes must be paid each year on capital gains and dividends you receive, even 
if you reinvest the proceeds in additional fund shares. 
</P>
<P>
 But you can get around this problem if you invest in a variable annuity. This 
is a contract issued by a firm, such as an insurance company, through which 
your money is invested in a pool or pools of money operating precisely along 
the lines of a mutual fund. 
</P>
<P>
 The law permits the "inside buildup" in annuities, just as in life insurance 
policies, to go untaxed until you start withdrawing money from the account, 
perhaps many years from now. 
</P>
<P>
 As of mid-1993, CDA-Wiesenberger, a firm that tracks developments in the 
mutual fund industry, tallied 791 funds operating within annuity programs that 
had total assets of $87.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Annuities, traditionally a retirement tool popular among older people, are 
emerging in this climate of rising taxes as a popular tax-deferral tool for 
taxpayers of all ages," says the Institute of Certified Financial Planners, a 
national trade group. 
</P>
<P>
 But an annuity should never be bought without a close look at fees -- for 
administration and insuring mortality risk, as well as for investment 
management. These often run to well over 2% a year, or about double what is 
charged at the typical straight mutual fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "The higher costs of annuities offset their tax benefits for a decade or 
more," says John Bogle, chairman of the Vanguard Group of Investment Cos., in 
his book Bogle on Mutual Funds. 
</P>
<P>
 That factor by itself makes variable annuities suitable only for money you can 
afford to tie up for very long periods of time. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of that, you may face early-withdrawal charges imposed by the annuity's 
sponsor if you need to take money out in the early years of the account's life 
-- and a 10% penalty tax if you make a withdrawal before you reach age 59 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 "Annuities are a lifetime commitment," says the financial planners' institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Annuities have an edge on IRAs, Keogh plans and company-sponsored 401(k) 
retirement plans, in that the law sets no limit on how much you can invest each 
year. But your annuity contribution can't be deducted on your current tax 
return, no matter what your income level. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maximize contributions to retirement savings plans first," counsels Brennan. 
</P>
<P>
 In many variable-annuity packages, you may decide among a series of fund 
portfolios where to put your money. Choices may include money-market and bond 
funds as well as stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 But advisers generally agree that your selection must emphasize stocks to give 
you a reasonable hope of overcoming the cost disadvantage. "The fees that you 
pay won't be justified unless you achieve above-average returns," Brennan says. 
</P>
<P>
 Variable annuities' tax-deferral feature is of greatest value to investors in 
the highest tax brackets, which were raised to 36% and 39.6% by the 1993 tax 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are in just the 15% bracket, or even the 28% bracket, a variable 
annuity investment will have to achieve very strong results just to pay its own 
freight.

SWAPPING FREQUENT FLIER DEAL FOR FARE CUT UNLIKELY; TRAVEL: IBM EFFORT TO GET 
DISCOUNTS FOR EMPLOYEES WAS THWARTED. SUCH MILEAGE PROGRAMS ARE IN FACT 
EXPANDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 While some companies might like to swap frequent flier programs for cheaper 
air fares, there is every indication business travelers won't see that happen. 
</P>
<P>
 The programs are in fact expanding. It is now possible to earn frequent flier 
miles, and ultimately free air travel, by sleeping at certain hotels, dining at 
specified restaurants, making long-distance calls and -- soon -- by ordering 
flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent disclosure that IBM had approached major airlines asking whether it 
could get discounts for employee air travel by banning its employees from 
participating in frequent flier programs raised the issue anew. 
</P>
<P>
 American Airlines and United Airlines -- the two airlines with whom IBM was 
talking -- turned the company down, according to Randy Peterson, a 
frequent-flier expert who operates FlightPlan Inc., in Boulder, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 The question is not a new one. But International Business Machines Corp., with 
a $300-million annual air-fare travel budget, won headlines because of the 
impact such a change would have had if the airlines agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's really a story about frequent flier miles -- it's a story 
about where IBM is going, looking for a way to cut costs," Peterson said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because American and United rebuffed them, I think it says these programs do 
work and they don't want to be messing with the relationships they already have 
with each flier," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there was any chance these programs weren't successful, we'd see the 
airlines trying to get out of them," he said. "But they're wildly successful." 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson said he'd be more worried about IBM's musings if it were not for the 
fact that the programs have now sprawled far beyond the airlines themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "These programs have become so big and so huge -- it's not really about 
frequent fliers any more," Peterson said. "It's about what airlines are doing 
to generate money from affinity groups" such as hotels, long-distance carriers 
and others who buy the miles from them. 
</P>
<P>
 Frequent flier programs are not without their critics. Corporations worry that 
traveling employees might sacrifice schedules and prices to run up points. 
Analysts say everyone in the end pays for them in the prices carriers charge. 
</P>
<P>
 But they also represent up-front money for the airlines, which sell the miles 
to hotels and others who use them as lures. 
</P>
<P>
 That end of the business is on a takeoff roll. 
</P>
<P>
 Red Lion Hotels & Inns, which operates in 10 Western states, recently 
announced it would hand out credits of 250 miles on Alaska Airlines for every 
restaurant meal of $25 to $49.99. It will give a 1,000-mile credit for a dining 
tab of from $50 to $99.99. 
</P>
<P>
 Northwest also has a restaurant-miles arrangement with some airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilton, Hyatt, Marriott, Holiday Inn, Sheraton, Westin and Red Lion among 
others allow guests to earn mileage points by staying at their hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson said American Airlines has told him its next affinity partner for 
mileage will be Florist Telegraph Delivery -- opening the way for earning miles 
by ordering flowers by phone. 
</P>
<P>
 Long distance carriers took the plunge a while back. According to the Travel 
Letter, published by Consumer Reports, here's how the three major programs in 
that field work: 
</P>
<P>
 * AT&T offers for each dollar spent one point, worth five miles credit on 
Delta, United or USAir. The points expire in two years if not used, but you 
need not specify which airline they go to until you're ready to use them. 
</P>
<P>
 * MCI offers mileage on American and Northwest but the airline must be 
specified in advance. The credit is posted monthly and expires in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sprint offers credit on TWA, five miles per dollar spent. For members of 
TWA's very-frequent flier program, the credit is seven miles per dollar. The 
TWA mileage has no expiration. 
</P>
<P>
 The Travel Letter rates AT&T's program as the most flexible but says Sprint's 
offers the highest payoff.

BOSLEY ON BROADWAY: HAPPY TO BE BACK; THEATER: AS THE FATHER IN THE $10-MILLION 
MUSICAL 'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST,' THE VETERAN ACTOR FINDS TODAY'S VISUALS 'JUST 
AMAZING.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Tony Award-winning actor Tom Bosley couldn't be happier about being back on 
Broadway after a 25-year absence. 
</P>
<P>
 But he still feels a bit like a fish out of water. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm having a ball, but it's not quite what I expected," said Bosley, star of 
Disney's musical "Beauty and the Beast," which recently opened for previews at 
the Palace Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to come back to Broadway, but it's almost entirely different," 
Bosley said during a break in rehearsal. "We now use microphones, and there are 
a lot of computerized things with lights that we didn't have in my day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just amazing, really, the visuals that have become part of the Broadway 
theater," Bosley said. "Before we were really dependent on the music and the 
lyrics." 
</P>
<P>
 Bosley plays Beauty's father in the $10-million Disney extravaganza. Adapted 
from Disney's animated film of the same name, "Beauty and the Beast" is the 
story of a young woman in a provincial French town who falls in love with the 
Beast -- a handsome prince trapped in an evil spell that, if he can learn to 
love and be loved, will be broken. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosley's contract calls for him to be in "Beauty and the Beast" for six months 
with an option to renew. 
</P>
<P>
 And, if "Beauty and the Beast" becomes a hit, there's a good chance a second 
"Beauty and the Beast" company will open in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Disney has talked about the possibility down the line of an L.A. company, 
and, if I'm not involved in anything else, I would certainly consider that and 
be home at the same time," Bosley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Square-built and a bit chunkier than he was 25 years ago, the character actor 
is known in the industry an extremely hard-working "actor's actor." 
</P>
<P>
 In many of his roles, he combines the easygoing charm of the congenial 
neighbor next door with a strong sense of moral and ethical values. 
</P>
<P>
 And he's always tried to play parts that are good role models for young 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A veteran of more than 1,000 TV appearances, Bosley is best known as Mr. 
Cunningham, Ron Howard's father on the long-running 1970s-80s series "Happy 
Days." 
</P>
<P>
 After his 11 years on "Happy Days," Bosley want on to play Sheriff Amos Tupper 
on "Murder, She Wrote" and, more recently, Father Dowling in the "Father 
Dowling Mysteries." 
</P>
<P>
 He made his Broadway debut as legendary Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia in the 1959 
production of the Pulitzer Prize-winning musical "Fiorello." He received a Tony 
for his performance as "the little flower," as the feisty LaGuardia was 
affectionately called, and went on to be in five more Broadway shows. 
</P>
<P>
 After his last time out on Broadway in 1969, Bosley began to work in 
television and movies exclusively. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosley wanted to come back to Broadway a long time ago but turned down a few 
roles because he didn't think the shows would last. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just didn't want to come here and do something and then fall by the 
wayside," he explained. "And I even gave consideration to replacing someone in 
a show. But when this show came along, I auditioned for it and they liked me. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I just got together with my family and made some sacrifices to make it 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
 But the more things change on Broadway, the more they stay the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really overwhelmed with the amount of revivals that are coming in and 
that are already in," Bosley said. " 'Damn Yankees' is here. 'My Fair Lady' is 
here. 'Carousel' opens soon. And 'Showboat' is coming to town." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be like deja vu for me," he said. "Like it was when I first 
came to New York."

THANKS TO 'KING KONG,' FAY WRAY LIVES HAPPILY EVER AFTER; MOVIES: 61 YEARS 
LATER, THE ACTRESS IS MOST REMEMBERED FOR THE ROLE. THE CLASSIC KICKED OFF AN 
AFI SALUTE TO HOLLYWOOD'S GOLDEN AGE IN WASHINGTON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's easy to see why King Kong fell for Fay Wray. Sixty-one years after the 
film's premiere, she's still a scrumptious, albeit slightly hard of hearing, 
little dumpling. 
</P>
<P>
 Although her life's accomplishments include 77 feature films, three marriages, 
two kids, an autobiography and a couple of plays, she'll always be remembered 
as the lovesick gorilla's main squeeze. 
</P>
<P>
 Does she resent it? Not one bit: "There were 500 films coming out each year in 
the '30s, so to be in one of perennial interest is kind of lovable. I'm liking 
it better now than I did at the beginning, when it seemed to me that it was not 
Shakespeare." 
</P>
<P>
 It was this most beloved of all monster movies that recently brought the 
pixilated 86-year-old to Washington, where the 1933 classic opened a monthlong 
salute to Hollywood's Golden Age at the American Film Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 One of 5,528 entries in AFI's new "Catalog of Feature Films 1931-1940," "King 
Kong" gets three pages and seven columns of teeny type that offer not only a 
complete cast list, but the names of Wray's and co-star Jack Armstrong's stunt 
doubles; not just the running time, but how many feet of film. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a jolly good catalogue," opines Wray, who reveals therein that she was 
paid $10,000 for her 10-week stint -- pretty good money for the Great 
Depression. 
</P>
<P>
 "The interesting thing about the decade was that it started out like an 
invalid," Wray says. "The (movie) business was in real trouble. 'King Kong' was 
such an immediate attraction that it really saved RKO, which was on the edge of 
bankruptcy." 
</P>
<P>
 Wray was surprised by the public and critical reaction -- reviewers said she 
was brilliant. "I wanted to put my hands over my ears -- there was too much of 
me screaming. . . . I yelled every time they said, 'Yell.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Before the film was edited, she also went into a sound studio, where she 
recorded a series of shrieks and moans that, as the AFI catalogue notes, were 
used in other RKO pictures into the '40s. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Wray) could scream beautifully," as film writer Anthony Ambrogio observed, 
"and the scream was a necessary ingredient of the emerging horror film." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether it was the screaming or the blond wig -- Wray remains a redhead in 
real life -- Kong went after her as if she were wearing banana perfume. Wray 
pooh-poohs the notion that she was the horror genre's first sex symbol: "I was 
not just a body, it seems to me. I had some more delicate thing about me. I was 
a proper little person. I think it made a difference to that film, I do." 
</P>
<P>
 She has clearly given this considerable thought. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just was attracted to a creature he had never seen before. Maybe he had 
never seen a blond. She was like a flower, I felt, that he was fascinated with. 
I think that I had some quality that made this great animal think a little bit. 
When we see him on top of the Empire State Building, he becomes something more 
than a great ape. He becomes an individual of sensitivity. When it comes to the 
last scene, I still feel sorry for him. And that's kind of miraculous." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wray turns her attention to the menu. "I'm glued to the swordfish," she says, 
"because it comes with celery root." It is a favorite of hers, a fondness she 
shared with her late third husband, Sandy Rothenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothenberg was the brain surgeon of her late second husband, Robert Riskin, 
the Academy Award-winning screenwriter of "It Happened One Night," "Mr. Deeds 
Goes to Town" and "Lost Horizon." All three were directed by Frank Capra and 
are among the films featured in the AFI retrospective. 
</P>
<P>
 Wray credits her second husband with giving actresses something to say for a 
change. "I think women began to be interesting when Robert Riskin allowed them 
to have humor," she says. "He was just about the first one who did, because up 
to that point a man and a woman had romance but the comic relief came from 
another source. Then suddenly two people were saying amusing things. And that 
was his style." 
</P>
<P>
 She's also nostalgic for the days before women became empowered. In her era, 
she says, "they suffered better than they do today. Now they're trying not to 
suffer anymore. They tell people off and run the show. It's just not as 
dramatic." 
</P>
<P>
 Wray lives in a Los Angeles high-rise on what was the 20th Century Fox back 
lot. It overlooks the spot where she made "Shanghai Madness" with Spencer 
Tracy, one of 11 films she made in 1933. But she has no formal ties to the film 
industry today -- her last theatrical release was "Dragstrip Riot" in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
 She spent her early years in Canada but made her way to California with her 
mother and became an extra in silent Westerns when she was only 14. "They were 
shorts, mostly two-reelers, but I got as high as a five-reeler once, with Hoot 
Gibson. He was almost like a somnambulist -- he just kind of floated through." 
</P>
<P>
 She had a similar reaction to Gary Cooper, her co-star in "Legion of the 
Condemned" in 1928. "Well, Gary -- hmmm, he slept a lot. It seemed to me every 
time he sat down in a chair he would just let himself flop. He didn't talk 
much, but he had that wonderful, wonderful face. The most photogenic face ever 
on a male, I think. He was really beautiful, yes." 
</P>
<P>
 But preferring awake to handsome, she became involved with the screenwriter, 
John Saunders. Her marriage to the paranoid and melancholy Saunders ended when 
she woke from a nap to find him withdrawing a hypodermic needle from her 
buttock. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In her autobiography, "On the Other Hand," she describes Saunders as "a 
shadowy figure between me and what I hoped would be the fullness of working and 
growing as an actress." Saunders committed suicide in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
 Wray made her stage-acting debut in her first husband's 1931 play, "Nikki on 
Broadway." "It had a wonderful leading man, and his name turned out to be Cary 
Grant. He had beautiful manners, great charm. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a very compelling personality, and I was so pleased that when that 
show closed after six weeks, he too was going back to Hollywood. And when my 
friend Merian Cooper (the co-director of "King Kong") told me, 'You're going to 
have the tallest, darkest leading man in Hollywood,' I thought, 'Oh, it must be 
Cary Grant.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Later she found out that she would be undressed, tickled and sniffed by a 
50-foot gorilla -- a behemoth who perishes in an effort to save his beloved 
from a phalanx of photographers armed only with flashbulbs.

TELEVISION REVIEW; AGENTS WHO'VE COME IN FROM COLD STORAGE

 Spy fans: End of the Cold War got you down? 
</P>
<P>
 Even though recent scandals confirm that snooping still goes on between East 
and West, the fictional spy game has lost some of its zip since the Soviet 
Union's demise. John le Carre turned to international arms dealers in his most 
recent book; others have found substitute villains in drug cartels and 
terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who prefer the good old days when the Evil Empire reigned as the 
free world's chief nemesis, KOCE Channel 50 is offering some solace in the form 
of a vintage British series premiering tonight for a 20-week run. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Sandbaggers," which started production in 1979, is many things American 
network television is not: talky and relatively action-free, low in fancy 
production values but high in plot complexity, and starring characters who 
aren't likable in the traditional TV way. 
</P>
<P>
 This is behind-the-scenes stuff, with all the requisite politicking and 
back-stabbing. As series star Roy Marsden, who plays agent Neil Burnside, 
lectures a foreign counterpart in tonight's episode: "If you want James Bond, 
go to the library. . . . Our battles aren't fought at the end of a parachute. 
They're won and lost in drab, dreary corridors in Westminster." 
</P>
<P>
 Burnside is director of special operations for the Secret Intelligence 
Service. He's the acerbic but brilliant type, with no qualms about 
circumventing the chain of command when it suits his purposes, or battling his 
superiors when necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 His three agents are called Sandbaggers, led by Willie Caine (Ray Lonnen), 
whose easy charm plays well against Burnside's gruff determination. The cast 
includes Richard Vernon as "C," chief of SIS and Burnside's 
not-always-effective buffer against political pressures, and Jerome Willis as 
Matthew Peele, Burnside's fence-sitting immediate superior. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to the bit of sermonizing quoted earlier, the dialogue is generally 
gritty and full of bite, and though it is sometimes heavy on jargon, it 
shouldn't be beyond comprehension for attentive and spy-savvy viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 The emphasis in the first two episodes is on backstage machinations, with 
Burnside battling career-conscious bureaucrats and political interests in 
London as much -- or more -- than he fights the Soviets, or the other 
adversaries in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 In tonight's episode, "First Principles," a Norwegian spy plane crashes in 
Soviet territory and Burnside is forced against his judgment to send agents in 
to help rescue the crew -- because the Norwegians have promised to buy some 
British-made missiles in return. 
</P>
<P>
 Episode two finds Burnside coordinating the surveillance of a possible 
defector and also pushing for the assassination of a fictional African despot. 
Burnside pulls some strings to get the job himself, apparently for personal 
glory -- political killings don't come along often. 
</P>
<P>
 According to press materials, potential love interests will later join the 
cast, but the first two episodes are free of romantic entanglements (unless you 
count Burnside's regular digs at his ex-wife, whom we never meet, but is the 
daughter of a high-ranking Foreign Office official). 
</P>
<P>
 "The Sandbaggers" is absorbing drama in the British tradition, harmed only by 
a dated look -- That hair! Those clothes! -- and a few too many shots of men 
walking grimly around London. The most refreshing aspect is that the makers 
trust the viewer to follow along without excessive hand-holding. 
</P>
<P>
 Accents and terminology can be confusing at times, but don't fret: Burnside 
gives regular updates to his superiors, which help the viewer to catch up as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 Marsden is a spiky but intriguing presence as Burnside, whose perpetual sense 
of certainty would seem arrogant if he weren't right so often. The character 
shifts somewhat from the first to the second episode, but presumably it will 
become better defined as the series progresses. 
</P>
<P>
 For spy fans in withdrawal, Burnside could become a deserving addition to the 
hall of espionage heroes, one in the no-nonsense, damn-the-bureaucrats mold. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Sandbaggers" will air tonight at 9:30 p.m. on KOCE Channel 50. The 
series continues Tuesdays in the same time slot.

 The New Stone: The Rolling Stones on Monday ended speculation about who would 
replace Bill Wyman with the word that Darryl Jones, who has recorded and toured

 Programming for Young People: Cable's Nickelodeon announced Monday that it 
will spend $30 million over the next three years on new programming for its 
weekday preschoolers' bloc, "Nick Jr." Plans call for at least one hour of new 
shows each year, with two series -- the multicultural "Gullah Gullah Island" 
and the puppet show "Allegra's Window" -- to begin airing this fall. In 
addition, Jim Henson Productions will develop a "Muppet laboratory" to create 
new characters for Nickelodeon. The characters will be featured in 40 
two-minute vignettes, which will air as mini-pilots for a future Henson series. 
The cable network also will begin airing on April 4 a daily 7:30 p.m. "Jim 
Henson Muppet Hour" consisting of episodes from "The Muppet Show" and "Muppet 
Babies." And for older kids, Nickelodeon will air "All That," a half-hour pilot

 Another Generation?: Trekkers may soon have new fodder for their devotion. Out 
of last weekend's annual "Star Trek" convention in Pasadena comes the news that 
a never-published futuristic "universe" conceived by the late creator of "Star 
Trek," Gene Roddenberry, will be developed for comic books and other media by 
BIG Entertainment. Roddenberry's widow, Majel Barrett, who starred as nurse 
Christine Chapel in the original "Star Trek" series, will develop additional 
characters and story lines along with D.C. Fontana, who wrote several "Star 
Trek" episodes. No word yet on any television or movie projects, but BIG 
Entertainment does have a standing agreement with Disney/MGM studios to produce 
home videos based on its comics characters. ART

 Restoration Plans Get a Boost: Los Angeles-based collectors Iris and B. Gerald 
Cantor have donated $10 million toward the restoration, renovation and 
expansion of the Stanford University Museum of Art, which has been closed since 
sustaining severe damage in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. Plans call for 
renovating the existing building, enhancing the B. Gerald Cantor Rodin 
Sculpture Garden and building a 36,000-square-foot wing. The expanded museum, 
to be renamed the Iris and B. Gerald Cantor Center for the Visual Arts at 
Stanford, is scheduled for completion in 1997. The gift from Cantor, an 
investment banker, and his wife brings the museum within $2 million of the 
project's estimated cost of $29 million. Other funds raised include $6 million 
in federal disaster assistance and $11 million from individuals. QUICK TAKES

THEATER REVIEW; AN ECLECTIC 'ORESTEIA' OPENS ACTORS' GANG'S NEW HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN BRESLAUER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To inaugurate its new home, the Actors' Gang has gone back to the roots of 
tragedy -- and come up with some Attic antics. This eclectic "Oresteia" may be 
flawed, but it's just the kind of sprawling, exuberant production you'd expect 
from such a venturesome group. It's a fitting introduction to the Gang gestalt. 
 
</P>
<P>
 This "Oresteia" -- composed of three one-act plays based on the tragedies of 
Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides -- re-imagines the fall of the house of 
Atreus for a post-Cold War world in which the price of victory is moral 
collapse. The production showcases an impressive array of acting, directing and 
designing talents -- and it almost overcomes the fact that two of the three 
adaptations are written in Charles L. Mee Jr.'s trademark deconstructivist 
idiom at its most gimmicky. 
</P>
<P>
 Mee's "Agamemnon" recounts the return of the titular hero (Ned Bellamy) to his 
wife, Clytemnestra (Clare Wren), after 10 years of war, and the revenge tragedy 
that follows. They are shadowed by a robed chorus of Beckettian sages -- Homer 
(Joseph Grimm), Hesiod (Gary Kelley), Herodotos (Daniel Parker) and Thucydides 
(Michael Rivkin) -- given to Joseph Campbell-like pronouncements on the power 
of myth. 
</P>
<P>
 A pre-show shroud of fog clears to reveal Mark Wendland's provocative set -- 
an expansive playing area covered with opened books and upturned furniture. 
Director Brian Kulick stages "Agamemnon" with the deliberately methodical 
pacing and declamatory acting of standard-issue postmodernism. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it's the pretentious dialogue rather than Kulick's staging that's the 
more problematic. Mee, after all, is the kind of adapter who's overly fond of 
snippets of academic texts and phrases like "I dreamed I had an iron penis." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ellen McLaughlin's adaptation of "Electra," on the other hand, has none of the 
airs of Mee's "Agamemnon." Instead of a hodgepodge of found verbiage, hers is a 
lyrical, quietly feminist and often wry updating of the story of Clytemnestra 
and her children, directed with a shrewd but unobtrusive hand by Oskar Eustis. 
</P>
<P>
 The third part of the evening features the other Mee adaptation -- a version 
of "Orestes" chock-full of interpolated passages from unrelated 20th-Century 
sources. Fortunately, director David Schweizer has hit upon the only 
appropriate response to such a text: He's staged it as farce. What's more, he 
has the energy -- and a seemingly limitless well of shtick -- to pull it off. 
</P>
<P>
 Set in a crazed hospital-asylum, the story of the smitten siblings Electra 
(Shannon Holt) and Orestes (James Parks) who've come to the end of their 
murderous line almost gets lost amid the barrage of faux medical mania and 
stage business that includes Carpenters tunes, group masturbation and 
earthquake jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, more is more here. In fact, so much is going on all the time in 
this surreal environment that it actually provides a glimpse of the 
post-apocalypse, or at least of a society devalued to the point of 
meaninglessness. 
</P>
<P>
 Kulick, Eustis and Schweizer have all, with varying degrees of success, 
brought a distinct visual and theatrical style to their appointed texts. But 
not all the scripts are created equal. "Agamemnon" and "Orestes" sample 2,500 
years of commentary that in the end winnow down to the Mee decade. McLaughlin's 
adaptation puts the focus on the characters and the story, and is the far 
superior work for it. 
</P>
<P>
 That the evening, which approaches the length of the Peloponnesian War, 
coheres is a tribute not only to the talented trio of directors, but also to 
the Gang and its guest actors (including the eminent and inimitable Alan 
Mandell -- who will, however, temporarily be replaced by an understudy, 
returning March 31). If its first outing has its problems, Actors' Gang and its 
new home are still as essential to L.A. theater as the Greeks have been to the 
making of modern Western drama.

Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7 p.m. Ends April 17. $15. (213)

 "Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult" thumbed its nose at the Academy Awards 
with a wacky Oscar parody on its way to winning the top box-office prize over 
the weekend in a landslide. The third installment of the Paramount comedy 
franchise, from producer David Zucker, grossed more than double its nearest 
competitor with a $13.2-million opening weekend.

DANCE REVIEW; 'RITMO TANGO' MAKES NO FALSE MOVES AT THE FOUNTAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wearing a gown of goldand-black chain-link sequins with huge stars cut out 
over her hips, Loreen Arbus stalks the stage of the Fountain Theatre in 
Hollywood as an icon of the Argentine tango. 
</P>
<P>
 Her dapper partner, Alberto Toledano, matches her intimidating Buenos Aires 
hauteur as he pilots her through dismayingly intricate and unpredictable 
kick-and-turn choreography that only a fool would confuse with the simplistic 
1-2-3-slide routines that stateside ballroom dancers perform in place of 
authentic tango footwork. 
</P>
<P>
 Arbus and Toledano may be Americans, but they got the high-velocity moves, the 
fusion of snobbish and streetwise attitude, the irresistibly disreputable 
glamour of tango on loan from a host of major teachers and predecessors down 
Argentine way. Their "Ritmo Tango" revue, seen Sunday, not only showcases their 
terrific skill and versatility, but also introduces two of their students, a 
fine band and an appropriately intense singer of the passionate-and-doomed 
tango songbook. 
</P>
<P>
 Taped music accompanies some of the dancing -- regrettable, because guitarist 
Dino Durand, keyboard player Carlos Boedo and bandonion master Mario Vasquez 
grow hotter and tighter the more they perform. Ruben Di Grazia appears 
periodically to sing (and sometimes speak) highly theatrical tango ballads -- 
none more impressively rendered than "El Dia Que Me Quieras" by Carlos Garde 
and Alfredo Le Pera 
</P>
<P>
 Tango students Cynthia Wraspir and Karlo Abouroumieh look promising enough in 
their brief duet in the first act, and they even manage to survive the 
program's major miscalculation: a feverish dance-drama involving sex, money, 
death and ballroom deportment. 
</P>
<P>
 Tipping their hats to each other -- and to tango tradition -- Abouroumieh and 
Toledano also team up for a memorably sly, deadpan man-to-man tango. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Ritmo Tango" at the Fountain Theatre, 5060 Fountain Ave., Hollywood. (213) 
663-1525. Tickets $15. March 23 and 26 only, 8 p.m.

MUSIC REVIEW; SYMPHONY WORKS UP A TEMPEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No soloists graced the Arlington Theatre stage Saturday, as the Santa Barbara 
Symphony continued its season and its quest for a conductor. That left the 
spotlight trained on this month's candidate for the position: John Giordano, 
who huffed and puffed and ably led the orchestra into mostly romantic, 
tempestuous musical battle. 
</P>
<P>
 Giordano, who has led both the Ft. Worth Symphony and the Ft. Worth Chamber 
Orchestra for many years, happily seized said spotlight in a strangely uneven 
program of Bach, Barber and Rachmaninoff. This orchestra has been notably 
remiss in its recognition of 20th-Century music. Ironically, although 
two-thirds of this program came from our century, the musical language was 
backward-looking. Likewise the concert. 
</P>
<P>
 In effect, Bach's popular Suite No. 3 in D served as a perfunctory formal 
introduction -- despite the timeless beauty of the "Air" -- for Barber's early 
Symphony No. 1 and Rachmaninoff's swan song, "Symphonic Dances." With the 
baroque restraint out of the way, Giordano went to town, relishing the multiple 
climaxes and fickle dynamics, wringing crescendos for all their worth and 
savoring the quiet passages. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1936 Barber work, classical in form and romantic by instinct, the 
Vivace found the orchestra working up an insistent piston-pumping pulse, almost 
pre-minimalist in effect. Later, the players achieved a proper pitch of manic 
brooding over that ominous ostinato from the expanded double-bass section. 
</P>
<P>
 Genteel melodic gestures gave way to Russian rusticity in Rachmaninoff. 
Especially persuasive was the orchestra's reading of the second movement's 
restless waltz, seemingly fueled by a surreptitious passion. 
</P>
<P>
 Programming questions aside, this soloist-free presentation cast due attention 
on the musical ranks. Regardless of who wields the baton and quakes with 
authority on the podium, this is a group of power and luster. JOSEF WOODARD

THEATER REVIEW; GURNEY'S 'THE FOURTH WALL' AN EXPERIMENT IN ERROR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD STAYTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Consumer Warning: Before entering the Pasadena Playhouse, read a history of 
contemporary drama and ingest gallons of caffeine. 
</P>
<P>
 Then odds are you'll pass the test of A. R. Gurney's "The Fourth Wall." But 
there's a far greater chance that you won't care. The drop-out rate to this 
experiment in error should make fans of "Love Letters" nostalgic for the 
playwright's good old plays. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, that's why the esteemed Gurney wrote "The Fourth Wall": to 
break free of past patterns. Instead of another drawing-room comedy like "The 
Cocktail Hour," the 63-year-old author of more than 20 plays has timidly 
ventured into absurdist territory, but his approach is far too didactic. Rather 
than genuinely liberating drama, "The Fourth Wall" resembles a lecture on 
Bertolt Brecht's "alienation effect." 
</P>
<P>
 Call it "Four Characters in Search of a Plot." The actors do. In fact, the 
performers never let us forget we're an audience in a theater watching a stage 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 The curtain rises to become an imagined wall in an affluent Buffalo, N.Y., 
living room. During a mid-life crisis, Peggy (Barrie Youngfellow) has turned 
her furniture away from the fireplace and toward this blank wall. Evidently 
unfamiliar with minimalism, sophisticated New Yorker Julia (Jean De Baer) is 
shocked by such artificiality. 
</P>
<P>
 "I keep thinking of plays," says Julia while peering intently at the imagined 
blank wall and at us. ". . . I keep thinking I need a better exit line." 
</P>
<P>
 But her childhood friend Roger (Sam Freed) doesn't want Julia to leave. He 
begs her to help resolve his spouse's crisis. He's "trapped in a play not of my 
own making." So they conspire to find a better plot. But Peggy, suffering from 
empty-nest syndrome, gestures at the audience and declares: "We must break 
through the fourth wall." 
</P>
<P>
 In desperation, Roger phones a local drama instructor and requests a house 
call. Dr. Floyd Loesser (Jim Fyfe) rushes in to offer a second opinion. "Beware 
of comparing life and the theater," declares the frantic academic. 
</P>
<P>
 Such exhausted sketch material rarely amuses. Some evidence exists that the 
playwright considers this West Coast premiere to be his "Noises Off"; the Three 
Stooges would have to return from the grave to transform this into farce. To 
compound the evening's tedium, director David Saint mistakes Gurney's modest 
cleverness for Noel Coward wit. So we get sincere, self-conscious dialogue 
about the meaning of life and the crisis of the modern American theater. 
</P>
<P>
 The capable company struggles courageously with the pretentious subject. De 
Baer is a triumph of style over substance as the unsophisticated cosmopolitan. 
Fyfe's high-minded professor is appropriately dysfunctional. Freed and 
Youngfellow are a convincing couple in an unconvincing crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Why this? Gurney has toyed with theatrical conventions far more inventively, 
particularly in "The Dining Room." But everyone's imagination seems bankrupt 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem here isn't the presence of an imagined "fourth wall" -- it's the 
absence of one. We long for something between us and the play. One hopes that 
Gurney liberated himself during this writing exercise. But in an effort to free 
American drama of aesthetic restraints, he constructed a classic example of why 
audiences flee the theater.

when it is whisked into a fashionable shop by an errant breeze, but Bon-Bon is 
so desolate over its loss that she refuses to make her Paris deliveries. 
Madeline and friends save the day, of course, and are the sensation of an 
Easter fashion show, too. Golden Book Video. $12.95.

DANCE REVIEW; FEAR AND ANGER IN THE HERE AND NOW

 The "Voices in Motion" series, created as a showcase for emerging local 
choreographers, returned to the Ivar Theatre in Hollywood over the weekend in 
its third edition. 
</P>
<P>
 The program booklet credits four government agencies with making possible ("in 
part") programs of the Inner City Cultural Center. However, this ICCC event was 
largely made possible by the choreographers themselves, who contributed up to 
$750 apiece in order to appear in the two-day, three-night series. 
</P>

 Fear and anger dominated many of the works seen Saturday, with the R&R Dance 
Theatre focusing on the L.A. riots, the Donlavy Dance Company on AIDS panic and 
the KIN Dance company on both homelessness and explosive urban violence. Even 
the relatively upbeat Brockus Project Dance Company ended its suite of 
well-crafted jazz-based pieces with a premiere of a five-part work about 
putting together a shattered soul. 
</P>
<P>
 Parts of R&R's "L.A. After Images" (choreographed by Roberta Wolin) and 
Donlavy's "Common Threads" used fascinating spoken texts that obliterated the 
less distinctive movement accompanying them. However's R&R's talent for 
re-creating images and feelings from the riots grew stronger as the piece 
progressed, with performers such as Vivian G. Rankin and Robert Whidbee 
especially eloquent. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuel Donlavy's fiery "Disappearing Acts" solo achieved a level of technical 
and emotional sharpness lacking in his dogged, confusing processional trio 
"Cycles" and only fitfully evident in his surging new septet "Like a Quiet 
Storm." Similarly, his HIV-testing psychodrama, "When It Came to Dinner," 
dumped plenty of potentially powerful dramatic and movement ideas on the stage, 
but failed to organize them purposefully. 
</P>
<P>
 KIN's two-part "Pale Forest," choreographed by Frit and Frat Fuller, conveyed 
alternately creepy and alarming views of street life through technically 
sophisticated yet always urgent group motion. For rock-dance heat with a 
modern-dance social agenda, no local company beats KIN. 
</P>
<P>
 Working in a more middle-of-the-road style, Deborah Brockus artfully shaped 
statements of isolation and pain in "Stranger," of supportive female 
relationships in "Sylvie" (co-choreographed with Terri Best and Sahri Nyce) and 
of attempts to reach beyond individual suffering in "Fragments of the Soul."

'DAYS OF OUR LIVES' ACTOR MACDONALD CAREY, 81, DIES; SHOW BUSINESS: HIS LONG 
CAREER INCLUDED STAGE, SCREEN, RADIO AND TV ROLES. HE ALSO WROTE POETRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Macdonald Carey, the tall veteran actor of stage, screen, radio and television 
best known in recent years as the patriarchal Dr. Tom Horton on the daytime 
soap opera "Days of Our Lives," died Monday. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
 Carey, who had undergone surgery for lung cancer in 1991, died of the disease 
in his Beverly Hills home. 
</P>
<P>
 He had continued working on the television series until two months ago. A 
spokeswoman said writers will have Carey's character die in the program. In 
tribute, the NBC network plans to show Carey's portrait after Wednesday's 
episode and then fade to black. 
</P>
<P>
 The multifaceted Carey overcame alcoholism, a struggle he chronicled in his 
1991 autobiography, "The Days of My Life." He also published three volumes of 
poetry and was invited to teach poetry by the University of South Carolina, 
which awarded him an honorary doctorate in fine arts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be remembered for what I am -- a poet/actor," Carey told The Times 
in 1988. "I'd like to be the best I can at both of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Carey said he thought his first book of poetry, "A Day in the Life," was 
published "mostly because I was Macdonald Carey." The second, "That Further 
Hill," he said, was "a vanity book, to be sure, but I did it because by then I 
thought I was a good poet." 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to think that this time," he said on publication of "Beyond That 
Further Hill," his third volume, "it's because I am a good poet." 
</P>
<P>
 A Times reviewer greeted the first book in 1982 with the appraisal: "He writes 
honestly, without avoiding his vulnerabilities -- admirable in an age that 
honors image more than substance." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Carey frequently wrote about loneliness, he seemed to enjoy life even 
after his alcoholism cost him his three-decade marriage to actress Betty 
Heckscher. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (acting) profession teaches you a lot of bad things, but it also teaches 
you something of great value: 'Make it fresh every day.' I try to live that way 
-- singing, dancing, acting, writing," he said when he was well into his 70s. 
"And you know, right now is the most beautiful time of my life. The best time I 
ever had." 
</P>
<P>
 When "Days of Our Lives" debuted on Nov. 8, 1965, Carey was the central 
figure. He also intoned, in his familiar, resonant voice, the dramatic opening 
line which was to echo over three decades: "Like sands through the hourglass, 
so are the days of our lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Twitted by critics for moving into soap operas after a distinguished career on 
Broadway, 60 films and classic radio and television dramas such as "Playhouse 
90," the matter-of-fact Carey said in 1966: "There's not enough work, not 
enough movies being made today to keep all the actors busy. . . . For an actor, 
this kind of show is great. This is actually radio come alive again. . . . I 
really love it." 
</P>
<P>
 Carey's role as the perennial nice guy with a devoted wife and five children 
earned him Emmy awards for best actor in a daytime drama in 1974 and 1975 and 
six Soap Opera Awards from viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 Macdonald Carey was born and raised in Sioux City, Iowa, across the street 
from the twins who grew up to be Ann Landers and Abigail van Buren. He began 
his education at Philip Exeter and Dartmouth. But when the Depression struck, 
he got a brief note from his parents: "Come home." 
</P>
<P>
 Economically persuaded, Carey earned a bachelor's degree at the University of 
Iowa and pursued a master's in speech. He left to join a regional Shakespearean 
theater company, but the company folded, stranding him in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Carey went to work for NBC Radio there in 1937, and soon moved to New York for 
the network. He followed Don Ameche in radio's "First Nighter," and went on to 
"John's Other Wife," "Stella Dallas" and "Just Plain Bill." 
</P>
<P>
 On Broadway, Carey made an inauspicious debut in "Mamba's Daughters." But he 
went on to star with Gertrude Lawrence in her "Lady in the Dark" and opposite 
Kitty Carlisle in "Anniversary Waltz." 
</P>
<P>
 The stage work won him a contract with Paramount for B movies, and his 
self-description as "strictly a nonentity in pictures." A notable exception was 
Alfred Hitchcock's "Shadow of a Doubt" in 1943, in which Carey starred with 
Joseph Cotten and Hume Cronyn. 
</P>
<P>
 Carey served in the Marines for three years during World War II and returned 
to generally better roles -- "Suddenly It's Spring" with Paulette Goddard in 
1947, "Dream Girl" with Betty Hutton in 1948, and "Streets of Laredo" with 
William Holden and "The Great Gatsby" with Alan Ladd, both in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
 By the mid-1950s, Carey was concentrating on television, starring in such 
early drama series as "Playhouse 90," "U.S. Steel Hour" and "Alcoa Playhouse." 
As television matured, he starred in the 1956 series "Dr. Christian" and the 
1959 series "Lock Up," and won such roles as Squire James in the popular 
mini-series "Roots." 
</P>
<P>
 In his later years, Carey was active in the Roman Catholic Church and became a 
knight of the Holy Sepulchre and knight of Malta. 
</P>
<P>
 In honor of his support of mental health services, the East Valley Mental 
Health Center in North Hollywood was named for him last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Carey is survived by his six children, Lynn, Lisa, Steve, Teresa, Mac Jr. and 
Paul, and six grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 The family has asked that any memorial donations be made to the Macdonald 
Carey East Valley Mental Health Center, 11631 Victory Blvd., North Hollywood.

JURY SELECTION TO BEGIN IN RODNEY KING'S CIVIL SUIT; COURTS: THE CITY HAS 
ADMITTED ITS LIABILITY. KING IS SEEKING $9.5 MILLION BUT THE CITY SAYS IT CAN 
ONLY AFFORD TO PAY $1.25 MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Jury selection is to begin today in Rodney G. King's multimillion-dollar 
lawsuit against the city of Los Angeles and the four former police officers who 
took part in his 1991 beating. 
</P>
<P>
 Liability will not be an issue in the trial because the city has admitted its 
responsibility for King's injuries. All that remains is to determine how much 
he should be compensated. 
</P>
<P>
 "The civil case will be quite different from the criminal trial," said Laurie 
L. Levenson, a Loyola Law School professor who has followed the case. "The 
issue of whether the officers crossed the line has been established. What this 
case will focus on is how much money Rodney King will receive for the officers' 
violations." 
</P>
<P>
 Chances for an out-of-court settlement fizzled last year when the two sides 
could not agree on damages. Milton Grimes, King's attorney, is seeking $9.5 
million for his client. City officials contend that the municipal treasury can 
only afford $1.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
 King's lawsuit against the city and the officers demands payment for alleged 
permanent injuries and mental anguish he suffered when police beat him with 
batons and shocked him with a stun gun after a car chase that ended in Lake 
View Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
 Security will be tightened during the civil trial in the Roybal Federal 
Building where the officers were tried on federal civil rights charges last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The case will be heard by U.S. District Judge John G. Davies, who also 
presided over the civil rights case against Sgt. Stacey C. Koon and Officers 
Laurence M. Powell, Timothy E. Wind and Theodore J. Briseno. 
</P>
<P>
 Koon and Powell were found guilty of violating King's civil rights and are 
serving 30-month sentences in a federal prison in Dublin, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 King's attorneys asked that Davies disqualify himself for allegedly showing 
bias during the sentencing of Koon and Powell. Davies said that King had 
provoked the confrontation with police by driving drunk and leading officers on 
a chase. The judge also questioned the seriousness of the injuries inflicted on 
King, who was struck 56 times during the videotaped beating. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal appeals court in San Francisco denied King's request to remove 
Davies from the case. 
</P>
<P>
 King's civil suit is not accompanied by the community tension that surrounded 
the officers' federal trial or their earlier not guilty verdicts in state 
court, which touched off the 1992 riots -- the worst civil unrest in modern 
U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two officers are in prison and that's taken a lot of the sting out of this 
case," Assistant City Atty. Don Vincent said. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial will be divided into two phases: the first to decide how much King 
will be compensated for actual damages; the second to determine the amount of 
punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Davies has allotted three days to King's attorneys to put on their case during 
the first phase, while lawyers for the city and the officers will get two. Both 
sides will be given seven days in the trial's second phase. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will certainly make every effort to stay within the court's confines, but 
we need to address some issues and that might take some time," said Koon's 
attorney, Ira Salzman. 
</P>
<P>
 Salzman said additional time may be needed to overcome the disadvantage the 
city has placed on his client by its admission of liability. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an amazing concession of liability," he said. "It's going to hurt 
tremendously." 
</P>
<P>
 The defense will argue -- as it did in the officers' criminal trials -- that 
the use of force was proper, in part because the officers were following 
established department procedures when they beat King, Salzman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stacey Koon is at the bottom of a long line of policy decisions that he had 
no role to play in," he said. "How much is enough? He has gone to prison. He 
has a wife and five children. He has been fired from his job." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the beating, King has had several well-publicized encounters with the 
law. He was arrested in 1993 after his wife accused him of beating her, but she 
declined to press charges. He was taken into custody again last March on a 
drunk-driving charge and was ordered to serve two months in a live-in alcohol 
rehabilitation center. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryant Allen and the estate of the late Freddie Helms, the two men who were 
passengers in King's car on the night of the beating, settled their cases 
against the city for $55,000.

DEMOLITION OF 16 COUNTY-USC BUILDINGS SOUGHT; QUAKE: TODAY SUPERVISORS ARE 
EXPECTED TO APPROVE TEARING DOWN HOSPITAL FACILITIES. MEANWHILE, OFFICIALS HOPE 
TO USE FEMA AID TO SPEED CONSTRUCTION OF $1-BILLION COMPLEX PLANNED BEFORE 
TEMBLOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Board of Supervisors is expected to approve today the demolition of 16 
quake-damaged Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center buildings, leaving 
unresolved several key issues related to how the vast center will recover from 
more than $400 million in facilities losses. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, county health officials are hoping to persuade the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency to allow them to use federal relief money to speed 
the construction of a $1-billion complex to replace the quake-battered center.  
</P>
<P>
 The buildings to be torn down housed administrative and service functions and 
were not used for patient care. But two others, the Pediatric Pavilion and the 
Psychiatric Hospital, both of which were closed and their patients transferred 
after the Jan. 17 quake, were extensively damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The condition of those buildings is still being assessed, but officials said 
it is likely that the Pediatric Pavilion will have to be torn down.  
</P>
<P>
 Before the earthquake, county officials were nearing completion of plans to 
replace the entire medical center, which occupies 100 buildings and 4 million 
square feet. Rather than spending as much as several hundred million dollars 
repairing and retrofitting the center's buildings, county officials hope to use 
the relief money for the new complex -- adjacent to its location in Boyle 
Heights -- that would include intensive care rooms, burn wards, laboratories 
and outpatient clinics.  
</P>
<P>
 "FEMA has not agreed to this, but this is what we are hoping for," project 
manager Fernando Vizcarra said. FEMA officials could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Although medical center officials said financing for the project is in place, 
FEMA money could speed its planning and construction. The center, which will be 
nearly half a million square feet larger than the First Interstate tower in 
Downtown Los Angeles, was to have been built in several phases over eight 
years, but FEMA money could make it possible to build it all at once. Under the 
current timetable the first of two main wings is to be occupied in 1997, but 
that date could be moved up two years with help from FEMA, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the FEMA money could accelerate the hospital replacement plans, there 
is resistance from private hospital officials in the county who believe that 
alternatives to the $1-billion medical center should continue to be explored. 
Their argument is that with a glut of empty hospital beds in the central Los 
Angeles area, the massive hospital envisioned by the county make not make 
sense. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony J. Abate, a vice president with the Hospital Council of Southern 
California, said: "We find ourselves with excess capacity that wasn't 
considered five or 10 years ago when planning for this hospital began," he 
said. "In Los Angeles County, 50% of the hospital capacity is empty right now." 
</P>
<P>
 The future of other county-operated community clinics and regional health 
centers still has not been decided. These include the Mid-Valley Comprehensive 
Health Center in Van Nuys, nine office and other buildings at the Olive View 
Medical Center in Sylmar, and the San Fernando Health Center. The county staffs 
45 regional health centers and about half were seriously damaged in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 County-USC spokesman Harvey Kern said an initial estimate pegged damage to 
center facilities at $390 million but that a final damage estimate could take 
four more months to compile. 
</P>
<P>
 The buildings to be demolished include a 61,000-square-foot research and 
office facility built in 1921 and a 40,000-square-foot laundry built in 1928. 
Since the quake, the medical center has been sending out more than 1 million 
pounds of laundry a month. FEMA and the state Office of Emergency Services have 
agreed to pay $750,000 to demolish the structures. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the vacant land created by the demolitions will be occupied by 
temporary buildings to be used as offices by doctors and nurses. Kern said that 
since the quake, many doctors who worked at the pediatric and psychiatric 
facilities have been using their cars as makeshift office space. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pediatric Pavilion was evacuated Feb. 1 and patients were moved into 
Women's Hospital. That set up a domino-like series of moves in which some 
administrative functions were moved from a medical center office building to 
the City of Commerce, to be replaced by clinics formerly at Women's and at 
Pediatric. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing the new arrangement, the Board of Supervisors Tuesday will vote on 
changing the name of Women's Hospital to Women's and Children's Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 When the psychiatric facility was shut down, about 80 adult patients were 
moved to Metropolitan State Hospital in Norwalk. Juvenile patients were 
transferred to Augustus Hawkins Mental Health Center at Martin Luther King 
Jr./Drew Medical Center.

BOARD OKS POLICY ON SCHOOL CHOICE; EDUCATION: NEW GUIDELINES GIVE PARENTS 
GREATER FREEDOM TO SELECT CAMPUSES OUTSIDE THE NEIGHBORHOOD. BUT THERE ARE 
STILL SOME LIMITATIONS IN THE PLAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE CHAVEZ, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Parents in the Los Angeles Unified School District will have greater freedom 
to choose the school their child attends under new guidelines unanimously 
approved Monday by the school board. 
</P>
<P>
 The new policy replaces regulations in force for many years that have made it 
difficult for parents to send their children to public schools outside their 
neighborhood. But in practice, the new rules also pose obstacles to free choice 
of a public school. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new guidelines, parents will have the unlimited right to withdraw 
children from their resident school without the principal's permission and in 
effect shop for a new school that has space within the district. Students will 
not be able to sign up at an integrated school if their enrollment upsets the 
racial balance. 
</P>
<P>
 The new approach was prompted by a state law authored by Assemblywoman Dede 
Alpert (D-Coronado) that ordered every school district in California to adopt 
the same open enrollment policies as part of a nationwide trend -- sparked by 
the school voucher movement -- to give parents a greater choice in selecting a 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a landmark in the school reform effort to open school choice to 
every family in the district," said Board of Education member Mark Slavkin. He 
said the new policy will allow parents to become more involved in their child's 
education "rather than feel their children are assigned to a school by 
default." 
</P>
<P>
 School principals and district officials will determine the number of 
available enrollment slots at every elementary, middle and senior high school. 
Officials estimate that about 50,000 spaces will be open at about 500 schools. 
Magnet schools are not affected by the new rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Students from the neighborhood -- as well as students bused in for integration 
and to relieve overcrowding -- will still have first choice at space in a 
school. The new policy also says that no student will be displaced from a 
school to make room for new applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 Students will be able to enroll at any school that has space, provided their 
arrival does not knock the campus out of integrated status. Schools are 
considered integrated when white students make up 30% to 70% of the student 
body. However, most schools in the district have student populations that are 
majority Latino, African American, Asian American and other nonwhite youths and 
will not be affected. 
</P>
<P>
 The racial and ethnic balance of the school from which the student withdraws 
is not a relevant factor under the new policy. Permission will not be required 
to leave any school -- a major change from past practice. 
</P>
<P>
 The key date for parents will be May 16, when district officials will release 
applications and the count of available seats at each school. Enrollment season 
for the 1994-95 school year will close on June 13. 
</P>
<P>
 If more students apply to a school than there are open seats, a lottery will 
be held. The state law signed by Gov. Pete Wilson last summer prohibits schools 
from making admission decisions based on academic achievement, language skills 
or athletic talent and mandates that all selections be made on a random basis. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Parents whose children attend traditional calendar schools -- those running 
from September to June -- will receive acceptance notices around June 17. 
Year-round schools will issue their notifications about June 30, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 All California Interscholastic Federation rules apply to students who use the 
new rules to transfer, meaning that varsity level athletes would have to give 
up competitive team sports for a year to change to schools not in their 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the state law, the district is not required to provide transportation to 
open enrollment students. District officials said that space may be open on 
some bus routes. Transportation availability will be determined two weeks after 
the start of the school year. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, the district has offered several popular but limited school choice 
programs that will continue. About 30,000 students are enrolled in magnet 
schools, for which applications are now being accepted. Another 40,000 youths 
attend schools outside their neighborhood as part of a voluntary integration 
program or to relieve overcrowding. And 5,000 attend other schools close to 
day-care providers or their parents' jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, a little-publicized permit plan had already allowed parents to send 
their children to any school that had space, but few took advantage of it 
because of complex applications and red tape. It required approval from the 
principal at the former school and from Downtown administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 Sue Di Julio, principal of Overland Avenue Elementary School on the Westside, 
said her office has been deluged with phone calls from school-shopping parents 
every time the choice issue has been publicized. She expects big demand for 
about 35 open seats in her school. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had open enrollment permits in the district before, but it was not very 
well-publicized and few people knew about it," Di Julion said. "I don't think 
the new policy is really much different, but it feels good because now parents 
feel that they are in control. . . . We are all sitting back to see what is 
going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Ellen Ruben Gabrielson, Parent-Teacher Assn. president at Overland, has been 
helping Di Julion field calls from parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea that parents can come to a school of their choice with a free 
ticket, as opposed to all that paperwork, is very appealing," Gabrielson said. 
"The opportunity will be great if it can be implemented hassle-free."

NERVES RATTLED, BUT L.A. STANDS UP TO TEMBLOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 As quake-weary residents returned to work Monday to right their tipped coffee 
mugs, it became increasingly clear that Sunday's 5.3-magnitude aftershock was 
the sort of jolt that residents have come to expect -- a shaker that leaves Los 
Angeles jittery but still standing. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it ranks as a significant temblor in its own right, the third-most 
powerful aftershock since the Northridge earthquake caused only minor injuries 
and little damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "No pun intended, but there are no earthshaking events to report," Bob Collis, 
a Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman, said. "We're back to our normal 
workload." 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, the Jan. 17 quake left 61 dead and caused at least $13 billion in 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the reason that overall damage was minimal is that most buildings and 
utilities in Southern California are designed to withstand much stronger 
quakes, said Tom Tobin, executive director of the state's Seismic Safety 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, in dozens of pockets around Southern California, Sunday's aftershock 
caused headaches and heartbreaks. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sherman Oaks, a hillside home hit hard by the January quake was damaged 
further Sunday and threatened to slide onto houses below. Wrecking crews 
finished the demolition Monday, causing the house to cave in on itself in a 
crash of cracking wood and shattering glass. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very sad to lose my house," said Mary Bond, 85, who built it with her 
late husband 38 years ago. "Now I'm homeless. Otherwise, I'm doing OK." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Van Nuys Superior Court building, the seventh floor was shut down 
because of concern about asbestos contamination. The closure forced two death 
penalty trials to be moved to other courtrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 During the aftershock, ceiling tiles in all four courtrooms on the top floor 
of the building were damaged. Because there is asbestos on beams and pipes 
above the false ceiling, the entire floor was closed as a precaution. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials hope to reopen the seventh floor Wednesday. The Van Nuys Courthouse 
is overwhelmed because it has taken over cases that would have been heard in 
the San Fernando Courthouse, which was closed after the January quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It delays things, with the courthouse being crowded anyway," said Superior 
Court Judge Michael R. Hoff. "But I'm sure this is going to work out as it 
always does." 
</P>
<P>
 Delays were not a problem for morning commuters. Getting to work was no more 
of a hassle than it has been since the January quake knocked out stretches of 
the Santa Monica, Golden State, Simi Valley and Antelope Valley freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans spokesman Russ Snyder said Sunday's shaking caused a few cosmetic 
cracks but did no further damage to bridges or overpasses. "There is no 
significant damage to report," Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Monday, Caltrans announced a contract to rebuild parts of a broken 
interchange in Sylmar. Work began Saturday on two transition roads connecting 
the Antelope Valley Freeway to the Golden State Freeway. Construction is 
expected to be completed by June. 
</P>
<P>
 Work on two other transition roads is expected to begin next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill King, a Los Angeles city building inspector, said his office saw a slight 
increase in the number of residents requesting inspections Monday, but added 
that there did not appear to be new significant damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are really in good shape," he said. "We're going to have aftershocks. We 
anticipate further aftershocks. I don't think there is any reason to be 
panicked. People just need to be prepared." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, said Caltech spokesman Jay Aller, who advised that there may be more 
such jolts the coming months. "That's pretty fair to say." 
</P>
<P>
 Aller added that there is a 1 in 20 chance that Sunday's jolt, centered about 
a mile west-northwest of Panorama City, was a foreshock to a larger quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Chau Lam and correspondent Thom Mrozek contributed to this 
report. Sunday's Aftershock The 5.3 magnitude aftershock of the Jan. 17 
Northridge quake was centered one mile west-northwest of Panorama City.

MARSHALS WIN ROUND IN FIGHT TO KEEP JOBS

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge Monday denied Los Angeles County's motion to dismiss a 
lawsuit brought by Municipal Court judges, who are fighting the elimination of 
the Marshal's Office. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Donald Smallwood ruled that there are significant issues to be resolved, 
and granted the judges' group an opportunity to pursue their case.  
</P>
<P>
 The judges maintain that the county acted illegally when it abolished the 
office in a cost-cutting move last fall. The Board of Supervisors replaced the 
marshals with sheriff's deputies to provide security and other services in 
courtrooms.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; APPEALS 
COURT UPHOLDS LIQUOR STORE CRACKDOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A state appeals court has upheld the city of Los Angeles' post-riot crackdown 
on liquor stores, rejecting an appeal filed by the Korean American Legal 
Advocacy Foundation on behalf of merchants whose stores suffered damage in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to a neighborhood outcry, the city imposed conditions on the 
rebuilding of damaged liquor stores. Merchants filed suit in an attempt to 
block the regulations that they argued were outside the city's jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2nd District Court of Appeal rejected the merchants' challenge. The state 
Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control may be responsible for alcohol 
regulation, the court said, but cities may impose reasonable limits on land 
use.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SOUTH-CENTRAL; PROGRAM 
TO TURN ALLEYS INTO GARDENS IS BEGUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A program to clean up littered, crime-plagued alleys by turning them into 
community gardens and recreation areas got under way Monday in South-Central 
Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 "For far too long, these alleys have been treated as private dumping grounds, 
often by trash haulers and other contractors completely oblivious to the 
detrimental effects of illegal dumping," Councilwoman Rita Walters said."We 
hope this program will help turn the tide." 
</P>
<P>
 In many South-Central neighborhoods, alleys have become clogged with discarded 
tires, furniture and construction debris. Prostitutes and drug dealers also ply 
their trades there.  
</P>
<P>
 According to public works officials, the city spends $4 million a year 
cleaning up the alleys. More than 40% of all illegal dumping is in 
South-Central, Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas said.  
</P>
<P>
 Under the conversion program, the city will close off nuisance alleys and turn 
them over to adjacent property owners who want to spruce them up for community 
use. Participants in the pilot program will have to pay to install gates to 
block off the alleys, and must assume responsibility for maintenance and 
liability.

RESTAURATEURS REPORT 24% LOSS FROM SMOKING BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than half of 300 restaurateurs surveyed said a citywide ban on smoking in 
eateries cost them 24% of their revenues, according to a report released 
Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 "The results are quite clear," said Paul Holm of Charlton Research Co., the 
San Francisco-based firm that did the study. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilman Marvin Braude, the council's anti-smoking 
crusader, dismissed the survey as another tobacco industry ploy. 
</P>
<P>
 Holm told reporters the study received no funding from cigarette makers, but 
Braude said the Charlton Research Co. has worked for tobacco companies in the 
past. The survey's sponsors -- the Pacific Dining Car and the Southern 
California Business Assn. -- announced the results a day before the council is 
scheduled to debate whether to order a study on the ban's impact.  
</P>
<P>
 "The city has got to look at this particular survey . . . to see if, in fact, 
we have to rethink the current ban," Councilman Richard Alatorre said.

FATHERS RIGHTS GROUP PROTESTS AT COURTHOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Waving placards saying, "We Do Exist," and "Don't Call a Sitter, Call Dad," 
about 50 divorced and unwed fathers protested their "deadbeat dad" image Monday 
in front of the Los Angeles County Courthouse.  
</P>
<P>
 The fathers, members of "My Child Says Daddy," said to be the nation's first 
African American fathers rights organization, blamed the district attorney and 
family law courts -- more than their ex-wives and girlfriends -- for their 
plight."The fathers pay child support, and don't get to see their children," 
said Paul Dancy, a postal worker from Los Angeles who is fighting for joint 
custody of his two children, ages 12 and 4. "I'm tired of being bashed," he 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 One father said he had just received a bill from the district attorney for 
$6,000 in interest, even though his two children are over 18. Another said he 
has not seen his daughter in 11 years although 45% of his income is deducted 
for her support.  
</P>
<P>
 Family attorneys say higher state child support requirements now becoming 
effective have prompted fathers to seek more visitation in the belief that it 
will lower their payments. But the fathers claim they truly want to help raise 
their children. Group founder Reginald Brass said: "We're trying to rebuild the 
family by putting fathers back in the home so our children won't be gang 
members or on drugs, or become pregnant teen-agers."

ROBBERS FIND NEW ROUTE INTO HOMES: CLASSIFIED ADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A crime wave involving thieves who masquerade as buyers of pricey home 
computers prompted police and the Recycler newspaper Monday to warn sellers 
against allowing strangers responding to classified ads into their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the latest twist to the home invasion robbery.This time, the armed 
thieves responding to Recycler Classified ads have struck at least nine homes 
throughout Southern California, stealing high-end Macintosh computers and 
related equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Macs are an excuse to get into the house," said Detective Bill Speer of 
the Los Angeles Police Department's Robbery-Homicide Division, which is 
investigating cases in Reseda, the South Bay, on the Westside and in other 
areas since December. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest case occurred Saturday, when two victims were shot and wounded 
before one of them shot back, apparently injuring the suspect. That attack came 
even though the victims knew of the past robberies, possibly because of a 
computer bulletin board that allows Mac users to communicate electronically, 
police said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: TORRANCE; EPA TO HOLD 
PUBLIC FORUM ON DDT FOUND AT 2 SITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Neighbors of two waste sites near Torrance will hear from federal officials 
tonight about the implications of recent tests that turned up unusually high 
levels of DDT in two back yards along West 204th Street. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency representatives will also address 
concerns about potential health effects of the two sites: Montrose Chemical 
Corp., which is a federal Superfund site, and the nearby Del Amo Pits, a 
proposed Superfund site. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents are questioning whether their health problems -- such as rashes, 
nausea, headaches and joint pain -- are being caused by chemicals from the 
sites. Concern intensified this month when the EPA found unusually high levels 
of DDT in the two back yards between Normandie and Vermont avenues. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA public forum tonight will begin with an open house from 5:30 to 6:30, 
followed by a meeting from 7 to 9:30 at the Halldale Avenue School auditorium, 
21514 Halldale Ave., Los Angeles. On hand to answer questions will be 
representatives from the EPA, the state Department of Health Services and the 
Los Angeles County Department of Health Services.

DISMISSED OFFICER ACCUSES LAPD OF BIAS, FILES SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alleging that the Los Angeles Police Department discriminated against him in a 
disciplinary hearing because he is black, a former LAPD officer announced 
Monday that he has filed a federal lawsuit to regain his job and to stop what 
he says is unfair treatment of African American and other minority officers by 
the LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want fair treatment as far as African American officers are 
concerned," said Philip Wilkes, who was an LAPD officer for four years until 
last March, when he was fired for conduct that a police disciplinary panel 
concluded was unbecoming a police officer. "We have to stop being treated as 
second-class citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkes -- who was found guilty by a police Board of Rights of failing to pay 
child support, lying on a court form, violating a court order and becoming 
involved in a domestic dispute -- maintains that the LAPD disciplinary system 
was particularly hard on him because he is black. Wilkes was fired from the 
department on March 18, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "African American and Latino officers have to adhere to a higher standard than 
white officers," Wilkes said. 
</P>
<P>
 All the charges against Wilkes grew out of a dispute with his girlfriend and 
none directly involved his work as a police officer. Similar charges against 
white officers have not resulted in such severe discipline, he said, though he 
and his lawyer, B. Kwaku Duren, conceded that they do not have statistical 
information to back up that claim. 
</P>
<P>
 Accompanied by Duren and other supporters, Wilkes announced the filing of the 
lawsuit at a news conference in front of the LAPD's Parker Center headquarters. 
A few police officers looked on, but department officials declined comment on 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Greenebaum, president of the Los Angeles Police Commission, also declined 
comment on the Wilkes case, but said he has never seen any evidence that the 
department's disciplinary system is biased against minority officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've heard that stated before," Greenebaum said. "But I've never seen 
consistent evidence that would support the argument that there's a pattern. . . 
. I do not feel that I have seen any evidence of systematic racism or 
discrimination against minority officers." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the Christopher Commission studied the LAPD and concluded, among 
other things, that the department's failure to punish the perpetrators of 
racist acts "conveys to minority and non-minority officers alike the message 
that such conduct is in practice condoned or tolerated by the department, 
notwithstanding its stated policies to the contrary." 
</P>
<P>
 The Christopher Commission did not, however, report any findings about 
discrimination in the disciplinary process. 
</P>
<P>
 At the press conference, Duren acknowledged that he does not have statistical 
evidence showing that such discrimination exists in the disciplinary process, 
but said he will ask the city to supply statistical data as part of the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what the discovery process is designed (for)," Duren said. LAPD 
disciplinary decisions take into account more than just the charges against the 
accused officer, a fact that makes it difficult to compare cases. An officer's 
entire professional history may be reviewed by a disciplinary board to 
determine how serious a penalty is warranted. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkes said Monday that he was never suspended while with the LAPD. In his 
lawsuit, he is described as a "very competent police officer with good work 
habits." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkes is seeking reinstatement to the Police Department, along with back pay 
for the past year.  
</P>
<P>
 No trial date has been set.

SLAIN MAN'S FAMILY SUES RAP SINGER AND ENTERTAINMENT FIRMS; VIOLENCE: SNOOP 
DOGGY DOGG ALREADY FACES A MURDER CHARGE IN THE KILLING. THE FILING ALSO SEEKS 
DAMAGES FROM MEDIA COMPANIES FOR HIRING HIS BODYGUARD, WHO ALLEGEDLY WAS THE 
GUNMAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A wrongful death suit asking for $25 million in damages has been filed against 
Snoop Doggy Dogg and media giant Time Warner by the family of a man who 
authorities say was gunned down last August by the Long Beach rapper's 
bodyguard. 
</P>
<P>
 The 22-year-old entertainer, whose real name is Calvin Broadus and whose 
"DOGGYSTYLE" album has generated more than $40 million in sales, already faces 
a murder charge in the slaying of Philip Woldemariam in a Palms-area park. 
</P>
<P>
 He is accused of driving the vehicle from which his bodyguard, McLinley Lee, 
allegedly shot and killed Woldemariam, 20. Both men and their companion, Shawn 
Abrams, pleaded not guilty Oct. 1, claiming self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no words to express my family's grief and outrage over this loss," 
said the victim's father, Woldemariam Ghilamariam, a Long Beach building 
contractor.. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't tell you how devastating it is to see the man charged with my son's 
murder not only out walking free but being honored on award shows and 
performing constantly on TV," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee and Abrams also are named as defendants in the suit, as are several 
corporations affiliated with the rapper's music, including Time Warner, Warner 
Music Group and Interscope Records. 
</P>
<P>
 The Woldemariams' suit accuses the entertainment firms of negligently hiring a 
bodyguard who allegedly engaged in reckless conduct leading to the Aug. 25 
killing. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit was filed Nov. 12 by the Woldemariams, who say they were advised at 
the time by the Los Angeles County district attorney's office not to speak to 
the news media. However, their attorney, Nathaniel J. Friedman, said the couple 
decided last week to speak out.  
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Woldemariam family expressed dismay over the portrayal of their 
relative as a violent gangster who stalked Broadus.  
</P>
<P>
 "They are trying to make Philip out to be some dangerous criminal when nothing 
could be further from the truth," said Woldemariam's sister, Sophia. 
</P>
<P>
 Broadus, Lee and Abrams could not be reached for comment. Executives at Time 
Warner, Warner Music Group and Interscope declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The rapper's attorney, David Kenner, characterized the suit as a "transparent 
attempt to profit from the gang-related activities of their son. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clear from the evidence presented to the grand jury that Philip 
Woldemariam was responsible for his own demise," Kenner said. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution and defense teams agree that Woldemariam had a verbal 
confrontation with Abrams and Broadus about an hour before the shooting in 
front of an apartment building where Broadus was living, and that Woldemariam 
might have been armed. But the prosecutor said the people in Broadus' vehicle 
chased Woldemariam to the park and provoked the fatal shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 After a second verbal altercation, McKinley fired seven shots, one of which 
fatally wounded Woldemariam in the back, police said. Broadus, Lee and Abrams 
surrendered a week later. 
</P>
<P>
 "The self-defense claim does not fly in this case," said Edward Nison, a 
deputy district attorney in the hard-core gang division. "The defendants went 
looking for trouble, and the end result was a shooting." 
</P>
<P>
 Broadus served a brief jail sentence in 1990 for drug dealing and is listed in 
police files as a member of the Long Beach Insane Crips. But the rapper has 
said he ended his gang involvement while in high school. Woldemariam is in the 
files of a police anti-gang unit as a member of the By Yourself Hustlers, a 
gang based in the Miracle Mile area. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenner said that Woldemariam, on probation after serving a jail term for 
negligent discharge of a firearm on a junior high school playground, had 
threatened Broadus' life on several occasions, including once last summer 
during the filming of a video. 
</P>
<P>
 The Woldemariams insist that their son had never met Broadus until 40 minutes 
before he was slain. They also say two of Woldemariam's friends who witnessed 
the shooting told detectives in August that the victim was unarmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Those witnesses, however, testified during a grand jury investigation in 
November that Woldemariam had a gun tucked in his waistband and may have been 
reaching for the weapon before he was shot. Woldemariam's family say the 
witnesses altered their accounts because they were intimidated by gang members 
associated with Broadus. Police said there is no evidence that the witnesses 
were threatened.

FUND DRIVE TO KEEP ALIVE PRIEST'S LEGACY; AID: SUPPORTERS OF IMMIGRANTS RIGHTS 
ACTIVIST FATHER LUIS OLIVARES, WHO DIED LAST YEAR, HOPE TO ESTABLISH A 
$1-MILLION ENDOWMENT. THE PURPOSE IS TO BENEFIT GRASS-ROOTS ADVOCACY PROGRAMS 
IN LOS ANGELES. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 During the 1980s, Father Luis Olivares achieved a lasting reputation as an 
uncompromising advocate for an often unpopular cause: improving the plight of 
Central American refugees and illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Before his death a year ago, Olivares turned his Downtown Los Angeles church 
into a sanctuary for refugees, denounced U.S. policy in Central America and 
called on employers to ignore a federal law banning the hiring of undocumented 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although friends say Olivares' spirit lives on in the work of those he 
inspired, many have spoken about the need for a more formal structure ensuring 
long-term assistance for his broad social agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters last week launched a drive aimed at creating a $1-million endowment 
-- known as the Luis Olivares Legacy -- to help grass-roots initiatives serving 
the millions of immigrants and refugees in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a mechanism to continue the work that my brother started," said Henry 
Olivares, who heads the legacy's board of advisers. 
</P>
<P>
 The legacy's first grant, a modest $2,500, was awarded to the Centro Pastoral 
Rutilio Grande, a church-run, social service organization that Olivares helped 
found 10 years ago to serve the needs of new immigrants. The center, on the 
grounds of Blessed Sacrament Church in Hollywood, includes a shelter for the 
homeless (recently occupied by immigrant families who lost their homes in 
January's earthquake). It is named after an activist priest murdered during the 
civil war in El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
 According to organizers, a national climate of hostility toward newcomers 
underscores the need to carry on Olivares' mission. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't think of a more important time to get involved in such a legacy, to 
reawaken the spirit of Luis Olivares," said actor Martin Sheen, one of the late 
priest's admirers who helped kick off the endowment campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 If supporters succeed in raising $1 million through direct mail and other 
appeals, they say it could generate $50,000 to $475,000 in interest to be 
disbursed annually. Even a few thousand dollars can make a big difference to 
groups operating on shoestring budgets, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A grant of $5,000 can be a lifesaver," said Madeleine Janis-Aparicio, former 
director of the Central American Refugee Center. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The legacy plans to support nonprofit, community-based organizations that work 
with Latino immigrants and refugees in Los Angeles. Areas of concern include 
literacy, AIDS, human rights, homelessness and unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond grants, fund organizers seek to convey a symbolic message of concern by 
invoking the name of the charismatic priest, a Texas native of Mexican descent. 
</P>
<P>
 "More than the money, this is a statement of faith," said Jack Shakely, 
president of the California Community Foundation, which will administer the 
Olivares endowment. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund will provide an alternative to major foundations and other big-wallet 
donors, who are often leery of backing politically sensitive causes. Most 
beneficiaries of the Olivares fund are likely to oppose official efforts to 
seal the U.S.-Mexico border, reduce the flow of asylum-seekers arriving in the 
United States and otherwise curb immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1980s, Olivares enraged church and government authorities with his 
denunciations of Washington's policies in Central America. In 1985, Olivares 
declared his Downtown parish church, Our Lady Queen of Angeles (commonly known 
as La Placita) as Southern California's first public sanctuary for Central 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Louie was absolutely committed to helping refugees and immigrants," said 
Father Michael E. Kennedy, who worked with Olivares at La Placita and Blessed 
Sacrament. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the many who remember, with gratitude, is Marta Pineda, now 34, a former 
shrimp packer in El Salvador who says she fled her homeland after fellow 
unionists were threatened and killed. Pineda arrived in Los Angeles in early 
1988, with a newborn daughter, Jasmin. Like many others, she turned to La 
Placita, which placed her in a church shelter near Blessed Sacrament Church. 
She remained a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no place else to go," Pineda said during an interview last week, 
accompanied by her daughter, now 6, and her 4-year-old son, Jesse.  
</P>
<P>
 Olivares died on March 18, 1993, of complications from AIDS, apparently 
contracted through an improperly sterilized needle during a visit to Central 
America. He was 59. 
</P>
<P>
 On the anniversary of his death, former friends, colleagues and admirers 
gathered at Blessed Sacrament. Mariachis accompanied the memorial service, just 
as the Mexican melodies had resounded at 11:30 a.m. Sunday services in La 
Placita during his tenure. For Olivares, though, church teachings extended well 
beyond weekly celebrations of the Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I come to my final judgment, the Lord is not going to ask how many times 
I went to Mass," Olivares once said. "I know what I will be asked: 'When I was 
hungry, did you feed me? . . . When I was naked, did you clothe me? . . . When 
I was a foreigner in your midst, did you take me in?' "

$6 MILLION PAID TO CITY LOBBYISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lobbyists were paid nearly $6 million in 1993 to influence decisions at Los 
Angeles City Hall and contributed $230,000 to the campaigns of the city's 
elected officials, according to a report released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 25 top lobbying firms reported receiving two-thirds of the fees, the 
report by the city Ethics Commission said. 
</P>
<P>
 The highest fees were paid by the developer of the Warner Ridge commercial 
project in Woodland Hills ($168,000) and Lockheed Air Terminal ($158,000), 
which holds contracts at Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 A City Council committee Wednesday will discuss amendments to the city ethics 
law that could force more lobbyists to report their earnings. One change would 
attempt to increase reporting by lawyers, many of whom cite attorney-client 
confidentiality in refusing to report their lobbying earnings.

SANTA ANA MEXICAN CENTER CRAFTS PLAN; ARTS: CASA DE LA CULTURA STILL HAS NO 
HOME AND LITTLE FUNDING, BUT WITH MEXICO'S BACKING, DIRECTORS HOPE TO EXPAND 
ITS BASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A cultural center was officially launched at the Mexican Consulate on Monday, 
as Latino community leaders applauded the months-long planning that already has 
brought one nationally acclaimed Mexican artist here to perform. 
</P>
<P>
 The center will bring knowledge and a much-needed pride in their heritage to 
local Latino youths, while chipping away at discrimination in Orange County, 
community leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it will give an opportunity to allay a tremendous apprehension about 
diversity in Orange County," said Amin David, chairman of Los Amigos of Orange 
County.  
</P>
<P>
 "When we can put forth our most magnificent contributions to society, in all 
the arts, I think we'll be forming a base of much more acceptance, and fear and 
apprehension will be diminished. It's just a very constructive direction to go 
in." 
</P>
<P>
 The Casa de la Cultura de Mexico still has no home and only minimal funding, 
but the festivities marked a commitment by Felipe Soria Ayusa, Mexican consul 
for Orange County, and the center's nascent 52 members to see to it that those 
things follow soon. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday evening, about 100 people, from business people to artists and 
academics, crowded into the consulate to praise the effort, listen to mariachi 
music and enjoy a buffet that featured gourmet dishes from five Mexican states. 
</P>
<P>
 The center is modeled on cultural institutes across the country that bring 
top-notch musicians and artists here with the help of the Mexican government. 
</P>
<P>
 While board members stressed that the center will be politically neutral, the 
idea was born of an increased effort by Mexican President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari to reach out to Mexican nationals living abroad, Soria said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Casa de la Cultura will specifically reach out to Latino youth to provide 
a sense of identity and also serve as "a seed of understanding" in the larger 
community, board President Ninfa Duran told the gathering. 
</P>
<P>
 Members said they expect nonprofit status to be secured from the state within 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of the major things we need in our community here, in order to teach 
our kids our own traditions. Some of our kids don't even know anything about 
Mexico," said Frank Alaniz, the center's treasurer and the executive director 
of Grupo Renacimiento, which offers aerobics, gymnastics, tae kwon do and 
Mexican folklorico dance classes to youth in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Alaniz said many Latino youths absorb negative stereotypes of Mexican 
immigrants and are unaware of Mexican cultural contributions. With the center, 
he said, "they're going to have more room to visualize what are our own roots . 
. . how it was in the past and how it can be in the future. They're going to be 
more proud -- proud to be Latino -- so that way they will be able to contribute 
more to the community here in the United States. They will also be proud to be 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Soria said Mayor Daniel H. Young and Councilman Miguel A. Pulido Jr. have 
expressed support for the project, and community leaders said Monday that they 
will seek more concrete support as they look for funding and a building. 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting support from the city will be crucial," said Santa Ana attorney Jess 
J. Araujo. "But we basically are prepared to start up in an interim fashion. " 
</P>
<P>
 A November performance by Mexico City performer Viola Trigo at Santa Ana High 
School gave the current members a taste for the type of events to come, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trigo, a powerful singer who performs traditional Mexican folk songs, was 
brought to town by the Mexican consulate. 
</P>
<P>
 Several painting exhibits are now being planned, and the Mexican government 
has offered to send teachers to the area in July and August to educate Orange 
County's Latino children about Mexican culture, Soria said. 
</P>
<P>
 The board is having a contest for the design of a logo for the cultural 
center. The contest is open to all, and entries should be submitted to the 
Mexican consulate. 
</P>
<P>
 Community leaders credited Soria with promoting the center and securing 
support from the Mexican government. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just very happy that we have a consul who took this on and decided to 
make it a priority and secure support from the Mexican government," Araujo 
said. "He sought out key people in the community and was able to demonstrate to 
us how it's been done in other places. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on the population of Mexicans we have in Orange County, this probably 
could have been done earlier . . . but what really helped was having the consul 
say, 'This is front burner.' That just motivated all of us."

MYSTERIES OF MOTHER EARTH, OTHER WORLDS; SPACE: LEARNING AND MAKING SENSE OF 
PLANETARY SCIENCE IS MISSION OF SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO RESEARCH INSTITUTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The boy in the front row held up an uglyrock, gray, jagged and dirty. "It's a 
meteorite!" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl in the second row wanted to know how close she could come to the sun 
before she and her spaceship blew apart in a ball of fire. 
</P>
<P>
 And the girl in the back asked, with the weight of the world etched in her 
face, whether we will "ever be able to repair the ozone layer." 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas B. Nash, 61, fielded each question patiently, as 80 area students 
spent a morning learning about space at the San Juan Capistrano Research 
Institute, which receives $500,000 a year from the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration, partly for conducting such "Q&A" get-togethers. 
</P>
<P>
 Nash told the boy his rock might be a meteorite but probably wasn't. (A long 
discussion about meteorites ensued.) He told the girl that standing in her back 
yard could generate plenty of damage from the sun. (A discussion about 
ultraviolet rays ensued.) And he told the other girl that human beings are 
doing all they can to damage the ozone through the excesses of industry and 
commerce. Unless society changes, he warned his listeners, the future looks 
bleak. 
</P>
<P>
 Such mornings are not uncommon at the 6-year-old institute, which addresses 
more than 3,000 schoolchildren a year on planetary science, Nash's forte and 
that of three other staff scientists, each of whom obtains grants from NASA for 
studies of the stars. In addition to research, the institute's roles are 
education, science workshops for teachers and major conferences on all things 
planetary. 
</P>
<P>
 Confabs with Orange County students are a small part of an institute whose 
high-powered focus often leads to new approaches on NASA space missions or 
brings together some of the world's most renowned planetary authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The institute's mission, Nash said, is to learn as much as possible about 
planetary science and then apply it to "the environment -- on a scale that's 
bigger than our city, county, nation or world. I'm talking here about other 
worlds." 
</P>
<P>
 NASA administrators credit Nash with conducting a workshop a year and a half 
ago at which more than 70 new concepts were presented that later helped shape 
some of the agency's unmanned planetary missions. And yet despite being 
appreciated by NASA, the institute is, like others specializing in planetary 
science, under constant threat of losing its funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, scientists applaud the institute for having created a small-scale 
think tank in a scenic environment, free from the bureaucratic tangle of 
mammoth agencies and institutions. And civic officials here commend Nash's work 
for recommending the city for something other than swallows and its famous 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
 The institute began as Nash's attempt to free himself from bureaucratic 
constraints and put his own job closer to home. As a 30-year research scientist 
and science program manager of the renowned Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 
Pasadena, he was one of the first commuters to travel daily between South 
County and Los Angeles via Amtrak. 
</P>
<P>
 Nash calls JPL, a branch of Caltech, "a very powerful organization that has 
achieved tremendous things for our country, but it's a ponderous beast at 
times. Scientists, as a rule, tend to be particularly perturbed by 
bureaucracy." 
</P>
<P>
 He worked at JPL until 1992, four years after founding the institute, which 
got its start through a $15,000 contribution from private donors in conjunction 
with a matching grant from the city of San Juan Capistrano, which Nash formerly 
served as a city councilman and mayor. His wife, Carolyn Nash, is now a 
councilwoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, the Birtcher Corp. provided the institute office space free of 
charge. In 1989, when Nash moved his nine-person staff to a former bank branch 
owned by Birtcher, the city kicked in with a $6,000-a-month rent subsidy that 
totaled more than $200,000 before expiring last year. The institute now pays 
its own rent, Nash said, and has a payroll of $280,000 a year for the entire 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Nash's problems are entirely about money. His "annual crisis" is 
persuading NASA to renew its $500,000 appropriation -- no small task in a 
deficit era that appears hell-bent on claiming planetary science as a victim. 
Nash said the institute is in no danger of folding but he does hope to 
cultivate sources of private funding that can compensate for a government 
shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, his brainchild continues to flourish. The institute has played host 
to a series of international conferences attended by scientists from NASA, the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Caltech, the University of Paris, the 
University of Tokyo and several famous Max Planck institutes in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Brinton, acting chief of the planetary science branch of the solar 
system exploratory division of NASA, calls Nash "a highly respected scientist 
in the planetary science community," whose specialty is the study of planetary 
satellite surfaces and their composition and characteristics. 
</P>
<P>
 Brinton said the agency applauds Nash for having expanded the scope of the 
institute to include education and "interactions with young people, which is an 
important focus of NASA's program today." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the institute has been "well ahead of the game in computer 
visualization -- taking scientific imaging data and manipulating it by using a 
computer to enhance various characteristics of the image you're looking at. You 
can view surfaces from different angles as if you're flying over them in an 
airplane. All of these computer-graphic visual aids are of immense value to 
scientists in better understanding their data." 
</P>
<P>
 Nash has devoted much of his own career to the study of Io, an obscure moon of 
the planet Jupiter. His eyes widen as he talks about Io's high temperatures and 
volatile activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has a surface completely in turmoil," he said. "In my opinion, it's the 
most intriguing body outside the earth. It has active volcanism of an 
extraordinary extent, far more than that of earth. It has a surface enriched in 
sulfur, much in the way the earth's surface is enriched in water." 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that such work even occurs here is celebrated by city officials, who 
say the institute brings a unique dimension to a town known largely for its 
birds. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of interest in our mission and in our swallows," said 
Councilman Gary Hausdorfer. "But the institute is drawing scientists from 
around the world, and NASA has acknowledged that valuable planetary research is 
going on right here in San Juan Capistrano." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that the institute has been without controversy. In 1992, Santa Ana real 
estate investor James Meehan filed a complaint with the state Fair Political 
Practices Commission claiming that then-council candidate Carolyn Nash failed 
to report on her campaign forms the $6,000 monthly rent subsidy made by the 
city to her husband's institute. The city made rent subsidies of more than 
$200,000 to the institute between 1988 and 1992, the complaint said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nash -- whom the FPPC later exonerated -- said she forgot to report the 
subsidy. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband calls the episode "a very unfortunate and painful experience. It 
merely portrayed how low people can reach in trying to achieve their political 
ends." 
</P>
<P>
 If anything, the dispute underscored how daunting a role finances play in the 
institute's profile. 
</P>
<P>
 "NASA funding is flat, and it's causing a lot of stress within the system," 
Doug Nash said. "Small organizations like ours are even more vulnerable. We 
don't have the momentum of the large organizations." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he voted for Clinton and supports the President's efforts -- in local 
politics, Nash and his wife are strictly slow-growth -- he bemoans the 
Administration's lack of emphasis within NASA on planetary science, the 
institute's lifeblood. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President has drawn his priorities in such a way that space science is at 
the bottom of the heap," Nash said. "Even within NASA, they have ranked the 
space station at the top, followed by aeronautics, then technology, then the 
'mission to planet Earth,' or so-called Earth science, then planetary science." 
</P>
<P>
 Nash believes planetary science holds the answers to a multitude of problems, 
not the least of which is depletion of the ozone layer and the spread of 
so-called greenhouse gases. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the institute's research, currently going on with other scientists 
from around the world on the Yungfraujoch mountain in Switzerland, seeks to use 
infrared radiation to "explore chemical components in the earth's atmosphere, 
particularly the ozone layer." 
</P>
<P>
 Funding woes trouble Nash for the limitations they impose on such work. He for 
one hopes the United States returns to the moon someday -- preferably to its 
so-called "dark side" -- which he says would afford mankind the best space 
station and telescope site imaginable, higher than any point on earth and free 
from most of Earth's magnetic field. 
</P>
<P>
 If nothing else, he said, it would give him something to talk about when all 
those school kids come to visit. 
</P>
<P>
 "As scientists, we're happy to share that knowledge as soon as possible," Nash 
said. "Plus, it's just flat-out fun to see the light in a student's eyes. As a 
scientist and as a person, that's something you live for."

IT'S THE LAW, EVEN IF STRANGE; ORDINANCES: THE CITY OF ORANGE MADE A ROUTINE 
REVIEW OF ITS MUNICIPAL CODE AND TURNED UP SOME LEGAL ODDITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At least now if you get caught telling fortunes without a license, you 
probably won't have to appear in court. 
</P>
<P>
 The same goes for failing to take out the trash every week, or even being 
cited for public nudity. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal Court in Santa Ana recently asked the city of Orange to review the 
bail amounts it has set for such misdemeanor crimes, which are spelled out in 
the city's voluminous municipal code book. 
</P>
<P>
 The court periodically requests such reviews to ensure that bail amounts are 
fair, and are not so high that defendants feel they have to fight every charge 
in court, which could create a logjam in the justice system. 
</P>
<P>
 When Orange completed its review this month, most bail amounts remained 
unchanged. But city attorneys took the opportunity to modify their penalties, 
recommending that the court allow some offenders to forfeit their bail money 
instead of appearing in court. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, public nudity, accumulation of trash and fortune-telling without 
a business license previously would have required the accused to tell it to the 
judge -- in person. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the revisions, which still have to be approved by the court, 
first-time offenders will be able to post bail and forgo a court appearance 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is more than an exercise in expediency," said Orange Assistant City 
Atty. Stan Soo-Hoo. "The court is trying to make the process more efficient." 
</P>
<P>
 But most of these lesser-known misdemeanors, which carry bail amounts from $50 
to $150, are rarely enforced, Orange authorities concede. They can recall 
occasional nudity citations, but none for neglecting to take out the trash 
every week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen a (trash) ticket," said Soo-Hoo, who supervised Orange's bail 
review. "I don't know if there's a practical way to measure one week's worth of 
garbage. Usually these kinds of laws are made with the public's health and 
safety in mind." 
</P>
<P>
 The city's bail review process, however, brought to light a host of other 
legal oddities buried in its 715-page municipal code. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange apparently has little faith in domesticating some creatures of "a wild 
nature." Anyone caught making pets out of piranhas, walking catfish, or 
nonpoisonous snakes over six feet long will have to part with $55, according to 
the new bail schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 And those humans wild enough to expose their private parts to public view are 
also out of luck, and will have to surrender $150 to the county court if cited. 
Children ages 10 and under, and thespians performing in live theater, however, 
can run around naked if they like, according to the code. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps one of the most peculiar rules appears in Section 17.78.160 of the 
city's Municipal Code. According to this section, residents with balloons 
exceeding 30 inches in diameter have technically run afoul of the law, and will 
have to post bail of $50. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's balloon restriction surprised even Municipal Court veteran Pierre 
Poudevigne. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are local ordinances of all extremities," said the administrative 
services assistant, who has been with the court for 29 years. "But in my tenure 
here, I haven't seen too many odd ones like a 30-inch balloon" ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 But Orange authorities say the law serves a useful purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is consistent with our sign ordinance," said police Lt. Ed Tunstall. 
"It's to prevent one business from getting an advantage over another." 
</P>
<P>
 Though it has been nearly a decade since Orange last revised its bail 
schedule, the city recommended few increased bail amounts to the court. But 
officials did seek higher bail amounts on several offenses related to the sale 
and public consumption of alcohol. The largest hike came for drinking in 
public, which shot up from $50 to $150. 
</P>
<P>
 And under the old bail schedules, people caught relieving themselves in public 
faced costs of $100. Now it's $150. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city lowered some of its bail amounts, too. Bail for improperly 
soliciting for charitable or religious purposes or failing to post a business 
tax certificate tumbled from $150 to $70. 
</P>
<P>
 "We looked at the bail schedule for consistency," Soo-Hoo said. "We didn't 
want a minor offense to have a higher bail than a more serious one."

NEW RAMS STADIUM UNREALISTIC, OFFICIALS SAY; SPORTS: FOUR OUT OF FIVE ANAHEIM 
COUNCIL MEMBERS SAY IT IS UNLIKELY THE CITY WOULD BUILD A CENTER TO KEEP THE 
TEAM FROM MOVING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A majority of City Council members say it is unrealistic for the city to 
consider building a new football stadium as a way of stopping the Los Angeles 
Rams from moving away. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, which has been floated by Mayor Tom Daly as part of a plan to 
prevent a Rams departure, has received little or no support from all four of 
Daly's fellow council members in an informal poll last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will meet tonight in closed session to discuss what the city's 
negotiating stance with the Rams should be. Daly's council colleagues have 
criticized him for trying to move forward on proposals that do not yet have the 
backing of a council majority. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tom may have an agenda of his own," Councilman Irv Pickler said, "but he has 
to be careful not to act for the council on stuff. It takes three votes. I 
don't care if you're mayor or whatnot. It takes three." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilmen Pickler, Fred Hunter, Frank Feldhaus and Bob D. Simpson said they 
would prefer to find out what demands the Rams will make on the city before 
they move forward on further negotiations with the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they did not completely rule out the idea of a football stadium, they 
said it is only a remote reality, especially when the city is grappling with 
other more pressing problems, such as a $9-million budget shortfall.  
</P>
<P>
 Under Daly's plan, the city would create a sports and entertainment center 
that would link Anaheim Stadium, Anaheim Arena and a football stadium with 
Disneyland, the convention center and the city's other tourist attractions. 
Additionally, Daly has said the city should investigate building a large retail 
center near the stadium, similar to CityWalk in Universal City, where sports 
fans could dine and shop before and after games. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly said he is not sure how the football stadium would be financed but said 
he would look to the private sector to back it, much like the Anaheim Arena 
project was done. The arena was largely paid for by Ogden Corp. in exchange for 
rights to manage the facility for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "A few years ago it was unclear how the arena project was going to get off the 
ground," Daly said. "Anything is possible if we put our minds together to find 
solutions." 
</P>
<P>
 But the rest of the council said they think it is unlikely that a private 
party, like Ogden, would be willing to build a stadium, allow the team to play 
there virtually rent-free and then give the club all the revenue from parking, 
luxury suites and concessions, like the city of Baltimore reportedly has 
offered to do for the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who would do that?" Simpson asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's realistic," Pickler said. But, he added, if a stadium can 
be built without jeopardizing city funds, "more power to him. I guess I 
wouldn't rule anything out . . . but I don't think it's realistic." 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter said the idea of building a football stadium "is a joke."  
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way we're going to build a football stadium," he said. "For what? 
Eight games? Come on." 
</P>
<P>
 Feldhaus said he admires "Tom's aggressiveness in the matter, but most 
assuredly I would not put the city at risk for the Rams or any other football 
team." He added that he does not believe the city should pursue a stadium 
proposal. "I think building our community center is more important than a 
football stadium," Feldhaus said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rams officials have told the city that they intend to exercise an escape 
clause in their stadium lease May 3 and look to move to a city with greater 
financial opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly dismisses the criticism of his proposal and says he is only trying to 
prevent the football club from fleeing the city. At the same time, his plan 
could revitalize an area of the city that has tremendous economic potential, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are things we should be looking at whether the team stays or goes," 
Daly said. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly acknowledged that the departure by the Rams is not "nearly as much as a 
concern as other issues like crime and taxes. Those issues are at the forefront 
of the political agenda." 
</P>
<P>
 At least two council members, Pickler and Hunter, have publicly said that 
regardless of what the city offers, they do not believe the Rams will remain in 
Anaheim. They said the city must try not to alienate the California Angels, who 
also play at the stadium, while trying to accommodate the Rams.  
</P>
<P>
 When asked about the likelihood of the Rams staying in Anaheim, Hunter simply 
waved his hand and said: "They're gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Pickler said as far as he is concerned, "the Rams are out of here. I've had it 
with their attitude. My main concern now is the Angels and doing what we can to 
extend their lease, not the Rams."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM AIRING SET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council tonight will discuss a campaign finance reform proposal aimed 
at closing election-law loopholes. 
</P>
<P>
 The reforms, proposed by the Irvine League of Women Voters, probably will 
undergo review by the city attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Under campaign rules adopted in 1977, a contributor can give a maximum of $190 
to each candidate in an Irvine election. 
</P>
<P>
 But the $190 limit does not apply to political action committees and other 
groups that have no official connection to a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 The new proposals would extend the $190 cap to PACs and other "independent" 
campaign groups. The reforms would also prohibit city employees from asking 
firms that do business with Irvine to contribute to a candidate's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's meeting will also feature a briefing from the Irvine Co. on a 
proposal to create affordable housing units for seniors.SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA NEWPORT BEACH; DISTRICT TO RELEASE SCHOOL AUDIT 
RESULTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Newport-Mesa Unified School District will disclose the results of its 
first curriculum audit at the Board of Education meeting tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 The districtwide evaluation was done in December by a team of auditors who 
analyzed how well the district educates its students. At the board meeting 
tonight, a representative from the auditing agency will make a detailed 
presentation of the results of the study. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a good school district, and we want to continue to get better," Supt. 
Mac Bernd said. "The only way to do that is to find out exactly what we need to 
do" to improve. 
</P>
<P>
 A team of auditors from the National Curriculum Audit Center of the American 
Assn. of School Administrators spent a week in district classrooms, pored over 
thousands of policy documents, test scores and salary schedules, and 
interviewed teachers and administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the process, school officials had said they anticipated that the 
audit would expose the district's weaknesses and make suggestions for 
improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Sue Greene, the lead auditor on this project, said in a statement Monday that 
there are "no limitations to Newport-Mesa success that . . . could not be 
overcome with time, strategic planning, leadership, modifications of policies 
and practices, professional teamwork and community support." 
</P>
<P>
 The audit will, for example, compare the math curriculum at every elementary, 
middle and high school in the district. It also will examine the district 
organizational structure and use of resources. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes a lot of courage for school districts to do these," Bernd said. 
</P>
<P>
 The $32,500 audit is being paid from interest earned on the $4-million 
endowment fund set up by the Irvine Co. to improve school curricula. The 
special meeting begins at 6 p.m. at the Harper Community Center, 425 E. 18th 
St., in Costa Mesa. One hundred copies of the audit report will be available 
for the public.BOB ELSTON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; SAMPLING A JAPANESE TRADITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For 18 elementary students from St. Catherine's Military School in Anaheim, 
Thanksgiving came eight months early this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the young cadets and their teachers passed on the sweet yams and mashed 
potatoes, instead indulging in o-hagi and kusa dango, two traditional Japanese 
rice dishes coated with special spices. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of Dohyo Restaurant in Orange, the students celebrated the 
Japanese version of Thanksgiving called Higan. The holiday marks the first day 
of spring with a traditional feast. 
</P>
<P>
 "Similar to Thanksgiving here in the United States, Higan is a day where the 
Japanese give thanks for the bountiful crops received during the previous year 
and pray that next year's harvest is as plentiful," said Russell Tyson, the 
general manager of the restaurant that treated the students to a traditional 
Higan meal. "We hope to share our heritage with the students and demonstrate 
how similar, indeed, our cultures really are." 
</P>
<P>
 With the supervision of the restaurant staff, the students were allowed to 
prepare and shape their own rice dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 "You mush it together to give it a sticky consistency," explained Tyson. "So 
you can smush it into a ball." 
</P>
<P>
 If that wasn't clear enough, head waitress Miki Mizushima, offered this hint 
for making the specialty dish: "You've played with Play-Doh before? It's like 
that exactly." 
</P>
<P>
 Though a little hesitant at first to try the new food, the students enjoyed 
the Higan treat. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sticky and it's different," said Matthew Geiger, 8, of Yorba Linda. "But 
it's good." 
</P>
<P>
 The hands-on approach to feasting obviously appealed to students, some of whom 
said they prefer Higan to its American counterpart. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a little better," said Brian Rayner, a 9-year-old from Costa 
Mesa. "They get to make things. In America, things get cooked and it's just 
there for you." 
</P>
<P>
 Instructors at St. Catherine's Military School appreciated the opportunity to 
expose their students to the customs of another culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we want to do is to educate them completely," said Sister Elvera, a 
teacher at St. Catherine's. "We couldn't do this on our own." MARTIN MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; AGENCY OKS PLAN FOR YOUTH PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city's Community Redevelopment Agency voted Monday to spend nearly 
$500,000 for a program that trains youth to fix up dilapidated housing in their 
own neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 At its regular meeting, the agency authorized its staff to draft an agreement 
with the California Conservation Corps., Southern California Gas Co., the 
Carpenters Union and Central County Regional Occupation Program to implement 
the program -- dubbed YES, for Youth Education and Service. 
</P>
<P>
 The funds will be rerouted from an existing redevelopment agency program that 
provides for emergency or exterior repairs for low and very low income 
residents and the elderly. But the YES program will focus specifically on the 
city's federally designated Operation Weed and Seed area. 
</P>
<P>
 The labor will be provided by the CCC, which began recruiting youths for the 
program last week, said Norm Canchola, a neighborhood specialist with the 
agency's housing department. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, 1992, the city received a $1.1-million U.S. Department of Justice 
grant for Operation Weed and Seed, designed to "weed out" crime in Santa Ana's 
roughest neighborhoods and "seed" the afflicted areas with social-service 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 All the money was spent on law enforcement efforts, Canchola said, so the YES 
program will be funded with the other redevelopment funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "This provides training for the youth and in addition offers some educational 
possibilities for them, while also getting the maintenance work done that needs 
to be done," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Youths will be trained in carpentry, painting and lead abatement, among other 
things. 
</P>
<P>
 The city received an additional $200,000 Justice Department grant last month 
to continue the "weeding" portion of the program and is now applying for a 
$300,000 grant that would be earmarked specifically for "seeding." LEE ROMNEY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; CITY TO CONSIDER FILLING PANEL VACANCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council today will consider whether to fill a vacancy on an advisory 
citizen panel that reviews disciplinary actions against employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The Merit Commission has been without a third member since Earl French 
resigned last month after he was appointed to the city's Planning 
Commission.The two other members are Anji D. Clemens and Randy Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Panel members, who can be reappointed after serving two years, are chosen from 
among educators, the clergy and the public. French was the public 
representative. Clemens is assistant principal at Westminster High School and 
Hill is pastor of the First Nazarene Church. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel is authorized under city code to hold public hearings on matters 
relating to employees, including appeals from suspension, dismissal or 
demotion, and make recommendations to the council. 
</P>
<P>
 One case the panel is likely to tackle immediately involves Paul Gilbrook, the 
president of the firefighters union who was fired last month following 
allegations of payroll fraud and for driving a firetruck with a suspended 
driver's license two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, acting City Manager Robert Huntley denied Gilbrook's appeal. Alan 
C. Davis, Gilbrook's lawyer, said Monday that they may appeal to the Merit 
Commission but will first insist on non-binding arbitration to try to resolve 
the case, as provided for in the firefighters' contract.BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; STATION TO GET SYSTEM TO REMOVE FUMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Officials plan to clear the air at the city's fire station headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned about diesel exhaust fumes, which are a health hazard, the City 
Council last week unanimously approved the purchase and installation of a 
diesel exhaust removal system at a cost of about $14,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Chief Bernard F. Heimos said the diesel engine emissions include 
substances, including benzene, that can cause cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 These byproducts of diesel exhaust can be harmful to firefighters since fumes 
can spread to eating, sleeping, physical fitness rooms and offices within the 
fire station, Heimos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week's vote to purchase equipment demonstrated that the council "put 
firefighters' safety as a high priority," Heimos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor John Collins said the council's decision is a sign of the times. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've become sensitive to those items in our atmosphere that can cause 
(health) problems," Collins said. "The council wants to take every measure to 
make sure our firefighters are not subjected to this type of carcinogen." 
</P>
<P>
 Heimos said that every time a firetruck engine is started to respond to an 
emergency call, firefighters stand nearby to put on their safety gear and are 
exposed to high levels of diesel exhaust. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to provide an atmosphere that is free of certain levels of diesel 
exhaust," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The existing system of vent panels and exhaust fan are inadequate to get fumes 
out of the station, at 17737 Bushard St., Heimos said. 
</P>
<P>
 New equipment uses a vacuum hose with an inflatable cuff that attaches to the 
diesel exhaust pipe and draws out emissions, releasing them outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Heimos said the city's other fire station, Station No. 2 on 16767 Newhope St., 
already has an adequate air-exchange system within the building. DEBRA CANO

 For at least six years, school officials have looked into the possibility of 
converting the Maple Community Center into a K-6 school, but have been 
unsuccessful in raising the more than $1 million necessary, said Pat Puleo, 
director of instructional services for Fullerton School District. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, the school board has focused on the less expensive possibility 
of opening a kindergarten at the site. According to Puleo, the cost of opening 
a kindergarten for 60 children would be $322,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight the school board will debate whether to open a kindergarten at Maple 
starting in September, 1995, and whether to begin advertising for bids for the 
renovation project. Registration for kindergarten begins April 6, and the board 
wants to decide if Maple will be on the list before that date. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Karen Chavez expressed concern during the last meeting over the 
cost of opening the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Several board members also expressed doubt as to whether parents and children 
are best served by a kindergarten at the center, since youngsters will be bused 
out of the area for the rest of their education once they complete 
kindergarten. 
</P>
<P>
 They worried that the children would be separated from their friends and 
thrust into a foreign environment when they reached the first grade. 
</P>
<P>
 Maple Elementary School was closed in 1971 because of racial imbalance, and 
students were bused out of the area in anticipation of a court order on 
desegregation. 
</P>
<P>
 But other board members argued that many of the children already attend the 
Head Start program at Maple and that a kindergarten would allow the children to 
stay close to their families and friends for one more year while they are still 
very young. 
</P>
<P>
 Parent Lilia Garcia said a local school would allow parents to participate in 
the children's beginning education. "I want to help and participate, but when 
it's so far away, I can't do it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We keep saying that we can't do the whole thing (a K-6 school), so we're not 
going to do anything at all, and that's unfair," said board member Elena 
Reyes-Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're long overdue in making a demonstrated commitment to that neighborhood," 
board member Rosamaria Gomez-Amaro agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Reyes-Jones added that the board should open the kindergarten as a first step 
and then work to raise money to open eventually a K-6 school at the site. MARY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; GAY GAMES IV TO GET O.C. CONTINGENT OF 86 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard C. Grauman had a dream during a trip to the nation's capital to 
participate in last May's gay march on Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 His reverie was to organize gay and lesbian athletes in Orange County to 
participate in the 1994 Gay Games in New York City this June. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orange County has these blinders on that (locally) there are no gay 
athletes," said Grauman, 31, who is homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
 With little more than two months remaining, the Anaheim resident has organized 
86 athletes who will compete and represent Orange County in New York's 
Olympic-style competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has gone way beyond what I had ever dreamed of -- this has opened a new 
door to the gay and lesbian community," said Grauman, who will compete in 
racquetball events. "I look at the professions of the people going: lawyers, 
doctors, certified public accountants, financial planners, construction 
workers, and yet, they're all athletes." 
</P>
<P>
 As founder and captain of TEAM Orange County, Grauman worked thousands of 
hours to organize local athletes for Gay Games IV. The games are expected to 
draw more than 15,000 gay and straight participants from throughout the world 
in 31 individual and team sports. The games will be held from June 18 to 25. 
</P>
<P>
 "My medal has been working with TEAM Orange County and the friendships that 
have developed," Grauman said. "We've all worked so hard. If I won a medal, it 
would be the icing on the cake." 
</P>
<P>
 Grauman, a medical case manager for adults with head injuries, said: "There 
isn't the pressure of winning or losing. The whole emphasis is on doing your 
best. . . . You can feel proud of who you are." 
</P>
<P>
 Others share Grauman's spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 Darin Bence, 27, co-captain of the team, will be competing for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always been an athlete regardless of my sexuality. I did athletics 
because it's the masculine part of me," said Bence, a Laguna Beach triathlete 
who started swimming at age 5. A massage therapist, Bence said going to the Gay 
Games is a chance to change the way people think about the gay community. "I 
want to show America that we're the neighbor next door," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 TEAM Orange County member Nancy Schroeder, 36, of Huntington Beach, had hoped 
to be a contender in the swimming competitions in the 1976 Montreal Olympic 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
 She didn't make the team. 
</P>
<P>
 After quitting swimming 18 years ago, Schroeder, a mortgage banker who is gay, 
now has a second chance to compete for a gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still have the competitiveness," she said. "I'd like to win a medal." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Ammon, a swimmer and Laguna Beach psychologist, brought four gold 
medals home from the 1986 Gay Games. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the biggest statement people can participate in as gay and lesbian 
people," said Ammon, 53. "It's a celebration of a lifestyle. It is so 
affirming. It's a sorely needed antidote to the bigotry we're surrounded with."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: YORBA LINDA; HEARING TO BE HELD ON SMOKING BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three to four times a week, Don Baker has lunch at the Main Street Restaurant. 
Usually, he ends his meals with two things: a drink from the bar and a couple 
of cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker considers his cigarette habit -- and that of countless other residents, 
workers and visitors in the city -- a personal choice, but it is about to 
become the subject of public debate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission will hold a public hearing Wednesday on an amendment 
to the city's anti-smoking ordinance that would ban lighting up in all public 
places and places of employment. 
</P>
<P>
 The ban was proposed last month by Councilman Henry W. Wedaa, who cited a 
city-sponsored survey that indicated more than 70% of residents support such a 
ban. The survey, which polled 400 residents, was conducted last June. 
</P>
<P>
 "Secondhand smoke is a killer," Wedaa said. "More than 430,000 people die each 
year as a direct result of smoking. How many die in Yorba Linda, I wonder." 
</P>
<P>
 Wedaa wants the council to approve the amendment soon, using the public 
hearing process to gather reaction from residents. But at least two other 
councilmen want to place the matter before the voters in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have people knocking on my door," asking for a ban, said Councilman 
John M. Gullixson. "Let's put it on the ballot and let the people regulate 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Daniel T. Welch also wants residents to vote on a ban. It would 
cost the city about $10,000 to put the measure on the ballot. The financial 
effect of imposing a smoking ban has not been calculated. 
</P>
<P>
 If the amendment is adopted as written, Yorba Linda would be the first North 
County city to enact the ban and would join Laguna Hills as the only cities in 
the county to ban smoking in both restaurants and workplaces. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar ban was adopted late last year by the Board of Supervisors, but it 
affects only unincorporated areas of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Americans for Nonsmokers Rights, four Orange County cities have 
enacted smoking bans for restaurants: Dana Point, Huntington Beach and Laguna 
Beach, which are phasing in the ban, and San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 By his own reckoning, Baker spends between $100 and $200 a week treating 
colleagues to lunch and entertaining clients at Main Street. But that would 
change if the ban was approved. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very simply, I won't come here if I can't enjoy a cigarette," Baker said. "I 
will never visit a restaurant that does not have a smoking section. I would 
rather bring my lunch to work and eat it in the park." 
</P>
<P>
 While restaurant owners have not yet voiced much opposition publicly to the 
proposed ban, Gullixson said several who he had talked to feared it would hurt 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said if it was a countywide ban, it would not affect business," 
Gullixson said. "But if it's just in Yorba Linda, smokers will drive 
elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Roslyn Ruocco, owner of Main Street Restaurant, said she opposes a ban on 
smoking in restaurants for philosophical, not just financial, reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't feel (the city) should be able to take that privilege away," 
said Ruocco, a former smoker. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruocco estimated that most of her customers do not smoke and said the smoking 
section is often empty. Reserving several tables and booths for smokers could 
be costing her money, she admits, because the nonsmoking section fills up 
faster and nonsmoking patrons often must wait for a table in that section. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Ruocco said, "I prefer to save a spot for my few customers who 
enjoy smoking." DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAKE FOREST; COUNCIL TO DISCUSS DRIVE-BY SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The hail of bullets didn't hit anyone, but a botched drive-by shooting last 
week has prompted a special City Council meeting at 5 p.m. today to deal with 
gang problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will hear about the community's concerns and discuss what City 
Hall can do to help Orange County sheriff's investigators find whomever fired a 
gun from a passing car on Tama Lane last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Ann Van Haun said investigators suspect there were gang ties in 
the drive-by incident and that local students may be involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "We called the meeting to talk about what we can do to help," she said. "We're 
not going to stand by and not do anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Van Haun said that options before the council range from offering a reward for 
information leading to the gunman's arrest to discussing with school 
administrators ways the city might ease gang-related problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to take a stand right here," said Van Haun. "We don't want to 
wait for things to get worse." FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA; BANDS NOT PERMITTED TO PRACTICE AT PUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The owner of O'Leary's Pub said those bands playing at his bar were only 
practicing. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said rehearsals or no, the bands were providing live 
entertainment -- and O'Leary's doesn't have a permit for that. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since the council revoked a permit for live entertainment from O'Leary's 
Pub six months ago, officials said, owner Ronald Slutsky has continued to 
provide such entertainment on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 His permit allows Slutsky to provide entertainment in the form of a jukebox, a 
pool table and a dart game only. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have not violated the permit," Slutsky said recently. "The bands practice. 
I don't pay them." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Steven C. Anderson responded: "Mr. Slutsky's playing word games 
with us." 
</P>
<P>
 Council members have decided to allow Slutsky to continue operating his bar 
with "absolutely no live entertainment, practicing, rehearsing or playing." 
</P>
<P>
 The council also required that Slutsky's permit be reviewed in 90 days. MIMI

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT; HARBOR RENOVATION TO AFFECT BOAT SLIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 County officials are warning sailors up and down the Southern California coast 
of an impending shortage of boat slips while a three-month renovation project 
at the popular Dana Point Harbor is underway. 
</P>
<P>
 The logjam will mainly affect boats that use the harbor as a stopover while 
traveling between San Diego and Los Angeles. Boat owners who rent slips in Dana 
Point will be moved to guest slips while reconstruction is done. 
</P>
<P>
 A very limited number of spots will be open to visiting vessels, but those are 
expected to fill up quickly. The county has notified maritime publications and 
sent letters to area yacht clubs about the space shortage.FRANK MESSINA

COUNTY SEEKS BETTER ACCESS TO PARK; COURTS: OFFICIALS SUE TO BAR A HOMEOWNERS 
GROUP IN LAGUNA NIGUEL FROM RESTRICTING PARKING ON STREET NEAR BADLANDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 County officials have filed suit in an effort to force a homeowners 
association to remove no-parking signs and red paint from curbs, which they 
contend illegally block the public from using a seven-acre county park with 
spectacular ocean views. 
</P>
<P>
 In its lawsuit filed Friday in Orange County Superior Court, the county 
contends that Monarch Point Homeowners Assn., is preventing county residents 
from using a rugged ridgeline park known as Badlands by restricting use of Isle 
Vista Drive, the only dedicated public access. 
</P>
<P>
 According to allegations in the suit, the developer of the Monarch Point 
community in 1988 removed red paint from a curb along Isle Vista Drive and took 
down no-parking signs posted on the road in order to obtain a development 
permit under the State Coastal Act. 
</P>
<P>
 But then, the county suit says, about May or June of 1992, county officials 
discovered that "the red paint had been returned to the curb and no parking 
signs had been reinstated . . . ." The county says it has complained to the 
homeowners association, but to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
 Monarch Point Homeowners Assn. and its lawyer, William P. Hickey of Irvine, 
could not be reached Monday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the lawsuit seeking a judicial restraining order that would force the 
association to remove the signs and red paint said the association denies that 
the public's easement rights across Isle Vista Drive include the right to park 
cars next to Badlands Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit also contends that the homeowners association has illegally erected 
and maintained a locked gate along a portion of Isle Vista Drive, which 
obstructs public use of the park. 
</P>
<P>
 The county in its suit is requesting the court to levy a series of fines 
against the association, including $10,000 for each day the defendant may have 
been in violation of the Coastal Act.

SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES, COUNTY REACH TENTATIVE, THREE-YEAR CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK I. PINSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County sheriff's deputies ratified a tentative, three-year contract 
with the county Monday by an 84% margin, according to Robert MacLeod, the 
group's general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 On the two major economic issues, salary and monthly medical contributions, 
both sides gave some, MacLeod said. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be no salary increase the first year, but for each of the second 
and third years, the raise will be 3.5%, he said, essentially what the 
association sought. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the association agreed to increases in deputies' monthly contribution 
to medical insurance: $400 a month, beginning this June; $415 a month, 
beginning June of 1995; and $430 a month in June, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a lot closer to what they wanted than what we wanted," MacLeod said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides compromised on the remaining 12 issues on the table, he said, 
"because both sides wanted an agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 MacLeod said, "Negotiation is about compromise, and once you have an 
agreement, you're a fool if you're not happy about it." 
</P>
<P>
 On March 4, some deputies called in sick as part of a job action to protest a 
lack of progress in negotiations. The last negotiating session with the county 
was held March 15, MacLeod said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1,300 members of the association were able to vote in daylong balloting by 
fax, by telephone or in person, MacLeod said. Those who came to the 
association's headquarters could walk around a room where details of the 
proposed contract were enlarged to poster size and explained by members of the 
negotiating team. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just finished eight months of tough bargaining and four months without a 
contract," he said. "We're certainly willing to have it come to an end." 
</P>
<P>
 The new contract will begin running from the expiration of the previous pact, 
MacLeod said. The contract awaits final approval from the county Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're glad it's over, and I'm sure everyone involved is glad," he said. "It's 
a complex and tedious process. The smallest miscommunication can create the 
greatest problems."

END TO PREMARITAL TESTS ASKED; MEDICINE: CMA SEEKS STATE APPROVAL TO END 
SYPHILIS, RUBELLA BLOOD TESTING. DOCTORS SAY BENEFITS ARE MINIMAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a move to slash health care costs, the California Medical Assn. Monday said 
it wants to eliminate state requirements for premarital blood tests to detect 
German measles and syphilis. 
</P>
<P>
 Premarital testing has not been effective in detecting these diseases and is 
costing California residents and insurers $20 million a year, said Dr. Val W. 
Slayton, who co-authored the proposal to eliminate the testing, which was 
adopted by CMA delegates meeting here. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are misplacing our resources," Slayton said. He said vaccinations for 
rubella have become so pervasive that last year, only three babies born in 
California had contracted German measles from their mothers. And none of those 
cases would have been prevented with premarital rubella testing, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, he said, state health officials estimate that only 37 to 52 cases 
of syphilis were diagnosed from 250,000 premarital blood tests administered for 
the disease in 1992, the last year for which there are statistics.  
</P>
<P>
 Slayton said although about 7,000 new cases of infectious syphilis are 
diagnosed in the state each year, most are not found among people seeking 
premarital blood testing but among a high-risk group composed of intravenous 
drug users, prostitutes and persons who carry the virus that causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of doing away with the premarital testing requirement also noted 
that 40% of couples already bypass the requirement by filing for "confidential 
marriages" and an additional 20% of California residents get married in other 
states that don't require blood tests. In addition, they noted that 30% of 
babies in California are born out of wedlock, making premarital testing moot. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the elimination of required premarital health screening was opposed 
by some physicians at the CMA's annual weeklong meeting, who said instead the 
law should be revised to encompass the high-risk groups. Some physicians said 
through testing they had discovered women who needed to be immunized against 
rubella. "It is a low case rate because we give the shots," one physician said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the opposition's arguments were criticized as "anecdotal," by those 
wanting to dump the testing requirement, noting that already 36 other states 
have done so. 
</P>
<P>
 In other action, CMA leaders also said they would lobby the state Legislature 
to remove the requirement for women seeking sterilization to sign special 
consent forms in addition to the regular surgical consent form. The special 
form requires a three-day grace period after signing, and a 30-day grace period 
for women on Medi-Cal. Dr. David Priver, who authored the proposal, said the 
most onerous aspect of the current law is that some women who want to be 
sterilized during a Cesarean section instead must wait and endure a second 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Dr. Judith Leong Mates, chairman of a scientific committee that 
recommended against the proposal, said she expected opposition from women's 
groups who will argue that special consent procedures are necessary to prevent 
unwanted sterilization being performed on poor women, especially those who do 
not speak English. Mates said the CMA previously had tried to change the 
consent law regarding sterilization, and its public image had suffered. 
</P>
<P>
 The CMA leadership softened a proposal that it support therapeutic use of 
marijuana for people with diseases such as AIDS and cancer, saying it would do 
so only "if controlled studies prove efficacy" of marijuana in relieving 
symptoms.

WOMAN WOUNDED IN FREEWAY SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Irvine woman who was shot in the face on a Los Angeles freeway Sunday night 
was in serious condition Monday with a bullet lodged in her throat, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhonda Rogers, 32, was hospitalized at Martin Luther King, Jr.-Drew Medical 
Center in Los Angeles with a fractured jaw, a lacerated tongue, and a bullet in 
her throat after the 11:45 p.m. shooting, according to Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Deputy Benita Hinojos.  
</P>
<P>
 Rogers was driving east on the Century Freeway in South-Central Los Angeles 
after dropping off her boyfriend at Los Angeles International Airport, Hinojos 
said. Just before the Vermont Avenue exit, a yellow car pulled alongside Rogers 
and a single shot was fired, the bullet striking her in the left cheek. Rogers 
pulled over and called 911 on her cellular phone, Hinojos said.

MAN CONVICTED OF MURDER IN STRANGLING OF EX-GIRLFRIEND 
</P>

<P>
 A Westminster man was convicted Monday of second-degree murder for strangling 
his former girlfriend after their relationship fell apart. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Superior Court jury deliberated just over two hours before 
finding Hung Ngo, 26, guilty in the March 18, 1993, slaying of Tran Bich Cao, 
21, also of Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 Ngo climbed through the victim's first-floor bedroom window and strangled her, 
said Deputy Dist. Atty. Gregg L. Prickett. 
</P>
<P>
 "I argued to the jury that it was a case of, 'If I can't have her, no one can 
have her,' " Prickett said. Cao had been living with Ngo, who was unemployed, 
and supporting him until shortly before their breakup. 
</P>
<P>
 On the night of the murder, Ngo waited outside Cao's home until she returned 
after a date, Prickett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ngo testified to jurors that he was drinking heavily the night of the slaying 
and had difficulty remembering what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Alerted by Westminster police that Ngo may have gone north after the murder, 
Oakland police found him in a bus station several days after the slaying. He 
reportedly told authorities: "I'm the one you're looking for."

ORANGE COUNTY D.A. INDICTS 2 FORMER WATER OFFICIALS; SCANDAL: THE PAIR FACE 38 
CHARGES, INCLUDING FAILURE TO REPORT GIFTS FROM FIRMS THAT BENEFITED FROM THEIR 
ACTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A year after scandal shook the Santa Margarita Water District out of 
obscurity, prosecutors charged two former top managers Monday with illegally 
taking thousands of dollars in gifts from companies that relied on their help 
in securing government contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County district attorney's office brought a total of 38 misdemeanor 
charges against Walter W. (Bill) Knitz, 62, former general manager of the 
district, and Michael P. Lord, 51, former assistant general manager, alleging 
that the two repeatedly failed to disclose gifts from business people and took 
action on their behalf despite conflicts of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither man could be reached for comment, but in the past each has maintained 
his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office opened its investigation last March, a day 
after The Times reported that Knitz and Lord had accepted tens of thousands of 
dollars in gifts from local business people -- from pheasant hunting and 
fishing trips to theater tickets and golf outings. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges came as something of a respite for a new water district board that 
came into office in November, when most of the old board was swept out in the 
wake of the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess everybody got what they deserved," said board member Bob Lay, 
chairman of the district's finance committee. "I initially went into this 
thinking this was all trumped up. But it wasn't. Those guys were feathering 
their nest pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
 All of the charges filed Monday center on gifts allegedly provided to Knitz 
and Lord by two Orange County engineering firms -- Robert Bein, William Frost & 
Associates of Irvine and MacDonald-Stephens Engineering of Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors allege that Knitz illegally took part in Santa Margarita Water 
District decisions worth more than $1.1 million in government contracts to the 
two companies from 1990 to 1992, while Lord allegedly influenced about $250,000 
in Bein, Frost contracts during that same time at the water district. 
</P>
<P>
 The furor over the reports of lavish trips and gifts prompted a newfound 
public scrutiny for a $28-million-a-year special district that has operated for 
29 years in relative obscurity, providing water and sewer service for 84,000 
people in South County. 
</P>
<P>
 Within weeks of disclosure of the payments, the district adopted a strict 
ethics code banning employees from accepting gifts of any amount, and it 
suspended Knitz and Lord with pay from their six-figure salaries. Each later 
resigned. 
</P>
<P>
 Lord's attorney, Gary Pohlson, said the yearlong investigation has taken an 
emotional and financial toll on his client and that Lord is considering filing 
for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Knitz's attorney, Marshall Schulman, said: "I have to see what they're 
charging and see what they've got. If they don't have anything, then you'll 
expect us to fight it." 
</P>
<P>
 Knitz and Lord face possible jail time and fines if convicted, although 
prosecutors said they were uncertain what the most severe sentences could be. 
Arraignments have been scheduled for April 12 in Orange County Municipal Court 
in Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at MacDonald-Stephens and Bein, Frost did not return calls seeking 
comment. Although officials at MacDonald-Stephens have refused to discuss the 
investigation, Bein, Frost officials say they never sought to influence 
contracts through gifts to anyone at the water district. 
</P>
<P>
 The counts listed in the complaint are broken down into two types of 
violations: failure by each man to disclose repeated gifts from local business 
executives in state-required filings, and attempts by each to use "his official 
position to influence a governmental decision in which he knew or had reason to 
know he had a financial interest." 
</P>
<P>
 It is against state law for most government officials to take part in a 
decision affecting anyone who has provided $250 or more in gifts during the 
previous 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint gives few details about the gifts the two men allegedly 
received, but it does break down the contracts that came into question as a 
result. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors alleged that Knitz, despite an apparent conflict-of-interest 
created by the gifts, improperly influenced five MacDonald-Stephens contracts 
between 1990 and 1992, totaling $662,620, and influenced 10 Bein, Frost 
contracts worth $495,380. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1989, Bein, Frost has been paid about $13 million for a variety of 
engineering projects; MacDonald-Stephens has been paid more than $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 One conflict-of-interest count against Lord involved a $2-million certificate 
of deposit that the water district purchased from Mission Viejo National Bank 
in 1991, even though the bank was on the verge of financial collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the district incurred no loss and redeemed the certificate of deposit 
when it matured, the transaction raised questions about Lord's handling of 
customer funds and proceeds from the public sale of bonds -- in particular, the 
relationship between the district, Lord and banker Charles D. Maranto. 
</P>
<P>
 Documents reviewed by The Times showed that the water district's 
multimillion-dollar general operating fund followed Maranto as he went from 
bank to bank over a five-year period. Lord had obtained at least a $50,000 
loan, a $45,000 line of credit and another $3,000 line of credit from the banks 
involved with Maranto, who was with Mission Viejo National when the district 
purchased the $2-million certificate of deposit.

UNDERSEA NOISE TEST COULD RISK MAKING WHALES DEAF; SCIENCE: SCRIPPS INSTITUTION 
RESEARCHERS PROPOSE THE EXPERIMENT TO STUDY GLOBAL WARMING. CRITICS VOICE 
ALARM.

 A plan by scientists to place loudspeakers on the ocean floor off Big Sur and 
the Hawaiian island of Kauai and blast sounds so loud they could be heard in 
New Zealand has alarmed some biologists who fear the noise could deafen whales 
and other marine animals. 
</P>
<P>
 The noise, which would be audible to humans and sound something like a bowling 
ball rolling down a lane, would be broadcast every four hours for 20 minutes 
until the year 2004 at a volume much louder than sounds known to frighten 
whales from their normal migratory route. 
</P>
<P>
 In a clash between conflicting environmental concerns, the experiment is 
designed to test whether the temperature of the Pacific Ocean is rising as a 
result of global warming. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsors of the project at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego 
estimate that the noises off the California coast could affect 677,000 marine 
mammals, but they downplay any serious harm and say the experiment would yield 
valuable information about ocean temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, one set of loudspeakers would be located about 2,800 feet deep 
and 25 miles offshore in the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, where rare 
blue whales, humpbacks and other whale species gather. A second speaker would 
be placed at a similar depth off the coast of Kauai near the home of endangered 
monk seals. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Marine Fisheries Service will hold a hearing on the project today 
in Silver Springs, Md., and decide in coming weeks whether to issue a permit 
exempting the experiment from regulations that protect marine mammals from 
human harassment, hunting and killing. The experiment is scheduled to start 
this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindy Weilgart, a Nova Scotia scientist who specializes in studying sperm 
whale vocalizations, said she fears that the frequent loud noises could cause 
whales nearby to go deaf, leaving them unable to navigate or find food. 
</P>
<P>
 The low rumbling sound would be broadcast at 195 decibels -- 10 million times 
as loud as the 120-decibel level known to disturb some whales, she said. The 
decibel scale is logarithmic. By comparison, humans can suffer ear damage from 
120-decibel noises transmitted through the air. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are invading an ocean habitat that so far has been untouched by man," said 
Weilgart, a post-doctoral fellow at Cornell University. "It's an experiment of 
tremendous implications and we are doing it without a clue of what it would 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 Because whales are difficult to study, little is known about their sensitivity 
to loud noises or the frequencies at which they hear. But whales appear to be 
highly acoustic animals, navigating, hunting prey and communicating over long 
distances by sound. In some cases, loud noises caused by human activity 
underwater have caused individual whales to lose their hearing and eventually 
die. 
</P>
<P>
 "A deaf whale is a dead whale," Weilgart said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to impairing the hearing of some whales, the experiment would 
cause a constant level of noise pollution in the Pacific Ocean, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Over long distances, the frequent loud sounds could disrupt the normal feeding 
and mating behaviors of dozens of marine mammal species and disturb fish 
populations, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you hear an irritating hum in the background it can drive you up the wall, 
even if it doesn't affect your hearing," said Weilgart. "It can be a 
psychological effect." 
</P>
<P>
 For advocates of the project, however, the danger to all marine species from 
global warming is greater than the harm that loud noises might cause to 
individual creatures. Global warming is the heating of the planet resulting 
from human activity, which could cause major climatic changes and alter Earth's 
ecology. 
</P>
<P>
 They also contend that the broadcasts would be just one of many noises filling 
the ocean with sound, along with vessel traffic, industrial underwater 
explosions, supersonic aircraft and earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Pioneered by Scripps oceanographer Walter Munk, the planned experiment is 
based on the newly developed science of acoustic thermometry. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists would measure the time it takes each broadcast to travel across the 
ocean. Then, because sound travels faster in warmer water, they could plot 
temperature changes in the ocean over a long period of time. 
</P>
<P>
 "This breakthrough method provides temperature measurement over large ocean 
expanses and can shorten the time scale for characterizing greenhouse trends to 
a decade, far shorter and more affordable than methods of atmospheric 
measurement," says a summary of the experiment submitted to the National Marine 
Fisheries Service. 
</P>
<P>
 The $35-million study would be financed largely by the Defense Department and 
would rely in part on sophisticated listening gear operated by the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
 The initial application for a National Marine Fisheries Service permit 
proposes a two-year study using the two speaker systems off Point Sur and 
Kauai. Ultimately, scientists contemplate a network of broadcast points and 
receivers dotted around the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 The Scripps researchers estimate that the broadcasts off California could 
affect as many as 26,000 whales belonging to 10 species, 406,000 dolphins 
belonging to eight species and 245,000 seals, sea lions and elephant seals. 
</P>
<P>
 Ann Terbush, head of the National Marine Fisheries Service's permit office, 
said that at the agency's request, Scripps scientists have given the broadest 
estimate of the number of marine mammals that would be harassed or killed in 
the experiment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to need to decide whether this permit should be granted, whether 
the proposed taking is required and whether it is desirable based on the nature 
of the research," she said. Sounding Off 
</P>
<P>
 Some marine biologists are alarmed by a plan to install loudspeakers on the 
ocean floor off Big Sur that would broadcast sounds at a very high volume in an 
experiment to gauge global warming. It is feared the noise could harm whales 
and other mammals in the surrounding marine sanctuary.

NORTH KOREA ATOMIC ISSUE SENT TO U.N.; DIPLOMACY: INSPECTION AGENCY SEEKS 
SECURITY COUNCIL ACTION ON DISPUTE. U.S. SAYS IT WILL SEND PATRIOTS TO S. KOREA 
AND RESUME MILITARY EXERCISES. 
</P>

<P>
 With its inspections of North Korean nuclear facilities thwarted, the 
International Atomic Energy Agency moved Monday to ask the U.N. Security 
Council to help resolve its dispute with the Pyongyang regime. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time in almost a year of tangled diplomacy that the 
international agency felt compelled to seek Security Council action against 
North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the council could eventually impose economic sanctions against 
Pyongyang, most analysts believe that it will not do so immediately -- partly 
because China, a permanent member with veto power over council resolutions, has 
said it is not yet ready to support sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main thing is that (the IAEA) has now passed the ball to the Security 
Council," one Clinton Administration official said Monday night. "We're on 
completely new territory now. This will be a precedential case as to how the 
Security Council responds." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the Clinton Administration took steps Monday to shift its 
confrontation with North Korea from a diplomatic approach to a military one. 
The Pentagon announced it is sending a battalion of Patriot missiles to South 
Korea and laying the groundwork to resume the massive "Team Spirit" military 
exercises with South Korean forces later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 A Patriot missile battalion has from three to six batteries of missiles. Each 
battery has eight launchers; each launcher carries four missiles. The Pentagon 
said the Patriot battalion will arrive in South Korea in 30 to 35 days, along 
with 850 soldiers from Ft. Bliss, Tex., who will operate and maintain the 
batteries. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the IAEA and the Administration were responding to recent intransigence 
by North Korea. In the last few days, the regime of President Kim Il Sung has 
prevented the IAEA from finishing a round of inspections of North Korea's 
nuclear facilities. Over the weekend, Pyongyang's delegate walked out of talks 
with South Korea, threatening to turn Seoul into a "sea of fire." 
</P>
<P>
 The IAEA is the organization responsible for checking nuclear facilities, 
including reactors and reprocessing plants, to ensure they are used for 
peaceful purposes of energy production rather than to produce the fuel for 
nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting Monday in Vienna, the agency adopted a resolution somewhat milder 
than had been anticipated. Instead of washing its hands of the issue 
completely, the IAEA gave North Korea one more chance to go along with 
inspections of its facilities. But it formally referred the issue to the 
Security Council, the first step toward involving the council in the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say chances are that the council will start with a resolution simply 
condemning North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, it is more important that a (Security Council) resolution show North 
Korea that it is completely isolated than that it call for immediate 
sanctions," said Arnold Kanter of the RAND Corp. "Building a coalition is more 
important than (trying for) a resolution which calls for sanctions, which, 
right now, everyone else is opposed to. That would be shooting ourselves in the 
foot." 
</P>
<P>
 An Administration official said Security Council members will probably have 
informal discussions on North Korea this week and may then try to adopt some 
form of resolution or statement next week. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, U.S. officials say, the council might approve some weakly worded 
statement that simply urges North Korea to drop its resistance and let IAEA 
inspectors finish their work at the nuclear installations. Administration 
officials hope that China will go along with such a statement. They were 
encouraged Monday that the Chinese delegation in Vienna did not veto Monday's 
IAEA resolution, choosing instead to abstain. 
</P>
<P>
 The next step envisioned by the Administration would be a Security Council 
resolution that, in effect, calls on the Pyongyang regime to comply with 
inspections "or else." The last step would be some move toward U.N. economic 
sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a process could take months. During that time, the Pentagon will 
apparently step up pressure on North Korea. Besides the Patriots and Team 
Spirit exercises, some experts have said the United States could increase its 
troop presence in South Korea and hold a naval exercise in waters near North 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. military commanders have said they want the Patriots brought to South 
Korea now, primarily for reasons of convenience and logistics: At the moment, 
they can be brought in routinely by sea. By contrast, if the Patriots were 
needed on an emergency basis after or just before the outbreak of war, the 
missiles would have to be sent to South Korea by air, taking up airlift space 
that could otherwise be used for other equipment and personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some specialists say the Patriots' dispatch is primarily symbolic. 
Through this small action, they say, Clinton could satisfy those in the United 
States who seek tougher policies, while the Administration quietly continues to 
work toward a diplomatic solution. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are just things that give political cover to President Clinton" and 
South Korean President Kim Young Sam, said Selig Harrison, a North Korea 
specialist at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. "If (Clinton) is 
prepared to go to negotiations with North Korea, then he needs some political 
cover." 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials said Monday that the joint U.S.-South Korean Team Spirit 
military exercises will now probably take place around September. The exercises 
had once been tentatively scheduled for this month but were put off when North 
Korea agreed to let in IAEA inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
 It is difficult, if not impossible, to carry out Team Spirit exercises in the 
spring or summer, while rice is being planted and cultivated in many areas of 
South Korea. So whether intentionally or not, North Korea's decision to first 
admit the IAEA inspectors, then to bar them from completing their work, 
succeeded in stopping Team Spirit for about six months. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said Monday that they are unsure what prompted North Korea to 
dig in its heels over the last week and to stop cooperating with the 
international inspections. "One explanation is that they are hiding something" 
in their nuclear sites, a State Department official said. "Another is that this 
is part of North Korea's political tactics, seeking to put pressure upon the 
United States and South Korea" in negotiations over political and economic help 
for Pyongyang. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison, who has visited Pyongyang several times and is one of the strongest 
supporters in Washington of a conciliatory approach toward North Korea, 
suggested that the latest tactic is merely a negotiating ploy. North Korean 
officials "don't want to give everything to us before they have a negotiation," 
he asserted. "They are just behaving in their usual and exasperating way." 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has said it is prepared to talk about an improvement in ties 
with North Korea and economic help for Pyongyang at a new round of talks, which 
would begin after the IAEA completes its inspections. North Korea apparently 
believes that it has already cooperated sufficiently with the IAEA and that it 
is entitled to the new round of negotiations now.

D.A. CUTS STAFF FOR ENVIRONMENT, WORKPLACE CASES 
</P>

<P>
 The Los Angeles district attorney's office will accept no new cases involving 
environmental and worker safety violations or major fraud so that the agency 
can concentrate more of its dwindling staff on violent crimes, Dist. Atty. Gil 
Garcetti said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The move is the latest in a series of steps Garcetti has taken toward 
dismantling special units that were created to aggressively attack mostly white 
collar crime. Already he has transferred personnel out of his workers' 
compensation and auto insurance divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 The new policy becomes effective today, Garcetti said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want desperately to continue to prosecute these cases, but unless we have 
the ability to prosecute violent crime, we can't," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A strict hiring freeze has created staff shortages that have depleted the 
number of prosecutors who devote their time to street crime, Garcetti said. His 
only alternative is to pull personnel from the special units, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of several advocacy groups held a news conference Monday to 
warn that the public's health and safety will suffer if the violators of 
environmental and worker safety laws are not aggressively prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
 They credited the special units with deterring serious workplace safety 
violations and the illegal disposal of toxic substances, and predicted that 
violations will skyrocket. In Los Angeles County, they said, those violations 
disproportionately affect ethnic communities -- especially poorer Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 The environmental crimes and occupational safety and health unit has handled 
more than 400 cases since 1987, and produced more than $13 million in fines, 
penalties and restitution, according to Garcetti's office. 
</P>
<P>
 The major fraud unit prosecutes white collar crimes that involve amounts over 
$100,000. The unit has 214 active cases involving 11,000 victims and fraud 
believed to total $675 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Garcetti said two other special units will stop taking new cases. 
</P>
<P>
 One litigates motions related to appeals by defense lawyers and the other 
prosecutes building permit violations for municipalities that do not have city 
attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Rice, a spokesman for Cal/OSHA, the state job safety agency, said his 
department would be "very concerned" if Garcetti stopped taking cases from its 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 He and others interviewed Monday said there are a couple of alternatives to 
pursuing cases through the district attorney's office. The state attorney 
general might be one avenue, but Rice wondered if the agency has the resources 
and expertise to prosecute complex criminal cases of that type. Another route 
would be to pursue misdemeanor charges through the offices of city attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's special units prosecute the cases as felonies. 
</P>
<P>
 The County Board of Supervisors last year imposed the strict hiring freeze on 
the district attorney in an attempt to force him to stay within his annual 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti acknowledges that he overspent his budget by about $3 million last 
year, and will probably overspend by as much or more this year if his 
$119.6-million budget is not significantly increased. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney said it is ironic that the units he is disbanding 
generate significant income for the county through fines, and some cost the 
county little or nothing because they are financed by state and federal grants 
and private money. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Mike Antonovich said he favors lifting the freeze and giving 
Garcetti the money that he seeks, but at least one member of the board said 
that will not happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't give Gil Garcetti the money he wants because the money doesn't 
exist," said Supervisor Deane Dana. "It's his decision to how he makes his 
cuts. There is no magic pile of money we can go to." 
</P>
<P>
 The other supervisors could not be reached for comment. Supervisor Gloria 
Molina in the past has accused Garcetti of using threats to get his way and has 
warned him such tactics will not work. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, the district attorney cut personnel in his workers' 
compensation fraud unit by 25% and moved four of 18 prosecutors out of his auto 
insurance fraud unit as part the gradual dismantling of those teams. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, he would not accept a $500,000 gift from a real estate group that 
wanted it used to fight real estate fraud, because, he said, he did not have 
the personnel to staff such a unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti said all of the special units he is trimming will be disbanded by 
July 1 if he does not get budget relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Other units that he has not yet targeted for cuts could also be disbanded by 
that date, he said. Those include the consumer protection division, a crime 
prevention program for young people and the special investigations division 
which involves prosecutors early in cases of shootings by police officers.

SALVADOR RULING PARTY, EX-REBELS HEAD FOR RUNOFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As international observers Monday analyzed serious irregularities in El 
Salvador's first postwar elections, the presidential race appeared headed for a 
runoff between the government's right-wing party and a coalition of former 
guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. peacekeepers, U.S. Congress members and other observers said 
disorganization, delays and other systemic problems prevented large numbers of 
Salvadorans from voting in Sunday's historic national elections, and they 
called for reform. But most said they saw no evidence of massive fraud, and the 
former guerrillas retreated from earlier allegations of fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 With the vote count proceeding slowly, Armando Calderon Sol of the ruling 
Nationalist Republican Alliance, or Arena, held on to a substantial lead over 
leftist legislator Ruben Zamora, who heads a nine-party coalition that includes 
former rebels of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or FMLN. 
</P>
<P>
 But Calderon Sol, the portly former mayor of San Salvador, was just shy of the 
absolute majority he needed to avoid a runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trend indicates that we are in the presence of a second election, since 
no single party reached the required percentage" of more than 50%, said Luis 
Arturo Zaldivar, president of the government's Supreme Electoral Tribunal. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the likely date for a runoff would be April 24. 
</P>
<P>
 In a news conference Monday night, Calderon Sol said he still held out hope 
for a first-round victory but was confident that he could win a runoff easily. 
"We were the big winners on Sunday," he proclaimed, saying Arena had taken most 
mayoralties in the country and may have gained a majority in the National 
Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Zamora's coalition said they believed that they could win a second 
round. But before Sunday's voting, Zamora's senior campaign strategist 
acknowledged that, if Arena obtained more than 45% in the first round, Calderon 
Sol would almost certainly win the runoff by forming coalitions with smaller 
right-wing parties. 
</P>
<P>
 With almost 77% of the vote counted Monday evening, Arena hovered just above 
49%, while Zamora's coalition fluctuated between 25% and 26%. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday night, senior FMLN leaders denounced fraud in the elections, the 
first voting since U.N.-brokered peace accords ended a bloody 12-year civil war 
in 1992. But they backed down and, on Monday, shifted their focus to the likely 
second round, planning ways to overcome voting anomalies and budgeting campaign 
money, which, by law, the government will provide for the runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are convinced there will be a second round, and we will work to eliminate 
election irregularities," said Schafik Handal, senior FMLN leader and 
unsuccessful candidate for mayor of San Salvador. Handal lost to Arena's Mario 
Valiente by almost a 2-1 margin. 
</P>
<P>
 The irregularities included chaos, long lines and snail-pace processing at 
voting stations. Thousands of people were prevented from casting ballots 
because their names did not appear on incomplete voter-registration lists, even 
though they had valid voter cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Transportation was a problem for many rural and urban voters; in San Salvador, 
the government's decision to concentrate voting in just five stations meant 
many citizens had to travel a considerable distance, then wait a long time to 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
 While the government said the problems were to be expected in a country 
emerging from war, some observers chalked them up to an intentional effort to 
discourage massive voting. 
</P>
<P>
 David Browning, a British expert on El Salvador who has observed elections in 
Central America for years, said the irregularities caused "large-scale 
disenfranchisement." He blamed the woes on a lack of political will on the part 
of government officials because most of the problems cropped up in past 
elections and were never corrected. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not just fumbling ineptitude (when) it could have been put right, and 
it was not put right," Browning said in an interview, a day after he observed 
voting in the capital and its working-class suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
 A team of observers representing the U.S. government also said it was 
"troubled" that "many of the procedures cited as administrative defects" in 
previous elections continued to be practiced. 
</P>
<P>
 "The major Election Day problems stemmed from a complex registration and 
voting process," said Brian Atwood, President Clinton's envoy and the U.S. 
Agency for International Development director. "In case of a second round, a 
complete review of the voter registry and a renewed effort by the Supreme 
Electoral Tribunal to ensure that all aspects of the electoral process are 
transparent and better organized is extremely important." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that he had no evidence there was a deliberate attempt to 
disenfranchise prospective voters. 
</P>
<P>
 While most observers agreed the voting difficulties did not substantially 
change the presidential race's outcome, diplomats and others said the greatest 
damage may have been done at the local level. In many small towns, a few dozen 
votes can determine a race. If former combatants who were participating in 
elections for the first time meet only frustration, the diplomats said, they 
could become disenchanted with a democratic system that seems pointless. 
</P>
<P>
 Augusto Ramirez Ocampo, head of the U.N. peacekeeping mission here, said at 
least 25,000 people could not vote on Sunday because their names did not appear 
on registry lists.

DINGELL HEALTH PLAN EXEMPTS SMALL FIRMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN TUMULTY and EDWIN CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), 
struggling to find a health care reform bill that can pass his committee and 
ultimately the House, is circulating a plan that would exempt firms with 10 or 
fewer workers from President Clinton's proposed requirement that they provide 
health insurance for their workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Dingell's proposal, described by his staff in an eight-page draft that was 
obtained by The Times, would also scale back the minimum benefits package of 
the Clinton plan and discard the Administration's requirement that most 
Americans join government-organized purchasing cooperatives. 
</P>
<P>
 It would meet Clinton's goal of universal coverage by requiring workers in 
smaller firms to purchase their own health coverage if their employers did not. 
Government subsidies would be available to low-income people who could not 
afford their own insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan is significant because the committee, with its heavy concentration of 
moderate to conservative Democrats, has been considered the most difficult 
proving ground for health reform in the House. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the three House committees with jurisdiction over the health issue, 
Energy and Commerce is also considered the most accurate gauge of overall House 
sentiment. The bill it approves is likely to carry the most weight when House 
Democratic leaders eventually attempt to meld the three committees' bills into 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last few weeks, Dingell and his health subcommittee chairman, Henry 
A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), have been consulting intensively with the Democrats 
who have raised the strongest objections to the Clinton plan. They want to 
begin voting on a proposal shortly after Easter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping that this will produce the breakthrough that we need," Waxman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dingell and Waxman discussed the staff draft Monday with a number of committee 
members whose votes are considered crucial. Many committee members have 
complained that the Administration proposal is too costly and bureaucratic and 
puts an excessive financial burden on small business. 
</P>
<P>
 Initial reaction appeared to have been favorable. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very positive step forward," said Rep. Philip R. Sharp (D-Ind.), one 
of the committee members who met with Dingell. "Things are starting to pull 
together and really move. It represents a very strong starting point for the 
committee." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Rep. Lynn Schenk (D-San Diego), another committee member: "It looks like 
it is beginning to address my concerns about small business." 
</P>
<P>
 White House spokeswoman Lorrie McHugh said that the Administration is 
encouraged by the signs of progress but declined to comment on the specifics of 
the draft proposal. "The ball is in their court," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Where Clinton's plan would require all businesses to pay up to 80% of the 
costs of their employees' health insurance, Dingell's approach would exempt 
firms with 10 or fewer workers. Those that chose not to provide benefits 
instead would pay a payroll tax -- 1% for companies with up to five employees, 
2% for those with six to ten. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee staff estimated that under its proposal more than 75% of all 
businesses would be exempt from having to pay the employer share. Businesses 
generally would pay a lower percentage of health costs than under the Clinton 
plan, the staff added. 
</P>
<P>
 Committee staff members claimed that the draft proposal, unlike Clinton's, 
would not add to the deficit. They trimmed costs primarily by requiring 
consumers to pay a greater share of their health bills through higher 
deductibles and co-payments. The bill would also provide catastrophic coverage 
only after a consumer's health bill reached $2,500, which is $1,000 higher than 
the limit in the Clinton plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Clinton's proposal, the draft contains controls on health costs but gives 
the states more power to administer them. 
</P>
<P>
 States also would organize purchasing cooperatives, similar to one that 
already exists in California, in an effort to give smaller health care 
purchasers more clout in the marketplace. However, no one would be forced to 
buy their insurance coverage from the so-called "alliances." By comparison, the 
Clinton plan would give firms with fewer than 5,000 employees no other option. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, the House Ways and Means health subcommittee, which has been 
considering its health care package for more than two weeks, narrowly adopted a 
controversial measure limiting to $350,000 the amount of awards for medical 
malpractice for non-economic damages. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-5 vote, with two Democrats joining the committee's four Republicans, 
foreshadows a titanic battle in Congress, pitting doctors and trial lawyers 
against each other. 
</P>
<P>
 The monetary cap on damages for pain and suffering is one for which the 
American Medical Assn. has been campaigning -- and a chief reason that the 
nation's largest physicians' organization has refrained from backing President 
Clinton's reform agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer groups were outraged by the subcommittee vote. "This is a black day 
for consumers," said Gail Shearer of Consumers Union. "This is a serious blow 
to the most severely injured victims of doctor negligence." 
</P>
<P>
 The subcommittee, chaired by Rep. Pete Stark (D-Oakland), is expected to 
finish drafting an alternative to the President's prescription for reform this 
week, possibly as early as today. 
</P>
<P>
 In another vote, the panel supported a plan proposed by Clinton to encourage 
medical schools and teaching hospitals to produce and train more primary care 
doctors and fewer specialists. The panel also defeated a Republican proposal to 
phase in subsidies for the working poor more slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 Stark argued against the cap on non-economic damages, saying that such a limit 
would "shield" incompetent physicians while deterring attorneys from taking up 
cases that might otherwise be too costly to try. 
</P>
<P>
 The cap was proposed by Rep. Nancy L. Johnson (R-Conn.) and approved by the 
committee after a majority rejected many other provisions in her amendment, 
including the abolition of punitive damages against the maker of a medical 
product or device that has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, Johnson had sought a cap of $250,000 for non-economic damages, a 
limit that is already in place in California. Clinton's plan does not limit 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in Leesburg, Va., Senate Finance Committee members completed a 
two-day retreat on health care, having made no apparent progress toward an 
agreement but expressing a desire to produce a bill that could win support from 
both parties in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 In Hartford, Conn., a leading opponent of President Clinton's health care 
plan, Rep. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.), collected thousands of dollars in 
contributions from insurance industry executives at a fund-raiser Monday while 
protesters outside chanted, "Shame, shame, shame." 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper, who is running for the Senate in Tennessee, is author of a proposal 
that the health and insurance industry like far better than the Clinton plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Sara Fritz in Hartford, Conn., contributed to this story.

<P>
 The bad news came at sea. Navy Capt. Chris Cole and his crew of 350 were 
returning here last summer when they learned their El Paso, a 24-year-old, 
steel-and-gray amphibious cargo ship, was coming home for good. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be decommissioned next month, its days of ferrying personnel and 
equipment to far-off places such as Somalia gone forever. 
</P>
<P>
 Cole is lean and tall, almost towering, his bearing ramrod straight. He's been 
a Navy man for two decades. Despite his military demeanor, he struggled against 
tears to describe the decision to mothball his beloved ship. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a naval officer, I understand it," he said. "The country wants to cut the 
military budget. But as a captain of a ship, I can hardly talk about it. It's a 
wonderful ship. It's a wonderful crew. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ship is metal and paint. But it's the crew that brings it to life." 
</P>
<P>
 The human toll of military downsizing is clear. Across the nation, many people 
are learning -- grudgingly -- that a service career may not be as promising or 
rewarding and certainly not as lasting as it once was. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone with the Cold War is the job security it provided. Units with illustrious 
pasts are being disbanded. Promising careers are being cut short. For those who 
stay in the service, forced transfers are all too common. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's disappointing," said Maj. David Deykes, a 43-year-old West Point 
graduate and one-time field infantry platoon leader. He has been told that June 
30 is his last day in the Army. 
</P>
<P>
 "You take it personal at first," Deykes said. "Everybody does. You try for a 
goal and you fail. Suddenly, the Army is not placing any special fidelity and 
trust in you any more." 
</P>
<P>
 Deykes fears for his own future and that of the armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
 But to some experts, the human toll of downsizing is not all that worrisome. 
Charles Moskos, a Northwestern University military sociologist, points out that 
the Army, which has been saddled with the brunt of the reductions, has already 
made virtually all the necessary cuts and is "out of the woods." The Navy and 
Air Force, he said, did not face such drastic changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, there's been a lot of heartbreak," he said, "but institutionally (the 
reduction) has been a remarkable success. If civilian industry had to cut this 
far, there would have been blood all over the floor." 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the uneasiness is because of the wild stories that are circulating 
about the cutbacks," said Lawrence J. Korb, a former Defense Department 
manpower official now at the Brookings Institution. "It's scared away some of 
the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 He blames the Pentagon for letting rumors of mass firings, though largely 
false, go unchallenged. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether real or imagined, the so-called drawdown has troubled and confused 
many and even left some feeling betrayed. 
</P>
<P>
 For eight years, Lt. Pat Dennison devoted his career to the Navy, working 
aboard the aircraft carrier fleet and seeing duty in the Persian Gulf. All he 
wanted to do was go to sea. But once he realized that ships were being 
dry-docked, he was retrained in public affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 30 years old and at the midpoint of the 20 years' service needed to earn 
his retirement, Dennison wonders if he'll make it to the end. "These ship 
cutbacks are scaring me," he said. "Getting promoted has become too 
competitive. Career enhancement isn't there. A lot of my friends were giving up 
and getting out. 
</P>
<P>
 "The future isn't there for so many of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Two rounds of base closings have devastated dozens of defense installations 
nationwide. And commanders spared so far are having to justify why their posts 
should not be shuttered in a third round set for 1995. Total uniformed 
personnel, nearly 1.8 million at the end of 1992, is heading for 1.5 million by 
the end of next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Soldiers are returning by the tens of thousands from attractive Army posts in 
Europe. More than 100 Navy ships have been decommissioned, many of them 
mothballed at East Coast shipyards-turned-graveyards. Some are broken down into 
spare parts; others sold to foreign governments. 
</P>
<P>
 Stealthy, slender "nuclear attack submarines" that once spied on Russian subs 
are serving as escorts for naval battle groups or as floating museums for 
cadets at Annapolis, Md. The Strategic Air Command, once the Air Force's "first 
alert" nuclear defense, closed two years ago, costing 3,000 military jobs in 
Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
 All four military services are drastically slashing the numbers of new 
recruits. Even still, the Army and Air Force have had to jettison thousands of 
personnel, mainly by attrition and special retirement incentives. The Navy and 
Marine Corps so far have not had to let anyone go, but they are requiring all 
first-term enlistees to compete for a second tour of duty. 
</P>
<P>
 The Navy Training Center in San Diego, where 25,000 recruits used to go 
through boot camp each year, closed in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "They made the Navy sound bigger than it really is," said Brian Beltz, a 
19-year-old from Findlay, Ohio, and a member of the last boot camp class there. 
"They made it sound like the President was coming to our graduation and 
everything, and he didn't. They built our hopes up." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike drawdowns following World War II and the Korean and Vietnam wars, this 
one seems particularly painful to the rank-and-file trying to make a living in 
uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, the Pentagon has simply cut from the bottom, said Carl Cocke, 
head of research and analysis at the Center for Military History in Washington. 
The draftees were the first to leave, almost always by their own decision. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, it is the career soldiers and sailors who feel they are caught in 
the greatest swath of personnel cuts. There are fewer jobs, fewer promotions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one dark cloud on the horizon in recruiting is we have substantial 
statistics which indicate a decrease in the propensity to enlist," Defense 
Secretary William J. Perry said recently. "Many young people believe the Army 
is no longer recruiting, no longer bringing new people into it in the face of 
the drawdown." 
</P>
<P>
 At the San Diego boot camp, it is clear that the Navy is not what it used to 
be. All but three of the center's 80 buildings are closed, the furniture and 
equipment moved out. The staff has been cut from 500 to 40, and the rest are 
ticketed for departure soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we found out about this, it was utter disbelief," said Capt. Patricia M. 
Spishock, the assistant chief of staff. "It was like going through a denial 
process." 
</P>
<P>
 In Northern California near Monterey, there is -- or was -- Ft. Ord. Once 
bustling with 35,000 service members and dependents, the historic Army post is 
down to 1,000 and targeted to drop to 500 by the end of this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone too is the 7th Infantry Division, which saw action in both world wars, 
Korea and Panama. One of its last missions was to help restore calm during the 
1992 Los Angeles riots. 
</P>
<P>
 The 7th is one of four Army divisions that are being eliminated. Soldiers 
still left at Ft. Ord are turning to new assignments or preparing for new lives 
out of the military. 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Hatemi, 23, an infantryman, has decided to take on one more enlistment, 
this time as a military policeman, before returning home to Inglewood. After 
that, he said, "it's time to move onto bigger and better things." 
</P>
<P>
 Staff Sgt. Betty Ramos, 33, has spent 10 years as an Army chaplain and goes 
from Ft. Ord to Ft. Monroe, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's early mornings and late evenings and it could go into nights," Ramos 
said of her job. "They're drawing down and it's getting competitive, but I 
think I can hold my own." 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Bryan Cox is leaving. Thirty-four years old, with nine years' service, 
he is taking a $60,000 severance bonus under the Army's volunteer separation 
program. He plans to open a commercial golfing range. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox, who has four sons, didn't feel he could pass up the bonus money. "I 
wanted the cash in hand," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And as Ft. Ord closes, those at the Monterey County veterans center are 
feeling the pinch as well. 
</P>
<P>
 With the post's closing, there go the local health and medical care 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 For them, it means a day's bus ride to the Bay Area for treatment at the 
closest military installation. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I could have seen what the military was doing today, I would have gone 
somewhere else," said Joe DeWitt, a 20-year Army soldier before he retired in 
1977. 
</P>
<P>
 At Norfolk, where the sailors from the El Paso are living on a berthing barge 
and emptying their ship, the future remains uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 Some, like Petty Officer Larry Brock with 24 years' service, are retiring 
sooner than they would have liked. 
</P>
<P>
 With the ship's decommissioning, he said, he cannot expect to win another 
promotion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I promised my wife not to get out unless I was forced out, and here I'm being 
forced out anyway," Brock said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others like Seaman Sal DeFazio, with only two years' service, are being 
transferred for new training. He's hopeful there's a future when he's done. "My 
only fear is that they're going to cut down too much," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Adm. Henry H. Mauz Jr., commander-in-chief of the Atlantic Fleet, sympathizes 
with their uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're concerned about the future," Mauz said. "Will there be a Navy? What 
will it be? I tell them to have hope." 
</P>
<P>
 Aboard the Gunston Hall, the 325-man crew takes pride in its re-enlistment 
rate. They like to call their ship the "Gunston Hilton." But many feel the 
pressure to compete against each other for promotions. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Cmdr. Chris Chace, the ship's executive officer, recalled how one sailor 
was sent to an admiral's mast for punishment for a minor infraction -- a short 
absence from duty -- that cost him any real chance to promote later. "That was 
it for him," Chace said. 
</P>
<P>
 Master Chief Rick Yarbrough thanks the Navy for helping him mature when he 
enlisted as a troubled youth. "And the Navy did a lot for me. It gave me a 
life, gave me a career. Now I'm ready to go out." 
</P>
<P>
 His retirement from the ship's signal corps will come soon, and already he's 
worried that the skills he has learned will not help him in the civilian world. 
"There's not a lot of jobs out there for a signalman," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the base, classes are doubling at the Transaction Assistance Program. 
</P>
<P>
 Begun four years ago to help sailors ease back into civilian life, the program 
first offered a dozen sessions a year, with about 75 in each class. 
</P>
<P>
 That number has climbed to 24 sessions a year, with class sizes of 150 or 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeannie Keith, 20, from Bowling Green, Ky., is leaving after just two years, 
upset that her classification as a machinist mate prevents her from switching 
to nursing. The Navy health care slots, she found, are overstaffed, while 
machinist mate positions are understaffed. So she's stuck. 
</P>
<P>
 She started to talk about her predicament, and then began to cry. She said it 
wasn't fair to have to quit the Navy to better herself. "I have to leave to get 
ahead," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those same kinds of pressures are being felt in the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
 Col. William Foster, an Army war planner, helped devise the strategy of 
closing posts in Europe and reassigning soldiers throughout the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1990s, Foster said, the military is finding itself undertaking a wide 
array of responsibilities, such as drug interdiction and peacekeeping, and many 
servicemen and women are being deployed more often and to more hot spots. 
</P>
<P>
 "It causes turbulence and uncertainty," he acknowledged. "They are being asked 
to deploy more than before. Your time away from your home station is increased. 
There's a certain perception that the stress is higher. But there's also the 
old adage that a busy soldier is a happy soldier." 
</P>
<P>
 Even those with plum assignments are not feeling all that comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 When the old weather tracking operation was closed recently at McClellan Air 
Force Base in Sacramento, less than a fourth of the 200 crew members was chosen 
for a more ambitious program: flying the Open Skies reconnaissance missions 
over the Soviet Union and two dozen other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the weather pilots passed over for the Open Skies mission at Offutt 
Air Force Base in Omaha were given less exciting assignments. Some retired. 
Some took desk jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 But even the 43 lucky ones who were selected still do not see it as a firm 
sign of job security. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes," said Capt. Curt Lindskog, a pilot with nearly 20 years in the Air 
Force, "the ax falls indiscriminately."

HAYDEN DECRIES 'GHOST' INSTRUCTORS AT SAN DIEGO STATE; EDUCATION: THE SENATOR 
SAYS SOME PROFESSORS ARE NOT TEACHING FULL LOADS AND THAT ADMINISTRATORS HAVE 
BEEN FALSIFYING DOCUMENTS TO COVER UP. COLLEGE SPOKESMAN SAYS A STATE AUDIT 
WILL FIND THAT ALL REGULATIONS WERE MET.

<P>
 State Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) charged Monday that for years 
administrators at San Diego State University have falsified documents to cover 
up for professors who are not teaching full loads, thus cheating students and 
taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This damn thing seems to have been going on for 20 years," Hayden said. "This 
is major fraud." 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden, who is running for the Democratic nomination for governor, demanded 
that the state's legislative analyst investigate San Diego State and other 
California State University campuses to determine the extent of the "ghosts in 
the classroom." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he wants the analyst to determine how much of the $65 million a year 
in state subsidies for faculty salaries at San Diego State may have gone to 
professors who were not teaching as many classes as their contracts required. 
</P>
<P>
 Figures released by Hayden indicated that San Diego State professors were 
teaching 25% fewer classes than their colleagues at other campuses, while 
student tuition was increasing systemwide and San Diego State class size was 
the highest of any Cal State campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "San Diego State has increasingly expanded class size, diluting the potential 
learning experience of students . . . while reducing teaching loads for senior 
faculty," Hayden said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many San Diego State students, he added, have had to take five or six years to 
graduate because they could not get the required classes in four years. 
Enrollment at San Diego State has dropped nearly 20% in four years, with some 
students transferring to other campuses where they were assured of being able 
to graduate in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden, a frequent critic of California higher education officials, said he 
believes the chancellor of the 20-campus Cal State system must have been aware 
that San Diego State was juggling the figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Chancellor Barry Munitz, through a spokeswoman, said he would wait until an 
audit is completed before responding. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego State spokesman Rick Moore denied Hayden's assertions about fraud 
and said that administrators are confident that the audit will show that the 
campus has met all regulations about teaching loads. "We have met our 
obligations to teaching students and sometimes exceeded them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden's information was provided, in part, by Rajesh Kanwar, an assistant 
professor of business at San Diego State who was denied tenure, ending his 
teaching career there. Kanwar said he was a beneficiary of the ghost-teaching 
system that he now wants stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 The comments by Hayden, a former chairman of the Assembly Higher Education 
Committee, came as the Senate moved toward a confirmation vote on three Cal 
State trustees opposed by Hayden. The vote had been set for this week but has 
been delayed until next week. 
</P>
<P>
 In a news conference and then a telephone interview, Hayden said the alleged 
teaching load scam was going on while the three trustees were on the board and 
that they failed to stop it. "There obviously has been a major failure in 
oversight," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden alleged that San Diego State has a pattern of violating a state law 
requiring professors to teach at least 12 units of classes per semester, which 
is usually three classes. About 43% of professors at San Diego State teach only 
two courses a semester, Hayden said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Kanwar and Hayden, professors were given more credit than 
warranted for supervising independent study programs, administrators liberally 
waived teaching requirements by a process known as "assigned time," and 
professors were given credit for courses taught by graduate students or, in 
some cases, not taught at all. 
</P>
<P>
 The documents cited by Hayden as being fraudulent were teaching load summaries 
forwarded to the system's central administration and subject to audit by the 
state Department of Finance to make sure the state is getting its money's 
worth. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden said that if San Diego State professors were teaching as many courses 
as professors at other campuses, another 674 classes could be added.

MEXICAN JUDGE CLEARS 6 CHARGED IN SHOOTOUT; RULING: ONLY ONE OFFICIAL IS 
ORDERED TO STAND TRIAL ON CHARGES OF AIDING THE ESCAPE OF TWO MEN ARRESTED 
DURING A GUNFIGHT BETWEEN STATE AND FEDERAL POLICE IN TIJUANA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In the increasingly confused aftermath of a shootout between state and federal 
police, a state deputy attorney general and five police commanders have been 
cleared of wrongdoing in the incident, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 A Mexican federal judge ordered only one official, an agent of the state 
prosecutor's office, to stand trial on charges of aiding the escape of two men 
arrested March 3 in the gunfight at a busy intersection, officials said. But 
the judge cleared the homicide chief of the Baja California judicial police, 
even though state officials admit that the now-fugitive commander helped the 
two wounded gunmen flee from police headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal prosecutors will appeal the ruling by Judge Graciela Guadalupe Alejo 
Luna, according to Diana Ortiz Villacorta of the Mexican attorney general's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are in disagreement," Ortiz said. "The state attorney general's office 
admits his guilt, but the judge is setting him free." 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling represents a victory for Gov. Ernesto Ruffo Appel, who has been hit 
with a politically charged scandal caused by the gunfight. The five dead 
included the commander of a federal police unit and a state police officer 
alleged to have been guarding drug lord Ismael Higuera Guerrero. Authorities 
describe Higuera as the acting leader of Tijuana's Arellano drug cartel. 
</P>
<P>
 The special federal unit was hunting for the cartel's kingpins, three brothers 
wanted in the murder of the cardinal of Guadalajara last year. The gunfight 
erupted when federal officers tried to stop Higuera's vehicle and were ambushed 
by his heavily armed entourage, enabling the drug lord to flee in a second 
vehicle, police say. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruffo ordered a sweeping investigation into charges that state police officers 
-- and civilian enforcers in their employ -- were among the attackers. But he 
defended Deputy Atty. Gen. Sergio Ortiz Lara, prosecutor's agent Juan Carlos 
Guerrero Zermeno and four of the police commanders accused of helping suspects 
escape. Ortiz and the others simply responded to the chaotic shooting scene and 
were victims of a hasty federal prosecution, state officials contend. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Alejo apparently agreed -- to a point. But she upheld charges against 
Guerrero, who allegedly took charge of six prisoners, according to Ortiz. The 
federal spokesman said the judge cleared the Tijuana homicide commander, who 
disappeared two days after the shootout and has been singled out for blame by a 
state investigation. Commander Francisco Fiol Santana led two of the suspects 
out a back door after paramedics treated their wounds at headquarters, 
according to officials. 
</P>
<P>
 In an earlier ruling that also contradicted federal and state authorities, 
Alejo found insufficient evidence last week to try state officer Juan Jesus 
Hernandez Tejeda for murder and assault. Hernandez, the partner of the slain 
officer alleged to have been driving the drug lord's vehicle, was ordered to 
stand trial on a lesser charge of possessing an illegal weapon -- an AK-47 
automatic rifle. The judge has declined to discuss the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is troublesome that we have two contradictory accounts by the state and 
federal institutions," said Jose Luis Perez Canchola, Baja's human rights 
ombudsman. "The terrible thing is that the society mistrusts the versions of 
both sides." 
</P>
<P>
 Perez has launched a third investigation into the case. He said there are 
reports that up to five carloads of gunmen attacked the federal unit and that 
renegade federal officers allied with traffickers participated. Eyewitnesses 
also reported seeing snipers on a nearby rooftop, raising the possibility of a 
planned ambush, Perez said. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of several politically tinged attacks on Gov. Ruffo, Mexico's former 
attorney general has alleged that Ruffo has tolerated official corruption 
connected to the Arellanos, who are suspected in a three-year wave of murders 
across Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is evident since November of 1992 that the authorities of Baja California 
have protected the Arellanos," said Ignacio Morales Lechuga, now Mexico's 
ambassador to France, in a scathing letter published Friday in a Tijuana 
weekly. "Neither the federal attorney general's office nor the society of Baja 
California have any remaining doubts that the state justice apparatus is 
responsible for the protection of drug traffickers and the wave of violence 
that this phenomenon brings." 
</P>
<P>
 In response, Ruffo suggested that the former attorney general's charges are 
part of an offensive by the dominant Institutional Revolutionary Party during a 
presidential election year. Ruffo, a member of the opposition National Action 
Party, has previously said that Morales' agency failed to act on evidence 
against the cartel provided by the state. 
</P>
<P>
 After Morales was replaced in early 1993, his successor fired or arrested 
hundreds of allegedly corrupt federal officers.

IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT; AT AGE 99, EX-MECHANIC KEEPS UP WITH THOSE IN THE FAST 
LANE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JEFF BRAZIL, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Let's just say John H. Chapman deserves the very senior citizen discount on 
his car insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 You see, this 99-year-old former mechanic is not only of sound mind and body, 
he still drives. 
</P>
<P>
 And one of his pet peeves: Older people who drive too slowly for their -- and 
everybody else's -- good. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get on the freeway and there's a slow-mover, nine times out of 10 you 
look over and it's an old gray-hair. I say, if you can't keep up with the flow 
of traffic, well then, maybe you ought not be on the road." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's cruise control: "Don't trust it." 
</P>
<P>
 Metered on-ramps: "Do they do any good? You wait 15, 16 seconds, and when you 
get on the freeway it's still congested." 
</P>
<P>
 And factory-installed cassette decks: "I guess you're supposed to put records 
in there." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, actually, it's for tapes, but such innovations were hardly de rigueur 
when Chapman first hit the road in 1910. 
</P>
<P>
 Blessed with a ready wit and vigor to spare, Chapman recently walked into a 
Department of Motor Vehicles building in Laguna Hills, aced a driving test and 
got a new license. It authorizes him to be driving past 100 and makes him one 
of the oldest registered drivers in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's all I want, to be able to say I drove at 100," said the man who was 
born the year before actor-comedian George Burns -- everybody's favorite senior 
citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's an accomplishment." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, as of July, 1993, dozens of Californians over the age of 99 had been 
issued driver's licenses. Although there is a widespread perception that 
Chapman and his fellow nonagenarians and centenarians are menaces on the road, 
it is not entirely deserved. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of ageism going around," DMV spokesman Evan Nossoff said. 
</P>
<P>
 Older drivers actually get in fewer accidents each year than very young 
drivers, the DMV said. 
</P>
<P>
 For every 100 drivers 85 and older, an average of 4.8 are involved in 
accidents per year. By comparison, for every 100 drivers 16 to 19 years old, 
9.4 get in accidents in a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Drivers between the ages of 45 and 84 have the fewest number of accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Although DMV statistics show that drivers over age 85 are involved in more 
serious accidents per mile than other age groups, it is roughly equivalent to 
the danger posed by younger drivers -- 4.5 accidents per 1 million miles for 
drivers age 16 to 19, compared to 5.5 accidents per million miles for drivers 
85 and up. 
</P>
<P>
 Basically, if someone advocates barring people over 70 from driving because of 
the increased danger they pose, then, Nossoff said, "we'd have to -- on the 
same grounds -- take licenses away from men under the age of 24 and women under 
the age of 20." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of impaired vision and duller reflexes, older drivers do tend to drive 
slower and make ill-advised turns and lane changes, DMV officials say. But 
statistics show time and again that the most dangerous violation is speeding, 
and older drivers as a group are not guilty of that anywhere near as often as 
their younger counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman is a perfect example of why some older drivers are safer bets than 
younger ones: They are experienced, they drive less and they stay out of 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 In three years, Chapman has logged only 4,800 miles on his glossy white 
Saturn, which he washes himself. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent day, he left his Irvine townhome and drove off to see the "tax 
man." 
</P>
<P>
 As he chugged down the San Diego Freeway, he was no speed demon, but he does 
not mind pushing it to 60, even 65, to keep up with the flow of traffic. In 
fact, he says the speed limit should be increased. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cars today are . . . made to go faster," he said.

PROTEST MAY FORCE RAPIST TO BE MOVED; PAROLE: MODOC COUNTY DELEGATION MEETS 
WITH WILSON. STATE CONSIDERS POSSIBILITY THAT A VICTIM MAY NOW LIVE NEAR SITE 
CHOSEN FOR RELEASED SEX OFFENDER. 
</P>

<P>
 The Wilson Administration on Monday began reviewing new information from Modoc 
County officials that could lead to the transfer of serial rapist Melvin A. 
Carter from that remote northeast California county. 
</P>
<P>
 A delegation from the county pressed its case for the removal of Carter in 
separate meetings with Gov. Pete Wilson and his top prison managers Monday 
afternoon, after which a top Wilson aide said the state is open to the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "They raised a couple of issues we are looking at, and depending on what we 
find, we may reconsider," said Craig Brown, undersecretary of the Youth and 
Adult Correctional Agency. "We are not reconsidering now." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said the Administration is concerned about reports, so far unconfirmed, 
that one of Carter's victims lives in the county. Brown said the state also is 
reviewing the county's contention that the placement of Carter at a minimum 
security work camp violates a state agreement with the U.S. Forest Service for 
use of the land. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration policy, Brown said, is to not release parolees to within 35 
miles of one of their victims. He said the Corrections Department is seeking to 
verify the story of an Alturas woman who says she was raped by Carter 16 years 
ago when she was a student at Cal State Hayward. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown also acknowledged that the placement of Carter at the Devil's Garden 
work camp contradicts what the state said when it built the camp in the 
mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did tell them we wouldn't put violent inmates there," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter, 49, was convicted in 1982 of raping 12 women and admitted assaulting 
dozens of others. He was released last week after serving half of his 25-year 
prison sentence. He is living at the work camp voluntarily but under the 
supervision of state prison guards. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson early Monday sought to distance himself from the fury surrounding 
Carter's release, telling reporters that he did not direct the Corrections 
Department to send Carter to Modoc County. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did not give them a specific instruction as to where," Wilson said. "I set 
up the kind of circumstances I thought would provide maximum protection. The 
department found this particular location." 
</P>
<P>
 Although by day's end the Administration was taking a serious look at the 
chance that one of Carter's victims might be living in Modoc County, Wilson 
earlier showed little concern about the report. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a man who claims he raped a hundred women, and they are probably all 
over the state," Wilson said. "We don't know where they are. We have to put him 
somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 And although Wilson at first refused to meet with the Modoc County delegation, 
he later changed his mind and invited a few of the group's representatives into 
his office for a short discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Colt, chairman of the Modoc County Board of Supervisors, said afterward 
that he was satisfied with the governor's response. 
</P>
<P>
 "He basically said we will work together," Colt said. "We asked him if we 
could work together to resolve this. He said yes. He was genuinely concerned 
with the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 The skirmish over Carter's fate also took a new turn in the court system 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Modoc County Dist. Atty. Ruth Sorensen obtained a Superior Court 
order barring Carter's release in the region. Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren quickly 
sought to invalidate the order and Friday won a temporary stay of its 
enforcement from the 3rd District Court of Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Sorensen filed a reply, asserting that corrections officials had 
violated state law by failing to make written findings for sending Carter to 
Modoc and failed to provide local authorities with notice of his parole.

LOCKYER DELAYS ACTION ON BUDGET DIRECTOR NOMINEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer on Monday sidetracked the nomination of 
Gov. Pete Wilson's state budget director while a Senate committee investigates 
charges that false testimony was given on a proposed Mojave Desert nuclear 
waste dump two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic lawmaker's motion to send the pending confirmation of Russell 
Gould back to the Rules Committee, which had previously approved him, occurred 
without dissent amid renewed controversy over the safety of the Ward Valley 
site. 
</P>
<P>
 While the committee conducts its election-year investigation, Gould will 
remain on the job as director of finance. Earlier, Gould had been in charge of 
the state agency that licenses nuclear dump sites. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Wilson said Gould, in his present job, has "absolutely nothing 
to do with Ward Valley now or will he ever. We are confident (the senators) 
will come to the conclusion that Russ Gould is the best person for the job." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ward Valley issue was reignited last week when U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer 
(D-Calif.) charged that the state Department of Health Services had 
deliberately suppressed information about the types and amounts of nuclear 
wastes that would be dumped there, including plutonium-239 from nuclear power 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
 State health officials have denied that they changed their estimates of the 
amount of plutonium intended for Ward Valley. They said a so-called worst-case 
scenario involving plutonium was merely a theoretical projection required by 
the federal government in a license application. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's action was the second time the Senate delayed advancing Gould because 
of concerns that dumping nuclear waste at Ward Valley could contaminate the 
nearby Colorado River. 
</P>
<P>
 Gould was Wilson's nominee for secretary of health and welfare in 1992, when 
controversy first erupted over the safety of the site. As secretary, Gould had 
administrative authority over the Department of Health Services, which is 
responsible for nuclear safety licensing and enforcement in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The confirmations of Gould and of Molly Coye, the governor's nominee to direct 
the Department of Health Services, were delayed until the Senate satisfied 
itself that safety issues would be properly addressed by the two officials. 
Coye left the Administration last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Coye and Gould both testified as witnesses before the committee that the site 
posed no danger to Southern California, which draws some of its drinking water 
from the Colorado River. 
</P>
<P>
 Gould later was promoted to state director of finance, the most powerful 
fiscal post in Wilson's Administration. He was unanimously recommended for 
confirmation by the Rules Committee last September, but a final vote by the 
Democratic-controlled Senate has been on hold ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockyer said Boxer, an outspoken foe of the Ward Valley site, told him 
officials of the department "intentionally misled the Legislature about the 
nature and extent of the radioactive materials that would be deposited at Ward 
Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a serious charge and ought to be resolved before we act on Gould's 
confirmation," Lockyer told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic senator said the investigation would look into whether Gould, 
Coye and other state officials knew whether "the waste stream description was 
different from that which they told us" two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 He said it was uncertain when the committee would hold new hearings on Gould 
and when the investigation would conclude.

 Egyptian security forces hunting gunmen who ambushed a police vehicle in 
southern Egypt shot dead six Muslim militants in a dawn raid Monday, security 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 They said a policeman was also killed in the raid, taking the death toll in 
violence between militants and security forces since Sunday to 14 -- the 
bloodiest 24 hours this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said the bodies of the militants were riddled with five or six 
bullets each. Security sources said they were members of the Muslim militant 
Gamaa al Islamiya, which is fighting to overthrow President Hosni Mubarak. 
</P>
<P>
 They said the militants opened fire from a cemetery near the town of Abu Tig, 
215 miles south of Cairo, after police moved into a nearby village and arrested 
six people. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of police had swept the area after gunmen ambushed a police vehicle 
on Sunday in Sidfa, a few miles away, killing five policemen and injuring six 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 The ministry said the militants who died Monday -- three of whom were 
teen-agers -- were responsible for the shooting of two policemen and an attack 
on a train last month in which two Egyptians and two foreigners were hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 About 350 people have been killed in political violence in Egypt in the last 
two years, most of them policemen or Muslim militants.

ISRAEL, PLO NEGOTIATORS MEET IN TUNIS TO ADDRESS IMPASSE; MIDEAST: U.S. ENVOY, 
PRESENT AT TALKS, SAY THREE SIDES HELD 'GOOD DISCUSSIONS.' BUT NO BREAKTHROUGH 
IS ANNOUNCED.

 Senior Israeli and Palestinian negotiators closeted themselves in Palestine 
Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat's villa Monday with America's 
chief Mideast coordinator to try to break the impasse that has stalled Middle 
East peace negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Ross, the State Department coordinator for the region, said the three 
sides held "good discussions." 
</P>
<P>
 He prepared for possible consultations with the Israelis at his hotel through 
the night before his scheduled visit to Damascus this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's still more work to be done, but there's work being done that's 
important, and we're going to keep at it," Ross said, leaving Arafat's villa 
shortly before midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 A PLO official said the talks "went well" but needed more time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're getting to the point where we can see that an agreement is 
possible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat met for several hours with an Israeli delegation headed by Uri Savir, 
director general of Israel's Foreign Ministry, before meeting with Ross to 
discuss the possible resumption of Palestinian self-rule talks, frozen since 
the massacre of about 30 Palestinians in a Hebron mosque by a Jewish settler 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides then held another round of talks Monday night, as the United 
States tried to find common ground on Palestinian demands for increased 
security for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip in the wake 
of the mosque attack. 
</P>
<P>
 PLO sources said the proposals offered by Israel -- reportedly including a 
Palestinian police force in Hebron under Israeli control, designation of Red 
Cross observers as all or part of an international force in the occupied 
territories and rounding up Jewish settlers in the Hebron area into a single 
location -- are still insufficient. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat is said to have responded derisively to the proposal for Red Cross 
observers in place of the armed international force of observers sought by the 
PLO. 
</P>
<P>
 "He thought the idea was funny," a PLO official said. "Some people are now 
even starting to make jokes about it -- about how the international observers 
will come in with Band-Aids instead of guns." 
</P>
<P>
 Another Arafat adviser said the PLO rejected Israel's move for relocating 
Hebron settlers into a single group, insisting that all of them be moved out of 
the area. The PLO has also rejected the idea of a Palestinian police force 
under Israeli control. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were indications as the talks progressed that some common ground may 
be possible to get the negotiations back on track, if not as early as Thursday, 
when Israel Radio reported hopes for a meeting in Paris between Arafat and 
Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres. 
</P>
<P>
 One PLO official said the Israeli delegation seemed to be sympathetic to the 
PLO need for a public move on Palestinian security in the wake of widespread 
anger and growing opposition to the peace process among Palestinians in the 
occupied territories after the Hebron massacre. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're realistic enough to know that we need something," a PLO 
official said. "The most important thing is to start the negotiations again so 
we can get the Israeli army out of Gaza and Jericho. That's the first step. 
Because I don't think any of us are so naive not to know that when it comes 
down to a confrontation between Palestinians and a Jewish settler, which side 
the army's going to be on." 
</P>
<P>
 Yasser Abed-Rabbo, head of the PLO's information department, said the meetings 
Monday afternoon consisted mainly of an exchange of views. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were no results until now," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Peres, in remarks broadcast Monday, said he expected the PLO to participate in 
peace talks along with Syria, Lebanon and Jordan in early April. 
</P>
<P>
 In Israel, meantime, there was speculation in the media Monday that Israel 
might show some flexibility on troop withdrawals. The Hebrew daily Maariv 
reported that Israel is prepared to begin withdrawing troops from Gaza even 
before a final agreement is reached in a renewed round of negotiations.

MOSQUE SECURITY HAD WORRIED RABIN LAST FALL; ISRAEL: TESTIMONY REVEALS THAT 
PRIME MINISTER ASKED FOR PREVENTIVE MEASURES IN OCTOBER AT THE HEBRON SITE 
WHERE A SETTLER SLAUGHTERED PALESTINIANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was aware as early as last October of the 
likelihood of escalating extremist acts at Hebron's Cave of the Patriarchs, the 
holy site where an armed Jewish settler massacred about 30 Palestinians last 
month, a senior Israeli commander testified Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin stressed on several occasions, in private meetings with his top military 
officials, the need for more security to prevent increased settler violence at 
a shrine sacred to both Jews and Muslims, said Brig. Gen. Gadi Zohar, who heads 
the Civil Administration, Israel's military government in the occupied West 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Zohar's testimony, the latest in a series of revelations before a five-member 
Israeli judicial commission investigating the Feb. 25 killings, appeared to add 
to the growing evidence of security lapses at a holy site that the Israeli 
government knew had become a flash point that could undermine the Middle East 
peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 But Zohar and a retired Israeli brigadier general also indicated in their 
testimony before the commission Monday that no one in the military or the 
government foresaw the "extraordinary act of a lunatic," such as Baruch 
Goldstein, the Brooklyn-born physician who fired more than 100 rounds from an 
assault rifle into a crowd of kneeling Muslims as they prayed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It never occurred to me that a Jew would be capable of committing such an 
act," said Brig. Gen. Moshe Yaalon, who served as Israel's military commander 
in the occupied West Bank until the first of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, Yaalon added, the security system that permitted Jewish worshipers to 
carry weapons into the shrine but required hand-searches of all Muslims 
entering the Cave of the Patriarchs was designed solely to prevent Arab attacks 
on Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would not reach any conclusions from the extraordinary act of a lunatic," 
Yaalon told the commission, set up to answer questions surrounding the 
massacre. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier testimony indicated that the incident occurred at a time when there 
were fewer Israeli guards at the site than there were supposed to be and that 
the soldiers there took no notice of Goldstein and his weaponry. 
</P>
<P>
 "God forbid, I could have found myself testifying before a commission after 
Jews were butchered by 500 inflamed Muslim attackers," Yaalon said. "Then the 
question would have been, 'Why weren't the Jews armed when they were praying so 
close to 500 Muslims?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, the violence continued Monday in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 An Israeli officer and a soldier were killed when a roadside bomb exploded 
beside their passing patrol in Israel's self-declared security zone in south 
Lebanon, where Israel's forces have been on a state of high alert for possible 
reprisals for the mosque massacre. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel responded Monday afternoon by shelling suspected strongholds of the 
Islamic resistance group Hezbollah, or Party of God, which claimed 
responsibility for Monday's attack. A 12-year-old girl was killed and 22 other 
children injured when a shell struck near a school bus, according to reports 
from south Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, at least three Jewish settlers were injured in the occupied 
West Bank when an armed group opened fire on a bus taking them to their 
settlement north of Ramallah. And at least 16 Palestinians were injured when 
Israeli security forces opened fire to quell continuing protests throughout the 
West Bank and Gaza Strip, where last month's killings ignited a storm of 
outrage that has left dozens of Palestinians dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Last October -- amid similar protest, bloodshed and escalating tension between 
Jews and Arabs who opposed Rabin's peace declaration with Yasser Arafat, 
chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization -- Zohar recalled the prime 
minister stressing in his security meetings the sensitivity of Hebron's Cave of 
the Patriarchs. 
</P>
<P>
 Zohar cited an attack inside the Muslim section of the shrine, attributed to 
the Jewish extremist settler movement. In that incident, he said, Jewish 
extremists poured acid on Islamic prayer carpets. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to Rabin by another of his job titles, Zohar said: "The defense 
minister referred to the subject of the cave a number of times, in which he 
stressed the sensitivity of the place and the need to act there in accordance 
with the (security) arrangements. As far as I can recall, every time that I 
brought the subject up . . . (Rabin) expressed a great deal of interest and 
responded." 
</P>
<P>
 Zohar conceded that security arrangements at the shrine where Jews and Muslims 
pray so close to one another are "problematic," but he insisted that 
appropriate precautions had been taken. 
</P>
<P>
 He provided no further specifics in his testimony. But articles Monday in two 
prominent Hebrew dailies -- Davar and Al Hamishmar -- cited meetings that Rabin 
called on Oct. 22 and 29, when "members of the security apparatus were told 
that he (Rabin) believed that there was a possibility that Jews would try to 
create provocations in the Cave of the Patriarchs in order to derail the peace 
process." 
</P>
<P>
 Both stories reported that Rabin stated in the Oct. 22 meeting, "What is being 
said here about the rugs in the Cave of the Patriarchs should draw attention to 
those holy places which can naturally move it from a national problem to a 
religious one."

TURNING IN CLASSMATES TOTING GUNS IS PAYING OFF IN MEMPHIS

 Capt. William Cox couldn't tell if the child's voice on the other end of the 
telephone line belonged to a boy or girl. When they are that young, it is hard 
to know, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ross Elementary School student called Weapon Watch to report that a 
10-year-old classmate had brought a gun and knife to school in her book bag 
that day. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was mad at somebody," the voice said when asked why the girl decided to 
pack a pistol in among her books, note pads and pencils. "It isn't the first 
time she brought it." 
</P>
<P>
 "Well we don't want her shooting anybody," Cox replied before assigning the 
anonymous tipster a code number and asking the student to call him in the 
morning for more instructions. 
</P>
<P>
 By turning in a fellow classmate, the youngster may have just earned $50 under 
Weapon Watch, a program recently implemented by the Memphis City School 
District to get children involved in ridding their schools of crime. Believed 
to be the only hot line of its kind in the country, students are rewarded if 
they give police information that leads to the confiscation of weapons and, in 
almost all cases, the arrest of the classmates who bring them on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the program began in the 104,000-pupil district in November, more than 
500 calls have come in -- resulting in the recovery of more than 70 weapons and 
the arrest of nearly 70 students. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those turned in have been a 9-year-old carrying a knife and an 
11-year-old with a sawed-off rifle. Officials have confiscated dozens of guns 
-- including a 9-millimeter pistol, a 380-millimeter automatic and a 
.38-caliber revolver -- along with an assortment of knives, razors and other 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 And the phones at 528-CASH haven't stopped ringing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a positive program and it is working," said Luvenia Lemmons, president 
of the Memphis Council of PTAs, who supported its implementation. "At first, 
people were against it because they thought it was snitching. But not having to 
turn in their names has helped remove that stigma." 
</P>
<P>
 The program was approved last year by a task force on school violence. Instead 
of buying metal detectors like other districts have done, Memphis officials 
decided to get students to weed out the weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district joined forces with the Memphis Police Department and Crime 
Stoppers, a group that financially rewards citizens for calling in tips about 
crimes. Students who call in are given a secret code number. Once they get a 
call, police are dispatched to the school and officers conduct an 
investigation. If a weapon is found, Cox makes arrangements to secretly meet 
and pay off the informant. 
</P>
<P>
 Weapon Watch's success has prompted nearby districts to join in. "We look at 
it as an ounce of prevention," said James E. Hayslip, public relations director 
for the Shelby County school district on the outskirts of Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has gotten in on Weapon Watch by 
tracking the confiscated weapons as part of a nationwide effort to crack down 
on juveniles carrying guns. The guns will be traced to determine who the owners 
are and whether the weapons were stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the program has had an effect and a good effect," said Cox, a 30-year 
veteran officer who is in charge of Weapon Watch. "I think it is something of 
the future, something all cities could use. It is here to stay."

DEATH DATE LIFTS SERIAL KILLER OUT OF OBSCURITY; JOHN WAYNE GACY'S NEW TEAM OF 
LAWYERS LEAPS INTO ACTION. A PUBLICITY BLITZ IS PLANNED, SUPPORTERS RALLY. 
EFFORTS ARE SEEN AS IN VAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 John Wayne Gacy's days repeat themselves, one after another, in the sort of 
well-ordered, stress-free routine that a maximum security prison can provide: 
Three square meals. Free time to correspond with pen pals. A regular pinochle 
game with fellow prisoners. And, when the spirit moves him, long hours devoted 
to painting. 
</P>
<P>
 It is an existence Gacy has grown accustomed to after 14 years spent on Death 
Row at Menard Correctional Institute in southern Illinois. He has lived there 
-- in a 6-by-9-foot cell festooned with paintings of clown characters and a 
Chicago Cubs banner -- since his March, 1980, conviction for the murders of 33 
boys and young men in his suburban Chicago house, the worst recorded case of 
serial killings in the United States this century. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, after more than a decade of filing tortuous legal appeals to stave off a 
death sentence, Gacy's routine faces the ultimate interruption. Last October, 
the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear Gacy's appeal of his death sentence, and 
the Illinois Supreme Court quickly responded in December by ordering his death 
by lethal injection on May 10. 
</P>
<P>
 In the months since the court's order, Gacy has become a high-profile inmate 
after years of reclusion. A new team of lawyers is filing last-ditch motions to 
overturn his conviction. He is sifting through interview offers from tabloid 
news shows, planning a publicity blitz to insist he killed no one. The Illinois 
attorney general is suing Gacy to recover profits from the sale of his artwork. 
And partisans even have set up a taped toll telephone number -- advertised as 
"John Wayne Gacy Speaks" -- to give voice to his protestations of innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 A new motion has been filed claiming that Gacy was "incompetent" to stand 
trial and, as a result, cannot be put to death because Illinois law prohibits 
the execution of incompetents. And after poring over old business records that 
Gacy kept in his work as a contractor, Gregory Adamski, one of his attorneys, 
now plans to submit proof alleging he was out of town -- in Little Rock, Ark., 
Kansas City and Upstate New York -- when several of the killings took place. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can show that he did not kill even one of these boys, that throws doubt 
on the state's case," Adamski said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gacy was arrested in December, 1978, in suburban Norwood Park in connection 
with the disappearance of a 15-year-old boy who sought a part-time laborer's 
job with Gacy's building repair firm. Over the following weeks, police and 
medical examiners removed the skeletons of 29 youths from the crawl space under 
Gacy's home. Pleading insanity, Gacy admitted the killings but was convicted 
and sentenced to death for 12 murders and given life sentences for the other 21 
slayings. 
</P>
<P>
 Renee Goldfarb, a criminal appeals lawyer in Cook County, said she expected 
state appellate judges to make short work of Gacy's final appeals. The 
incompetence claim has failed in the past, she said. And the tack of using 
business records to exonerate Gacy is so flimsy, Goldfarb said, that "his own 
(previous) lawyers repeatedly told him it was a waste of time." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, state lawyers are seeking a court order to seize Gacy's prison bank 
account under a little-used law allowing officials to recover the cost of his 
incarceration. As of December, the state had paid $141,074 to house Gacy at 
Menard. 
</P>
<P>
 Adamski has said that Gacy has made more than $30,000 on the sale of his 
artwork -- oil paintings of pastoral scenes, skulls and grinning clowns. Before 
his arrest, Gacy, calling himself "Pogo," appeared as a clown at children's 
parties and charity events. 
</P>
<P>
 His paintings rarely sell for more than a "few hundred dollars," Adamski said. 
Collectors are most often Gacy's correspondents -- he receives more than 100 
letters a week, the lawyer said -- or those fascinated with serial killers. 
</P>
<P>
 Gacy had spent up to six hours a day painting -- a routine he recently 
suspended, Adamski said, because of the state's attempt to seize his profits. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent press conference detailing the effort against Gacy, Illinois Atty. 
Gen. Roland Burris said that the inmate "is still manipulating the system." 
Fears that Gacy has been transferring his art profits to other accounts to 
frustrate the state's legal bid has led one legislator to sponsor a state bill 
to freeze an inmate's assets when a suit is filed. 
</P>
<P>
 As his death date approaches, Gacy likely will grant a paid interview to a 
tabloid news show, Adamski said -- money that will be used to defray his legal 
costs. "Whoever will pay us the most," Adamski said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Gacy sticks to his time-honored schedule, Adamski said, rising at 
10 a.m., talking strategy with his lawyers, keeping up his contacts with his 
small tribe of friends on the outside. There are so many letters, Adamski said, 
that Gacy has collected his favorites in a slim volume of correspondence. 
</P>
<P>
 He calls it "Letters to Mr. Gacy."

TURKISH MILITARY, GUERRILLAS ESCALATE BATTLE OF WILLS

 This nation's highest appeals court on Monday upheld the detention of six 
Kurdish members of Parliament accused of treason, while in the war-scarred 
countryside, security forces and Marxist guerrillas fought a battle of wills in 
a struggle that is polarizing this key country at the crossroads of the Balkans 
and the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
 In Kurdish-dominated areas of southeastern Turkey, Monday was Nowruz, an 
ancient regional festival greeting the first day of spring. In recent years, 
celebrations of folk dancing and fire-jumping had become a stage for bloody 
protests by Turkish Kurds seeking greater ethnic and political rights. 
</P>
<P>
 At least two people died in a police raid in the southeastern city of 
Diyarbakir on Monday, and Kurdish leaders reported about 200 arrests, but most 
people stayed home. 
</P>
<P>
 The Turkish armed forces flooded the southeast with troops, and, atypically, 
invited Kurds to celebrate a festival that has long triggered official 
disapproval. In response, the guerrillas, who seek an independent Kurdish 
state, instructed people to stay off the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a draw Monday in the distant, rural and poor region where about half of 
Turkey's 12 million Kurds live and about 11,000 people have died in the 
decade-long struggle between guerrillas and the armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once again the people were trapped in the middle," reported Mettin Corabatir, 
a Turkish television newsman, as cameras panned through tense streets patrolled 
by gunmen in civilian clothes and soldiers in uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 The balance of terror gripping the southeast has drawn fire from international 
human rights activists, who accuse both the armed forces and guerrillas of the 
Kurdistan Workers Party of major abuses. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 800 villages have been forcibly evacuated -- some of them destroyed 
-- in an army drive to isolate the guerrillas, who often murder country folk 
who shun their cause. Hundreds of Kurdish leaders in the southeast have been 
slain, and arbitrary arrest and torture are routine tools of state repression, 
human rights groups charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven radical Kurdish members of Parliament were arrested earlier this month 
after being stripped of their parliamentary immunity. They allegedly expressed 
support for guerrillas fighting for a separate state for the 20 million to 30 
million Kurds, a non-Turkic, non-Arabic people who speak their own language but 
lack their own country. 
</P>
<P>
 The Turkish constitution asserts that there are no minorities in Turkey. Calls 
for Kurdish rights, therefore, are treasonable in the view of government 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for the jailed Kurds argued that lifting their immunity was illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, as widely anticipated by Turkish observers, the country's 
constitutional court disagreed. It freed one of the deputies on a technicality, 
but confirmed detention of the rest.

 The political opposition gained a foothold in the National Assembly for the 
first time in this nation's post-colonial history, as President Zine Abidine 
ben Ali, running unopposed, won a huge mandate for his program of economic 
liberalization and clamping down on Islamic fundamentalism.

 Official turnout was more than 94% as 2.9 million voters went to the polls in 
the first election contested by opposition parties since Tunisia's independence 
from France in 1956, authorities announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben Ali, whose war on religious fundamentalism has left Tunisia virtually 
immune from the political turbulence of its North African neighbors -- at the 
expense of thousands of arrests and restrictions on human rights -- won 
endorsement from 99.91% of the electorate. 
</P>
<P>
 Parties from the political opposition took a legally allocated 19 seats in the 
National Assembly, their first edge into a government that has been dominated 
since independence by the ruling Constitutional Democratic Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal opposition has been less adamant than Ben Ali in making overtures to 
the West, expressing support for fellow Arab states Iraq and Libya in their 
confrontations with America and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben Ali has been a cornerstone of Western policy in the Middle East, 
presenting one of the first prospects for Arab recognition of Israel, as 
Tunisia has permitted Israeli officials to come and go through its capital in 
recent months in meetings with the Palestine Liberation Organization, 
headquartered in Tunis. 
</P>
<P>
 Tunisia hosted the first multilateral peace talks between Arab states and 
Israel to be held in an Arab country. 
</P>
<P>
 Newspapers proclaimed the elections "the Tunisian spring," but opposition 
leaders branded the polling a hypocrisy since no one ran against Ben Ali, who 
took power from the ailing Habib Bourguiba, Tunisia's onetime president for 
life, in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Moncef Marzouki, a prominent human rights activist, had announced his 
candidacy for the presidency but was not permitted to run under regulations, 
which require nomination by 30 deputies of the National Assembly or regional 
councils. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben Ali's party until now has held all 141 seats in the National Assembly; it 
also controls all but one of Tunisia's municipal councils. Marzouki had sought 
a delay in the elections to change the rules but did not succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 A second potential opponent, Abdel Rahman Hani, leader of a small nationalist 
party unrecognized by authorities, also announced his candidacy and challenged 
Ben Ali to a televised debate. But he was arrested and charged with forming an 
illegal association and spreading defamatory and false information. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can say whatever they please, but as far as we're concerned, these 
elections are a disgrace to the people of Tunisia," said Sayed Ferghani, a 
spokesman for the outlawed Islamic organization, Nahda, exiled in London. 
</P>
<P>
 Tunisian officials have deliberately opted for a cautious approach toward 
democratization, watching the unhappy example of neighboring Algeria, where a 
full-blown legalization of political parties and free elections led to a 
victory of Islamic fundamentalists and a subsequent military crackdown to set 
aside the election results, perching the country on the verge of civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in Egypt, the blossoming of an Islamic fundamentalist movement has 
resulted in numerous attacks on foreign tourists, throwing the tourism industry 
into chaos and raising doubts about the future course of democratic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Tunisia, despite some incidents of violence that included a purported plot to 
assassinate Ben Ali, has been a relative island of calm and prosperity in 
turbulent North Africa. It has focused on economic liberalization, tourism and 
agricultural development. Most citizens seem to approve of Ben Ali's plans for 
development, even if the toll on human rights for the fundamentalists has been 
high. 
</P>
<P>
 Now seven years into a structural adjustment program designed to make the 
economy more market-oriented, growth has averaged 4.9% over the last six years 
and inflation is low, though unemployment stands at 13%.

MANDELA PRAISES S. AFRICAN POLICE AT RALLY; POLITICS: SPEECH CONVEYS HIS INTENT 
TO CALM FEARS AND BUILD SUPPORT AMONG THE WHITE-LED FORCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB DROGIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thirty-four years after one of the bloodiest, most infamous police massacres 
of the apartheid years, Nelson Mandela appeared Monday at his campaign's 
largest rally yet to praise an unlikely group: the much-maligned police. 
</P>
<P>
 "The majority of police . . . want peace," Mandela told the more than 75,000 
people who jammed Miami Beach, a weed-filled field beside a foul-smelling 
industrial pond here. "The majority of police are made up of honest people, 
black and white, who want to serve our country. We need them. They need us. 
Together we must work together to build a better South Africa." 
</P>
<P>
 His surprising testimonial came only three days after an independent judicial 
panel released a report alleging that three of the country's most senior police 
officials had secretly funneled assault rifles, mortars, grenade launchers and 
other weapons to Inkatha Freedom Party guerrillas in hopes of sabotaging the 
move toward democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was clear evidence of how Mandela, the African National Congress leader 
who is expected to win next month's democratic elections to become the nation's 
first black president, has already focused on calming fears and building 
support in the anxious ranks of the white-led police force. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere is the grim legacy of police brutality and misconduct more etched in 
blood than here, 35 miles southeast of Johannesburg, in the dusty sprawl of 
tin-roofed shanties, unpaved roads and burning trash heaps of Sharpeville. 
</P>
<P>
 It was just before noon on March 21, 1960, when what has been described as the 
first major demonstration against apartheid was launched. Thousands of unarmed 
blacks gathered outside a small police station to protest "pass laws," which 
severely restricted where blacks could live or work. 
</P>
<P>
 Police, frightened by the crowd, suddenly opened fire. When the dust cleared, 
they had killed 69 people and wounded 180 others, most of them shot in the 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody was fighting," recalled Douglas Mgxekwe, 76, a grizzled survivor of 
the massacre who waited for Mandela in the crowd's crush Monday. "Suddenly they 
shoot. Everyone run away. It was a nightmare. I never forget it." 
</P>
<P>
 The killings signaled the end of a nonviolent, passive resistance campaign 
that was begun in the 1950s against apartheid. It also marked a vast increase 
in violent government repression. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela's giant rally was fairly unforgettable as well. Supporters hung in 
trees, lined roofs, clung to playground equipment and jammed so tightly on the 
field that more than a dozen people passed out or were injured and had to be 
carried out to medics. Others caused near panic as they threw stones, waved 
assault rifles and axes or tried to ram their way through the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 The crush was so severe that Mandela was unable to reach the stage for 45 
minutes after landing nearby in a helicopter. When he finally took the 
microphone, the stern-faced leader repeatedly interrupted his prepared speech 
to give a tongue-lashing instead to his security men, the press, the ANC 
publicity department, the crowd, local "ruffians" and especially ANC local 
organizers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's lucky that nobody has died here," he said angrily. "It is a totally 
unacceptable situation." 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as he finished speaking, bursts of gunfire suddenly echoed behind the 
stage from local bands of armed, dancing partisans. Mandela's bodyguards, 
waving shotguns and pistols, circled close around him and hustled him into a 
car. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela's safety has become a growing concern as the election approaches and 
tension rises. On Sunday, Mandela's armored limousine was pelted with stones by 
National Party supporters as he left a rally in Manenberg. He canceled campaign 
appearances among Zulus in Natal province on Friday and Saturday after aides 
reported assassination threats.

UKRAINE SENDS 2ND LOAD OF WARHEADS; U.S. VOWS MORE AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A second trainload of nuclear warheads has been sent from Ukraine to Russia 
for dismantling, officials said Monday, as U.S. Defense Secretary William J. 
Perry arrived for a visit to a missile base and to deliver a pledge of $100 
million more in U.S. aid. 
</P>
<P>
 After a day of closed-door meetings with Perry, government officials said a 
train carrying 60 warheads removed from missiles in Ukraine left for Russia 
under heavy security on March 14.The news came on the eve of a visit by Perry 
to one of the missile bases from which warheads are being removed. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry came to Kiev for two days of talks, concerned that an agreement by 
Ukraine to eliminate its nuclear weapons was stalled. The agreement was reached 
in January by the presidents of Russia, Ukraine and the United States. The 
announcement by Ukraine indicates that "progress on the nuclear disarmament 
phase of that agreement is going very well," Perry said.

U.N., SERBIAN TROOPS IN FACEOFF OVER WEAPONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Times Wire Services

<TEXT>
<P>
 Guns pointed toward each other, U.N. peacekeepers faced off Monday with 
Bosnian Serbs over tanks, antiaircraft guns and mortars found in a weapons-free 
zone around Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the worst reported violation of the U.N.-ordered weapons pullback from 
around the capital since it took effect Feb. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 By late Monday, the Serbian and Canadian troops -- separated by a few hundred 
yards -- were waiting for the outcome of talks on the standoff. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Serbian forces and mines were surrounding two groups of Canadian 
troops, said Cmdr. Simon MacDowall, a spokesman for the U.N. peacekeepers. 
Serbs eventually removed the mines to allow for talks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble began over the weekend when the Canadians were checking on arms 
discovered weeks ago and found four tanks, three antiaircraft cannons, four 
howitzers and 18 mortars nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 The guns were not pointed at Sarajevo and were in no position to strike at the 
capital. But the United Nations wants the guns moved north out of the zone or 
put in U.N. weapons collection centers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Serbs have agreed to withdraw or place under U.N. control all heavy 
weapons in a 12-mile radius around Sarajevo or face NATO air strikes. But they 
use a different center when measuring the zone, and argued that the arms found 
Monday were outside it. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Monday, at the United Nations, Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali 
proposed that NATO expand its air cover to Croatia and that the Security 
Council extend the U.N. mandate in the Balkans, which expires March 31, for six 
more months.

SCANT TURNOUT MAY VOID LOCAL RUSSIAN VOTING; ELECTIONS: APATHY IN ST. 
PETERSBURG AND 16 OTHER REGIONS SHOWS CITIZEN PATIENCE IS WEARING THIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pitiful turnout for local elections, coupled with a host of polling 
irregularities, threatened to invalidate the vote in Russia's second-largest 
city, officials said Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, as in 16 other Russian regions where local elections were held Sunday, 
apathetic citizens stayed away from polls, demonstrating that their patience 
with Russia's worsening economic situation has worn thin. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Petersburg voters showed remarkable indifference Sunday, when only 19% 
participated in elections for the newly created City Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 The election, which had to attract 25% of eligible voters to be binding, had 
seemed doomed to fail, although Mayor Anatoly A. Sobchak made some apparently 
successful last-ditch efforts to salvage what was shaping up to be a political 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Sobchak, for example, extended poll hours to Monday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 He also took the extraordinary step of widening the electorate: Initially 
those students and army draftees who are only temporarily in St. Petersburg had 
been forbidden to vote, but Monday they were being frantically summoned to the 
polls. 
</P>
<P>
 This change in the rules, however, infuriated hundreds of candidates, and the 
city prosecutor's office announced that it will challenge the validity of the 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
 In some polling stations here Sunday, fewer voters had turned out by noon than 
there were candidates on the ballot. The apathy was just as bad on Monday. At 
Station No. 31 -- across the street from the City Assembly -- 10 people had 
turned up by noon to choose among a ballot of 19 candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the final hour of polling, the city had a 24.99% turnout. But Gennady N. 
Petrov, chief of the City Assembly press center, said that, in the final hour, 
more than 4,000 voters turned out, pushing the final turnout figure to 25.6%. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, local elections in many Russian regions Sunday failed to attract the 
needed quorum. 
</P>
<P>
 From Murmansk in the frigid Russian north to Kamchatka, across the Bering Sea 
from Alaska, voters showed dissatisfaction with Russia's political course by 
staying home. 
</P>
<P>
 Final results in most elections have not yet been announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Local elections have been held in Russia's 89 regions and republics on a 
rolling basis since December; 29 more regions are to hold their local elections 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 In St. Petersburg, many of the 754 candidates, representing 16 parties and 
countless independents, descended on the Election Commission on Monday with 
complaints about the voting. They said that in several polling places, ballot 
boxes were opened late Sunday night and left opened and unguarded until Monday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a local newscast reported late Sunday that sausages were being sold 
cheap outside a meat-packing factory whose director is a candidate for city 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 At the elections commission, a complaint of cheaply sold chicken legs outside 
one voting station caused amused consternation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sausages and chicken legs are hard to sort out," commission member 
Yevgeny Baklagin said. "What constitutes a criminally low price? I'm not even 
sure what the going rate for chicken legs is these days."

WESTERN IDEA OF HUMAN RIGHTS IS FOREIGN, JAPAN LEADER TELLS CHINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa said Monday that he had told his 
Chinese counterpart, Li Peng, that the Western concept of human rights should 
not be blindly applied to all nations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him that it is not proper to force a Western- or European-type 
democracy onto others," Hosokawa told reporters en route to Tokyo via Shanghai 
after his three-day trip to China. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made the same statement when I met President Clinton last November" in 
Seattle, Hosokawa said. 
</P>
<P>
 His controversial remarks were made at a banquet hosted by Li on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese Foreign Ministry officials traveling with Hosokawa had not made the 
prime minister's statement public to reporters in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 They had only said Hosokawa urged Beijing to improve its human rights record. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan is locked in a difficult diplomatic situation as it wants to strengthen 
ties with China -- the world's fastest-growing economy -- while facing a bitter 
trade dispute with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, in Tokyo earlier this month before 
going on to Beijing, asked Hosokawa to cooperate with Washington in pressing 
China to better its human rights record. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher later warned China's leaders that they stand to lose their 
preferential trading status if they did not show progress on human rights. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sharp rebuff, Chinese police rounded up dissidents before and during his 
visit. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Christopher said he was optimistic that China will meet 
Washington's demands for human rights improvements.

RESTORATION OF RAPE CHARGES IS SOUGHT

<TEXT>
<P>
 Citing what he said was a series of legal blunders, the state attorney general 
asked a court Monday to reinstate rape charges against five men allowed to 
plead guilty to misdemeanors in a 1991 assault on an unconscious woman in a 
tavern. 
</P>
<P>
 The men pleaded guilty to sexual misconduct and were each fined $750.As part 
of a plea agreement, the original charges of first-degree rape, a felony 
carrying a sentence of up to 25 years in prison, were dismissed last June. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference in New York City, Atty. Gen. G. Oliver Koppell said he 
had asked a state Supreme Court judge to reinstate the rape indictments on 
grounds they had been illegally dismissed by a local judge who lacked 
jurisdiction and misapplied the law.

CLINTON TREASURY AIDE IN EARLY BRIEFING ON FAILED S&L; ETHICS: POLITICAL 
APPOINTEE ALTMAN WAS TOLD ARKANSAS THRIFT CASE WOULD GO TO JUSTICE DEPT. HE 
ALSO IS A REGULATOR, RAISING CONFLICT PROBLEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman was told in advance by a top federal 
regulator that the investigation into the failed Madison Guaranty Savings & 
Loan would be referred to the Justice Department for possible prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no indication that Altman tipped off the White House about the 
looming criminal referral. The session predates Treasury general counsel Jean 
E. Hanson's controversial Sept. 29 meeting with then-White House Counsel 
Bernard Nussbaum, in which she alerted the White House to the pending referral 
from the Resolution Trust Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Altman received the briefing from William Roelle, a top official of the RTC, 
and Hanson, senior Treasury officials say. The two told Altman that a criminal 
referral in the Madison case "was coming to the surface" within the RTC. The 
RTC asked the Justice Department to begin a criminal probe on Oct. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 The Altman session is the earliest known briefing for a top Administration 
official on the Madison case, which is part of special counsel Robert B. Fiske 
Jr.'s investigation into President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton's 
Whitewater Development Corp. real estate investment in Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 But the briefing highlights the possible conflict between Altman's dual roles 
as acting chief executive officer of the RTC, an independent regulatory agency, 
and as a Clinton political appointee at the Treasury Department. Altman is a 
college classmate of Clinton and campaign adviser to him in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Altman described the briefing as a five-minute conversation that occurred 
during a meeting called to discuss the Treasury's investigation of the Bureau 
of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearm's handling of the Branch Davidian tragedy in 
Waco, Tex. He said Hanson took the initiative to tell him that the RTC was 
about to issue its criminal referral in the Madison case. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials stress that the substance of the criminal case was not discussed 
with Altman. In Hanson's meeting with Nussbaum, she told him that the Clintons 
would be mentioned as possible beneficiaries of illegal actions related to the 
Madison case. 
</P>
<P>
 Altman has been under fire from Republicans in Congress for a meeting he held 
with Nussbaum last month to discuss the Madison case and has recused himself 
from any further involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 He also has effectively ended all day-to-day responsibility for the RTC and 
plans to step down as the RTC's acting chief executive on March 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Altman stressed in an interview with The Times that he told the RTC to handle 
the case of Madison Guaranty just as it would any other criminal matter, and 
that he in no way intervened. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Katsanos, a spokesman for the RTC, says that the briefing was "routine" 
because of Altman's role as acting head of the RTC. 
</P>
<P>
 Altman said he did not know Hanson planned to tell the White House about the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanson's decision to brief the White House has been questioned by 
congressional Republicans who say it shows the case has been subject to 
high-level political interference. 
</P>
<P>
 Her meeting with Nussbaum was the first of three Whitewater-related sessions 
between Treasury and White House officials that are also now the subject of the 
Fiske's investigation. Even Treasury officials concede that Hanson's meeting 
with Nussbaum is the most troubling of the three meetings. Hanson was 
unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Altman, Hanson and Treasury chief of staff Josh Steiner are all scheduled to 
appear before the Whitewater grand jury this week to testify about the 
meetings, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 News of the earlier meeting comes just as Altman and Treasury are being 
inundated with questions about Whitewater. The controversy has fueled rumors, 
repeatedly denied by Treasury officials, that both Treasury Secretary Lloyd 
Bentsen and Altman were on the verge of resigning. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Altman insists that he won't let the cloud of suspicion now hanging over 
him deter him from keeping up with his work. And he says he will not resign, 
telling people that they will have to "carry him out feet first."

GOP BALKS AS BANK HEARING IS CANCELED; POLITICS: REPUBLICANS HAD PLANNED TO 
RAISE THE WHITEWATER ISSUE. GONZALEZ INSTEAD CALLS FOR A SELECT PANEL TO PROBE 
THE CONTROVERSIAL MATTER.

 Escalating the partisan confrontation over the Whitewater controversy, the 
chairman of the House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee Monday 
abruptly canceled a hearing in which Republican lawmakers had planned to 
question President Clinton's connections to a failed Arkansas savings and loan. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a surprising twist that appeared to catch Democratic leaders off guard, 
Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.) also called for the creation of a select 
committee to conduct full hearings and to investigate "every aspect" of the 
tangled Whitewater events. 
</P>
<P>
 Some equally surprised Republicans saw Gonzalez's call for special hearings as 
a tactic to delay a congressional review -- the first phase of which would have 
been a hearing Thursday. Yet Democratic sources said that the move is likely to 
reinforce the leadership's reluctant consensus that Congress sooner or later 
must conduct its own investigation of allegations that depositors' funds from 
the failed Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan were diverted to a real estate 
venture in which the President and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton had an 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
 House leaders had opposed congressional hearings on the grounds that they 
would interfere with the criminal investigation now being conducted by special 
counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. But House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) told 
reporters Monday evening that House Democrats hope to reach a compromise with 
their GOP counterparts on a formula for the hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Foley added that he would be meeting with Minority Leader Robert H. Michel 
(R-Ill.) today to "work out the conditions on which some hearings might take 
place" in the near future, provided they do not interfere "with the needs of 
the special counsel." 
</P>
<P>
 A similar compromise already has been negotiated in the Senate, which voted 
unanimously last week to recommend that senators take their own look at 
Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 No date or forum for the hearings were set but the Senate leadership also will 
meet this week in an effort to work out details. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitewater, meanwhile, seemed to be putting more of a strain on the President 
during a visit to a seniors' center in Deerfield Beach, Fla. Responding to a 
reporter's inquiry about Whitewater, Clinton said: "My faith that the truth 
will win out has been sorely tested in the last few weeks. But it's still 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 He dismissed a question about whether he is worried that the plea bargain 
struck by David Hale, an Arkansas banker and former Little Rock municipal 
judge, would prompt a new round of disclosures about his and his wife's 
involvement with the Whitewater real estate project and its ties to Madison. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is all a bunch of bull," Clinton said, shaking his head and appearing 
frustrated about the Whitewater questions that constantly seem to hound him. 
"Why don't you guys let the special counsel do his job?" 
</P>
<P>
 Until this week, that was also the question that Democrats on Capitol Hill 
asked when pressed by their GOP counterparts to agree to Whitewater hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 But their concern that such hearings would turn into a political circus, 
giving the Republicans a platform from which to attack the President, has 
gradually been overtaken by a conviction that Whitewater could end up 
overshadowing Clinton's legislative agenda, threatening health care and other 
initiatives, unless the Democrats deal with it. 
</P>
<P>
 As White House aides are subpoenaed to appear before a federal grand jury, 
concern is also growing among Democrats that a continuing refusal to hear 
Whitewater testimony will be perceived as a cover-up. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all realize that hearings are going to happen. It's just a question now of 
how we are going to do them and when," said a senior Democratic aide. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez sent Foley a letter Monday saying it is "time for Democrats to use 
the truth, the weapon Republicans fear most" in a "full public airing of every 
aspect of this matter." 
</P>
<P>
 The Republicans for months have been "using an array of half-truths, 
old-rumors, half-baked conspiracy theories and outright lies" to malign the 
President and Mrs. Clinton and public hearings are the best way "to expose the 
Republican witch hunt for what it is," Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in a move that immediately provoked more GOP allegations of 
stonewalling, Gonzalez also canceled the Banking Committee hearing scheduled 
for Thursday, when Republicans on the panel had hoped to question Clinton 
Administration officials and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez's tirade drew a swift response from Rep. Jim Leach of Iowa, the 
ranking Republican on the panel, who said that the postponement raises the 
question of whether "the majority party has the spine to conduct credible 
oversight of an Administration of the same political party." 
</P>
<P>
 Leach added that information about the scandal that he had planned to unveil 
at the hearing may now be disclosed in a floor speech that he said he would 
"probably give sometime this week."

JUSTICE DEPT. SETTLEMENT BARS DENYING CARE TO AIDS PATIENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Seeking to send "a clear message" to stop discrimination against AIDS 
patients, the Justice Department on Monday settled a discrimination suit with 
Philadelphia that bars emergency medical personnel from refusing assistance to 
those with the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement, the first involving an AIDS case under the Americans with 
Disabilities Act, also will require training for each of the city's 2,300 
firefighters and emergency medical workers on preventing the transmission of 
HIV, respecting a person's right to privacy while rendering medical care and 
being sensitive to the needs of persons with HIV or AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, 1993, Philadelphia emergency medical technicians allegedly refused 
to place on a stretcher a man lying on the ground and complaining of chest 
pains. They had asked the man if he was on any medication and he had whispered 
that he was taking AZT, a drug used to treat persons with HIV. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the technicians then allegedly yelled, "Oh my God, he has AIDS," 
according to Merrily Friedlander, a Civil Rights division attorney, and the 
technicians told the man to place himself on the stretcher. When he was unable 
to do so, a bystander helped him onto the stretcher and placed him in the 
ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today's settlement will send a clear message to all cities across the nation 
that we will not tolerate discrimination against persons with AIDS," said James 
P. Turner, acting assistant attorney general for civil rights. Such 
discrimination is barred by Title II of the disabilities act. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the settlement, the man, whose name was withheld but who was described 
as a student in his 20s, will receive $10,000 in compensatory damages and a 
formal written apology from the city. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the city must develop and make public a written policy that 
prohibits emergency medical technicians from discriminating against those with 
HIV or AIDS. The city also will be required to discipline any employee who 
fails to comply with its guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint that led to the settlement was filed by the AIDS Law Project of 
Pennsylvania.

WELFARE REFORM PLANNERS IN DEADLOCK; POLICY: CLINTON TO GET BLUEPRINT TODAY. 
LEFT IN DOUBT ARE KEY ISSUES, INCLUDING FINANCING AND HOW MUCH RECIPIENTS WILL 
HAVE TO GIVE UP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The team responsible for drafting the Administration's blueprint for welfare 
reform will present its conclusions to President Clinton today, but despite 
months of deliberation the group remains seriously divided over how to finance 
the plan and how tough to be on some recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the task force has been unable to resolve a range of specific 
questions on how to implement Clinton's promise to "end welfare as we know it," 
officials insisted that these differences are relatively minor compared with 
the open chasm of disagreement over how to pay for the plan -- which may cost 
as much as $6 billion annually by 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some thorny issues left, but they do tend to be second order," said 
one senior White House official. "There tends to be overall agreement on 
structure and direction (of reform). Financing will be the trickiest." 
</P>
<P>
 The policy question of whether the government can punish welfare recipients 
who refuse to meet the new plan's work requirements and other rules without 
hurting their children also will be difficult to resolve. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite early warnings from some reform advocates that liberals in the 
Administration would dilute the reform effort, the task force has shaped a plan 
that broadly follows Clinton's campaign promises to require work, intensify 
efforts to collect child support and expand access to job training and day 
care. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the issues on which the group has deadlocked -- including whether 
part-time jobs will be accepted as satisfying the work requirement and whether 
states can withhold additional benefits when welfare recipients have more 
children -- illuminate the continuing divisions within Democratic ranks on this 
polarizing issue. 
</P>
<P>
 And the extended struggle inside the Administration over the knotty questions 
about financing reform and preserving a safety net for children may look mild 
compared to the stormy greeting that the proposal is likely to get when it is 
finally released to Congress -- probably at the end of April or the beginning 
of May. 
</P>
<P>
 "This could be a little bomb for the Administration," said Rep. Robert T. 
Matsui (D-Sacramento). "We're not going to rubber stamp it. They do feel they 
have a consensus on (Capitol) Hill. But we're not anywhere near that." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the working group's approach, which initially would target younger 
recipients, work would be required after two years on the welfare rolls and 
failure to work would result in lost income. 
</P>
<P>
 The government also would intensify its efforts to establish paternity and 
collect child support for children born out of wedlock. And as part of a 
renewed effort to discourage such births, women under 18 would be prohibited 
from using welfare funds to establish their own households. 
</P>
<P>
 Within that framework, the President must resolve a range of specific 
disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 One such division is over how to treat welfare recipients who take jobs as 
required but are paid wages so low that they remain in poverty. Should such 
workers receive supplemental welfare grants to augment what they earn in the 
private sector? 
</P>
<P>
 There is also a question about how to treat recipients who accept the 
minimum-wage jobs in the public sector that the plan would create but are not 
given enough hours of work by the states to match their welfare grants. Some 
advocate supplemental grants for these workers, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Reed, a domestic policy adviser to the President and a co-chairman of 
the welfare reform task force, is among those who "oppose the idea of welfare 
becoming a long-term income subsidy because it belies the two-years-and-out 
promise," one task force member said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration is also still wrestling with how to structure exemptions to 
the work requirement and extensions for the two-year time limit and how far to 
go in an effort to discourage out-of-wedlock births. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of whether the federal government should give states blanket 
approval to deny additional benefits to people who have children while already 
on welfare was so clearly a divisive issue that senior task force officials 
almost immediately decided to reserve it for the President to resolve. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside of the Administration, the potential for dispute is even wider. 
</P>
<P>
 Although 89 liberal representatives criticized the two-year time limit in a 
letter to the White House last fall, it appears many of them can be won over on 
this issue, but only if the plan provides a safety net for children and adults 
trying to play by the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Some members of Congress have complained that senior task force officials have 
not adequately addressed their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happens if a woman is not disabled and has a three-year-old kid who is 
not disabled, but she does not show up to work?" Matsui asked. "Do we take the 
child away from her and let her wander the streets? They have not answered 
this. That's why I'm a little surprised they're going to the President 
already." 
</P>
<P>
 The plan to phase in the program starting with people born after 1972 was 
broadly embraced by the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 But some members of Congress believe that older recipients who may have less 
expensive child care needs and some work experience should be offered the same 
help that those targeted at the outset will be offered. 
</P>
<P>
 The most bruising battles, however, are almost certain to come over financing. 
</P>
<P>
 Because welfare is an entitlement program, federal budget rules severely limit 
the Administration's options: To fund the plan it can either raise taxes or cut 
other entitlement programs. It cannot simply expand federal spending. 
</P>
<P>
 With the exception of a proposed gambling tax, the options under consideration 
lean heavily toward cuts. Advocates for the poor have already mounted intense 
campaigns against several of the ideas, such as scaling back access to social 
welfare benefits for legal immigrants who are not yet citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of the choices are good," said one member of the task force.

JUSTICES MAY TAKE UP ENGLISH-ONLY ON JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Supreme Court on Monday asked the Clinton Administration for its view on 
the legality of company policies requiring workers to speak English only. 
</P>
<P>
 The high court sought the opinion in a Bay Area case in which a policy barring 
two bilingual workers from speaking Spanish to each other was upheld by a lower 
court. The justices have not yet decided to hear the case but are expected to 
do so after the Justice Department makes its views known. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Equal Employment Commission has decreed that English-only policies in 
the workplace are illegal, except when they could be shown to be a "business 
necessity." That view is based on the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bars 
discrimination against employees based on race, religion, gender or national 
origin. The EEOC said that English-only rules are a type of discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 But last July, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals said that the EEOC was 
wrong. On a 2-1 vote, it ruled that English-only policies are generally legal, 
unless there is further evidence of "hostility toward Hispanic workers." 
</P>
<P>
 The issue arose in a small meatpacking plant in South San Francisco. In 1990, 
Kenneth Bertelson, the company president, received complaints from a black and 
an Asian worker who said they had been subjected to derogatory comments in 
Spanish from two Latino workers. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, Bertelson issued a new rule: "It is hereafter the policy of this 
company that only English will be spoken in connection with work. During lunch, 
breaks and employees' own time, they are obviously free to speak Spanish if 
they wish." 
</P>
<P>
 The two Latino workers, Priscilla Garcia and Maricela Buitrago, complained to 
their union when they were reprimanded for speaking Spanish to each other on 
the assembly line. When the union filed a suit, a federal judge ruled the 
policy illegal, but the 9th Circuit Court reinstated it. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, the 9th Circuit decision in the case (Garcia vs. Spun Steak, 93-1222) 
stands as the law in California and the other West Coast states under its 
jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
 In other actions, the court: 
</P>
<P>
 * Agreed to rule on whether companies can enforce mandatory-arbitration 
clauses in their contracts (Allied-Bruce Terminix vs. Dobson, 93-1001). Federal 
law supports arbitration as a quicker, less expensive way to settle disputes. 
But last year, the Alabama Supreme Court said that two Alabama homeowners 
cannot be forced to use arbitration in their dispute with an Arkansas-based 
termite inspection company, even though their contract with the company 
required arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
 The state court said that Congress does not have the power to displace state 
law governing such legal disputes. The justices will hear the company's appeal 
this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 * Heard arguments on whether a prominent Los Angeles law firm can be forced to 
pay damages to federal regulators for alleged legal malpractice growing out of 
the failure of an Orange County thrift institution (O'Melveny & Myers vs. 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., 93-489). The case has drawn wide attention in 
legal circles because regulators say they are seeking up to $1 billion in 
damages from law firms that advised failed S&Ls. 
</P>
<P>
 But the justices were highly skeptical of the government's argument and gave 
strong indications that they would reverse a U.S. appeals court decision in 
California that cleared the way for damage claims.

CLINTON'S NORTHWEST FOREST PLAN DRAFTED ILLEGALLY, JUDGE RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM KENWORTHY, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge ruled Monday that the Clinton Administration broke the law in 
developing its plan for management of national forests in the Pacific Northwest 
but refused a timber industry request to block implementation of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, ruling on a suit brought by the 
Northwest Forest Resource Council, said that the Administration had violated 
the Federal Advisory Committee Act's requirements for open proceedings in 
numerous instances during development of the forest plan. 
</P>
<P>
 But barring the Administration from following through with its plan "would 
exceed the injury" from its violation of the law, Jackson wrote. It would be 
"premature" to block implementation because the plan is just a written 
prescription at this point. He left open the possibility that other courts 
could find the violation serious enough to block forest management decisions 
called for in the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The forest plan is intended to break a long political deadlock over preserving 
old-growth forests in Oregon, Washington and Northern California and protecting 
the threatened northern spotted owl. New timber sales in the region have been 
enjoined for several years by federal judges who ruled that previous 
Administrations broke environmental laws by their management of logging. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton convened a conference on forest management issues in 
Portland, Ore., last year, and the Administration released details of a plan 
for managing the forests that would reduce the annual timber harvest to about 
one-fifth of the levels during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 The forest plan was developed by a White House-appointed team of several dozen 
experts in forestry management and other fields, aided by several hundred 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Rey, vice president of the American Forest and Paper Assn., played down 
the industry's failure to win an injunction. "The injunction is probably less 
important than the fact that the Administration's plan has been found to be 
legally flawed by the very first review that took a look at it." 
</P>
<P>
 An Administration official said the judge's decision would have little 
practical effect.

MORE AGGRESSIVE DEMOCRAT GETS BLESSING FOR HOUSE POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. EATON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 House Democratic leaders Monday selected a younger and more partisan lawmaker 
over a colleague with more seniority to become acting chairman of the House 
Appropriations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisconsin Rep. David R. Obey, 55, scored a decisive first-ballot victory over 
Iowa Rep. Neal Smith, 73, in a two-man race in the Democratic Steering and 
Policy Committee to replace the ailing chairman, 84-year-old Rep. William H. 
Natcher of Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
 All 258 members of the Democratic Caucus in the House must choose between Obey 
and Smith on Wednesday, but the blessing of party leaders appears likely to 
give Obey's campaign momentum before the decisive vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Natcher, hospitalized with a serious heart problem, would be able to resume 
his chairmanship if he recovers his health. If he does not return to the 
demanding appropriations post, however, the acting chairman almost certainly 
would take over the job on a permanent basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who was senior to Obey on the panel, has argued that he deserved to be 
named as acting chairman in line with the longstanding House tradition of 
rewarding length of service. 
</P>
<P>
 But several members of the steering and policy panel said they wanted a change 
in the leadership of the appropriations panel that would work more closely with 
the Clinton Administration and the House Democratic leaders in shaping 
priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Democrats also favor Obey because he is more aggressive, and they 
anticipate that GOP members of the House will become more confrontational if 
Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) takes over the Republican leader's post 
next year from retiring Rep. Robert H. Michel of Illinois.

$87-MILLION AID EARMARKED FOR 23 CITIES; GRANTS: LOS ANGELES TO SHARE IN FUNDS 
PROVIDED BY JOINT U.S. AND PRIVATE ALLIANCE FOR HOUSING AND BUSINESS 
DEVELOPMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Hoping to accelerate renewal of ravaged city neighborhoods, an unusual 
alliance of corporations, foundations and the U.S. Department of Housing and 
Urban Development said Monday that it has pooled $87.6 million for low-interest 
loans and grants to community development corporations in 23 cities, including 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The alliance, known as the National Community Development Initiative, expects 
its $87.6 million will generate an additional $660-million commitment from 
other sources. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference with corporate and foundation officials, Housing 
Secretary Henry G. Cisneros hailed the "historic partnership" in which the 
government will serve as an equal, not as the bureaucratic master running the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 At President Clinton's request, Congress gave Cisneros' department a one-year, 
$20-million appropriation for the housing and business development program but 
the secretary said that the Administration may ask for $50 million or $100 
million more next year if it proves a success. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditional federal support of urban development has consisted mostly of 
community development block grants and urban revitalization demonstration 
grants, both given to local governments with varying restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros said that an important element of the new program is the use of two 
experienced intermediaries, the Enterprise Foundation and the Local Initiatives 
Support Corp., to distribute funds to local community development corporations 
as they see fit. 
</P>
<P>
 The two national organizations will provide technical expertise and training. 
</P>
<P>
 Decisions have not yet been made on allocation of funds among the cities. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the federal government's $20 million, the Prudential Insurance 
Co. of America contributed $15.1 million to the new pool of money; the 
Rockefeller Foundation, $15 million; J. P. Morgan & Co., $12 million; John D. 
and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, $6 million; Metropolitan Life 
Foundation, John S. and James L. Knight Foundation and the Pew Charitable 
Trusts, $5 million each, and Surdna Foundation, Annie E. Casey Foundation and 
McKnight Foundation, $1.5 million each. 
</P>
<P>
 The funding is the alliance's second round of support for urban rejuvenation. 
The first effort, announced in 1991 without HUD participation, committed $62.8 
million and has generated more than $350 million in additional contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, the original funding helped support the Los Angeles 
Collaborative for Community Development, an umbrella group of national and 
local foundations, corporations and the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Collaborative has provided operating support and training to more than a 
dozen community development corporations, enabling them to take on bigger 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Alliance funds have been loaned to those corporations primarily for housing 
development expenses, such as site acquisition and construction costs. More 
than 1,000 units of housing have been put in the pipeline. In the South-Central 
area, money from the alliance and others has led to the creation of a community 
child-care center in commercial space within a housing development.

LOCKYER LASHES UC OFFICIALS OVER UNSOLICITED PAY INCREASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARL INGRAM and RALPH FRAMMOLINO, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Calling them "grubby, self-interested individuals," Senate President Pro Tem 
Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward) on Monday lashed out at University of California 
administrators for an account of a private meeting in which they discussed 
giving one UC official a raise $15,000 higher than he was willing to accept. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockyer told reporters that the disclosure may prompt the Senate to create a 
permanent oversight committee to monitor the UC and California State University 
systems. He said he would consider appointing as chairman one of UC's most 
persistent critics -- state Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), who once chaired 
a similar panel when he served in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 The powerful Senate leader said the new panel may be necessary because UC 
officials have not learned their lesson from the public outcry over past 
decisions to give executives hefty pay raises and golden parachutes, starting 
with the closed-door decision to award retiring President David Pierpont 
Gardner a severance package of more than $800,000 in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (UC administrators) have been hammered for two years and they still 
continue to conspire in ways that are disrespectful to the taxpayers and 
elected policy-makers," Lockyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockyer's comments came in response to an article published Sunday in the San 
Francisco Examiner quoting from a tape of a meeting between UC President Jack 
W. Peltason, the nine UC chancellors and the system's top administrators. The 
March 2 meeting involved a teleconference video hookup between Peltason and his 
aides in the Bay Area and UC officials in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 During the meeting, Peltason criticized Lockyer and Senate Democrats on the 
Rules Committee for voting Feb. 28 to reject the appointment of UC Regent 
Lester Lee. Peltason asked UC Berkeley Chancellor Chang-Lin Tien to try to 
mobilize the Chinese American community on Lee's behalf if the matter was 
brought to the Senate floor. Tien did not hold out much hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to see them get away with it without some kind of pain or 
penalty," Peltason is quoted as saying. "On the other hand, I don't want to 
make it some kind of an issue between the university and the Democrats and make 
Bill Lockyer so mad at us that he is hostile toward the appropriations. So I 
want to keep a low profile." 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, the full Senate declined to consider the appointment, thus 
making Lee the first regent appointment to be scuttled in the university's 
125-year history. At the time, Lockyer said Lee was rejected because he was too 
much of a rubber stamp for Peltason. 
</P>
<P>
 The newspaper account said that before Peltason joined the meeting, UC 
officials argued over how much of a raise to give one Berkeley official who was 
transferring to UC San Francisco. Tien objected to the proposed salary of 
$150,000 -- representing a $34,000 raise -- saying the person had already 
received a 7% or 8% boost in January and was willing to accept $135,000. 
</P>
<P>
 A UC spokesman said Monday that the person eventually received a salary of 
$144,500 -- less than was discussed at the meeting.

PENSION OF FUGITIVE CARPENTER FROZEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL JACOBS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former state Sen. Paul B. Carpenter's life on the lam could become more 
difficult after a federal court order Monday froze the state pension money 
being paid into his credit union account. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. District Court judge ordered the Golden 1 Credit Union to withhold up 
to $68,750 from Carpenter's account. The amount represents the potential fine 
that the former politician faced if he had not fled the country before he was 
scheduled to be sentenced on political corruption charges last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The order withholds "the money that is there now or is deposited there in the 
future," said U.S. Atty. Charles J. Stevens, who asked for the garnishment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Downey Democrat, who was forced off the State Board of Equalization after 
his conviction, has been collecting $1,842 a month from the Legislators' 
Retirement System. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our efforts to locate and extradite Mr. Carpenter are ongoing," Stevens said. 
"In the meantime we are going to seize his assets -- assets that might aid his 
flight -- and to make sure he is not living in comfort while he owes a 
substantial debt to the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 The former politician failed to appear in court for sentencing after his 
conviction on 11 counts of mail fraud, obstruction of justice, conspiracy and 
money-laundering. 
</P>
<P>
 Days before he was to be sentenced, Carpenter sent a hand-written note to 
Judge Edward J. Garcia, saying he had left the country to seek "a more 
adventuristic" treatment for terminal prostate cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find my drive for survival stronger than my sense of obligation to your 
legal system," Carpenter wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Carpenter became a fugitive, the California Public Employees' Retirement 
System board, which manages legislative pensions, has been seeking ways to stop 
payments to him. 
</P>
<P>
 But a lengthy legal opinion by the retirement system's general counsel, 
Richard H. Koppes, concluded that there "is no legal authority to permit 
withholding Carpenter's pension benefits."

SCOTT HARRIS: UNCERTAIN FEELING ALONG THE BOULEVARD; MORE THAN TWO MONTHS AFTER 
JAN. 17, SOME OF THE MERCHANTS AND RESTAURATEURS WHO HUSTLED TO REOPEN SEEM 
IMPATIENT OVER THE SLOW PROGRESS OF OTHERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 "PANTY RAID!" screams the banner on Ventura Boulevard. Thus, shamelessly, 
Lingerie for Less promotes one of its deals. "Buy five panties, get one free!" 
</P>
<P>
 One good thing about frilly merchandise is that it doesn't break when it 
crashes to the floor. Caltech's Kate Hutton and Lucy Jones measure earthquakes 
by the Richter scale. Andja Vucurevic, who manages Lingerie for Less in Sherman 
Oaks, gauges quakes by the cash register. 
</P>
<P>
 To Andja, a 6.8 quake means you shut down for 2 1/2 weeks. A 5.3 quake is, by 
comparison, just a tease of a temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lost our butts," Andja said. Pardon me? Andja then pointed to the plastic, 
panty-clad derriere mannequins affixed high on a wall. After the shaking 
stopped, Andja said, business actually picked up a bit: "The malls shut down so 
people came to the Boulevard." 
</P>
<P>
 Over on Ventura Boulevard, business people take their silver linings when they 
can. This is especially true in Sherman Oaks, where thousands of residents 
(read: customers) were displaced by damage to apartments, condos and 
single-family homes. Thousands of other potential customers were displaced by 
damage to office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Boulevard, for all its plywood, yellow tape and cracks, has a way of 
looking vibrant even when it's hurting. There is always traffic and always a 
line at Starbucks. Tulanians fireplace shop has, of course, done well with 
homeowners in need of chimney and hearth repairs. The optometry office has been 
busy with customers who lost contacts or had spectacle damage in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 But these are exceptions. The day after a big aftershock seemed like a good 
time to check in on the wounded heart of the Valley's most vital commercial 
strip. 
</P>
<P>
 More than two months after Jan. 17, some of the merchants and restaurateurs 
who hustled to reopen seem impatient over the slow progress of others. The 
plywood, cyclone fencing and yellow tape are reminders of how long the recovery 
will take. Hidden from view are the fissures that separate the business 
interests -- landlords and tenants, small business people and the big chains. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, it would be wrong to give the impression that every business is hurting 
here. This is not true. At Michael J's Italian Kitchen, half the tables were 
taken. The proprietor, Michael Ourieff, seemed encouraged by his best lunch 
crowd in days. But before the quake, he said, "we used to fill out at lunch." 
</P>
<P>
 Ourieff, who founded his restaurant 11 years ago, is one of the small 
businessmen who is trying to hang in there. I've written about him once before, 
in a column describing his participation in a meeting with Secretary of 
Commerce Ron Brown concerning quake aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Ourieff has been approved for two loans from the Small Business 
Administration. One to cover losses to inventory, another for "economic injury" 
-- loss of sales -- during the recovery period. 
</P>
<P>
 At 4% interest, it's hard to find cheaper money. Then again, Ourieff has had 
to use his business assets and his home as collateral. If he defaults, "I think 
I get to keep my children." 
</P>
<P>
 His biggest headache now is his relationship with a landlord who lives in 
Oklahoma. Four years ago, Ourieff signed a new lease when rents were at their 
peak. His landlord, he says, doesn't seem to understand that the quake, apart 
from physical damage, has cut deeply into his lunch and dinner trade. After 11 
years establishing his business at one location, Ourieff is considering a move. 
</P>
<P>
 This is one reason the walls in the dining room remain cracked. "I'm real 
reluctant now to put money into the landlord's building. We may not be here." 
</P>
<P>
 If Michael J's leaves this stretch of the Boulevard, another reason would be 
the exodus of others. The quake put several merchants out of business and 
forced the temporary closure of others. Sav-On, The Gap and Banana Republic 
have left damaged buildings. Their absence has slowed foot traffic that 
businesses like Michael J's count on to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, one of the big questions here is whether The Gap and Banana Republic 
will return to their location in La Reina Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Andja, over at Lingerie for Less, said she's pretty sure the stores will be 
back in April. But Ourieff and Gary Huff, manager of Tower Video, fear the 
stores won't be back at all.  
</P>
<P>
 When I got back to the office Monday afternoon, I hoped to resolve this 
question. When I called The Gap's main office, a PR person said they'd get back 
to me with an answer. I informed the flak that I needed to know soon -- that my 
deadline was approaching. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, deadline's come and gone. Maybe they'll get back to me today. 
</P>

GETTING INVOLVED: MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR COMMUNITY; YOUNG AND OLD COME 
TOGETHER AT DAY CARE 
</P>

 The outside walls of the Mark Taper Intergenerational Day Care Center are 
splashed with brightly colored murals showing old and young joining hands, 
reading, sharing. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside those walls, the young and old are just getting acquainted, learning 
names, faces and how to span the generations. 
</P>
<P>
 In side-by-side centers in the Van Nuys complex, children from 6 weeks to 5 
years old and seniors, many suffering the effects of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's 
and strokes, spend their days. 
</P>
<P>
 The complex, sponsored by Organizations for the Needs of the Elderly and the 
YMCA, allows parents and people caring for the elderly a chance to work, to run 
errands, to avoid what workers call "the 36-hour day." 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of volunteers, the center also gives the children and their 
elders a chance to mingle in small-group settings. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight seniors, two in wheelchairs, sat in one of the children's playrooms 
Thursday, waiting for their young neighbors to join them for songs. 
</P>
<P>
 As a dozen children filed into the room, two bold youngsters marched up to the 
seniors and started shaking hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "Glad to meet you. Glad to meet you," one boy beamed as he pumped his hand up 
and down. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the first song, a 3-year-old with banana curls had snuggled up 
to 88-year-old Sam Fiddler, who clapped and patted the child's back, clearly 
delighted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Isn't she something?" he asked later, as he helped her make coconut-covered 
treats in the seniors' recreation room. 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of connection was exactly what center workers hoped for. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to raise self-esteem. This is what we're hoping this will do for both 
of them," said Judy Wolfe, acting intergenerational coordinator and director of 
the adult day-care component. 
</P>
<P>
 When the two generations meet, the children feel a sense of family and 
community and the seniors feel like they're still useful. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can still love the children. They can still hold a child in their lap," 
said Wolfe. "It gives them a feeling of independence and being needed. We all 
need that." 
</P>
<P>
 The seniors, in turn, make the volunteer workers at the center feel useful. 
</P>
<P>
 Butte Germaine, 68, started volunteering at the center four years ago, after 
her husband passed away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided I had to find someone who needed me," she said. "It gives me more 
than I think it gives them." 
</P>
<P>
 Stan Lubitsch has worked at the center for two years. After the 62-year-old 
suffered four heart attacks, doctors told him to retire. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a way of life for me," he said. "I can give something to these people 
and they can give something to me. I love these people. My reward is when they 
give me a kiss on the cheek." 
</P>
<P>

MARKETING / BRUCE HOROVITZ: THINGS ARE FINALLY LOOKING UP FOR THE AREA'S AD 
INDUSTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the bleakest eras in the history of Southern California's advertising 
industry appears to be ending. 
</P>
<P>
 After nearly five years of hemorrhaging that resulted in more than a dozen 
shuttered agencies, hundreds of lost jobs and millions of dollars in lost 
billings, signs are emerging that -- despite Southern California's unstable 
economy -- the local ad business is starting to turn around. 
</P>
<P>
 No one is projecting booming growth this year. And few expect the industry to 
ever return to its heydays of double-digit growth. But a surprising number of 
agencies are starting to add staff -- some for the first time in years. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives say some current clients are beginning to increase ad spending. And 
agency chiefs -- who just three months ago projected a flat 1994 -- now say 
annual billings in the market could rise about 5% this year. That isn't far 
behind 1994's national ad growth, already projected to increase about 6% or 7%. 
</P>
<P>
 "The doom and gloom is gone," said Brian Morris, chairman of the Western 
States Advertising Agencies Assn. and executive vice president of Dailey & 
Associates. "I don't hear all the complaining that I did about layoffs and 
clients cutting back on spending." 
</P>
<P>
 Several factors are behind the turnaround, key among them: The economy has 
improved nationally, and because most large Los Angeles agencies have national 
clients, they are seeing increases in ad spending. Also, some local companies 
that trimmed their advertising budgets are beginning to add to them, albeit 
slightly. And many agencies are adding business through diversification. 
Several have set up divisions to create infomercials -- such as a BBDO unit 
about to create an infomercial for Apple Computer. Some agencies are also 
getting more into direct marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is absolutely no question that things are turning around," said Dennis 
Holt, president and chief executive of Western International Media, the 
nation's largest media buying company, whose annual billings for fiscal 1994 
are up 15% from the same period a year ago. As a result, the firm has recently 
added staff and expanded operations to several floors of a building across the 
street from its headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Western does not create ads but, like advertising agencies, it purchases 
broadcast time and print and billboard space for clients. Western's size -- 
more than $1.5 billion in annual billings -- helps convince clients that it can 
swing budget media buys. Among its clients are Disney and Home Depot. 
</P>
<P>
 The advertising turnaround is particularly striking in the local broadcast 
industry. For the first two months of 1994, Los Angeles-area radio ad revenues 
were up nearly 10%, according to industry estimates. "And I guarantee you, 
March will also be up substantially," said Howard Neal, vice president and 
general manager of radio stations KOST and KFI. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, television ad revenues in the Los Angeles market are up 
about 6% for the first quarter, executives say. Last year, local TV ad revenues 
were down 4.5% compared to 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "In spite of all logic -- with the natural disasters and the shattered economy 
-- business is terrific," said John Riedl, general sales manager at KABC-TV. 
</P>
<P>
 After a flat 1993, the ad agency Davis, Ball & Colombatto expects to post 
annual growth of at least 5% in 1994, said Brad Ball, co-president of the firm 
that recently won new clients Knott's Berry Farm and China Airlines. But its 
increased billings for 1994 will also come from boosts in ad spending from 
current clients such as Ralphs and Chief Auto Parts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just the fact that we're hiring says it all," Ball said. New promotional 
activities by its retail clients will result in staff increases of about 10% 
this year, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Santa Monica agency Kresser/Craig expects that both its billings 
and staff will increase about 10% this year, Chairman Bob Kresser said. Among 
its clients that plan to boost ad spending in 1994 are Arco, Albertson's and 
Kinko's, Kresser said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, when many clients cut ad spending, Kresser/Craig had a flat year and 
did not increase staff, Kresser said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the signs of an industry turnaround, few ad executives are eager to 
talk about it just yet, Kresser said. "As an industry, we've been through 
trying times for so long that no one is quite ready to say, 'Hurray, hurray, 
it's over.' " 
</P>
<P>
 At the Los Angeles office of BBDO, "the dark fear is gone," Chairman Steve 
Hayden said. Still, he said, "we're adding revenues but not profits." While the 
agency saw its billings grow more than 50% last year with the addition of two 
new clients, it expects its 1994 profit to grow "maybe 2%, if that," Hayden 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 David Park, chairman of the Advertising Club of Los Angeles who also sits on 
boards of two other regional advertising groups, says there is no doubt the 
turnaround has begun. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only are we seeing growth from existing clients, but we're also getting 
calls from prospective clients who we have not even tried to communicate with," 
said Park, chairman of the Los Angeles office of DDB Needham.

 This is not to say that local agencies are out of the woods. Since January, 
two agencies have closed due to lost business: Campbell & Wagman and the Colby

 Even if the industry is turning around on the West Coast, some ad executives 
are still extremely concerned about the future of the industry as a whole. 
After all, clients are increasingly turning to alternative resources -- such as 
talent agencies -- to create ads. And while some agencies are working in 
conjunction with media-buying firms, others are competing with them.

NOVELL TO BUY WORDPERFECT FOR $1.4 BILLION; COMPUTERS: THE UNION WOULD CREATE A 
SOFTWARE POWERHOUSE COMBINING THE WORLD LEADER IN PC NETWORKING WITH THE 
DOMINANT FORCE IN WORD PROCESSING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In keeping with the software industry's urge to merge, heavyweight Novell Inc. 
agreed Monday to buy WordPerfect Corp., its Utah neighbor and longtime ally, 
for $1.4 billion in stock and options. 
</P>
<P>
 The union would create a formidable software industry competitor combining the 
world leader in the booming personal computer networking business with the 
dominant force in word processing. 
</P>
<P>
 Novell also announced that it has agreed to purchase the Quattro Pro 
spreadsheet business of troubled Borland International Corp. for $145 million, 
a deal that would enable Novell and WordPerfect to offer a leading spreadsheet 
with their other products. 
</P>
<P>
 Software "suites," in which a spreadsheet, word processor and other 
applications are bundled into a coherent whole and sold together, are 
increasingly popular. Taken together, Novell's actions are in keeping with a 
trend in American businesses away from stand-alone, single-user personal 
computer applications toward software packages and group collaboration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Novell's objective is to accelerate this market transition," said Raymond J. 
Noorda, Novell's founder, president and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the WordPerfect deal, shares of WordPerfect common stock and options 
would be exchanged for about 59 million shares of Novell. WordPerfect would 
become a subsidiary of Novell and form the centerpiece of a new group focusing 
on applications software, such as word processors. 
</P>
<P>
 Novell, based in Provo, Utah, is the world leader in networking software, 
which ties computers together and allow users to share information. It also 
develops network services, computer operating systems and software to make 
programming easier. Privately held WordPerfect, based in Orem, develops 
applications. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fiscal year ended in October, Novell had sales of $1.12 billion. 
WordPerfect, for the year ended in December, posted revenue of about $700 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Combined, the two companies would be well-situated to develop applications for 
customers and deliver them efficiently. In addition to word processing, 
WordPerfect has developed programs relating to electronic documents, electronic 
mail, the generation of forms and other uses. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal thus would give Novell a chance to compete more broadly with 
Microsoft, an applications and operating system leader that is trying hard to 
penetrate Novell's networking business. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very natural partnership, a smart move for both companies," said 
Chuck Stegman, an office automation analyst with Dataquest, a market research 
company in San Jose. "It creates a viable alternative to Microsoft for 
developing corporate applications." 
</P>
<P>
 As pioneers in Utah's "Software Valley," a stretch of hundreds of companies 
south of Salt Lake City, Novell and WordPerfect have long been friendly and 
have often teamed up in recent years in efforts to develop computing standards. 
Four years ago, they briefly talked about merging, but officials said then that 
the time was not right. 
</P>
<P>
 Their unusual spirit of cooperation grows in large part from the region's 
close ties to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The two 
companies, about 10 minutes apart on Interstate 15, jointly employ about 9,000 
people, many of them Mormons. 
</P>
<P>
 Heading the new application software product group at Novell would be Adrian 
Rietveld, who on Jan. 1 became president and chief executive of WordPerfect. He 
succeeded co-founder Alan C. Ashton. Rietveld would become the fourth member of 
Novell's office of the president, from which the company expects to choose a 
successor to the aging Noorda. 
</P>
<P>
 In Nasdaq trading, Novell shares finished down 25 cents Monday at $23.75. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, with the sale of Quattro Pro, Borland loses about 25% of its 
business. The company, based in Scotts Valley, Calif., said it expects to 
report a big decline in sales and a sizable operating loss for the quarter and 
year ending March 31. It also said it will incur costs from a planned 
restructuring. The company also said its chief financial officer, Alan 
Henricks, has resigned. 
</P>
<P>
 Other high-profile mergers in the industry include the unions of Intuit and 
ChipSoft, makers of personal finance and tax preparation software, and 
Electronic Arts and Broderbund, makers of interactive games and educational 
products. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Adobe Systems Inc. and Aldus Corp., pioneers in the desktop 
publishing market, announced plans to merge.

AFTERSHOCK RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT NEW DEDUCTIBLES; INSURANCE: COMPANIES ARE 
WEIGHING WHETHER SUNDAY'S DAMAGE WILL BE CONSIDERED SEPARATE FROM JAN. 17 
QUAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Some Southern California residents who suffered property damage in both the 
Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake and Sunday's powerful aftershock may have to meet 
their earthquake insurance deductibles all over again, insurance company 
officials warned Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Most insurers said they will individually review claims from Sunday's 
5.3-magnitude aftershock before deciding whether to classify any new damage as 
part of the January quake or as an entirely separate incident. 
</P>
<P>
 For many homeowners, much rides on the outcome because earthquake insurance 
deductibles typically run 10% of the coverage limits, easily tens of thousands 
of dollars in most cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's aftershock centered near Panorama City triggered a new moratorium on 
the sale of earthquake insurance by several large insurers, making coverage 
more difficult to buy in Southern California for at least the next several 
weeks.  
</P>
<P>
 Farmers Insurance Group, Safeco Insurance Cos. and 20th Century Insurance Co. 
all suspended writing earthquake policies in the Los Angeles area for up to 30 
days. However, State Farm Insurance Cos. and Allstate Insurance Co., the two 
largest carriers, are continuing to sell new policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Although damage from the latest quake appeared relatively slight Monday, it 
raised concerns among homeowners about how their insurers will treat new 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
 John Mora, whose home in the Winnetka neighborhood of Canoga Park sustained 
$10,000 to $11,000 damage in the Jan. 17 quake, said a bookshelf toppled over 
and was smashed in the Sunday afternoon aftershock and that a new crack 
sprouted in the foundation of his garage. 
</P>
<P>
 Mora called his State Farm Insurance agent Monday and was unprepared for what 
he heard. "He told me it looks like it'll be considered a new quake and I've 
got to pay my $5,000 deductible again," Mora said. 
</P>
<P>
 State Farm Vice President Roger B. Tompkins said the company has no blanket 
policy for handling claims from Sunday's aftershock. If damage appears to be 
related to the Jan. 17 quake, it will be added to the original claim, he said. 
But if the damage is unrelated, it probably will be considered a separate 
incident, requiring the claimant to meet the entire deductible anew. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is technically considered a separate insurable event," Farmers spokesman 
Jeffrey Beyer said of the aftershock. However, he also said Farmers will 
consider claims case by case. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, insurers continue to boost their estimates of damage from the 
Northridge quake, increasing the likelihood that total insurance losses will 
far exceed the official industry estimate of $2.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Allstate nearly doubled its damage estimate Monday, saying it now expects to 
pay about $600 million on some 38,000 claims. Its initial estimate in early 
February was $350 million on 25,000 claims. 
</P>
<P>
 When Allstate issued its new damage estimate from the Northridge quake Monday, 
it was the second large carrier to project a sharply higher total. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Thursday, Woodland Hills-based 20th Century pushed its claims cost 
estimate up to $325 million from $160 million and said the losses would result 
in a $161.7-million charge against first-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Stock in the insurer's parent firm, 20th Century Industries, dropped again 
Monday, closing at $20.25 a share on the New York Stock Exchange, down $1.25 
for the day and down 24% from Thursday's closing price of $25.125.

BATTLE TO CONTROL THE SKIES; GLOBAL SYSTEMS VIE FOR SPACE ON RADIO SPECTRUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A gritty battle for dominance may be about to erupt in the rarefied atmosphere 
where communications satellites orbit the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's official announcement that two high-tech moguls want to use 
low-orbiting satellites to launch a $9-billion global communications system 
adds a major new player to the increasingly competitive market for global 
communications services.  
</P>
<P>
 Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft Corp., the world's biggest computer 
software company, and Craig McCaw, chairman of giant McCaw Cellular 
Communications, unveiled their plans to form a new company called Teledesic 
Corp. Teledesic will seek government authority to use radio waves to deliver 
wireless calling, video conferencing and other advanced services to people 
around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 But Teledesic is not alone. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 
Motorola Inc., Hughes Aircraft Co. and at least four other companies have 
already asked the Federal Communications Commission for approval to offer new 
telecommunications services over parts of the same precious radio spectrum 
sought by Teledesic. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole issue of licensing has not been resolved," said Michael D. Kennedy, 
director of regulatory relations for Motorola, which is a major investor in the 
Iridium Project, a $3.3-billion effort to build a global portable cellular 
telephone network using 66 satellites to transmit signals. 
</P>
<P>
 "One more party now has to be reckoned with, but we're confident that there's 
sufficient airspace to accommodate all existing requests," countered Tom W. 
Davidson, a Washington communications lawyer who is shepherding Teledesic's 
applications through the FCC. 
</P>
<P>
 The radio airwaves have emerged as a key battleground amid the rapid 
development of new technologies such as high-definition television, digital 
radio and wireless telephone services. 
</P>
<P>
 The new satellite services will compete with cable and fiber-optic phone lines 
for markets as the so-called information highway takes shape. 
</P>
<P>
 Interest in the radio spectrum is so high that the federal government 
estimates it can raise between $7 billion and $10 billion by auctioning space 
on it for the next generation of wireless telephone services alone. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the radio spectrum sought by Teledesic and others, the FCC has asked 
for industry comments on negotiating a resolution on how to divide up the 
limited space. 
</P>
<P>
 FCC officials have said they are unsure how they would go about allocating 
radio spectrum for new satellite communications services that have global 
reach. Congress has given the agency authority to auction space on the spectrum 
for most new telecommunications to the highest bidder, but so far the FCC has 
only examined rules for new wireless domestic communications services. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hughes Spaceway venture would utilize two satellites orbiting 23,000 miles 
above the Equator to offer wireless telephone, data and some video services in 
North America. Iridium would offer similar services around the world relying on 
airwaves that the FCC has already provisionally authorized it to use. But 
Iridium may need some of the disputed frequencies for so-called feeder links to 
its stations on Earth, FCC officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In its voluminous application filed late Monday at the FCC, Teledesic proposed 
a global communications network that would offer phone, video and data services 
through 840 satellites orbiting just 435 miles above Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 The network will face relatively high maintenance costs because the Earth's 
gravity would pull Teledesic satellites out of orbit in less than a decade. 
Higher satellites, such as those operated by NASA and proposed by Hughes, have 
12- to 15-year life spans. But the low orbit would thwart the brief signal 
delays that plague conventional communications satellites that operate 23,000 
miles up. 
</P>
<P>
 FCC commissioners were out of town Monday and could not be reached for 
comment. But an aide to agency Chairman Reed Hundt said Teledesic's plan could 
represent an important step toward reaching one of the Clinton Administration's 
most important policy goals: developing a global information superhighway that 
would link ordinary Americans with government, industry and schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing a speech Monday in Buenos Aires in which Vice President Al Gore called 
on foreign leaders "to help create a global information infrastructure . . . 
linking all human knowledge," Blair Levin, Hundt's chief of staff, said 
Teledesic's global satellite communications system "absolutely reinforces the 
type of things the vice president is calling for." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the Teledesic venture may present several complications for 
regulators. Besides needing FCC approval, Teledesic hopes to forge partnerships 
with telephone companies around the world that would be willing to lease space 
on its network to provide service in a region. 
</P>
<P>
 Davidson said the company has already been in touch with officials from 
several developing countries and that their reaction was "very favorable." 
</P>
<P>
 However, experts warn that foreign telephone companies and licensing 
authorities are not set up to deal with communications enterprises that cross 
traditional telecommunications boundaries. Moreover, many foreign 
telecommunications companies are government-owned monopolies that traditionally 
have been resistant to outside competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Europe is just beginning to open its markets," said Dimitri Ypsilanti, a 
telecommunications experts with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development in Paris. Crowded Skies Various companies around the world are 
fiercely competing to build satellite-based mobile telcommunications systems. 
There are three basic types of systems: low earth orbit (LEO), which are 
cheaper to launch but last a shorter time in orbit; medium earth orbit (MEO), 
which are more expensive but last longer in orbit, and high-orbit systems, 
which have the greatest longevity and expense. Here's a brief rundown on some 
major satellite projects: Teledesic: A $9-billion global communications system 
sponsored by Teledesic, a new partnership proposed by Craig McCaw of McCaw 
Cellular Communications and William H. Gates of Microsoft. It would link 
hundreds of satellites around the globe into a massive digital communications 
network. Iridium: A $3.-billion LEO system sponsored by Motorola, expected to 
begin operation in 1996. Its fleet of 66 satellites would provide a wireless 
global communications network. Project 21: Sponsored by London-based Inmarsat 
with backing by Swedish communications giant Ericsson. This network of 
satellites in 70 nations will be linked together to provide global phone 
service. Odyssey: An MEO system sponsored by TRW. Its $1.3-billion network of 
12 satellites wouldcreate a cellular telephone system in the sky. Globalstar: A 
LEO system sponsored by Loral and Qualcomm for operation in 1997. It is a 
$1.2-billion series of 48 satellites that would provide digital communications. 
Ellipso: A LEO system sponsored by Ellipsat, a unit of Mobile Communications 
Holdings. It would provide a $250-million digital phone network based on about 
12 satellites. Aries: A LEO system sponsored by Constellation Communications. 
It consists of about 45 satellites linked to provide telecommunication 
services. Sources: Phillips Business Information Inc.; Bloomberg Business News;

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: GUBER PAINTS ROSY PICTURE FOR SONY DESPITE A SHAKY IMAGE 
OF STUDIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sony Pictures Chairman Peter Guber sounded frantic when he picked up the phone 
over the weekend. In a torrent of words, he explained that his house had sprung 
a leak. "Have you ever seen a downpour like this?" he asked. "I must have 350 
buckets spread around the place!" 
</P>
<P>
 When it rains it pours, it seems -- at least in Guber's world. It was only 
last week that he suffered an equally serious management leak when motion 
picture group President Jonathan Dolgen resigned to take the top job at 
Paramount Pictures under its new owners, Viacom Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolgen was a key strategist for the company, a division of Japan's Sony Corp., 
and his departure left a void in its executive suite that may have undermined 
recent efforts to project an image of stability. In some circles, releasing 
Dolgen was even seen as a symbolic act of corporate retreat that could presage 
other changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Some downsizing has already occurred. The company's four distribution outlets 
-- Columbia Pictures, TriStar Pictures, Sony Classics and Triumph -- plan to 
release 38 movies this year, compared to 44 in 1993. Sony has also consolidated 
some TV and movie operations. Hollywood executives contend that the company now 
needs the New York office's permission to move on projects costing $40 million 
or more -- and Japan's permission for anything costing $60 million or more. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of his first extended interviews in recent months, Guber vehemently 
denied that. He said key spending decisions still reside with him, and he 
pointed out that Sony remains one of Hollywood's biggest film distributors, 
with a combined 19% market share last year. 
</P>
<P>
 In defending Sony against the somewhat loopy reputation it's developed over 
the years, he noted that the company is still committed to producing a 
"critical mass" of entertainment and that there's "every bit as much capital 
available" to fund operations this year as last. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he's happy in his job, Guber, 52, replied: "Happy is the wrong word 
for me. . . . There's not a minute when I'm not in wonder at the complexity of 
what confronts me. But as long as there's a challenge, I'll stay involved. When 
there's not, I'll move on." 
</P>
<P>
 Guber said Sony's biggest challenge is maintaining its key role in the 
entertainment and technology universe, which probably will require it to bring 
in strategic partners. Some sources contend that the company undermined its 
efforts on Wall Street to sell a 25% stake in the company for $3 billion by 
letting Dolgen escape -- which intensified concerns about management. Sony 
Corp. executives in Tokyo were also said to be upset about the timing. 
</P>
<P>
 But executives insist that discussions are still under way, with cable magnate 
John Malone, financier Marvin Davis, Pacific Bell, GTE and Bell Atlantic among 
those that have taken a look at the company. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing imminent, but deals can happen very quickly," Guber said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, he denied speculation that Sony will entertain offers for 
TriStar Pictures. Many industry executives consider it wasteful for Sony to 
operate TriStar as a stand-alone production and distribution company, because 
it already funds Columbia Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers also took it as a sign that the studio might be up for sale 
when TriStar Chairman Mike Medavoy recently resigned and Sony shifted 
management control to a team headed by Columbia Pictures Chairman Mark Canton 
and the now-departed Dolgen. But Guber said Sony views TriStar as a key asset 
within the company and has no plans to unload it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're committed to TriStar, period," he said. "After five years, that issue 
should be resolved. A parade of people here and in New York have offered to buy 
it. But I wonder what part of 'no' they don't understand. Some of these people 
must be dyslexic and think no means 'on.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Or they may be among the masses who find themselves perpetually confused by 
the day-to-day goings-on at Sony Pictures, which has suffered from frequent 
management turnover, reported cash shortages and infighting. Because of its 
multilayered management, Sony also has a reputation for being slow to make 
creative decisions. Said entertainment analyst Jeffrey Logsdon of Seidler Cos. 
in Los Angeles: "They know how to confound confusion with commotion out there." 
</P>
<P>
 When Sony Corp. bought the entertainment company for $3.4 billion plus sizable 
debt in 1989, it openly aspired to duplicate Warner Bros.' success as a mass 
producer of movies and television shows. Now many critics maintain that the 
electronics giant, shaken by the downturn in its core business, may actually be 
moving Sony Pictures in the opposite direction. 
</P>
<P>
 The Culver City-based studio recently trimmed its network TV division by 
putting Jon Feltheimer in charge of both Columbia Pictures TV and TriStar TV. 
TriStar's "Mad about You" is the company's only bona fide hit in recent years. 
Sony has never had a big first-run syndication presence, though it has a 
contender with "The Ricki Lake Show." In the game show world, Sony also owns 
such perennials as "Wheel of Fortune" and "Jeopardy." 
</P>
<P>
 The company has tried to launch the Game Show Channel, with only limited 
success. It also sold "Seinfeld" into syndication recently, though sources say 
Sony may get less from that deal than many assume because the show is produced 
by Castle Rock Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Guber concedes that Sony has an image problem, which he mainly attributes to 
the massive publicity that attended the failure of "Last Action Hero" last 
summer. In fairness, he said, critics should also acknowledge such hits as 
"Philadelphia" and "Groundhog Day." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have consistently been among the top-tier companies," Guber said. "Our 
strength is in providing content, and we're still dedicated to putting out a 
large number of movies."  
</P>
<P>
 While Sony Corp. releases only limited financial information on Sony Pictures, 
it recently reported that revenue dropped 3.7% to $795.9 million for the three 
months ended Sept. 30, compared to the year before. Revenue was down 13.3% in 
the first six months to $1.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people see "Wolf," the big-budget thriller starring Jack Nicholson that's 
set for a June release, as the biggest indicator of how Sony Pictures may fare 
in 1994. Pointing to that and other upcoming films -- such as Kenneth Branagh's 
"Frankenstein," "The Quick and the Dead" and Castle Rock's "City Slickers 2" -- 
Guber maintains that everything will work out fine. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still committed to the same management and philosophy," he said. "I 
don't consider this a job with training wheels."

COMMITTEE VOTE ON ELECTRIC CAR MANDATE REBUFFS AUTO INDUSTRY; ENVIRONMENT: 
CRITICS SAY CALIFORNIANS WON'T BUY VEHICLES. ASSEMBLY PANEL REJECTS PORK BARREL 
ARGUMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An auto industry-backed effort to suspend California's mandate requiring car 
makers to build thousands of electric cars beginning in the 1998 model year was 
rebuffed Monday by the Assembly Transportation Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 On a 7-2 vote, the panel rejected arguments that the zero-emissions vehicle 
program is becoming a huge pork barrel project and will be a disaster because 
Californians won't buy what critics predict will be overpriced, underpowered 
autos. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the committee's 16 members left before the vote on the anti-mandate 
bill, so the matter will be taken up again. But the vote clearly represented 
the sentiment of the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, the auto industry's main push to delay the electric car deadline 
is expected in May, when the California Air Resources Board, which set up the 
zero-emissions program, undertakes a biennial review of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those opposing the bill -- which would have suspended the 1998 deadline 
until auto battery technology meets specific criteria -- was Jacqueline 
Schafer, Gov. Pete Wilson's new appointee as ARB chairwoman. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ARB's existing review process can make whatever adjustments might be 
necessary" to the electric car mandate, Schafer said, contending that the 
board's regulations already allow auto makers great flexibility. "It's much too 
early to pull the plug on electric vehicles, as this bill would do." 
</P>
<P>
 Schafer said she and California Environmental Protection Agency Secretary 
James Strock will visit Detroit this week to review the state of battery 
technology with the U.S. Auto Battery Consortium, a Big Three/federal 
government battery research project. 
</P>
<P>
 The auto industry and the bill's sponsor, freshman Assemblyman Bernie Richter 
(R-Chico), contend that a breakthrough in battery technology is needed if 
electric cars are to be acceptable to large numbers of consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 With the 1998 model year, 2% of all new vehicles sold in the state must have 
no emissions -- in effect, a requirement to make available perhaps 35,000 
electric cars. The minimum climbs to 10% of new vehicles in 2003. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing what he said were more than $800 million in state and federal subsidies 
for various California alternative-fuel programs, Richter said supporters of 
the electric vehicle deadline are "feeding at the public trough." 
</P>
<P>
 But supporters of the mandate portrayed the electric vehicle mandate as a 
means of jump-starting a new California industry.

AIRLINE ADDING 15 FLIGHTS FROM ORANGE COUNTY; TRANSPORTATION: SOUTHWEST 
CHALLENGES AMERICAN AND ALASKA WITH NEW SERVICE TO SAN JOSE AND OAKLAND. 
</P>

 Strengthening its grip on the key California market, Southwest Airlines on 
Monday announced that it will begin 15 round-trip flights a day in May between 
Orange County and the Bay Area cities of Oakland and San Jose. The unrestricted 
fare will be $69 each way. 
</P>
<P>
 With the addition of John Wayne Airport in Orange County, Southwest will fly 
from every major Southern California airport except Long Beach when it starts 
service May 26. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been building in Southern California for five years," said Gary 
Kelly, chief financial officer for Dallas-based Southwest, which flies 
throughout the western U.S. and has some flights to the eastern part of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest is now the dominant carrier within the state, flying more than 50% 
of all intrastate passengers in the third quarter of last year, the most recent 
figures available. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest's move into Orange County has been long awaited because of the 
airline's reputation for low fares. Thousands of passengers have been driving 
to Ontario Airport or Los Angeles International to get cheaper fares. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest paved the way for the latest move when it bought Morris Air Service 
in December, which was already flying two flights a day between Salt Lake City 
and Orange County. The purchase of Morris Air allowed Southwest to pick up 
additional landing slots at an airport that restricts the number of flights to 
reduce noise. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the everyday fare on the flights will be $69 -- the same as on any 
Southwest flight within California -- Kelly said discounts of $49 for advance 
purchase will be available. Southwest will offer its two-for-one promotional 
fares for leisure travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest's low fares could attract additional leisure travelers to Orange 
County, a major tourism center, even though about 70% of those who now use John 
Wayne Airport are business travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This airport has been heavily weighted with business passengers," said 
Airport Director Jan Mittermeier. Now, "leisure travelers who have been going 
to Ontario are going to come here." 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest's primary competition on its eight daily round-trip flights between 
Orange County and San Jose will be American Airlines, which previously has 
pulled out of other routes rather than try to match Southwest's fares. 
</P>
<P>
 An American Airlines spokesman in Dallas said simply Monday: "We have not 
decided yet what we are going to do." American's unrestricted one-way fare from 
Orange County to San Jose is $119. 
</P>
<P>
 On Southwest's seven daily round-trip flights between Orange County and 
Oakland, it will primarily face off against Alaska Airlines. Making life more 
difficult for Alaska, Southwest plans connecting flights into Alaska Airlines' 
primary markets of Seattle and Portland, starting June 6. 
</P>
<P>
 An Alaska spokesman said the airline has matched Southwest's prices in the 
past, and expects to do so this time on the same routes. Alaska's unrestricted 
fare between Orange County and Oakland is $99.

 Grumman Corp. Shareholders Sue Over Offer: Stockholders allege that the 
company failed to seek the highest takeover bid by accepting a $55-per-share 
offer from Martin Marietta Corp. just before a competing bid was launched by 
Northrop Corp. The class-action suit filed in Manhattan federal court accuses 
Grumman and its board of misleading shareholders to believe the offer was in 
their best interest. The suit alleges that defense contractor Grumman, based in 
Bethpage, N.Y., broke securities laws by using false information to induce 
shareholders to tender their shares to Martin.On March 7, Grumman announced it 
had signed a merger agreement in which Bethesda, Md.-based Martin would buy the 
company for about $1.87 billion. Several days later, Northrop followed with an 
unsolicited bid of $60 a share.

CORPORATE CHARITY ROSE LESS THAN 1% LAST YEAR DESPITE BIG PROFITS 
</P>

 Corporate charitable contributions crept up only slightly in 1993 and probably 
won't rise much this year either, despite the national economic recovery, a 
business group said in a survey released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies responding to the Conference Board study estimated they increased 
their giving by less than 1% in 1993 -- even though it turned out to be a 
banner year for many U.S. companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main reason is the economy," said Maria Buenaventura, author of the 
report from the New York-based Conference Board. 
</P>
<P>
 The recession is over by most estimates, but Buenaventura said companies have 
been slow to increase giving to education and charities "until the economy 
gains a little more momentum." 
</P>
<P>
 The Conference Board said that for 1993, companies responding to its survey 
estimated they had increased their charitable giving by a median 0.9%. For 
1994, no increase was expected.

MAJOR CREDITORS LINE UP BEHIND MACY'S REORGANIZATION PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Major creditors of R.H. Macy & Co. appeared to back the retailer's proposed 
terms of reorganization Monday, boosting the company's chances of remaining 
independent when it emerges from bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York-based retailer wants to maintain its Macy's, Bullock's and I. 
Magnin stores in an independent company and has resisted a merger bid from 
Cincinnati-based Federated Department Stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Macy's, which has been mired in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings since 
January, 1992, must reach agreement with its creditors on the value of its 
retail operations and then must negotiate the amount of compensation or equity 
that creditors and bondholders will receive in exchange for forgiving the 
company's outstanding debts. 
</P>
<P>
 Macy's officials would not comment about a board meeting Monday, but company 
sources said the directors supported -- but modified -- a reorganization 
proposal submitted by the company's management. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's action came as one major secured creditor -- Boston-based Fidelity 
Investments -- announced support for the management-drafted plan. GE Capital, 
another secured creditor, also backed the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, another major creditor, Swiss Bank Mortgages, opposed an alternate 
plan backed by Laurence Tisch, a member of Macy's board. 
</P>
<P>
 Macy's on Monday also presented its plan to Cyrus R. Vance, a court-appointed 
mediator for Macy's and its creditors.  
</P>
<P>
 The plan will be formally submitted to all creditors Wednesday.

 Carl Karcher Enterprises Narrows Quarterly Loss: The Anaheim-based fast-food 
restaurant chain lost $458,000, or 2 cents a share, in the fourth quarter on 
$105.8 million in revenue.That compares to a quarterly loss of $10.8 million, 
or 60 cents a share, on revenue of $105.7 million the year before. But cost 
cutting helped the firm post its first annual profit in two years. For the 53 
weeks ended Jan. 31, Karcher had net income of $3.7 million, or 20 cents per 
share, contrasted with a net loss of $5.5 million, or 31 cents share, which 
included about $9.7 million in restructuring and other onetime charges. Karcher 
stock rose 37.5 cents to $13.875 on Nasdaq.

conglomerate also announced that minority shareholders have abandoned their 
efforts for a common stock offering of the privately owned company and are

 Southland Real Estate Outlook Good, Report Says: The long-term prospects for 
the region's real estate market remain relatively bright, despite its uneven 
economic recovery and nagging concerns about its deteriorating quality of life, 
an exhaustive report by Price Waterhouse Real Estate Group said. The 
consultants said the Southland's growing and generally well-educated work 
force, combined with its key Pacific Rim location and other factors, should 
lead to a rebound in demand for commercial and industrial space in three to 
four years.The housing market could come back even stronger and more quickly, 
with demand led by affluent one- and two-person households who prefer to live 
fairly close to major work centers and don't mind high-density housing. The 
Riverside-San Bernardino area will be the fastest-growing region in the West 
through the end of the decade, the study said, followed by the northwest 
portion of Los Angeles County and San Diego County.

Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi said.The division, which oversees the

the subject of a harshly critical state audit report last year that cited 
significant weaknesses in the way it handled its money. Garamendi demoted the 
former division chief and fired the No. 2 administrator. McRae will earn 
$195,000 in the new job, becoming the department's highest-paid employee. 
Garamendi, a candidate for California governor, has a salary of $95,052.

U.S. CALLS FOR CREATION OF GLOBAL COMPUTING NETWORK; COMMUNICATIONS: GORE URGES 
NATIONS TO WORK TOGETHER TO LINK HOMES, SCHOOLS AND OFFICES AROUND THE WORLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States urged all nations Monday to help build a "network of 
networks" that could pump billions of dollars into the world's economy by 
linking computers in homes, schools and offices around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 Vice President Al Gore told a U.N.-sponsored conference on telecommunications 
development that the world has the financial and technical resources to spin 
such a web, which he called a "global information infrastructure." 
</P>
<P>
 "We now can at last create a planetary information network that transmits 
messages and images with the speed of light from the largest city to the 
smallest village on every continent," Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the United States, a world computing network could be built and 
run by the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore noted in his speech that the network is already being built in bits and 
pieces as fiber-optic cable is laid under seas and across continents. 
</P>
<P>
 His announcement coincided with the creation of a joint venture between 
Microsoft and McCaw Cellular that appears to share the global network 
philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Gates, founder and chairman of Microsoft, the world's biggest software 
company, and Craig McCaw, who built McCaw Cellular Communications into the 
largest cellular telephone company in the country, formed Teledesic Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The new company, to be based in Kirkland, Wash., is proposing to build a 
$9-billion system of 840 small satellites that would circle the globe to form a 
communications network. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In his speech to an audience including some of the world's top policy-makers 
and the biggest names in the communications industry, Gore said the United 
States will throw its weight behind the global network project. 
</P>
<P>
 He described a vision of an intelligent web capable of improving international 
communications, of raising businesses' productivity, taking education to the 
farthest corners of the world and even promoting representative democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The global economy will also be be driven by the growth of the Information 
Age. Hundreds of billions of dollars can be added to world growth if we commit 
to the" network, Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine-day conference was organized by the International Telecommunications 
Union, a U.N. body with 182 members. It will also work on an action plan to 
extend modern communications to the least-developed countries. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the ITU, despite numerous technological breakthroughs and the 
fact that telecommunications have proved to be a profitable venture around the 
world, there is a huge gap between rich and poor nations. 
</P>
<P>
 While the 24 high-income developed countries have 70% of the world's telephone 
lines and only 15% of its population, ITU Secretary General Pekka Tarjanne said 
that two-thirds of the world's homes still have no phones. 
</P>
<P>
 The ITU estimates the world must invest about $530 billion by the year 2000 to 
boost "tele-density" -- a measure of main telephone lines per 100 inhabitants 
-- to 14.5 from 10. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Tarjanne noted recent success stories among developing countries that 
have managed to build up their telecommunications, singling out Botswana, 
Turkey, South Korea and Chile. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no blueprint for success, although there are common points that can 
be adopted by developing countries," he said. 
</P>
<P>

 Gore and Argentine President Carlos Saul Menem, who in 1990 opened his 
country's ailing telephone system to private-sector operators, spoke in favor 
of privatization and competition in telecommunications. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore noted that privatization has spurred development of telecommunications in 
dozens of countries, and he urged others to follow the lead of Argentina, Chile 
and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "But privatization is not enough. Competition is needed as well," Gore said. 
"Today, there are many more technology options than in the past, and it is not 
only possible but desirable to have different companies running competing but 
interconnected networks."

COMPANY TOWN; NEW ON-LINE SERVICE TARGETS TINSELTOWN; TECHNOLOGY: 
POST-PRODUCTION FIRMS COULD TRANSMIT VIDEO ON THE COMPUTER NETWORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Sprint and Silicon Graphics Inc. plan to announce today the launch of a 
private telephone and computer network aimed at the entertainment industry that 
will allow subscribers to transmit video or graphics to another site in a 
matter of minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Several post-production firms that do visual effects work for film, television 
and advertising that require dozens of time consuming back-and-forth approval 
and editing sessions have already signed up for the network, dubbed "Drums" -- 
a reference to one of the first forms of mass communication. And two of the 
major film studios are considering joining up. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming a day after Pacific Bell's announcement Monday of a planned test to 
deliver movies to theaters over telephone lines, the prospect of a Sprint-SGI 
"post-production internet" that could speed decision-making and ultimately save 
costs reflects how dramatically advancing telecommunications are starting to 
reshape the way the entertainment industry does business. 
</P>
<P>
 While the production process itself has become ever-more digital -- witness 
the "Jurassic Park" computer-generated dinosaurs and the growing trend of 
digitally inserting actors into their sets -- communication between the 
numerous people and businesses that contribute to a film has remained largely 
in the age of the Pony Express. 
</P>
<P>
 "It blows me away that people have this tremendous power on the desktop, do a 
bunch of work, and then download it to commercial tape and mail the tape 
through the U.S. mail," says Jim Flaging, regional director for Sprint's 
business services group. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not everybody is eager to embrace as-yet-unproven new technologies. 
</P>
<P>
 The reaction Monday of theater owners, studio executives and Hollywood's 
creative community to PacBell's "cinema of the future" announcement was 
decidedly mixed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Film distributors would be delighted to see an electronic method of 
distribution that would eliminate the need for physical distribution," said one 
studio executive. "But one of our concerns is quality, and another is who pays 
for it, the theater owner or a distributor?" 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Jacobson of the AMC theater chain was more bullish on the subject: 
"Change is change, and people are afraid of it. You can close your eyes and put 
your head in the sand if you want, but it's the future of the business." 
</P>
<P>
 Sean Daniel, a producer at Universal Studios, said he'd be interested in it if 
the technology was good enough. But he took some offense at the suggestion that 
the digital format could lead to producing different endings for different 
audiences, or re-editing a film after it's already been released. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything that makes the business more profitable would be good for movies. 
But I think it is a misunderstanding about what a motion picture is there to 
do. Theater 12 might have a choose-your-own-alien attack. But that's not a 
movie. A movie is someone else's vision that you want to give yourself over to 
see."

CENTURY 21'S REAL PEOPLE; IRVINE COMPANY'S NEW ADS FEATURE FAMILY'S SEXTUPLETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Century 21 real estate agent Caprice Hines-Kay received a phone call from a 
pregnant woman in a hospital bed who wanted to sell her home. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said they were planning to expand their family," Hines-Kay recalled."I 
was stunned when they told me they were having five kids." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dilleys -- who eventually had six babies last May -- and their business 
relationship with Hines-Kay are part of a series of television commercials 
being launched today, building on Century 21 Real Estate Corp.'s testimonial 
ads from 1993. The Irvine-based real estate sales network said it hopes to stir 
enthusiasm among its 5,000 U.S. sales agents as much as to bring in home 
buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 The testimonial approach has recently been adopted by MCI, Cablevision 
Industries and HomeBase. John Kasper, vice president of Century 21's ad agency, 
Campbell Mithun Esty in Minneapolis, said he declined to use actors as some 
testimonials do. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a realism that comes across when someone is talking about their own 
company," Kasper said. 
</P>
<P>
 Serendipitously, ABC's new magazine show, "Turning Point," co-hosted by Diane 
Sawyer, aired a profile of the Dilley family last Wednesday night. The show's 
crew had visited the family over a period of nine months. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't plan that," quipped Kasper. 
</P>
<P>
 Mother Becki Dilley and Hines-Kay communicated through nurses and fax machines 
to sell their two-bedroom, Bloomington, Ind., home within 60 days. They met in 
person for the first time after the babies were born. 
</P>
<P>
 The family is building a new home in an Indianapolis suburb.

WINNERS ENTERTAINMENT GETS W. VIRGINIA REPRIEVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Winners Entertainment Inc., a supplier of video gambling equipment, said 
Monday that the governor of West Virginia has signed a law that lets the 
company continue operating its machines at a West Virginia horse racetrack -- 
at least for the next nine months. The law also stipulates that local elections 
be held by Jan. 1, 1995, to determine if legalized use of video gambling 
machines should be allowed to continue permanently.Winners Entertainment, based 
in San Juan Capistrano, operates 165 such machines at the Mountaineer Track & 
Resort in Chester, W. Va.  
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the West Virginia Supreme Court ruled that the video gaming 
machines were in violation of state law. The governor's action relieves fears, 
at least temporarily, that the company would lose an estimated $4 million a 
year in revenue if it is forced to shut its operations.

BRIEFCASE: HEALTH CARE; CHOC NEWSLETTER LOOKS AT IMPACT OF REFORM ON CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by James M. Gomez, Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the debate over health-care reform rages in the hallways of Capitol Hill, 
the folks over at Children's Hospital of Orange County (CHOC) have decided to 
make their own statement about how the complicated issue will affect kids. 
</P>
<P>
 In a quarterly newsletter called The Human Side of Health Care Reform, CHOC 
features stories of children who are former patients.The third issue was 
printed last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The stories, some of which have no happy endings, are compelling testaments to 
how families try to cope with debilitating illness. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Crista Kuri and her battle for the lives of her two sons, Brandon and 
Matthew, for instance. Brandon was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis at the age of 
13 months, while Matthew developed insulin-dependent diabetes soon after. Torn 
by the stress over the medical problems, Kuri and her husband divorced. Now 
Crista cannot find work, while her ex-husband cannot change jobs because it 
would be difficult to find another employer to accept him into its health plan 
because of the boys' preconditions. 
</P>
<P>
 The story analyzes the pros and cons of this case under proposed health-care 
reform. The good news is that universal coverage would guarantee much-needed 
health care for the boys. On the down side, research for the cure of cystic 
fibrosis could very well "cease under the cost controls imposed by reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "So for Crista, Matthew and Brandon, health-care reform could improve their 
lives -- or it could be a disaster. It will all depend on the details of the 
final plan," the story ends. 
</P>
<P>
 Jena Jensen, director of marketing for CHOC, said that the stories of the 
Kuris and other families were chosen because they illustrated both sides of the 
debate in a way legislators and executives have all but ignored.

 Interpore Device OKd: Interpore International has received some long-awaited 
news from the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 After waiting for almost two years, Interpore, a maker of artificial bone and 
dental materials, received word from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on 
Monday that it can sell an implantable device to dentists. 
</P>
<P>
 The device is a three-millimeter-wide pole that is embedded in a patient's 
jawbone and used to anchor artificial teeth to the gum line, making dentures 
obsolete.

VANS HAILS SMALLER LOSS AS SIGN OF TURNAROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Vans Inc., the canvas shoe maker, Monday reported a third-quarter loss on an 
overall decline in sales. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange-based company's loss of $504,000 is an improvement from a net loss 
of $2.4 million, or 25 cents per share, in the third quarter of 1993. And while 
overall revenue fell, domestic sales of Vans shoes increased, mostly because of 
several new product offerings, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things are on target. The plan was that this quarter would be the beginning 
of the turnaround, and you're seeing some evidence of that," said Seth 
Feinstein, analyst with Crowell Weedon & Co., a Los Angeles investment banking 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The shoe company reported third-quarter sales of $17.9 million, compared to 
$18.2 million in the 1993 third quarter. International sales, which include 
shoes sold in Mexico, dropped to $3.6 million, compared to $5.3 million for the 
same period a year ago, mostly because of a soft economy in Mexico, the company 
said. Domestic sales of Vans' products were up 19% for the quarter to $8.8 
million from $7.4 million a year ago.  
</P>
<P>
 Increased domestic sales and a drop in inventories are both positive signs for 
the company, Feinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vans said it is boosting weekly shoe production from about 75,000 pairs to 
100,000 pairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The results for the quarter are encouraging and in line with our 
expectations," said Walter E. Schoenfeld, president and chief executive officer 
at Vans. "Even with the improvement in financial performance, there is still 
much to do. One of the main negatives for the past year has been low production 
levels. We are presently increasing production. . . . This should have a 
positive effect on gross margin." 
</P>
<P>
 In its announcement, Vans revealed that factory workers at the company's 
Orange manufacturing plant are scheduled to vote April 8 on whether to 
unionize. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales for the nine months ended Feb. 27 were $57.6 million, compared to $63.9 
million for the same period last year. Profit for the nine months dropped to 
$480,000, or 5 cents per share, because of sluggish sales. This compares with 
net income of $1.5 million, or 15 cents per share, for the same period in 
fiscal 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The earnings report was released after the market closed, so did not impact 
stock prices. Vans' stock was up 12.5 cents in Nasdaq trading Monday, closing 
at $5.625 per share.

PAYING FRINGE BENEFITS TO TEMPS IS TREND; EMPLOYMENT: MANY OF THE BETTER 
WORKERS WERE LAID OFF FROM COMPANIES THAT PAID THEM BENEFITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A trend by temporary employment agencies to provide benefits to the workers 
they place with companies is growing because many of the most desirable temps 
were laid off from companies where they received full-time benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 For job seekers with office, computer and administrative skills that are in 
high demand, it pays to shop around for the best benefits from temp agencies, 
an informal poll of agencies suggests. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're starting to have a recruiting problem, finding employees with office 
technology skills our clients require," says Bruce Steinberg, spokesman for the 
National Assn. of Temporary Services of Alexandria, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 To sweeten the pot and lure the best workers to a particular agency, benefits 
are often the incentive. 
</P>
<P>
 Though many temp outfits offer medical insurance, the amount they pay in can 
fluctuate greatly. Differences also pop up with respect to vacation pay, 401(k) 
retirement savings plans and bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies using the services of the $30-billion temporary industry, he adds, 
favor temp workers with benefits because "they don't want the temporaries to 
feel like second-class citizens" when working alongside employees who are 
covered. 
</P>
<P>
 "A number of our client employers request that we offer the same paid holidays 
to our temporaries as they provide to their permanent employees," says Robert 
Funk, president and chairman of Express Personnel Services, an Oklahoma 
City-based firm with 200 franchised agencies hiring 150,000 temps. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressure also is coming from the temps themselves, adds Kitty Sorell of New 
York City, a consultant to temp agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The old saw was that temps don't ask for benefits. But so many people have 
been laid off, they are looking (for them) now," Sorell says. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the high unemployment levels in Southern California, the trend toward 
offering insurance and other benefits still has room to grow. 
</P>
<P>
 Gene Wilson, president of Thomas Temporaries, said his agency gives temporary 
workers the option of purchasing low-cost health insurance. But he said luring 
workers for his Irvine-based company has not been difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the employment climate in California is still very different than the 
rest of the country. Our market is still very soft," Wilson said. "To say 
across the board that recruiting is a problem is difficult to say. I have to 
say that I don't believe that benefits are the most important thing in 
recruiting. There are many other factors." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of NATS' 1,100 members offer their temporary workers medical coverage, 
Steinberg says, but it is by no means uniform. Often, employees must be 
practically full-time, meaning going out to jobs every day, to qualify for 
medical coverage, but the agencies involved make only small contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Keep in mind," says Funk, "that temporary employees work on average four 
weeks before they move on. Currently, very few company-sponsored health 
insurance plans would even cover someone for this length of time." 
</P>
<P>
 However, his franchises do offer both short- and long-term plans, with 
coverage starting immediately and paid entirely by employees unless the agency 
decides to help pay the premium. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee-based Manpower, the nation's largest temporary work firm which runs 
950 agencies with 640,000 temps, offers medical benefits the day a temp starts. 
However, it kicks in 50% of the premium only after a temp works 400 hours over 
a four-month period. 
</P>
<P>
 Olsten Staffing Services, of Westbury, N.Y., which operates 320 offices, will 
allow its 375,000 temps to get on its medical plan when they start work. But 
employees must pay it all themselves. The same holds true for TOPS, a small San 
Diego-based agency with 700 temporary workers. 
</P>
<P>
 TeleSec Staffing Services, of Kensington, Md., will pay half of a temp's 
medical premium if the worker puts in 32 hours a week in a month and only after 
accruing 200 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, only a very small percentage take advantage of it," says Stacey 
Matthews, director of public relations. 
</P>
<P>
 The temp firms surveyed, representing more than 1.2 million employees, all 
said they offer vacation pay. But the length of time a temp has to work for one 
week's pay varies greatly. 
</P>
<P>
 TeleSec says it gives one week's vacation pay after a temp works 1,000 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The six firms operating under the umbrella of Career Horizons, a 91-office 
outfit with 70,500 temps based in Woodbury, N.Y., require temps to put in 1,475 
hours during the calendar year to get a week's vacation pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Its divisions are TempForce, of Woodbury; Temporaries Inc., in major Texas 
cities; POPI, of Greensboro and Winston-Salem, N.C.; Potomac Personnel, of 
northern Virginia; Flexi-Force, of Milwaukee; and Tempo of New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 Temps both at Manpower and Olsten must put in 1,500 hours to earn a week's 
vacation pay, and TOPS requires its hires to put in 1,800 hours. At Manpower, 
temps who put in 1,800 hours in their second year get two weeks' paid vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 ESP franchises may require employees to put in 2,000 to 2,500 hours to get a 
week's vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 Pension plans are important as well. While Olsten, ESP and TeleSec do not 
offer 401(k) plans, Manpower, Career Horizons and TOPS do. Career Horizons 
allows an employee after 1,000 hours to save up to 10% of pay on a tax-deferred 
basis. Moreover, it will match 50 cents on every dollar saved up to 5% of a 
temp salary, according to Theo Mavros, communications manager. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of the firms polled will pay bonuses to temps for completing extended 
assignments and, in the case of Manpower, for winning the praise of clients, 
provided the temps accrue 400 hours a year. TeleSec gives an annual bonus to 
employees starting at 600 hours of $50, and $15 for each additional 100 hours 
worked. 
</P>
<P>
 Olsten says it also offers day care benefits and employee-of-the-month 
certificates. 
</P>
<P>
 One bonus all the agencies polled pay out is, of course, to the temporary who 
recruits another temp.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: NEWHALL LAND EXPECTS $3.7-MILLION QUARTER LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Newhall Land & Farming Co., a Valencia real estate developer, said it expects 
to report a first-quarter loss of $3.7 million because of earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Without those damages, Newhall Land said it would have had a break-even 
quarter on revenues of about $16 million. In the year-ago quarter ended March 
31, the company earned $364,000 on revenues of $15.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Newhall Land also said it expects its income from operations and revenues this 
year to exceed 1993's results. Its 1994 results will include lot sales in its 
new Scottsdale, Ariz., project, and the sale of agricultural land in the fourth 
quarter.

HITTING THE TARGET; VISTA CONTROLS DESIGNS INNOVATIVE MILITARY EQUIPMENT FROM 
ROBOTIC AUTOLOADER TO SEE-THROUGH HELMET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For a company that designs and manufactures state-of-the-art weapons systems 
for the military, the name is nicely ambiguous -- Vista Controls Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, there is not much about the small research and development company 
that draws attention to it. Vista would be just another amorphous company 
tucked away among the dozens of nondescript industrial complexes sprinkled in 
the Santa Clarita Valley were it not for the 25-ton armored vehicle belonging 
to the Army parked in the company's warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 An Army self-propelled artillery gun, called the M109H Paladin, was loaned to 
Vista while the company works on a $700,000 Army contract to perfect a system 
that automatically loads the 96-pound 155-mm shells and powder bags fired by 
the weapon. The current loading system requires a soldier to physically lift 
the round from an ammunition rack. The Army is expected to renew the Vista 
contract later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get gawks and stares whenever I drive this thing around here. People stop 
and look, but then get out of the way real quick," said Vista engineer George 
Wiltsey, who is working on this and other projects for the Army. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiltsey and other Vista engineers have been working on this "robotic 
autoloader" since 1991. The Paladin is named after the lead character in the 
1950s television Western "Have Gun Will Travel." 
</P>
<P>
 The artillery project that Vista officials are working on uses a computerized 
prototype to transfer an artillery round from a storage rack to the gun's 
breech and load a powder charge automatically. It enables a Paladin crew to 
fire up to 11 rounds per minute before driving to another position on the 
battlefield. 
</P>
<P>
 The privately owned company, founded in 1985, has 45 employees and had sales 
of $6.5 million in 1993, said Mike Nemecheck, Vista military products marketing 
executive. He declined to reveal earnings for last year but said the company is 
profitable and expects sales to increase to $8 million in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Rambin, who founded the company and is president and CEO, owns more than 
50% of the company and employees own most of the remaining shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, more than 90% of the company's revenues have come from 
military contracts. In addition to contracts it has received from the Army, 
Marines, Navy and NASA, Vista has also been a subcontractor on other defense 
projects for General Dynamics, McDonnell Douglas, Lockheed, Rockwell and other 
defense contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, most of Vista's revenues come from a circuit board designed by the 
company's engineers for use in the Army's new M1A2 Abrams battle tank. The 
board is used in the tank's fire control processor to stabilize the turret and 
120-mm gun, enabling the gunner to fire accurately, while the tank rumbles 
along at 40 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our board is crucial to the tank's shoot-on-the-run ability. We designed the 
board for General Dynamics Land Systems, which built the Abrams tank," said 
Nemecheck. 
</P>
<P>
 Vista's contract with General Dynamics for the board is worth $17.5 million 
and is the company's largest military project to date. The six-year contract 
expires in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Nemecheck, a commander in the Navy Reserve, joined Vista last July, after 
working as a marketing manager for Whittaker Electronics Systems in Simi Valley 
for several years. He admits to being a duck out of water when working on 
high-tech projects for Army armored vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Nemecheck is the executive officer of a reserve unit in Long Beach that 
maintains and repairs Navy ships. In contrast to the state-of-the-art weapons 
systems that Vista is developing for the Army, Nemecheck described his Navy 
Reserve job as a "manager in a very low-tech garage for ships." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really more at home with mechanical things like turbines and pumps, but 
I'm also a salesman who's been around high-tech products," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiltsey is presently supervising a team of Vista engineers who are working on 
a See-Thru Armor Helmet that promises to give the crews of U.S. armored 
vehicles a significant advantage on the battlefield. The helmet, which will 
also have night-vision capability, will give a tank crew member, for instance, 
360-degree vision outside the tank while riding inside. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The helmet, which was demonstrated at an Assn. of the United States Army show 
in Washington last October, uses four small video cameras mounted outside the 
tank. Using computers and other high-tech equipment, the cameras are integrated 
with a helmet that features an opaque screen that can be pulled down in front 
of a soldier's face. 
</P>
<P>
 The soldier "sees through" the tank by viewing outside scenes in color on the 
opaque screen, while still being able to view the tank's control panels in 
front of him. The operator chooses which area he wants to view outside the tank 
simply by turning his head in that direction. Gyros inside the helmet activate 
the outside cameras. Currently, crew members can see what is outside their 
vehicle only by opening a hatch and looking out and exposing themselves to 
enemy fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Vista has no government funding yet for the helmet project and has paid for 
most of its research and development costs, which have totaled about $500,000 
to date, Wiltsey said. Eventually, the company hopes to sell the helmets to the 
military for about $25,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is new technology for an entirely new generation of armored vehicles 
that haven't been built yet. This is an example of what we do best here. We 
integrate existing technology into a defense project designed to work in a very 
specific way," Wiltsey said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Vista avoids projects for exotic weapons systems, which can be 
constraining and money losers for the firm. "As a small company, we're trying 
to carve out a niche with the military. It's a lower-risk effort for us if we 
stick with what we know and do best," Wiltsey said.

CHASE MANHATTAN SUES TO HALT RESTRUCTURE OF CITADEL HOLDING; BANKING: FIDELITY 
FEDERAL'S PARENT FIRM SAYS PLAN WOULD MAKE ITS THRIFT A BETTER BUY, BUT GIANT 
CREDITOR SAYS MOVE WOULD IMPEDE $35-MILLION LOAN REPAYMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Citadel Holding Corp.'s restructuring plan, which the savings and loan parent 
company has proposed under threat of government seizure, is now in doubt 
because of a lawsuit filed by Chase Manhattan Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is $482 million of troubled real estate assets that Glendale-based 
Citadel wants to transfer to a new subsidiary or division of the company, and 
then use to secure new debt. The move is intended, Citadel says, to free its 
Fidelity Federal Bank from the bad loans and make the S&L more attractive to a 
potential buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 In its breach-of-contract complaint, however, Chase accuses Citadel of 
self-dealing. Citadel's plan to shift the "cherry-picked real estate loans and 
real property" to the new subsidiary at "a bargain basement price" would 
benefit Citadel insiders, the lawsuit states. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, filed earlier this month in U.S. District Court in New York, 
seeks a court order barring Citadel from going forward with the plan, plus 
unspecified damages and attorney fees. It also names Citadel Chairman James J. 
Cotter as a defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 New York-based Chase contends in the complaint that Citadel's plan is intended 
to delay or hinder Chase's collection of the $35 million it loaned to Citadel 
in 1990. If the restructuring is implemented, the lawsuit says, Citadel would 
not have adequate capital or reserves, possibly rendering it insolvent and 
unable to repay the loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Others argue that, restructuring or not, Citadel faces inevitable government 
seizure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Citadel will never accomplish the things it's trying to do," said analyst 
Howard Rosencrans at HD Brous & Co., an investment banking and research firm in 
Great Neck, N.Y. "People will buy it out of bankruptcy when they can get a 
deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Citadel officials did not return phone calls. In a statement issued shortly 
after the lawsuit was filed, Citadel said it "does not believe the allegations 
have merit." 
</P>
<P>
 With total assets of $4.4 billion, 42 branch offices and 10 mortgage lending 
offices throughout the state, Citadel is a mid-size savings-and-loan company by 
California standards. Fidelity Federal has been up for sale since last June. 
</P>
<P>
 The company recently reported that it lost $67 million in 1993, in contrast 
with a $2 million profit in 1992. Citadel blamed the loss on Southern 
California's sour real estate market and continuing foreclosures, which forced 
it to increase its provisions for loan and real estate losses by $26 million 
last year, to $95 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Citadel's stock closed Monday at $5.375 a share. A year ago, the stock traded 
near $24. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Citadel remains adequately capitalized according to federal 
standards, concern over Citadel's losses and deteriorating capital has prompted 
the Office of Thrift Supervision, the federal regulatory agency overseeing 
savings and loans, to increase its oversight of the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Citadel also expects to report losses in the first and second quarters of this 
year. Without an infusion of capital or a reduction in its assets, it said, 
those losses would reduce Citadel's capital below regulatory minimums. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts say that if Citadel's restructuring plan is held up and the 
problem loans aren't unloaded, the risk of a government takeover will increase. 
A large portion of those loans are on apartment houses, many in the San 
Fernando Valley, which have suffered because of the recession and, more 
recently, the Northridge earthquake in January. 
</P>
<P>
 But analyst Charlotte Chamberlain at Los Angeles investment firm Wedbush 
Morgan Securities said: "The regulators may be forced to do something if the 
restructuring can't be achieved." 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks ago, Citadel said that it is discussing the sale of the thrift, 
and other investment alternatives, with unnamed parties. It hopes to complete 
the restructuring by the middle of the year, after which Citadel would become a 
real estate company focusing on servicing its loan and property portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say that some larger, well-capitalized financial institutions are 
probably interested in Fidelity Federal's well-located branches, which are 
mostly in Los Angeles and Orange counties. Great Western Corp. in Chatsworth, 
Irwindale-based H. F. Ahmanson & Co. and Golden West Financial Corp. in Oakland 
have been mentioned as possible bidders. None of these thrift holding companies 
would comment.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: INCENTIVE PROGRAM SPARKS PROFITS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Camarillo-based Power-One Inc. tossed an especially green St. Patrick's Day 
party last week for its 200 Ventura County employees. 
</P>
<P>
 As a reward for a successful year, the company paid out $342,000 in bonuses -- 
an average of $1,700 per person. That brings the bonuses received worldwide 
this year by Power-One's employees to $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the first year of our new incentive program, and we're very pleased 
with the way it's worked out," says Steve Goldman, Power-One's president and 
chief executive. "We announced specific goals, and everyone rallied to reach 
them. It's only appropriate that the rewards should be shared with the 
employees." 
</P>
<P>
 Power-One is a privately held company that produces power equipment for the 
industrial, telecommunications, data-processing and medical markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Since an incentive program was introduced in January, 1993, employees have 
responded by improving product quality, cutting costs and speeding up the 
introduction of new products, Goldman reported. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to many other California electronics concerns, Power-One showed 
strong increases in sales and profits last year. Goldman gives much of the 
credit for the gains to the new incentive program. Company revenues rose almost 
8%, to $60 million, while profits jumped more than 50%. Goldman declined to 
disclose the profit figure, but said he expects a similar percentage increase 
in earnings and a 15% rise in sales in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're definitely continuing the incentive program," Goldman said. "Our 
employees say they'll not only reach this year's goals, but that we're going to 
make even greater improvements." 
</P>
<P>
 Power-One this year plans a major upgrading of its 100,000-square-foot plant 
on Calle Plano, including the expansion of an automated sheet-metal shop and 
the addition of new manufacturing equipment. About a dozen new employees will 
be hired in Camarillo this year, mostly skilled sheet-metal workers, Goldman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Power-One has a worldwide payroll of about 1,000. In addition to its Camarillo 
headquarters, the company has factories in Mexico and Puerto Rico.

 A center offering reduced rents and other assistance to start-up companies in 
the environmental field is scheduled to open in Thousand Oaks this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous entrepreneurs have inquired about moving into the facility, reports 
Mike Murray, a spokesman for GTE California, which is making a building 
available as the center's initial home. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, known as the Thousand Oaks Environmental Business Enterprise 
Cluster, is being backed by GTE, the city of Thousand Oaks and the Center for

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: HOME SALES RISE FOR 7TH MONTH AS PRICES STABILIZE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Home sales in Ventura County rose in February for the seventh month in a row, 
and the falling prices of recent years may finally be leveling off. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 550 new and resold homes closed escrow last month -- 23% more than 
in February, 1993, according to Dataquick Information Systems.The median 
selling price in February was $193,000, 3% above the year-earlier figure. 
</P>
<P>
 "People seem to feel that both prices and interest rates have bottomed out," 
says John Karevoll, a financial analyst with La Jolla-based Dataquick. "That 
perception, along with an improving economy, are bringing buyers into the 
market." 
</P>
<P>
 Seventy-two new homes were sold in the county last month, twice as many as a 
year earlier and 16% more than in January, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Among resales, escrow closed on 390 single-family houses last month, up 19% 
from February, 1993, and 16% more than in January of this year. Condominium 
resales last month totaled 88, 6% more than a year earlier and 16% above 
January.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: NORTHRIDGE MALL REOPENING DELAYED UNTIL OCTOBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The earthquake-damaged Northridge Fashion Center will partially reopen in 
October, not in July as previously expected, a spokesman for the shopping 
mall's owner said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were just overly optimistic" in hoping for a summer reopening, said John 
Graham, vice president of property management at Dallas-based MEPC American 
Properties Inc., which purchased the mall one month before the Jan. 17 
Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge Fashion Center, about a mile from the earthquake's epicenter and by 
far the most badly damaged mall, will delay its reopening because of a lack of 
parking spaces, Graham said. All four of the parking structures at the mall are 
being rebuilt. And the shopping center's six department stores -- Sears, J. C. 
Penney, Bullock's, Broadway and two Robinsons-May facilities -- are using parts 
of the open-air parking lots as staging areas for their construction crews. 
</P>
<P>
 Sears is expected to be the first department store to reopen in October. At 
that time, there will be enough parking available to reopen some of the mall 
shops, Graham said. The rest of the mall will reopen in stages and is expected 
to be back in full operation in about a year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham added that the Bullock's store, which collapsed in the quake and has 
been condemned, might replace one of the Robinsons-May stores instead of 
reopening in a newly built store at its old site. The mall would then have only 
one Robinsons-May, and MEPC would try to find a sixth anchor tenant to build a 
new store. He said the company is talking with other department store owners, 
and he is "confident" that MEPC will find a new tenant. 
</P>
<P>
 The mall has also been undergoing an extensive cleanup of asbestos that was 
shaken loose during the quake and is removing all remaining asbestos. That 
process is expected to be completed by May 1.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: BIOPOOL INTERNATIONAL'S PROFITS TUMBLE IN '93 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Biopool International Inc., a Ventura maker of test kits for diagnosing blood 
disorders, said its profit increased 6% in the fourth quarter but its profits 
suffered a significant decline for 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 For the quarter ended Dec. 31, Biopool reported a profit of $198,993, compared 
with earnings of $188,292 for the same period a year earlier.Revenue in the 
latest quarter rose 16% to $1.11 million, from $956,898. 
</P>
<P>
 But for all of 1993, Biopool's profit fell 42% to $360,729, from $626,670 for 
the previous year. Revenue for 1993 totaled $4.31 million, down 11% from $4.87 
million. Biopool said its performance in 1993 was hurt by the unfavorable 
exchange rate of the Swedish krona, which resulted in reduced revenue at the 
company's Swedish subsidiary, Biopool AB.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: POLLUTION RESEARCH REPORTS TURNAROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pollution Research & Control Corp., a Glendale maker of air-pollution 
monitoring devices, reported profits for its fourth quarter and for all of 
1993, compared with year-earlier losses. 
</P>
<P>
 The company attributed the profit turnaround to its solving an 
inventory-control problem.However, it warned that new product development 
combined with shipping delays due to January's earthquake would result in lower 
sales and profit in the first quarter of 1994. In 1993's first quarter, the 
company earned $303,000 on $1.6 million in sales. 
</P>
<P>
 For the quarter ended Dec. 31, Pollution Research had net income of $182,000, 
in contrast with a loss of $1.7 million a year before. Its sales rose 7%, to 
$1.7 million from $1.58 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, the company earned $1.07 million on a 7% increase in sales, to $6.62 
million from $6.22 million.

COVER STORY; ROAD TO FORTUNE; 4 VALLEY FIRMS PROSPER DURING LOCAL RECESSION BY 
EXPANDING OUT OF STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While many Valley-based businesses are reeling from the recession, a few are 
basking in record profits, thanks largely to places like Arkansas, Illinois and 
Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are some of the states where four local companies -- the Cheesecake 
Factory, International House of Pancakes, Superior Industries and Players 
International -- have established restaurants, factories and riverboat casinos. 
At a time when many companies have pulled up stakes and left Los Angeles, this 
quartet of firms has found a way to get away from the drudgeries of the Golden 
State without actually leaving the area. Their out-of-state expansion has given 
these four companies the edge during the last three years of the state's worst 
economic slump since the Depression. 
</P>
<P>
 By moving into economically stronger regions, these companies have found 
cheaper places to produce and new, booming markets for their goods and 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, all of this out-of-state growth hasn't been a boon to the 
Valley economy. Although these four companies maintain headquarters and some 
operations here, their local employment overall has actually shrunk in recent 
years and now pales compared with emerging workplaces elsewhere. Partly that 
reflects corporate America's diminishing importance of headquarters, but the 
jobs have also moved to where the businesses have gone. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cheesecake Factory, a Calabasas-based restaurant chain known for its 
spacious setting and diverse menu, opened its first establishment out of 
California in January, 1991, on a snowy day in Chevy Chase, Md., an upscale 
suburb of Washington, D. C. It is now Cheesecake's highest-volume outlet, with 
sales topping $10 million last year -- more than its restaurant in Redondo 
Beach, which occupies twice the space. The newest Cheesecake Factory opened in 
Atlanta last fall and is on target to do even better, says David Overton, 
Cheesecake's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Expanding out of state "was probably the best thing we've done," said Overton, 
whose parents started the company in 1972 with a small bakery in North 
Hollywood. Today, Cheesecake owns eight restaurants, six of them in Southern 
California, including one in Woodland Hills. The company also operates a bakery 
in Calabasas. Since 1990, the company's sales have surged by an average of more 
than 20% a year, to about $60 million in 1993. Last year it earned almost $4.8 
million, up 12% from $4.3 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is now looking at opening restaurants in Chicago, Las Vegas and in 
Eastern states. 
</P>
<P>
 Players International's venture out of state was a $20-million gamble that 
could have busted the company. That's what it cost Players, also based in 
Calabasas, to switch from a marketer of low-cost Las Vegas tour packages to an 
operator of riverboat gambling casinos. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Fishman, Players' chairman, saw the California recession coming. So in 
1991, after returning from a weeklong tour of Iowa's burgeoning riverboat 
casino industry, he gave up on the Las Vegas business and went prospecting for 
casino licenses in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year Players launched two paddle-wheelers in Illinois and Louisiana, 
bedecked with hundreds of slot machines and table games. The result: Players 
hit a profit of $12 million for its fiscal nine months that ended Dec. 31, 
compared with a loss of $4 million a year earlier. And its stock has surged 
from a $2 a share in 1992 to more than $25 a share recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Superior Industries and the company that operates the International House 
of Pancakes, IHOP Corp. of Glendale, went out of state many years earlier, but 
they accelerated that expansion in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Southern California is the only region where we're negative in sales," said 
Fred Silny, IHOP's chief financial officer. Last year the company took over 
nine restaurants nationally because they were failing, and seven of those were 
in California. All told there are 572 IHOP restaurants across the country, with 
114 of them in California. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the strength of its out-of-state restaurants, including 58 established 
last year, IHOP's sales surged 25% in 1993 to $142.5 million from 1992, and its 
profit climbed 35% to $10.7 million. IHOP gets its revenues both from franchise 
fees and from royalties on restaurant sales. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Kyser, an economist at the Economic Development Corp., a nonprofit, 
business-retention organization in Hollywood, calls the expansion out of state 
"part of the business flight phenomenon." While Kyser says it's comforting that 
these four Valley companies have maintained their headquarters here, he worries 
that a build-up of too much business elsewhere could eventually lead to a 
complete exodus. 
</P>
<P>
 Top executives at these four companies say that won't happen, stressing that 
California remains an important place for them. Still, when asked why their 
corporate offices are here, they are more likely to talk about family 
preferences and the balmy Southern California climate than any strategic 
business reason. 
</P>
<P>
 "Corporate (offices) could be anywhere," said Players' chairman Fishman, 
speaking from Las Vegas. "It could be in Alaska." Companywide, Players has 
2,100 employees, but only a dozen of them work in Calabasas. That's down from 
as many as 300 employees in Calabasas before the company shifted its business 
out of state starting in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Weather may be the most important reason for Louis Borick, chairman of 
Superior, the Van Nuys maker of aluminum wheels. Borick fled his native 
Minnesota in 1957, he said, because "I hated the cold weather." Then 32, he 
arrived in Southern California and started Superior with $3,000, selling 
plastic shields to keep car bumpers clean of bugs. But the product flopped, 
Borick said, because there aren't as many freeway bugs here as in the Midwest. 
So Borick turned to other auto accessories -- seat covers, steering wheel grips 
and then, aluminum wheels. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior got its big break in 1974, winning a contract from Ford to make 5,000 
wheels for the Mustang. Last year the company shipped about 7 million wheels, 
and it earned $45 million on revenue of $393 million. Its enviable profit 
margin of 11% is as much due to Superior's new factories in low-wage, non-union 
states as it is to the auto industry's strong demand for the lightweight 
wheels. Superior makes wheels primarily for Ford and GM, and it is the 
industry's most efficient producer. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior opened its first out-of-state plant in mid-1986 in Fayetteville, 
Ark., moving into what was once a truck springs factory. Since then it has 
opened three more -- all of them in right-to-work states. And this year 
Superior opened its newest manufacturing plant in Mexico, in anticipation of 
greater demand in that country and the benefits from the North American Free 
Trade Agreement. Earlier this month Superior said it had received an order 
valued at $2 million annually to make wheels for Chrysler cars built in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Borick said he established manufacturing plants in Arkansas, 
Kansas and Tennessee to be closer to its customers, Ford and GM, but also 
because they are states where labor unions are weak. Throughout the 1980s, 
Borick had a long-running battle with the United Auto Workers at Superior's 
manufacturing plant in Van Nuys. The UAW did successfully organize the plant's 
mostly Latino work force, but it never won a contract and Borick's 
hard-charging campaign eventually kicked out the union. "We do not have any 
unions in our company," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Superior has 3,500 employees, including 700 in its factory in Van Nuys 
and 200 at its corporate offices. Reflecting the company's lean operations, 
Superior's conference rooms are bare of any paintings, contain old and drab 
furniture, and are seldom occupied for very long. "We don't have big meetings, 
everything is done quickly," said Jeff Ornstein, Superior's chief financial 
officer. The headquarters aren't much, he said, "but analysts like it" because 
of its modest cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Setting up businesses out of state hasn't come without challenges. Superior 
has had to deflect bad publicity from the UAW, which attacked the company for 
taking jobs away. Players has had its share of critics of gambling, not exactly 
seen as a wholesome endeavor by some in Metropolis, Ill., where one Players' 
riverboats is docked. Fishman says Players has tried to be a good corporate 
citizen, conducting blood drives and participating in other community 
functions. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheesecake Factory's restaurant opening in Chevy Chase, Md., was slowed by 
snow and the Persian Gulf conflict. "When we first opened, most businesses were 
closed because of the snow," said Linda Candioty, senior vice president. "But 
we didn't know any better and we opened. I was shocked, we were busy." 
</P>
<P>
 To accommodate regional tastes, Cheesecake has made minor adjustments to its 
extensive menu, which includes 200 food items over 17 pages, adding crab cakes 
in Chevy Chase and grits in Atlanta. In California, the company hasn't raised 
food prices in two years. "We're up, but we'd be up more if it weren't for the 
recession," said Overton. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, by going out of state these Valley companies have found 
friendlier, cheaper places to operate. Cheesecake Factory pleasantly learned 
that other states provide tax credits for tips, whereas California doesn't. 
Superior said its workers' compensation costs are up to 40% higher at its Van 
Nuys factory than at its other plants. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the bureaucratic laws, insurance costs, governmental regulations (in 
California) are far in excess of anywhere else in the U. S.," said Borick. 
"That could one day cause us to say, 'Screw it, we're not taking it any more.' 
" Borick said the company was unlikely ever to expand in California. The 
company is now enlarging its plant in Fayetteville. 
</P>
<P>
 IHOP's Silny says his company hasn't given up on California. The company plans 
to open 10 new International House of Pancake restaurants this year, four more 
than last year. "We're taking a long-term view," he said. But Silny said 
clearly it's been the out-of-state restaurants that have carried the company in 
the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very helpful being a national company," he said. "It's allowed us to 
balance out some weaker performance in the state with stronger restaurants 
elsewhere."

SLIDE DISCLOSURE HALTS LAGUNA FIRE REBUILDING; DISASTER: CITY WON'T APPROVE 
PERMITS UNTIL POSSIBLE SOIL STABILITY PROBLEMS IN MYSTIC HILLS, ELSEWHERE ARE 
STUDIED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Efforts to rebuild homes on a prominent hillside burned in the Oct. 27 
firestorm hit a potentially major stumbling block Monday after geologists 
disclosed that an ancient landslide may lie under 50 lots. 
</P>
<P>
 In a newly released report, geologists said if the discovery is confirmed, it 
could take up to a year to stabilize the Mystic Hills area before some of the 
homes lost there in the fire can be rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the report's impact is being felt citywide as local officials, who 
previously vowed to fast-track Laguna Beach's recovery from the fire that 
damaged or destroyed 441 homes throughout the community, immediately put the 
brakes on building permits Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials, made aware of potential soil stability problems elsewhere, have now 
decided not to approve any building permits until extensive geological studies 
are done in all areas where the fire hit. 
</P>
<P>
 For a city physically and psychologically devastated by the blaze, the report 
dampened the spirit of the community's recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't surprise me there are geological problems, because we've had 
problems elsewhere in the city," Laguna Beach Mayor Ann Christoph said. But 
after the tragic fire, the latest development is "disturbing and serious." 
</P>
<P>
 "The one option we would love to have," she said, "is to wave a magic wand and 
have it go away." 
</P>
<P>
 To Mystic Hills resident Mary Peterson, eager to replace her home, the report 
signaled that her ordeal isn't over yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fire was an inconvenience," she said. "This is a disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council has called a special meeting for tonight to discuss the 
possible old landslide and consider earmarking $35,000 for further geological 
studies estimated to take four to six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The city staff has advised that if additional study finds the hillside 
properties are stable, building permits may be issued. However, if the land 
needs to be stabilized, no permits could be issued for up to a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, the staff suggested that the council consider creating a special tax 
assessment district to raise funds for the stabilization project. It wasn't 
clear how much the effort, if needed, would cost or what the special district's 
boundaries would be. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of GeoFirm, the consultants that found the suspected ancient 
landslide, declined to comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 A summary of his report said "there is a possibility that an ancient landslide 
may underlay the site of roughly 50 homes / lots in Mystic Hills. About 15 of 
those homes were destroyed in the conflagration." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, more than 200 homes were lost in Mystic Hills, but the geologic 
study focused on just one area on the hillside above City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that homes have existed on the hillside for many years, but none has 
apparently experienced any damage from the suspected landslide. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerns about the stability of Mystic Hills comes at a critical time for the 
community's displaced residents, almost 80 of whom have filed applications to 
rebuild their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the city has issued only two permits and on Monday, officials ordered 
that no building permits be approved until geological studies are conducted and 
reviewed by city staff. After the fire, officials had promised to limit such 
studies in most cases to hasten the post-fire recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Kenneth C. Frank said Monday that the city, which has faced 
landslide-related lawsuits in the past, must be careful in light of the Mystic 
Hills report. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do have to be careful of liability, because everybody in the city pays if 
we have lawsuits," said Frank, whose own Mystic Hills home was among those 
destroyed. "But the key thing is, we're interested in protecting the health and 
safety of the people living there now and the people who want to rebuild." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout Laguna Beach's history, landslides -- including one in January, 
1993, in Mystic Hills that claimed three homes -- have continually plagued the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 The most devastating slide in recent times happened in October, 1978, when 60 
homes were damaged or destroyed in Bluebird Canyon, a hilly area about a mile 
south of Mystic Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Lawson, a Laguna Beach structural engineer, said Monday that the Mystic 
Hills area, like much of the South County, has a history of instability, 
particularly on south-facing slopes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always been bad up there," Lawson said. "Everything on the hill facing 
San Clemente has always been a hazard." 
</P>
<P>
 Iraj Poormand, a soil engineer, said "all of Orange County has a lot of 
ancient landslides. Older cities that involve hillsides have a higher 
likelihood of ancient landslides not being recognized at the time of 
construction. Laguna Beach is an old city, San Clemente is an old city." 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say a key factor in rebuilding over an ancient landslide is the depth 
of the underground crevice caused by the slide. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Lawson, 60 feet "is not too deep" for rebuilding to take place 
but "something on the order of 100 feet would be a problem. When you start 
getting down to 100 feet, you start saying: 'Where the hell is the bottom of 
this?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Lawson said foundations could be stabilized by drilling and tying steel 
supports into stable underground material. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Horne, president of the Mystic Hills Homeowners Assn., said Monday that 
homeowners should remain calm. 
</P>
<P>
 "My belief in these matters is not to cause panic," Horne said. "Let's wait 
and get the facts on the table."

SOUTHWEST TO BEGIN DAILY FLIGHTS OUT OF O.C. MAY 26; TRAVEL: FARES FOR 15 TRIPS 
FROM JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT TO OAKLAND AND SAN JOSE WILL BE $49 OR $69 EACH WAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Strengthening its grip on the key California market, Southwest Airlines 
announced Monday that it will begin 15 round-trip flights a day in May between 
Orange County and the Bay Area cities of Oakland and San Jose. The unrestricted 
fare will be $69 each way. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest's move into Orange County has been long-awaited because of the 
airline's reputation for low fares. Thousands of passengers have been driving 
to Ontario Airport or Los Angeles International to get cheaper fares. 
</P>
<P>
 With the addition of John Wayne Airport in Orange County, Southwest will fly 
from every major Southern California airport except Long Beach when it starts 
service May 26. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been building in Southern California for five years," said Gary 
Kelly, chief financial officer for Dallas-based Southwest, which flies 
throughout the western United States and has some flights to the eastern part 
of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest is now the dominant carrier within the state. It carried more than 
50% of all intrastate airline passengers in the third quarter of last year, the 
most recent figures available. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest paved the way for the latest move when it bought Morris Air Service 
in December, which was already flying two flights a day between Salt Lake City 
and Orange County. The purchase of Morris Air allowed Southwest to pick up 
additional landing slots at an airport that restricts the number of flights to 
reduce noise. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the everyday fare on the flights will be $69 -- the same as on any 
Southwest flight within California -- Kelly said discounts for advance purchase 
of $49 will be available. Southwest will offer its two-for-one promotional 
fares for leisure travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest's low fares could attract additional leisure travelers to Orange 
County, a major tourism center, even though about 70% of those who now use John 
Wayne Airport are business travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This airport has been heavily weighted with business passengers," Airport 
Director Jan Mittermeier said. Now, "leisure travelers who have been going to 
Ontario are going to come here." 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest's primary competition on its eight daily round-trip flights between 
Orange County and San Jose will be American Airlines, which previously has 
pulled out of routes rather than try to match Southwest's fares. 
</P>
<P>
 An American Airlines spokesman in Dallas said Monday: "We have not decided yet 
what we are going to do." American's unrestricted one-way fare from Orange 
County to San Jose is $119.

 On Southwest's seven daily round-trip flights between Orange County and 
Oakland, it will primarily face off against Alaska Airlines. Making life more 
difficult for Alaska, Southwest plans connecting flights into Alaska's primary 
markets of Seattle and Portland, beginning June 6. 
</P>
<P>
 An Alaska spokesman said the airline has matched Southwest's prices in the 
past and expects to do so this time on the same routes. Alaska's unrestricted 
one-way fare between Orange County and Oakland is $99. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter what action the airlines take, observers say that Southwest's 
entrance into Orange County will be a huge benefit to John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's going to spur the market. I think we are going to see people . . 
. getting off trains and out of cars because of the value the low prices are 
going to generate," said Tom Jackson, president of World Travel in Santa Ana, a 
15-office chain of travel agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The fares and flights were announced in a brief news conference at the 
airport. Orange County Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, for whom the terminal 
building is named, said the Southwest debut has created enough of a ripple to 
become a hot topic at social gatherings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been rather a relief to have people talk about Southwest instead of 
politics," he cracked. Southwest to Serve John Wayne 
</P>
<P>
 Starting May 26, Southwest Airlines will provide weekday round-trip flights to 
Oakland and San Jose from John Wayne Airport. One-way fares range from $49 to 
$69.

2 OFFICIALS CHARGED IN O.C. SCANDAL; INVESTIGATION: THE FORMER TOP MANAGERS OF 
SANTA MARGARITA WATER DISTRICT ARE ACCUSED OF ILLEGALLY ACCEPTING GIFTS FROM 
CONTRACTORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 One year after scandal shook the Santa Margarita Water District out of 
obscurity, prosecutors charged two former top managers Monday with illegally 
taking thousands of dollars in gifts from companies that relied on their help 
in securing government contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County district attorney's office brought a total of 38 misdemeanor 
charges against Walter W. (Bill) Knitz, 62, the former general manager of the 
district, and Michael P. Lord, 51, the assistant general manager, alleging that 
they repeatedly failed to disclose gifts from business people and then took 
action on their behalf despite conflicts of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither man could be reached for comment, but in the past both have 
steadfastly maintained that they are innocent of any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Assistant Dist. Atty. Wallace J. Wade said his office will continue 
to pursue an investigation into similar allegations against a former board 
chairman and an engineer at the district. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney opened its investigation into the case in March, one day 
after The Times reported that Knitz and Lord had accepted tens of thousands of 
dollars in gifts from local business people -- from pheasant hunting and 
fishing trips to theater tickets and golf outings. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges came as something of a welcome respite for a new water district 
board that came into office last November, when most of the old board was swept 
out in the wake of the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it will be a great relief to the district and particularly the 
employees who have had to withstand a great deal of trauma, not of their 
doing," said board member Bob Lay, who is chairman of the district's finance 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Board Chairman Jim Holmes: "It's time to finalize whatever's going to 
happen and get on with the world. The district would certainly like to get on 
with things. This was all in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 All of the charges filed Monday involve gifts allegedly provided to Knitz and 
Lord by two Orange County engineering firms -- Robert Bein, William Frost & 
Associates of Irvine, and MacDonald-Stephens Engineering of Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors alleged in their complaint that Knitz illegally took part in Santa 
Margarita Water District decisions worth more than $1.1 million in government 
contracts to the two companies from 1990 to 1992, while Lord allegedly 
influenced more than a quarter-million dollars in Bein, Frost contracts during 
that same time at the water district. 
</P>
<P>
 The furor over the reports of lavish trips and gifts prompted a newfound 
public scrutiny for a $28-million-a-year special district that had operated for 
29 years in relative obscurity, providing water and sewer service for 84,000 
people in South County. 
</P>
<P>
 Within weeks of the controversy's first disclosure, the district adopted a 
strict new ethics code banning employees from accepting gifts of any amount, 
and it suspended both Knitz and Lord, who continued to draw their six-figure 
salaries. Each later resigned. 
</P>
<P>
 Lord's attorney, Gary Pohlson, said the sheer length of the year-long 
investigation had imposed an emotional and financial "burden" on his client -- 
Lord is considering filing for bankruptcy -- but that he continues to maintain 
his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am surprised (by the filings) simply because it's taken so long. I was 
hopeful they wouldn't file," Pohlson said. The one bright spot in the day, 
Pohlson said, was the fact that prosecutors decided not to bring any felony 
charges, which carry stiffer penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 Knitz's attorney, Marshall Schulman, seemed to take the filings in stride. 
"We'll have to deal with them. I wasn't sweating it. I have to see what they're 
charging and see what they've got. If they don't have anything, then you'll 
expect us to fight it." 
</P>
<P>
 Knitz and Lord each face fines and/or jail time if convicted on the 
misdemeanor charges, although prosecutors said they were uncertain of the most 
severe sentences that could be imposed. Arraignments were set for April 12 in 
Orange County Municipal Court in Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors refused to elaborate on the charges filed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Shirley Grindle, a civic activist who has successfully pushed political 
finance reform measures around the county, said such gift-acceptance practices 
have a corrupting influence on local government. 
</P>
<P>
 Water district officials "got too chummy" with the people they were 
regulating, she maintained. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lesson that all public officials need to keep an arm's length distance 
from the corporations they govern," Grindle said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfortunate they got themselves into it." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at MacDonald-Stephens and Bein, Frost did not return calls seeking 
comment Monday. While officials at MacDonald-Stephens have refused even to 
discuss the investigation, Bein, Frost officials say they never sought to 
influence any contracts through gifts to anyone at the water district. 
</P>
<P>
 The counts listed in the complaint filed Monday are broken down into two types 
of violations: failure by each man to disclose repeated gifts from local 
business executives in state-required filings; and attempts by each to use "his 
official position to influence a governmental decision in which he knew or had 
reason to know he had a financial interest." 
</P>
<P>
 It is against state law for most government officials to take part in a 
decision affecting anyone who has provided $250 or more in gifts for up to 12 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint gives few details about the actual gifts that the two men 
allegedly received, but it does break down the contracts that came into 
question as a result. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors alleged that Knitz, despite an apparent conflict of interest 
created by the gifts that he had received, improperly influenced five different 
MacDonald-Stephens contracts between 1990 and 1992, totaling $662,620, and 
influenced 10 Bein, Frost contracts worth $495,380. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, during 1991 alone -- when Knitz reported receiving at least 
$3,675 in gifts from Bein, Frost and MacDonald-Stephens -- the complaint 
alleges he used his position to help secure at least $570,980 in contracts for 
the two companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Lord, meanwhile, allegedly played a part in issuing six contracts to Bein, 
Frost worth $229,150. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1989, Bein, Frost has been paid about $13 million for a variety of 
engineering projects; MacDonald-Stephens has been paid more than $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 One conflict-of-interest count against Lord also involved a $2-million 
certificate of deposit that the water district purchased from Mission Viejo 
National Bank in 1991, even though the bank was on the verge of financial 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the district incurred no loss and eventually redeemed the certificate 
of deposit when it matured, the transaction raised questions about Lord's 
handling of customer funds and proceeds from public-sale bonds -- in 
particular, the relationship between the district, Lord and South County banker 
Charles D. Maranto. 
</P>
<P>
 Documents reviewed by The Times showed that the water district's 
multimillion-dollar general operating fund followed Maranto as he went from 
bank to bank over a five-year period. Lord had obtained at least a $50,000 
loan, a $45,000 line of credit and another $3,000 line of credit from the same 
banks involved with Maranto, who was with Mission Viejo National when the 
district purchased the $2-million certificate of deposit. 
</P>
<P>
 Wade, who oversaw the investigation, said prosecutors were working against a 
tight deadline in filing their criminal complaints. By one interpretation of 
state law, the statute of limitations on several of the gifts to Knitz would 
have run out today, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wade did not rule out the possibility of a plea bargain -- as happened in a 
similar case last year when former Supervisor Don R. Roth pleaded guilty to 
political gift-reporting and conflict-of-interest misdemeanors. He paid a 
$50,000 fine and did community service. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wade said such discussions will have to wait at least several days, until 
the defendants' lawyers have had time to review the complaints "and let us know 
what direction they want to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Wade said prosecutors will continue their investigation into 
several other officials at the water district who have come under fire for 
their acceptance of gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 The ex-chairman of the water district, Don B. Schone, 52, resigned Jan. 16 -- 
the same day it was disclosed by The Times that he had taken free trips to Cabo 
San Lucas, courtesy of Bein, Frost. Schone was treated to stays in Cabo for 
four days in April, 1990, and again for five days in May, 1991, but did not 
report the gifts in state-required filings. 
</P>
<P>
 Schone, who served on the water district board for 17 years, has denied any 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in January, The Times reported that William B. Dye, the district's top 
engineer since 1979, and Dan Ferons, his chief assistant, received nearly 
$12,000 in meals and trips paid for by Bein, Frost. Dye, 58, had never reported 
receiving anything of value from any contractor on the statements of economic 
interest he has been required to file every year. 
</P>
<P>
 Until this year, Ferons has not been required to file such statements under 
the law, according to the water district. Both Dye and Ferons have denied any 
wrongdoing.

LANCASTER PRISON'S ESCAPES EXCEED THE 1ST-YEAR NORM; INCARCERATION: THE 
BREAKOUTS IGNITE THE FEARS OF RESIDENTS WHO FOUGHT THE FACILITY'S CONSTRUCTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When a convicted murderer escaped from the new prison here last fall by 
scaling an eight-foot block wall and two 12-foot chain-link fences -- all 
topped with razor wire -- he also shattered a state safety benchmark. 
</P>
<P>
 Before that Oct. 6 breakout, California's prison system had gone almost six 
years without an escape by a male maximum-security inmate. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months later, before the prison was even a year old, another 
maximum-security inmate escaped from Lancaster, this time by hiding in a 
garbage truck. He was crushed into a trash bale, then dumped at a landfill, 
where he was recaptured. 
</P>
<P>
 Prison officials have attributed these escapes to construction defects and 
staff errors -- the sort of shakedown kinks that might be expected at a 
brand-new prison housing more than 3,000 maximum- and medium-security inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 But state records and interviews with officials at other new prisons in 
California show that Lancaster's first-year break-out record was far worse than 
the norm. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not typical of any institution to have Level IV (maximum-security) 
inmates escape, whether it's in the first year or no matter how long they've 
been in operation," said Tip Kindel, a spokesman for the state Department of 
Corrections in Sacramento. "That is a very, very unusual event and one of very 
great concern to the department." 
</P>
<P>
 The escapes were a key reason that state officials decided late last month to 
remove Otis Thurman as warden at the Lancaster prison. Thurman was urged to 
retire or accept a lesser position elsewhere. He has not announced his 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 During Thurman's tenure, two minimum-security inmates also escaped -- 
triggering a firestorm of controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's an absolute embarrassment to the entire system that this 
brand-new prison -- state of the art, supposedly -- could have four escapes in 
one year," said Danielle Marvin Lewis, a Lancaster businesswoman who led an 
unsuccessful fight to block the new prison. "We have a very volatile situation 
out there, sitting within a half-mile of a residential area. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like living next door to a dynamite factory, in my opinion." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials note that maximum-security breakouts are indeed rare. 
</P>
<P>
 According to state records, only eight maximum-security inmates escaped 
statewide between April, 1982, and February, 1988 -- all from three of the 
state's older prisons: San Quentin, Folsom and the California Correctional 
Institution at Tehachapi. All but one was recaptured. 
</P>
<P>
 No maximum-security male inmates escaped from any California prison in 1989, 
1990, 1991 or 1992, according to state records. In 1990, a woman inmate escaped 
from the California Institution for Women in Corona. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, the lone maximum-security escapee was Eric Rene Johnson, 23, who 
climbed over the Lancaster prison's wall and fences. He was recaptured five 
hours later, outside a convenience market several miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, his escape ignited fear and anger among residents and led the City 
Council to drop its support for a proposed second state prison in Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "A murderer who was escaping from their prison, desperate and capable of 
violence, was at loose on our streets while we slept," resident Donna M. Reed 
told the council. 
</P>
<P>
 In a written report issued a month after the first escape, Warden Thurman said 
Johnson, after being assigned to work in a prison yard at 7 p.m., climbed over 
the wall while two guards were "simultaneously distracted." (A state 
corrections official later said that no yard officer was supervising Johnson -- 
a violation of prison rules.) 
</P>
<P>
 In his report, Thurman said that after Johnson got over the wall, "unnoticed, 
(he) waited behind the housing units, presumably until dark, when he scaled the 
inner and outer perimeter fences." 
</P>
<P>
 Razor wire was installed atop the wall and fences to entangle and injure 
anyone who tries to scale the barriers. Prison officials have not publicly 
explained how Johnson got over the wire without being seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Prison officers recaptured the inmate at 1:50 a.m. the next day. Prison 
administrators drew harsh criticism for failing to tell local sheriff's 
deputies about the escape until two hours after it was discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 After the breakout and an investigation by state officials, Thurman vowed to 
increase the number of times inmates are counted each day from six to seven, 
and to step up security checks around the fences and housing areas. 
</P>
<P>
 In his report, the warden said state investigators attributed the escape to 
"staff negligence, construction deficiencies and procedural inadequacies." 
(State prison spokesman Kindel later said the investigators "did not find any 
construction deficiencies in the escape route.") 
</P>
<P>
 At the conclusion of his report, Thurman stated that the Lancaster prison 
would receive $25,000 to provide 800 more hours of training on escape 
procedures to all employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the Lancaster prison was also the site of the only 
maximum-security escape reported so far in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 13, Steven Charles Brigada, 25, serving a life sentence for attempting 
to murder a California Highway Patrol officer, was working in the prison 
kitchen. Although inmates are allowed to enter a garbage bin area only while 
accompanied by a guard, Brigada somehow slipped into a waste bin without being 
seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Prison guards escort garbage trucks in and out of the prison. But on this 
morning, no one saw Brigada as the truck lifted the bin that he was hiding in 
and emptied it into the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 The inmate was injured when the truck compressed its load, then emptied it at 
a local landfill. He was recaptured after calling for help at the dump. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators at the prison have refused to provide further details on the 
two escapes or to discuss what disciplinary actions -- if any -- have been 
taken against guards who were on duty. They have said these are sensitive 
security and personnel matters, which require lengthy, confidential 
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some members of the prison's 15-member Citizens Advisory Committee have 
complained that the scarcity of information and Thurman's low profile after the 
escapes only increased local fears about the institution. 
</P>
<P>
 "People need to be told what has taken place," said Antelope Valley College 
President Allan Kurki, a committee member. "We have to build up a confidence 
base in the community, and it's not going to happen if the only response we get 
is: 'We can't discuss this.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Thurman is on a personal leave and has been unavailable for comment since his 
removal. James H. Gomez, director of the California Department of Corrections, 
would not comment on the escapes or Thurman's conduct as warden in Lancaster, a 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents were particularly upset because the recent escapes involved 
maximum-security inmates. The breakouts confirmed the worst fears of residents 
and local officials who waged a vigorous campaign in the late 1980s to block 
construction of a prison in Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the decade, state lawmakers decided that a prison had to be built 
somewhere in Los Angeles County. They pointed out that the county was producing 
about 40% of the state inmates but had no prison within its boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1987 "pain-for-pain" political compromise, state legislators ordered that 
one Los Angeles County prison be built in the predominantly Republican high 
desert, while the other would be in predominantly Democratic East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Strong opposition from East Los Angeles residents killed plans for that 
prison. But a similar campaign in Lancaster, citing the prison's potential 
impact on local water supplies, courtrooms and property values, failed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We specifically chose not to use the fear of escape as an issue because we 
thought that could create panic," recalled Lewis, who chaired the committee 
opposing the Lancaster prison. "We thought there were more than enough other 
reasons not to build the prison." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many residents did say they feared that inmates would escape and harm 
people in neighborhoods near the prison. The site selected by the state was at 
60th Street West and Avenue J, about four miles west of downtown Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 1, 1993, the $207-million prison, occupying a 252-acre site, opened. 
Local officials were so anxious to disassociate the community from the prison 
that they fought -- successfully, this time -- to keep "Lancaster" and 
"Antelope Valley" out of the prison's name. 
</P>
<P>
 California State Prison -- Los Angeles County was designed to house 2,200 
inmates but because of statewide overcrowding problems, it now houses just 
under 4,000. 
</P>
<P>
 As of March 1, the prison housed 1,887 Level IV, or maximum-security, 
prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 When inmates enter the state's general prison population, they are assigned to 
one of four security levels, based primarily on the length of their sentence. 
Their background and their record of behavior behind bars are also considered. 
</P>
<P>
 Maximum-security inmates most often are convicted murderers and others who 
have committed violent crimes or multiple offenses that have led to long 
sentences. If a maximum-security prisoner maintains a good behavior record, he 
or she can eventually be moved to one of three lower-security levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster's maximum-security inmates live in cells and are closely watched, 
but there are no Death-Row inmates -- such prisoners are housed only at San 
Quentin. 
</P>
<P>
 To discourage escape, state officials have begun installing lethal electrified 
fences between the two chain-link barriers that surround most maximum-security 
prisons. Lancaster is slated to receive one, but a date has not been announced. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, minimum-security prisoners, who usually have committed nonviolent 
crimes and have short sentences, live in open dormitories with no fences around 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the two maximum-security inmates who escaped from Lancaster set off 
the greatest uproar in the community, two minimum-security prisoners living in 
barracks outside the prison fences, also walked away in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Within four days, both were recaptured in the Los Angeles area, one after 
being involved in a carjacking, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the four escapes, brawls have erupted among inmates and between 
inmates and guards at Lancaster. Guards have shot four inmates who ignored 
orders to stop fighting. No inmates died in these incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the prison's advisory committee have said skirmishes are to be 
expected at a prison. But they did not expect the string of breakouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am totally overwhelmed that we have had four prisoners escape in less than 
one year," said Howard Brooks, executive director of the Antelope Valley Board 
of Trade and a member of the prison's advisory committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are real concerned," he added. "You have to assume that a prison is a 
prison -- and none of this one-year shakedown business. It's supposed to hold 
prisoners securely from day-one." 
</P>
<P>
 The state operates 28 prisons. Lancaster is one of 11 housing Level IV 
inmates. But none of the other California prisons opened in recent years match 
Lancaster's record for maximum-security escapes: 
</P>
<P>
 * No maximum-security inmates have escaped from seven-year-old California 
State Prison -- Sacramento, which houses 3,000 Level IV prisoners, or from 
Pelican Bay in Crescent City, which opened in 1989 and houses 2,000 
maximum-security inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 * No prisoners -- maximum- or minimum-security -- have escaped from Calipatria 
State Prison, which opened in January, 1992, or Centinela State Prison in 
Imperial, which opened in October. 
</P>
<P>
 * California State Prison -- Corcoran has had no escapes by Level-IV inmates 
since it opened in February, 1988. In 1993, however, one medium-security 
prisoner got out by hiding in a laundry truck. 
</P>
<P>
 * No escapes have occurred at California's two newest women's prisons, which 
opened in Stockton in 1987 and in Chowchilla in 1990. At the California 
Institution for Women in Corona, which opened in 1952, the last 
maximum-security escape occurred in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 * One of the older prisons, Tehachapi, which opened in 1933 as a woman's 
facility, has had only one maximum-security escape since it was converted to a 
men's prison in 1954. Convicted murderer Vincent Motley somehow obtained a 
guard's uniform and used it to drive out of the facility on Feb. 1, 1988. He 
was recaptured about a week later. 
</P>
<P>
 At older prisons, guards must "walk the tiers" to keep an eye on the inmates. 
At the newer prisons, including Lancaster, guards can watch the inmates and 
open each cell electronically from a central, enclosed control booth. The new 
prisons also have fewer "blind spots" where inmates can avoid being seen by 
guards. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Enomoto, who was director of the California Department of Corrections 
from 1975 through 1980, said that even the most secure structures must rely on 
fallible human beings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Occasionally, through somebody's error, escapes do happen -- even at a 
Level-IV prison," he said. "If escapes happen, you have to hold somebody 
accountable." 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, it appears that Thurman, the warden, was held responsible for the 
maximum-security breakouts at Lancaster -- and lost his job largely because of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, it was a factor," said a prison system source. "It's not that he did 
anything independently. But there was a management failure to make sure the 
staff implemented the proper procedures."

ANAHEIM THERAPISTS SUED OVER SEX ABUSE MEMORIES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A former winery executive is asking more than $8 million in damages from 
therapists he claims talked his adult daughter into accusing him of raping her 
when she was a child. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been totally humiliated, all because of these quackery procedures,' 
plaintiff Gary Ramona said. "This is an incredible story. . . . I pray that my 
life will return to normal and that I get my family back." 
</P>
<P>
 The trial, which began Monday in Napa County, may break new legal ground in 
addressing the sticky issues of recovered memories, said Richard Shearer, one 
of the father's attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 It also will test whether a third party can sue psychiatric therapists for 
damages in California, the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The malpractice lawsuit by Ramona, a former Robert Mondavi Winery vice 
president, charges that a family therapist and a psychiatrist talked his 
daughter, Holly Ramona, into visualizing lurid images of herself and her 
father. 
</P>
<P>
 Holly Ramona, now 23, says he molested her, and is scheduled to testify in the 
therapists' defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Since she initially accused Ramona in 1990 and filed her own suit against him, 
he has lost his $300,000-per-year job, his marriage and his friends, he said. 
Her suit is still pending. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit seeks at least $8 million in economic losses from Western Medical 
Center-Anaheim, psychiatrist Richard Rose and Marche Isabella, a marriage, 
family and child counselor. 
</P>
<P>
 Isabella's attorney, Jeffrey Kurtock, said the suit give the impression that 
Holly "suffered from some sort of mental defect in which you just have to say 
something to her and she'll believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 The suit maintains that Isabella planted the idea of molestation in Holly 
Ramona's mind while treating her for bulimia. At the time, Ramona was a student 
at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 That memory was then reinforced through improper use of sodium amytal, 
according Ramona's expert witness, Dr. Martin Orne, a psychiatrist at the 
University of Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
 "He lost his $300,000-a-year job, he lost his friends in and around St. Helena 
where he lived with his wife and three daughters," Ramona's trial attorney 
Richard Harrington said. "And he lost his marriage, and his children will no 
longer speak to him." 
</P>
<P>
 The defense warns that Ramona's suit opens up a legal can of worms. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a doctor has to be concerned about the feelings of someone who his patient 
accuses of doing something wrong, (it) has foreboding possibilities," said 
defense lawyer Bruce Miroglio.

O.C. WATER DISTRICT SCANDAL: CHARGES FILED; MANY REFORMS HAVE CHANGED TROUBLED 
WATER DISTRICT; SAFEGUARDS: THE NEW CONTROLS ARE AIMED AT PREVENTING ABUSES 
SIMILAR TO THOSE IN THE PAST AND TO PROTECT AGAINST EVEN THE APPEARANCE OF 
IMPROPRIETY.

<P>
 Long before criminal charges were contemplated against Santa Margarita Water 
District officials, significant change had already taken place to guard against 
abuse, including a strict code of conduct, a nearly total ban on gifts and a 
new selection process for consultants. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the new internal controls, the scandal prompted 135 people to 
apply for the general manager's $113,292-a-year job, caused the elimination of 
the assistant general manager's $109,116-a-year position and led to a sweep of 
three incumbents who had been on the board of directors when the scandal 
erupted. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth incumbent, chairman Don B. Schone, resigned in January after it was 
revealed that he had accepted trips to Mexico from a firm that did business 
with the district. 
</P>
<P>
 All five board positions will be up for grabs again this year, because of a 
new law that has changed the district's voting system to "one man, one vote" 
from the present system that assigns a vote to each dollar of a property 
owner's assessed land value. 
</P>
<P>
 The crisis at the district also became a catalyst for change beyond its 
62,000-acre domain. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, the Orange County Grand Jury began an inquiry into whether four 
water wholesalers could be merged. The grand jury is also studying whether to 
merge the Santa Margarita Water District with four other, similar South County 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's Local Agency Formation Commission is conducting its own study of 
whether to consolidate water and sanitation services in Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
 And the controversy has prompted talk of restructuring other levels of 
government as well, such as the county and its 31 city governments. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Margarita Water District, which operated in obscurity for 29 years, 
was thrust into the spotlight last spring with the news that its then-general 
manager, Walter W. (Bill) Knitz, and then-assistant manager, Michael P. Lord, 
had billed the district for tens of thousands of dollars in questionable 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, consultants and vendors that won contracts worth millions of 
dollars treated both managers, and other district officials, to meals and 
gifts, almost on a weekly basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Meals, entertainment and gifts also were extended to board members, including 
former chairman Schone, who resigned the same day The Times revealed that he 
had accepted trips to Cabo San Lucas from an engineering firm he had approved 
for contracts over the years. Schone did not disclose those trips on statements 
of economic interest. 
</P>
<P>
 William B. Dye, the chief engineer, received thousands of dollars worth of 
meals and entertainment from engineering firms he was recommending for 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Because few controls were in place to prevent Knitz and Lord from spending 
money the way they saw fit, both men said they saw nothing wrong with their 
expenditures, which included Broadway theater tickets, a limousine ride, 
high-priced room service tabs and frequent wax jobs for their district-provided 
automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the rules are far different. 
</P>
<P>
 Every district employee is required to submit a quarterly listing of all 
gifts, which can include as little as a cup of coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 The only gift an employee can receive is a meal or beverage related to a 
business meeting and even then, it cannot exceed $25 per meeting. No more than 
$50 can come from any one source over a calendar year. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, the board of directors had adopted a policy of no gifts whatsoever, 
but eased the restrictions on meals and beverages when employees complained 
about not being able to accept as much as a doughnut at a morning breakfast 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Those doing business with the district must submit an annual inventory of 
gifts provided to district employees. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Knitz and Lord spent thousands of dollars on lunches and dinners, 
including liquor, for themselves and an assortment of consultants, land owners 
and staff members. Under the new district policy, the district cannot be 
charged for those bills and the consumption of alcohol at business meals is 
strictly prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times exposed numerous instances of district employees' relatives working 
for district contractors and vice versa. For instance, Lord's son and daughter 
both worked for engineering consultants that received significant district 
business. Under the new rules, dependent offspring of district employees cannot 
work for companies that do business with the Santa Margarita Water District. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the board recently made an exception: the employment of offspring can 
be allowed if the board or general manager decide it does not "create a 
perception of conflict." And those offspring hired before May 19 of this year 
can stay in their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Limits were placed on business-trip-related meals -- $10 for breakfast, $20 
for lunch and $30 for dinner, including tips -- and employees can no longer 
travel first class, as Knitz sometimes did. The district also eliminated the 
payment of personal expenses, such as Lord's $200 theater tickets or Knitz's 
$245 limousine ride. 
</P>
<P>
 No longer can an employee's spouse's travel be paid by the district. In Lord's 
case, he brought along his wife Ingrid or an unidentified companion to business 
trips in New York, Oakland, San Francisco and Lake Tahoe. 
</P>
<P>
 The board also revamped the way in which it selects consultants and eliminated 
much of the work that two engineering companies -- MacDonald-Stephens Engineers 
and Robert Bein, William Frost & Associates -- had been granted for years. Both 
companies received no-bid work and had given tens of thousands of dollars in 
gifts to Santa Margarita officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new procedures, the district must solicit competitive proposals from 
at least three qualified consultants for any work above $10,000. Work below 
$10,000 will go to a qualified consultant "on file" but should be rotated among 
consultants when possible. 
</P>
<P>
 MacDonald-Stephens and another company, Wal-Con Construction Corp., were under 
an internal review over money they may have overcharged the district. The 
district's finance director found nearly $500,000 in questionable costs that 
MacDonald-Stephens billed the water authority and said that Knitz blocked his 
attempts to request the necessary paperwork that would have justified those 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Miller, who filled in as general manager until a new administrator started 
work in January, reviewed $250,000 in questionable charges but decided in the 
end that the company was responsible for only $35,000 of that amount. The 
district did not pay for incoming invoices from the company in that amount. 
</P>
<P>
 Wal-Con officials said they had actually underbilled the water district for 
hundreds of thousands of dollars of work, and Miller concluded that the 
district had no legal standing against Wal-Con and could not require them to 
pay anything. 
</P>
<P>
 In both instances, Miller said, the companies say they do not have nor were 
they required to keep detailed records, such as labor and overtime costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have much leverage, frankly," Miller said. "We're in a weak 
position." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the district's 29-year association with the law firm of Fritz R. 
Stradling is under review. Miller asked an outside attorney to audit 
Stradling's services, which cost the district about $300,000 a year, to see how 
legal service is being handled. 
</P>
<P>
 John J. Schatz, the new general manager, requested new proposals for legal 
work and has said that Stradling's law firm may be replaced with new counsel.

O.C. WATER DISTRICT SCANDAL: CHARGES FILED; PAST GRAND JURIES GAVE WARNING OF 
POTENTIAL FOR ABUSE AT WATER DISTRICTS; SCANDAL: THE SANTA MARGARITA AFFAIR HAS 
RESULTED IN MOVEMENT FOR CHANGE THAT COULD RESULT IN CONSOLIDATION THAT WOULD 
BRING AN END TO SMALL, INDEPENDENT AGENCIES.

<P>
 More than a decade ago, Orange County grand jurors saw the scandal coming. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1981, and again in 1987, two separate grand juries examined the independent 
water and sewer districts in the county and did not like what they saw. They 
issued two damning reports depicting a hidden layer of government run by 
uninformed boards of directors, reelected again and again by minuscule numbers 
of voters and overseeing multimillion-dollar contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 The jurors added a grim observation: The badly flawed system would be hard to 
change because of the "vested interest groups" that benefited from the public 
money spent annually by the districts. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, 1993, when scandal ultimately arrived, it landed at the biggest and 
most formidable water district in the South County, the Santa Margarita Water 
District, which stretches over Mission Viejo, Rancho Santa Margarita, Coto de 
Caza and the vast Rancho Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 Stories in The Times documented that the district's two top managers -- Walter 
W. (Bill) Knitz and his top assistant, Michael P. Lord -- had been living 
lavishly using taxpayer money, and had accepted more than $60,000 in gifts over 
five years from companies that had been awarded district contracts worth 
millions of dollars -- and without competitive bidding. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials enjoyed limousine rides, stayed in luxury hotels with 
four-figure room service tabs, drove $35,000 automobiles paid for and fueled by 
the taxpayers, traveled coast-to-coast, and piled up long lists of motel and 
lunch tabs in Orange County. All this happened the same year the board decided 
it could not afford raises for the district's rank-and-file employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Miller of San Juan Capistrano, who had retired in 1992 to a private 
consulting firm after 20 years as general manager of a smaller South County 
water agency -- the South Coast Water District -- remembers his shock at 
reading the accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really very surprised that things that far out were happening," Miller 
said. "I was hoping it was an isolated case. I don't think anybody else was as 
quite out in left field as they were." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the discovery revealed how many small service districts do business 
and raised questions about spending practices of many of them. The scandal also 
increased scrutiny and spotlighted problems everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The news about the Santa Margarita district rippled throughout the county 
system of 19 independent water districts and reached north to Sacramento. It 
prompted talk of reform, of an end to contracts awarded without competitive 
bidding, and of possibly merging districts for greater efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 State legislation was introduced to increase financial disclosure requirements 
for special districts, and to change outdated practices for the election of 
board members in the last two "landowner districts" in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the new voting legislation became law, big landowners in the Santa 
Margarita and Los Alisos water districts had a greater say than resident 
homeowners in choosing the districts' directors, since all property owners in 
those "landowner districts" were accorded one vote for each dollar of their 
land's assessed value on property tax rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere was the Santa Margarita scandal more intimately felt than in South 
County, where the myriad of water and sewer districts are a town hall system 
and the oldest form of government, out-dating some local cities by half a 
century. 
</P>
<P>
 In places such as Dana Point, where six different water districts and two 
sanitary districts divide the small, six-square-mile city, district directors 
were prompted to take a renewed look at obscure and antiquated practices. 
</P>
<P>
 And in San Clemente's Tri-Cities Municipal Water District, for example, the 
controversy inspired board members to cease collecting $500 in monthly health 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Tri-Cities directors ended their decades-old arrangement of allowing a 
vice president of an engineering firm that routinely accepts $50,000 a month in 
public funds from Tri-Cities to act in a dual capacity as district manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the board hired a new general manager who is not connected with the 
outside engineering firm. 
</P>
<P>
 By July, the disclosures had revived an issue twice brought up by the county 
grand juries during the 1980s, but repeatedly ignored by the special districts: 
consolidation. 
</P>
<P>
 A county government agency said it was time to look at merging the small 
districts into larger, more accountable agencies that would bring better 
service to their customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting in Dana Point, the Local Agency Formation Commission, a county panel 
charged with overseeing annexations and consolidations of local governments, 
launched a study of the traditional structure of South County governments. 
</P>
<P>
 James Colangelo, LAFCO's then-executive director, told a group of 28 wary 
officials from South County cities and special districts that "nothing is off 
limits. . . . If providing the best service means redrawing the boundaries of 
(some districts), LAFCO's mission is to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the Orange County Grand Jury is again scrutinizing the 
consolidation issue. Reports from LAFCO and the jury are due in the coming 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Legislature, with a bill authored by Assemblyman Mike Gotch (R-San 
Diego), armed LAFCO with new powers to consolidate special districts. 
</P>
<P>
 An interested observer in the developments of the past 12 months has been Alex 
Bowie, a Newport Beach attorney who has advised special districts for 30 years. 
The move for reform and consolidation has been in the wind for years and it was 
fanned by the scandal at Santa Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
 "You knew all of this was coming," Bowie said. "There were two focuses in the 
state Legislature this (past) year. One was the tax shift, the other was the 
Gotch bill which meant you were going to take a real long look at local 
government for financial reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "The spotlight just became focused because of this other unfortunate 
occurrence," Bowie said.

HARDING INVOLVED IN KERRIGAN PLOT, INDICTMENT SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If figure skater Tonya Harding had not pleaded guilty to a lesser charge last 
week, she would have been indicted in the plot to injure rival Nancy Kerrigan, 
a grand jury said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Three men allegedly involved in the Jan. 6 attack during the U.S. figure 
skating championships -- Shawn Eckardt, Shane Stant and Derrick Smith -- were 
indicted on charges of racketeering, conspiracy to commit assault, assault and 
unlawfully obtaining communications. 
</P>
<P>
 After a two-month investigation, the Multnomah County, Ore., grand jury 
concluded that the three men agreed with each other, Harding and her former 
husband, Jeff Gillooly, to "unlawfully, intentionally and knowingly cause 
physical injury to Nancy Kerrigan by means of a dangerous weapon." 
</P>
<P>
 Although grand jury foreman David Holt said that he could not discuss specific 
evidence reviewed, he told the Associated Press that he agreed with Norman 
Frink, Multnomah County deputy district attorney, that there was enough 
evidence to indict Harding. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like Mr. Frink said, there was a great deal of evidence pointing toward the 
fact that she was involved from the beginning or very close to the beginning," 
he said. "I think she would have been indicted on all counts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe she was so close to a lot of things that were going on that there's 
no way she could not have known." 
</P>
<P>
 In a plea bargain agreement with Frink's office, Harding pleaded guilty last 
Wednesday to a charge of hindering prosecution. She was sentenced to three 
years' probation, fined $100,000, required to pay an additional $50,000 to the 
Special Olympics and $10,000 in court costs and forced to resign from the U.S. 
Figure Skating Assn. She had been scheduled to begin competition last Sunday in 
the World Championships in Chiba, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillooly pleaded guilty on Feb. 1 to one charge of racketeering. Prosecutors 
said they will recommend a two-year prison sentence and a $100,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding's lawyers responded to the grand jury's report Monday in a statement 
that said: "Tonya Harding had hoped that it would not be necessary to further 
respond to false accusations about her. The decision of the Multnomah County 
district attorney to inaccurately depict Ms. Harding as having been somehow 
involved with Shawn Eckardt and the other defendants indicted today was 
unnecessary and unfortunate. . . . She categorically denies prior knowledge of, 
or participation in, the assault on Nancy Kerrigan." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Associated Press, Stant, the alleged hit man, and Smith, the 
alleged getaway driver, have established a "900 number" on which they discuss 
the case, including Harding's involvement. They also plan to sell police baton 
key rings and T-shirts that read, "Save a skater, club a Gillooly."

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA MEN'S TOURNAMENT; FOR BOEHEIM, IT'S BITTERSWEET 16; 
WEST REGIONAL: SYRACUSE COACH HAS SURVIVED THE HASSLES AND HEADACHES OF TODAY'S 
GAME TO RISE ABOVE THE RIM OF FAN AND MEDIA ATTENTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Here we go again. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the usual setup, the hotel ballroom, the table, the microphone, the 
platform in back for the TV cameras, the chairs for the numbskulls with the 
notebooks. Jim Boeheim has done this so many times, he's afraid he might fall 
asleep and start snoring. 
</P>
<P>
 How long can it be before someone asks the magic question . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Coach, do you intend to go inside to John Wallace?" 
</P>
<P>
 Oooh, he knew it! Of course, the Syracuse coach is going inside to John 
Wallace. Wallace is 6 feet 7, 220 pounds and if he gets the ball on the block, 
the only thing any of those Wisconsin Green Bay student-athletes will be able 
to do is call a friend. Do they expect him to make a public announcement 
beforehand so the other coach can take it away? 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach, is there a problem getting players to take a team like (second-round 
opponent) Wisconsin Green Bay seriously?" 
</P>
<P>
 Oooh, he knew it! They're suggesting the other team is so smart and so well 
coached and, of course, his guys are wild animals and he's just the guy who 
feeds them basketballs. 
</P>
<P>
 Were these guys born yesterday? Anybody can coach nobodies with nothing to 
offer but obedience. If you want to run with the big dogs, you need athletes, 
the kind who think they outgrew fundamentals in fifth grade and give you that 
you-know-I-had-better-offers look if you tell them something. He'd better watch 
it or he'll go off and they'll start that "whining" stuff again. 
</P>
<P>
 What's he doing in this business anyway? 
</P>
<P>
 All it is is a hassle anymore. The kids are younger and nuttier all the time 
and the alumni crazier. The press is on his case and the NCAA counts the number 
of T-shirts he hands out and Dick Vitale screams "GET A T-O, BABEEEE!" at him. 
If it wasn't for the money, fame, love of the game and the sheer thrill of it 
all, he might quit tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 So he explains, politely if dispassionately, that he doesn't predict how games 
will go or comment on other teams. The press guys seem to sag a little. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know," he says later, "I can predict when I go to a press conference -- 
like I wouldn't answer that guy's question so he's going to write something 
nasty." 
</P>
<P>
 He smiles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't that bad today. I can be worse." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Seriously, what is Jim Boeheim doing in a gig like this? 
</P>
<P>
 Away from the microphones, he's nice enough, if ever-combative, the grown-up 
version of the scrawny kid who clawed his way into the Syracuse starting 
backcourt alongside the great Dave Bing in the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 Even rivals think he runs a clean program, as these things go. Of course, he's 
a better coach than he gets credit for. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the old Big East powers such as Georgetown, St. John's and 
Villanova have rusted, but Boeheim is up to 12 20-victory seasons in a row. He 
just nursed the program through a season of NCAA sanctions and is back in the 
Sweet 16 -- the Orangemen will play Missouri on Thursday night at the Sports 
Arena -- with a team that has one senior starter. He hit 350 victories faster 
than any other coach in NCAA history. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not only Boeheim. 
</P>
<P>
 We have entered the era of the embattled coach. The popularity of the NCAA 
tournament has made them all celebrities, and they're not sure they like 
everything about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, schools called their scores into the papers if they played too far from 
home. Now, every game is on TV. In Boeheim's case, the home games are played 
before 25,000 in a domed stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coaching is the same as it's always been, but now it's just, it's like . . . 
this," says Boeheim, indicating the ballroom and the TV cameras at Ogden, Utah, 
during last week's subregional. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I started coaching Syracuse, I could go to North Syracuse and not one 
person knew who I was. We had one game on TV a year, that's it. Now every game 
we play is broadcast. Every . . . game . . . we . . . play." 
</P>
<P>
 Fame, as anyone who's had any can attest to, comes in two sizes: too little 
and too much. 
</P>
<P>
 The modern coach is idolized and scrutinized. He, in turn, complains about 
everything. 
</P>
<P>
 Last weekend, Cal's Todd Bozeman bristled at speculation that his two best 
players would turn pro, even suggesting it was an effort to tear the Bears' 
"family" apart. If Jason Kidd and Lamond Murray leave, Bozeman can check out 
the alternative, competing with lesser players who inspire no speculation. 
</P>
<P>
 The droll Norm Stewart, a revered institution in Missouri, grew so tired of 
references to the Tigers' six first-round losses in eight NCAA appearances, he 
produced a list after his opening-night victory over Navy and read the names of 
all the first-round opponents Missouri had beaten since 1944. 
</P>
<P>
 Oooh, first-round losses, don't get him started. 
</P>
<P>
 "Indiana loses to Richmond," Boeheim says. "Georgia Tech loses to Richmond. 
It's OK. Syracuse loses to Richmond, 'How the hell could they lose?' 
</P>
<P>
 "People think Derrick Coleman was inconsistent. He wasn't. He averaged double 
figures for every game he played at Syracuse but two. It's a myth, Derrick 
Coleman is inconsistent. It's just a myth promulgated about Syracuse that we're 
up and down." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, no one has asked him about first-round losses or Derrick Coleman. 
He's rolling. It just comes out. 
</P>
<P>
 Boeheim claims not to care what people say anymore. He looks like a man who 
might jump over the table at a news conference and choke someone if he cared 
any more. 
</P>
<P>
 In his mind, he has been burned so often, he's considering getting his 
sweatsuit made of asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
 He recounts one of his formative experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 "We once played St. Bonaventure," Boeheim says. "They had three guys averaging 
20 points a game, two guys averaging 10. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'I'll tell you what, they've got three of the greatest scorers I've 
ever seen.' 
</P>
<P>
 "(The) headline in the Rochester paper was, 'Boeheim Says St. Bonaventure 
3-Man Team.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, Jimmy Baron and their center got 22 apiece. They were so fired up, they 
were running by me saying, 'Coach, can we play? Coach, can we play?' 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe I'm too defensive, but I got burned big time. I learned as a young 
coach, you don't say anything about anyone's team. I tell the reporters in 
Syracuse, I'd like to be honest, but you can't be honest." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps if coaches stopped combing the papers for bulletin-board material, 
everyone could go back to freedom of speech. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps if Boeheim relaxed, he'd be better liked, but everyone is who he is, 
and he has learned to live with the consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 He has had 18 years to work on it. For all the talk about a razor's-edge 
existence, major college coaches lead relatively stable careers. 
</P>
<P>
 The coaches of the top 20 teams in this season's final AP poll have an average 
tenure of 11.7 years 
</P>
<P>
 The 16 NBA coaches who took their teams to last spring's playoffs averaged 2.7 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The hassle is a given, but what else would these guys, competition freaks all, 
do? 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to win," Boeheim says. "I think the reason I got to be the competitor 
I am is, my father beat me like a drum, every game we played, all my life. 
</P>
<P>
 "And each game we played, when I beat him, he wouldn't play me any more. But I 
got him in every game. It took a long time. I got him, starting in Ping-Pong, 
pool, golf. Took me a long time to catch him, but I finally caught him." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe if Boeheim pere had taken it easier on little Jimmy, he'd be a mellower 
man today. Maybe he'd be selling insurance by day, grumbling at some coach on 
TV at night. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, things could be worse.

SUBDUED STRAWBERRY; AFTER TWO FORGETTABLE SEASONS, OUTFIELDER TAKING NEW TACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Look at the legs, they say, and you can tell Darryl Strawberry is back. He's 
running the bases with fervor, something he couldn't do before -- not the last 
two seasons, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry says he first felt a little back soreness when he sat out the last 
couple of games of the 1990 season with the New York Mets. But no one thought 
anything about it then. Strawberry checked out fine when the Dodgers gave him a 
physical and was signed to a five-year, $20.25-million contract. He certainly 
showed no signs of a problem during the 1991 season, when he nearly took the 
Dodgers to a division title. 
</P>
<P>
 So did a little soreness later turn into a two-year debacle? Not even 
Strawberry is sure about that. All he knows is that he quit stealing bases 
after 1988, when he stole 29. The season before, he stole 36. And now, to the 
surprise of opposing pitchers, Strawberry is at it again, although the 
basepaths seem to be the only place where he is in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
 Quietly, Strawberry is plodding back. He is slow to speak, slow to walk and 
slow to go. He arrives at the clubhouse early and lingers late into the 
afternoon, often putting in extra running after a game, always signing 
autographs for fans. 
</P>
<P>
 His fans? Yes. At least in Florida, the tide is starting to turn again. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes he returns to Dodgertown in the evening -- only one of a few players 
to do so. If it's a party, he drinks soda. If it's a Bible study group, he 
speaks. If it's a radio show, he shows up on time. He even dresses differently. 
The chartreuse and red plaid number has yet to make an appearance. This is a 
new, subdued Strawberry. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife dresses me now," he says, referring to Charisse, his wife of three 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 He has rewritten his list of friends, getting rid of many of the hangers-on, 
and has added some new names. They include a new baby, a minister, and 
Charisse, whom Strawberry said helped pull him out of despair last September 
when he contemplated suicide. He had virtually lost two seasons, was 
continually booed and jeered and was frequently in some sort of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 But Strawberry hit his low point when he was arrested for allegedly assaulting 
Charisse, of which he was later cleared. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could have killed myself," Strawberry said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But that's an avenue that I had to go through in life because there is so 
much I wanted to be able to know about myself and didn't. And the whole thing 
about not knowing yourself was that because you have always been put on a 
pedestal to be this great individual where everybody expected so much out of 
you, and you couldn't give it to them the way they wanted it. So it wasn't 
appreciated, and you felt like, what's left?  
</P>
<P>
 "But there is a lot left." 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry's surgically repaired back is apparently strong again, and to be 
sure it stays that way, he has made a few changes. To ease the pressure, he has 
changed his swing, minimizing his trademark loop. And he plays left field now, 
because in right field he throws more frequently across his body, putting more 
stress on his back. 
</P>
<P>
 He is hitting the ball again, although his stroke isn't quite back. There are 
signs of the vintage Strawberry, but not enough of them for anyone in the 
Dodger organization to get excited. They, too, are reacting slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took a lot of strength to turn the page and be able to see a different 
sight, but that's what the whole key is, to get to the point of getting the 
strength and live life a different way," Strawberry said. "The most significant 
thing about me today is that I enjoy me for me and not for anybody else, and I 
choose today in my life not to share myself with others that I don't want to 
associate with. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will succeed, and with more peace about it rather than wanting to do it or 
having to do it. Those drives are not there. Now it's like, just do it. Go out 
and be an example of what life can be like when you are successful at a young 
age in your major league career and you deal with trials and tribulations and 
overcome that. It's great to be able to come and look at the whole picture 
differently and know it's yours, without worrying yourself about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Through four weeks of spring training, Strawberry has been this way. His eyes 
reflect new peace, his laugh is back, and his speech is more calculated. He has 
yet to say anything worth a headline, which is a record not found in baseball 
books but in the notebooks of reporters, who in years past only had to wait 
about 10 minutes for Strawberry to say something to lead a story with.  
</P>
<P>
 But for Strawberry, this respite may be short-lived. The past is threatening 
to pull him under again. Strawberry is facing a possible grand jury indictment 
for not reporting all his income from memorabilia shows from his days with the 
Mets. He denies any wrongdoing, but knows he is the target of an investigation 
that includes several players.  
</P>
<P>
 "It won't stop me from playing," Strawberry said. "You can only be stopped if 
you have intentionally done something or committed any type of crime. That is 
the only way a person can be stopped." 
</P>
<P>
 Reports indicate that the IRS will come after Strawberry shortly after the 
season begins, but Strawberry says he and his tax attorney have options if that 
happens. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Dodgers' position? They say it is premature to speculate. For now, 
they are happy with Strawberry.  
</P>
<P>
 "Very happy," said Fred Claire, executive vice president. "Just look at the 
legs -- his running is back. That is something he did not have before. Darryl 
is working hard, and he is also making good contact with the bat. I am very 
pleased with Darryl." 
</P>
<P>
 His teammates have been impressed, too. Mike Piazza praises Strawberry's work 
ethic, saying that he has seen Strawberry run after a game, go in the 
clubhouse, then go out and run some more. "You have to respect that," Piazza 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 But the biggest difference is that reliance on Strawberry to carry the team is 
diminishing. Nobody argues that his left-handed bat is needed in the lineup, 
and the power prospect of the middle of the order -- Piazza, Strawberry and 
Eric Karros -- is promising. But the emergence of Piazza and Karros, the 
possible resurgence of Tim Wallach and the power potential of Raul Mondesi have 
finally removed the load from Strawberry's back. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need him, and with him it will be great, no question," Karros said. "But 
we are not living and dying with Darryl this season, that's the difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry's confidence that this season will go well for him is hard to 
ignore. He clearly has renewed his religious faith, but will not discuss it in 
detail. Three seasons ago, Strawberry proclaimed his newfound faith, and 
shortly afterward, plummeted.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's something that belongs to me, and of course, all the questions have been 
raised this whole spring about the difference in me and all," Strawberry said. 
"And that's fine, but what is important to me is living the way I'm supposed to 
so I can be more gratified inside. That's what brings me inner peace -- to be 
able to accept my faults, to accept the tribulations that I have been through 
and to now walk in the joy of everything else. It's like, 'Hey, I finally got 
it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The pressure on Strawberry is, in some ways, greater than ever this season, 
but he says for the first time in his career, he isn't feeling it. All his 
life, he says, he stepped into the batter's box and wondered when that 
overwhelming pressure would lift. Now, he says, it's gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need to be more of an overachiever than I was before," Strawberry said. 
"But it's not pressure, because I know it's what I am supposed to be doing now 
and I will be better than before. I'm just glad I have a second chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry says he wants to stay in baseball for seven more seasons, which 
would make him 39 when he retires. Then, he says, it will be time to move on.  
</P>
<P>
 "What I have been chosen to do in life has nothing to do with baseball," he 
said. "Baseball is just a blessing and a part of it, but for me there is a 
whole other place that I live in outside of baseball. What it boils down to is 
that everybody is looking at me from the outside, and they don't know what is 
inside of me. Those things I will probably end up keeping to myself until I am 
out of the game of baseball. Then I will reveal those things I have been called 
to do. I don't know for sure what it is, but I know it is a powerful calling. 
That's why I am so accepting to the change and the direction." 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry doesn't think about how, the weekend in December that he married 
Charisse, the Dodgers put him on waivers. He could have been claimed by any 
club for $20,000, with the Dodgers stuck for the remaining $8 million of his 
contract. But there were no takers. 
</P>
<P>
 And Strawberry says he doesn't worry about the boos he will probably get from 
Los Angeles fans when the season starts. He knows how they felt when he made 
the careless "Let it burn" remark during the fires last fall. He is sorry for 
that, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to stay with the Dodgers and bring them some great years," said 
Strawberry, who has two years remaining on his contract. "With my way of 
thinking, I'll do my part, but when you write this article you will have people 
that will still have things to say, but that's OK with me. I'm not here to 
please them. And they are not here to please me. And I hope they understand 
that baseball is just a sport, it's not life. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's affected my life because of expectations, but it won't affect me 
anymore. "

JIM MURRAY: COLT IS GIVING SONG TO HOPE FOR THE DERBY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have to say I was proud of the horseplayers Sunday at Santa Anita. Proud, 
but not surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 An earthquake ripped through the establishment some time between the second 
and third race. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, anywhere else on Earth, when a 5.3 shock ripples through the premises, 
people flee, sirens wail and business activity comes to a standstill and shuts 
down for the day. 
</P>
<P>
 But horseplayers do not deal with earthquakes. After all, they are not part of 
their figures. Horses get mud marks for ability to stand up and run straight in 
the rain. Horses get speed ratings. They are marked for their ability to go a 
route. But who can handicap an earthquake? Not even Caltech, it would appear. 
So what chance does a guy who answers to the name Hot Horse Harry or Big Julie 
or Longshot Louie have?  
</P>
<P>
 So, the meet never missed a beat. The bugler was sounding the call for the 
third race as the temblor hit, but the horseplayers never even broke stride as 
they headed for the windows. They probably wanted to die even. Or ahead. They 
could go to St. Peter and say, "What'd you do that for? I was ahead in the 
meeting!" 
</P>
<P>
 If someone asked a player, "What did you think of the earthquake?" the 
response would probably be, "What race was he in?" Or maybe even, "I thought 
the boy rode him like an ostrich." 
</P>
<P>
 It takes more than an earthquake to distract the horseplayer from the swift 
completion of his appointed rounds. The end of the world would be hard put to 
get his attention. Particularly if he was trying to make a case for some 20-1 
shot.  
</P>
<P>
 Actually, if the horseplayers had let it, the earthquake would have upstaged 
one of the important races of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Felipe is a $200,000 1 1/16-mile stake, and you know all you need to 
know about it when I tell you that three horses who won it went on to win the 
Kentucky Derby. But that's nothing. Four horses who finished second went on to 
win the Derby.  
</P>
<P>
 That gives you seven horses that finished first or second in the San Felipe 
going on to win in Kentucky.  
</P>
<P>
 But that's nothing, either. One horse who won this race, Affirmed, went on to 
win the Triple Crown and four who finished first or second went on to win the 
Preakness. Seven San Felipe winners went on to win the Santa Anita Derby and of 
the horses who finished first, second or third, 21 went on to win the Santa 
Anita Derby.  
</P>
<P>
 If form prevails, then, either Soul Of The Matter or Brocco will win the Santa 
Anita Derby next month and maybe the Kentucky Derby in May.  
</P>
<P>
 Either way, "Hooray for Hollywood" should supplant "My Old Kentucky Home" the 
first Saturday in May. Brocco, who finished second in the San Felipe, is the 
colt owned by Cubby Broccoli, the originator and producer of the James Bond 
movies.  
</P>
<P>
 Soul Of The Matter, who won the San Felipe, is owned by composer Burt 
Bacharach, and if the horse follows the well-worn path from winner of the San 
Felipe to winner of the Santa Anita to winner of the Kentucky Derby, Tinseltown 
will still get top billing.  
</P>
<P>
 Every Hollywood filmmaker knows that the only thing as important to a movie as 
the script is the score. From Irving Berlin to Henry Mancini to Dmitri Tiomkin, 
the soundtracks have been as critical to the success of big-budget films as the 
stars or the horses.  
</P>
<P>
 Bacharach is one of the greats of the film music makers, the troubadours who 
set the scene for a blockbuster movie as surely as the dialogue. Who could come 
away from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" not singing "Raindrops Keep 
Falling on My Head" or from "Alfie" not humming "What's it All About, Alfie?" 
</P>
<P>
 When Bacharach is not at a keyboard or on a stage, he's in a paddock. Or a 
stable. Horse racing, like music making, is an addiction, and Burt, whose 
father was a longtime syndicated newspaper columnist, got hooked early.  
</P>
<P>
 Bacharach's music has earned him three Oscars and so many Grammy Awards, he 
couldn't tote them up immediately. But he has never had a horse as close to a 
gold record as Soul Of The Matter. He did have the filly Heartlight No. 1 -- 
named for a song he collaborated on -- in 1983, and she became filly of the 
year. But Burt had some horses that were losers of the week. In fact, his 
horses once lost 43 races in a row, he acknowledges. But he recently did a 
concert in Louisville, and he hopes Soul Of The Matter can play one there in 
May.  
</P>
<P>
 The San Felipe was not supposed to be a recital for the music man's horse. It 
was supposed to be a match race between Brocco and Valiant Nature, a rematch of 
their hookup in the Hollywood Futurity won by Valiant Nature. The other horses 
in the San Felipe were supposed to be the chorus. The posse. On a sound stage, 
they would have handed them spears. Brocco, after all, had won the Breeders' 
Cup, emblematic of the 2-year-old championship.  
</P>
<P>
 The track was listed as "good," which, in racetrack parlance, means anything 
but. A track gets to be "good" right after it's terrible and it means the 
traction will be barely this side of a banana peel's.  
</P>
<P>
 Soul Of The Matter hit this surface like Nancy Kerrigan and, when Brocco and 
Valiant Nature had run themselves into a clothesline, Bacharach's horse went by 
them in the stretch as if they were waiting for a bus.  
</P>
<P>
 If history tells us anything, Brocco or Soul Of The Matter will win the Santa 
Anita Derby on April 9 and maybe go on to win the Kentucky Derby the first 
Saturday in May.  
</P>
<P>
 Racetrack wisdom says that Brocco and Valiant Nature were "short horses" 
Sunday, lacking sufficient prep races. Neither had run this year, whereas Soul 
Of The Matter had raced twice, finishing third once. 
</P>
<P>
 But Murray's Law -- which is rooted in an unassailable position, ignorance -- 
says, "Good horses win, bad horses excuse." You can get used to losing.  
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood has had a spotty record at Kentucky anyway, where the hardboots used 
to rejoice whenever they could send a "Hollywood horse" home tourist.  
</P>
<P>
 It is not likely Bacharach's horse will show up in dark glasses, gold chains 
and an earring. He is not a "Let's do lunch" type, he's a hard-knocking sort 
who runs on grass, glass -- a "good" track -- in front or behind. As a matter 
of fact, not even an earthquake bothers him. If a 5.3 hits Louisville on May 7, 
he should be an "out" price.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI; SELECTORS PLANTED SEEDS IN EXACTLY THE 
RIGHT SPOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Things to remember as the NCAA tournament pulls into a rest stop along the 
road to the Final Four: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The nine-member NCAA selection committee did itself proud. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time since the tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985, the top 
four seeded teams in each regional advanced to the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 -- We owe an apology to the Big East Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only is the Big East tied for the lead in Sweet 16 teams -- the Big Ten 
also has three -- but it did it the hard way: Not one No. 1 seeding in the 
bunch. Connecticut is a No. 2, Syracuse a No. 4 and amazing Boston College a 
No. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, the Big Ten's Purdue is a No. 1, Michigan a No. 3 and Indiana a 
No. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 -- We owe an apology to the selection committee. 
</P>
<P>
 In what was probably the last at-large pick of the tournament, the committee 
chose Tulsa over Georgia Tech. We howled with indignation. Now we beg 
forgiveness. Georgia Tech lost to Siena in the first round of the National 
Invitation Tournament. No. 12-seeded Tulsa, with a nice geographical assist 
from the committee, is in the Sweet 16. 
</P>
<P>
 -- History repeats itself. 
</P>
<P>
 For the 10th time in the last 11 seasons, the No. 1-ranked team at regular 
season's end -- in this case, North Carolina -- has failed to win the 
championship. The last team to do it? Duke in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 -- What must Washington State be thinking? 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars could have, should have beaten Boston College in the opening round 
of the East Regional. Instead, the Cougars blew a 10-point halftime lead and a 
four-point lead in the last 1 minute 40 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Eagles followed the victory against Washington State with the 
upset of the year over North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Marquette Coach Kevin O'Neill is gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Three things we know for sure about Milwaukee: 
</P>
<P>
 1. The best brats in the land are served at County Stadium (ask for the 
special sauce). 
</P>
<P>
 2. It has the biggest four-sided clock in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 3. O'Neill is counting the moments until he can leave town. The most likely 
relocation destinations: Pittsburgh or Tennessee, followed possibly by Auburn 
and Clemson. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Indiana's Bob Knight never ceases to surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Seasoned Hoosier watchers couldn't remember the last time Knight hugged an 
opposing coach as he did Temple's John Chaney before the start of Sunday's 
second-round game at Landover, Md. Despite having coached a combined 1,525 
games, the men had never coached against each other. Afterward, Knight said: "I 
loved playing against them. I wish we played against them every year." 
</P>
<P>
 Reasons: Knight respects Chaney's honesty, integrity and efforts to help his 
players achieve academic success. He also took it as a personal challenge to 
solve Chaney's beloved matchup zone. 
</P>
<P>
 -- What must Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski be thinking? 
</P>
<P>
 Chaney got the big half-court embrace, but two years ago at the NCAA semifinal 
at Minneapolis, Krzyzewski got nothing more than a quick handshake. Weird, 
since Krzyzewski played for Knight at Army and coached for him at Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kentucky's Rick Pitino is out of the tournament, but his legacy isn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year it was former Pitino assistant Ralph Willard who led Western 
Kentucky to the regional semifinals. This year it is Tulsa's Tubby Smith, 
another former Pitino disciple. 
</P>
<P>
 -- UCLA Coach Jim Harrick is Tulsa's biggest fan. 
</P>
<P>
 The farther Tulsa advances, the less pathetic UCLA's loss becomes. On second 
thought. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 -- Whatever CBS is paying studio analyst Clark Kellogg, it isn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Kellogg, who pulled double shifts during the first two rounds of the 
tournament, logged more appearances than Walter Cronkite at the 1968 Democratic 
Convention. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Indiana's Knight never ceases to surprise, Part II: 
</P>
<P>
 Not only was Knight on his best behavior, relatively speaking, but at times he 
was almost charming. He fawned over Chaney. He actually extended the daily news 
conferences. He kept his anti-media lectures to a minimum. He waxed poetic. 
</P>
<P>
 Knight on the three-point shot: "I have never been a proponent of the 
three-point shot. It's like catching trout with worms. You should be able to 
catch trout with a fly, not worms." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Knight isn't stupid. He might not like the shot, but he understands 
its importance. So guess which team led the nation in three-point percentage? 
The Hoosiers, at 45.3%. 
</P>
<P>
 -- When Pitino speaks, it is best to listen. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Pitino before the tournament began: "The second round is where you're 
going to see the biggest number of upsets." 
</P>
<P>
 Results: No. 9-seeded Boston College defeats No. 1 North Carolina, No. 6 
Marquette defeats No. 3 Kentucky, No. 12 Tulsa beats No. 4 Oklahoma State, No. 
10 Maryland beats No. 2 Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
 -- So much for predictions. 
</P>
<P>
 We figured the weak West Regional would have the most early- round upsets. 
Instead, it remains the only regional in which the top four seeded teams -- 
Missouri, Arizona, Louisville and Syracuse -- advanced to the Sweet 16. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A statistic to keep in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Before dismissing Michigan completely from the Final Four mix, remember that 
under Coach Steve Fisher, the Wolverines are 12-0 in games determined by five 
points or fewer. They also have had lots of practice with close games in the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, three of their five victories were by four points or fewer and four 
of five by seven or fewer. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, three of their five victories were by five points or fewer and four 
of the five by eight or fewer. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1994, their two tournament victories have been by four and five points. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the last three NCAA tournaments, the Wolverines are 4-0 in overtime 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The selection committee owes us an apology. 
</P>
<P>
 Seton Hall. We told you so. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Biggest five surprises. 
</P>
<P>
 1 -- Maryland defeats St. Louis, then Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Terrapins' eight best players are freshmen and sophomores. A season ago, 
they finished 12-16 overall, 2-14 in the Atlantic Coast Conference. Now this? 
</P>
<P>
 2 -- Tulsa defeats UCLA, then Oklahoma State. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the tournament, some of the Bruin players didn't have a clue where 
Tulsa was. Now they do -- in the Sweet 16. 
</P>
<P>
 3 -- Boston College defeats Washington State, then North Carolina. "I don't 
think anybody is giving us a chance to win this game," said guard Malcolm 
Huckaby before the Eagles faced the Tar Heels. 
</P>
<P>
 Not true. We didn't give the Eagles much of a chance, but then again. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Before the tournament, North Carolina had lost three of its previous 10 games 
and struggled in three others. The Tar Heels didn't put away 16th-seeded 
Liberty until 10 minutes left and led only three times -- all in the first half 
and with point guard Derrick Phelps in the lineup -- during its game against 
Boston College. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the Tar Heel perimeter game remained suspect with inconsistent Donald 
Williams, the player rotation tried to keep nine players happy and the burden 
of being No. 1 weighed heavy. 
</P>
<P>
 4 -- Marquette defeats Southwestern Louisiana, then Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
 We are proud to say that the Warriors were one of our sleeper teams. Now if we 
only would have had the guts to take them in the office pool. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 5 -- Wisconsin Green Bay defeats California. 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches around the country weren't so surprised. Green Bay's Dick Bennett 
didn't have a Jason Kidd or a Lamond Murray, but he had a system that works. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Best moment of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The day before Boston College played North Carolina, a news conference was 
held. Seated on the dais was Huckaby, Bill Curley, Howard Eisley and Gerrod 
Abram. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is for all the players," said a reporter. "Were any of you recruited by 
North Carolina?" 
</P>
<P>
 Slowly, almost comically, each player looked at the others. No one said a word 
as all eyes finally settled on Curley, who arrived at Boston College four years 
ago with the closest thing to a national reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 But Curley said nothing. With that, all four players turned to the crowd of 
reporters and shook their heads.

NFL MEETINGS; COACHES REACH THE POINT TO CONSIDER TWO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the NFL passes its two-point conversion rule, probably today, coaches 
everywhere will celebrate like . . . well, like coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of them say it won't matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of them say they will rarely use it. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of them say that after scoring a touchdown to pull within one point in 
the final minute, they aren't even going to think about a two-point conversion 
and a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 These gambling men said they would kick for one point and a tie score, then 
take their chances in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of them said that. But not all. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hell, I might go for the win," said Jimmy Johnson of the Dallas Cowboys. " 
'Course, I never do what other coaches do, anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, the two-point conversion was attempted after only 9% of the 
touchdowns scored in college football. It was successful 43% of the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Listening to the coaches, it will be tried much less in the NFL, even though 
the ball will be spotted on the two-yard line, one yard closer than in college. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking about gaining two yards in front of their goal line -- 
sometimes in this league you have trouble gaining two inches ," said Wayne 
Fontes of the Detroit Lions. "There will not be as many attempts as people 
think." 
</P>
<P>
 Wade Phillips of the Denver Broncos reminded that, like baseball managers, 
football coaches play the percentages. And the percentages of a successful 
two-point conversion are too poor for most coaches.  
</P>
<P>
 "Let's say you have a 99% chance of kicking the extra point and going into 
overtime . . . and less than a 50% chance of making a two-point conversion and 
winning outright," he said. "What do you think we're going to do?" 
</P>
<P>
 The two-point conversion will be most useful, coaches said, to teams that are 
trailing early. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are down by 16 points and you can get it all back with two touchdowns, 
that's what you are going to do," New Orleans' Jim Mora said. "But at the end 
of the game, I'm kicking and going into overtime." 
</P>
<P>
 Mora smiled, adding, "And then I'll be called more conservative than ever." 
</P>
<P>
 The other rule expected to pass today -- moving the kickoff from the 35-yard 
line to the 30 -- has given Buddy Ryan of the Arizona Cardinals an idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to hire me an option quarterback to be my two-point quarterback," 
Ryan said. "When he's not doing that, he can return kicks for me under that 
other new rule. I'll pay the guy $100 and he'll be worth every penny." 
</P>
<P>
 All coaches agreed that no matter what their decision, it will be easier than 
everyone thinks to decide whether to go for two after a touchdown. They plan to 
draw up a chart listing different situations and the proper two-point decisions 
in those situations. 
</P>
<P>
 "You won't even have to think," Ryan said. "It will be written on the bench. 
You walk over, look down, then look up and say, 'Going for two!' It's easy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the worries of Newport Beach inventor Randy May, a rule allowing the 
use of the audibilizer within the 20- or 30-yard line will be proposed today. 
The Competition Committee will try to persuade ownership that May can 
manufacture 13 helmet microphones by Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Minnesota Vikings have had talks with the Houston Oilers about obtaining 
Warren Moon. The other quarterback looking for a trade, Jeff George of the 
Indianapolis Colts, might be traded to the Atlanta Falcons by the end of the 
week.

YOUNGS ADDS INTENSITY TO TEAM; VOLLEYBALL: FORMER UCLA AND EL TORO STAR LEADS 
YOUNG U.S. SQUAD TONIGHT AT BREN CENTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Elaine Youngs doesn't necessarily call it a full-on youth movement, but she's 
certainly part of a team in transition in her first full year with the U.S. 
national volleyball squad. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been a season of opportunity, transition and, at times, frustration, 
for Youngs, a former All-American at UCLA and El Toro High. 
</P>
<P>
 And the same could be said for the U.S. team, which has lost name after name 
from its roster in the last nine months. 
</P>
<P>
 A new version of the national team will meet China at 7 tonight at the Bren 
Center, the final stop on the five-city "Stars and Spikes" tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone is Irvine's Kim Oden, one of the team's leaders the past several years, 
who retired after the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone, at least for the time being, is Oden's sister, Bev, who is studying at 
Stanford but expects to return to the national team once she completes school. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone is former UCLA star Natalie Williams, who's out for the rest of the 
season because of a broken leg. 
</P>
<P>
 And gone are Elaina Oden, who's playing in Italy with Tara Cross-Battle, and 
Caren Kemner, who is playing in Brazil. Elaina Oden and Kemner are expected to 
rejoin the national team. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the veterans are away, the youngsters will play. 
</P>
<P>
 The national team's immediate future is in the hands of newcomers such as 
Youngs, Louisiana State's Angie Miller, UCLA's Samantha Shaver and Jenny Evans, 
Stanford's Amy Cooper and Kristin Klein, and Long Beach State's Alicia Mills. 
Will they carry their level of play to the next level? It's a question yet to 
be answered. 
</P>
<P>
 All the young players are rich in college experience, members of teams that 
won or contended for national championships every year. Yet none has played 
more than 60 international matches. Youngs has played in 48 entering tonight's 
match. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see the 1996 Olympic team as a mix of younger players and the veterans," 
Youngs said. "We have a lot of young players right now, players who need 
experience. Natalie is injured but still in the picture, and Bev and myself. We 
have a lot of good, young players on this team." 
</P>
<P>
 But so far, the young U.S. team has struggled against a Chinese team that 
features four players with Olympic experience -- outside hitter Sun Yue, middle 
blockers Lai Yawen, Su Liqun and Wang Yi. 
</P>
<P>
 China won the first three matches on the tour, including a sweep last Friday 
at San Jose. China outscored the Americans, 45-20, in the match. 
</P>
<P>
 But Youngs, a 6-foot outside hitter, has been one of the few bright spots 
during the recent stretch, averaging a team-high 18 kills in the three losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "If everyone had the aggressiveness of Elaine," U.S. Coach Terry Liskevych 
said, "we would be much better off. She brings something to the battle that a 
lot of people don't. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's an intense competitor, and when you put that with her athleticism, you 
have a great package." 
</P>
<P>
 You want intense? When Youngs played at El Toro from 1985-88, an opponent once 
said she felt as if "Elaine, at any moment, is going to turn around and punch 
me in the face." 
</P>
<P>
 You want competitive? Her shouting was nearly legendary during matches on the 
Bud Light four-player beach tour last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Liskevych looks for that kind of intensity in his athletes. Youngs reminds him 
somewhat of Kemner, the team's fiery six-time MVP. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing I've noticed about Elaine is that she's very hard on herself when 
she's not playing at her highest level," Liskevych said. "It's in her actions 
on and off the court. When she's not successful, if she hits into the block or 
serves into the net, you can see the disappointment on her face. 
</P>
<P>
 "She needs to just forget it and move on to the next play. That's the only 
thing you can control in that situation -- the next play." 
</P>
<P>
 Youngs' aggressiveness first caught Liskevych's eye in 1989, when she trained 
temporarily with the national team. She moved on to UCLA, where she was named 
an All-American three times, played on two NCAA championship teams and was 
tournament MVP in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 She played on two medal-winning teams at the World University Games, earning 
the bronze in 1991 at Sheffield, England, and the silver at Buffalo, N.Y., last 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Youngs had joined the national team in April, just before departing for the 
World University Games. She trained with the national team for about a week, 
then started a series of matches in a tournament in Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never actually had a tryout," Youngs said. "I was still enrolled at UCLA 
when I practiced with the team for a few days, then went to Switzerland. I 
guess that was my tryout." 
</P>
<P>
 Nine months later, Youngs admits she still is adjusting to the travel demands 
and high level of competition the national team plays night after night. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough at this level, because you're playing against great teams and 
great players all the time," she said. "In college, you played three or four 
really tough matches a year. But at this level, it's much more physical, much 
tougher. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'm ready for it. I've been waiting for this for a long, long time."

DUCKS TRADE KASATONOV, ACQUIRE PROSPECT AND PICK 
</P>

 Some other teams made moves for the playoff run Monday before the NHL's 
trading deadline, but the Mighty Ducks made a deal for the future, trading 
veteran defenseman Alexei Kasatonov -- their oldest and highest-paid player -- 
to the St. Louis Blues for a prospect and a draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
 Kasatonov was the Ducks' first All-Star, but at 34 is nearing the end of his 
career and has a year left on a contract paying him $650,000 this season.He has 
sat out the last 10 games recovering from a broken foot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a long hockey life, so I'm not surprised (to be traded)," Kasatonov 
said. "But I am surprised because I have an injury. I'm not ready to play. It's 
still sore. Maybe after two games." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks got left wing Maxim Bets, 20, a second-round draft pick last June, 
and St. Louis' sixth-round pick in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Bets, six feet and 200 pounds, is from Chelyabinsk in the former Soviet Union. 
He is playing junior hockey with Spokane of the Western Hockey League this 
season, and has 116 points, including 46 goals, in 63 games. He might play for 
the Ducks this season, but will finish with his junior team first. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is the type of player who will provide us with additional offense and 
creativity," Duck General Manager Jack Ferreira said. "Bets is someone who we 
project to play for the Mighty Ducks in the next year or two."

OILERS WILL KEEP DONNALLEY FROM RAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Houston Oilers will match the Rams' four-year, $4-million offer sheet for 
offensive tackle Kevin Donnalley. 
</P>
<P>
 At the NFL owners meetings Monday in Orlando an Oiler official told Ram 
executive vice president John Shaw that Houston has decided to match the Rams' 
offer for Donnalley and will make an announcement before Thursday's deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 The Houston Chronicle, quoting unnamed Oiler sources, will report today that 
the team decided to keep Donnalley because of the retirement of guard Mike 
Munchak. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's interesting," said Jay Zygmunt, Ram senior vice president, when 
advised of the Oilers' decision. "Obviously, we were hoping to have a shot at 
him. We knew there was a chance of them matching it, but we thought it was 
better than 50-50 that they wouldn't."

DUCKS TRADE KASATONOV, ACQUIRE PROSPECT AND PICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While other teams made moves for the playoff run before the NHL trading 
deadline Monday, the Mighty Ducks made a deal for the future, trading 
defenseman Alexei Kasatonov -- their oldest and highest-paid player -- to the 
St. Louis Blues for a prospect and a draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
 Kasatonov was the Ducks' first All-Star, and he won two Olympic gold medals 
with the Soviet national team. But at 34, he is in the waning years of his 
career and he has another year left on a contract that will pay him $650,000 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Kasatonov also had missed the last 11 games recovering from a broken right 
foot since being hit by a shot Feb. 20 -- coincidentally against St. Louis, his 
new team. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's life, it's hockey," Kasatonov said. "I have a long hockey life, so I'm 
not surprised (to be traded). But I am surprised because I have an injury. I'm 
not ready to play. It's still sore. Maybe after two games." 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis General Manager Ron Caron said he was aware of the injury but said 
Kasatonov "has been cleared to play," and he expects him to be among the Blues' 
top four defensemen. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the Ducks -- who already had the lowest payroll in the NHL -- might 
appear to be making room to sign draft pick Paul Kariya, General Manager Jack 
Ferreira said the Kasatonov deal had "nothing to do" with the stalled 
negotiations with Kariya. The sides remain millions apart on a multiyear deal. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange for Kasatonov, the Ducks acquired left wing Maxim Bets, 20, who 
was a second-round draft pick last June, and St. Louis' sixth-round pick in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Bets, who is from Chelyabinsk in the former Soviet Union, was drafted by the 
Blues in the second round last June with the 37th pick overall. The 6-foot, 
200-pound forward is playing junior hockey with Spokane of the Western Hockey 
League this season, and has 46 goals and 116 points in 63 games this season. He 
will finish the season with his junior team, but after that he could join minor 
league affiliate San Diego or possibly the Ducks if he signs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maxim Bets in an outstanding young player who we rated as one of the top 25 
prospects in last year's draft," Ferreira said. "He is the type of player who 
will provide us with additional offense and creativity. Bets is someone who we 
project to play for the Mighty Ducks in the next year or two." 
</P>
<P>
 Though the Ducks are only five points out of the eighth and final Western 
Conference playoff spot with 12 games remaining in their first season, they did 
not make any moves Monday to strengthen this year's team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything we tried to do that was to help us for the playoff drive involved 
(giving up) a core player," Ferreira said. "We weren't going to make those 
moves." 
</P>
<P>
 Kasatonov, who had four goals and 18 assists in 55 games with the Ducks, is 
expected to join St. Louis today.

RELATIONSHIPS: CAR-POOL ETIQUETTE; THE INCENTIVES ARE GREAT: MAKING FRIENDS, 
BEATING TRAFFIC, SAVING ON EXPENSES. BUT FLEXIBILITY IS A MUST. SACRIFICES ARE 
REQUIRED, AGREE ORANGE COUNTY COMMUTERS, AND FINDING THE RIGHT PARTNER CAN SEEM 
LIKE A COURTSHIP.

 Not long ago, Dianna Wong contracted a horrendous case of the flu. It didn't 
take her long to figure out who she got it from -- Carolyn Stiitz, her car-pool 
partner. "She pointed out that she was sick the week before, and I realized 
that, well, that's one of the hazards of being part of a car-pool." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite sharing illnesses and differences over radio stations, temperature 
controls and when to leave work, Wong and Stiitz make a good car-pool couple. 
They alternate driving each week and, with the help of the car-pool lane on the 
San Diego Freeway, are able to go from their homes in Westminster to the 
offices of Allergan Inc. in Irvine in 20 minutes -- 25 minutes less than if 
they drove solo. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've become very good friends since we started car-pooling three years ago," 
says Stiitz, who works in Allergan's bids and contracts department. "That's 
helped us. We're not shy with each other. If we're in her car and I don't like 
the music, I just reach over and change it myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Wong, a sample coordinator: "Carolyn's a little more rock 'n' roll, but 
that's usually OK with me. We spend our time talking anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Wong nor Stiitz thinks about going back to driving alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two people make the ideal car-pool," says Sally Rogers, an executive 
secretary from Mission Viejo who has been a part of 38 car-pools during the 
past 21 years. "It's easier to deal with just one other person. When you're 
dealing with three different personalities and schedules, it can be 
frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 Having started car-pooling at a time when "ride-sharing" meant "hitchhiking," 
Rogers says she has been a part of some excellent car-pools and some not so 
good ones. Because of a change in her work schedule, she recently started 
driving solo to her office in the South Coast Metro area and is enjoying the 
break from commuting with others. 
</P>
<P>
 "The worst kind of person to drive with is the type-A personality," she says. 
"Everyone's got to have some flexibility. One person will often want to 
dominate the group and decide when to leave and all that. The group has to 
realize that everyone's in the same boat. You're all doing this to beat 
traffic, save on gasoline expenses, and there are sacrifices you make as part 
of a car-pool." 
</P>
<P>
 Finding the right car-pool can seem like a courtship. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took about six months before I started feeling comfortable and accepted," 
says Bob Muir, a senior public affairs representative with the Metropolitan 
Water District, who goes from his home in Fullerton to a pickup site in La 
Habra each morning for the daily van-pool ride to Los Angeles. 'Some of these 
people had been driving to work together for more than 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think everyone needs to be friends in a car-pool," Rogers says. "You 
just have to be considerate of others." 
</P>
<P>
 Probably the biggest ride-sharing headache is getting everyone in the group to 
be punctual. "It can be real annoying when you have to wait for someone. It can 
be very cutthroat; people get left behind if they're not on time," says Muir, 
who tries to get to the pickup spot at least 15 minutes early.  
</P>
<P>
 "In a car-pool, you can be lynched if you're late," Rogers agrees. "If it 
looks like you're going to be held up a bit, let the others in your group know 
beforehand. They may not like waiting an extra 15 minutes, but they'll 
appreciate you for letting them know. And make sure you set your alarm each 
morning so that you're not in a rush." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Joe Cover, a principal analyst who rides in the same van-pool as Muir: 
"The key is to set a time limit. Everyone knows what time the van leaves, and 
if you're not there, it's gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Each car-pool seems to develop its etiquette over time. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some car-pools, everyone's real talkative in the morning and quiet in the 
afternoon. Others have been the opposite, and some have been entirely quiet or 
very talkative," Rogers says. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a morning van-pool, there seems to be an unspoken rule," Muir says. "No 
one turns the interior lights on. A lot of riders like to catch up on the sleep 
they're losing in the morning, and the people who want to read are out of luck. 
It's the same with the radio; don't turn on the rear speakers." 
</P>
<P>
 Music choices tend to be made by the driver. "It's my car; I like classical 
music, that's what's on the radio," says Celia Amezcua of Huntington Beach, a 
graphics designer for Pacific Mutual Insurance in Newport Beach, who drives to 
and from work each day with two friends. "It's soothing; it gets us ready for 
the day." 
</P>
<P>
 When musical tastes collide, there's always room for compromise. "I was in a 
car-pool with a woman once who loved rap music, which the other three didn't 
like," says Rogers. "The days she drove, we just brought Walkmans, that way 
everyone got to listen to whatever they wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Determining the temperature and other environmental factors generally isn't so 
easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'm burning up because she has the heat on too high, I'll tell her or I'll 
turn it down myself," says Stiitz, who often drives Wong home with the T-tops 
off of her Toyota MR2. "I might have them off in the afternoon, and I don't 
want to take the time to put them back on before we go home. Sometimes I think 
she wishes I'd put the tops back on because it can be chilly in the evening, 
but it's a short ride." 
</P>
<P>
 In a van-pool, deciding on temperature can be more complicated. "You've got 15 
people who like 15 different temperatures," Muir says. "I prefer sitting in the 
back of the van, but that's where you get the least amount of air flow, which 
can be uncomfortable in the summer." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Rogers: "I was once in a pool with a man who wore wool sweaters in July. 
He liked having the heat on every morning and only opened the windows a crack 
on the way home. It got so bad that one day the three of us crowded around his 
desk, told him how we felt and gave him a choice -- make your car comfortable 
for everyone or leave the car-pool. He left us and found someone else who 
wanted to share a warm, stuffy car. 
</P>
<P>
 "That taught me that the best way to handle a situation with another 
car-pooler is to do it early and as a group," Rogers says. "And don't be mean 
about it; just tell him or her how all of you feel." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Because most car-pools are made up of employees from the same company, much 
time is spent on the road gossiping over the latest office news. "In a large 
organization like ours, it's helpful," Cover says. "We're all from different 
departments, and it's interesting to hear about what's going on in other 
sections." 
</P>
<P>
 When drive-time chatter turns obnoxious, however, confronting the person may 
not work. "When you have someone who expresses very deep-seated opinions on 
sensitive topics such as politics or religion, and they want to dominate the 
conversation each day, it's hard to get them to keep quiet," says Nancy Haleen, 
a marriage, family and child counselor in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "In that case, the stress the others feel by having that person as part of 
their group outweighs the advantages of car-pooling. I've heard of car-pools 
breaking up over one of the riders," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1980, I was riding to work every day with two women who were volunteers 
for Reagan's presidential campaign," Rogers says. "They would talk the entire 
drive about politics until the morning I showed up with my Jimmy Carter button. 
That shut them up, and soon they stopped riding with me. But that was OK; I was 
getting tired of their perfume."

HEAD-BANGING CAN CAUSE WHIPLASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE KNOWLTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Parents take note: When your child comes back from that junior high school 
dance complaining of neck pain, there may be a simple explanation for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston University School of Medicine neurologist Dr. Marilyn Kassirer found 
that head-banging -- the nationwide dance fad involving jerking the head back 
and forth to a hard-rock beat -- can cause whiplash that lasts about three 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 Her recent study was prompted by an eighth-grade neighbor who said her neck 
hurt. Discovering that the teen-ager had been to a seven-hour dance marathon, 
Kassirer surveyed 36 other students from the same event. 
</P>
<P>
 About half the dancers had engaged in head-banging. Of those, 82% of the girls 
and 16% of the boys suffered "aching and twinging" pains in their necks. Of 
non-headbangers, only 26% of girls and no boys suffered pain. 
</P>
<P>
 Why more pain in girls? 
</P>
<P>
 "They have longer hair," says Kassirer, who published her findings in the 
Clinical Journal of Pain. "They try to get it moving in a flow pattern, 
hyper-flexing and rotating their necks, pushing their heads to the limit and 
beyond. It's the equivalent of having an auto accident." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the resulting pain is generally of limited duration, children with 
spine abnormalities may be at risk for more serious injury. LESLIE KNOWLTON

AN ARMY OF SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ARKUSH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They call themselves an army, which makes good sense. Every single one of them 
has bombed before. 
</P>
<P>
 But not tonight, never on the second Tuesday of each month. For three hours, 
in the narrow back room of L'Express restaurant in Sherman Oaks, these men -- 
many of whom hardly knew each other until one of their own died of lung cancer 
two years ago -- swap stories, tell jokes and drop names. 
</P>
<P>
 Are all the jokes funny? Probably not. Does it matter? Definitely not. 
</P>
<P>
 "We come here to recapture our youth," says stand-up veteran Allan Kent. 
</P>
<P>
 Yarmy's Army could pass as an unofficial Comedy Hall of Fame: Don Knotts, Don 
Adams, Harvey Korman, Tim Conway, Shelley Berman, Gary Owens, Pat McCormick, 
Howie Morris. Others, if less recognizable, have still done well on television 
and stage. It's a requirement. You make it here because you've made it out 
there, where it's cold and callous to comics and actors. 
</P>
<P>
 But here, it's safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get rejected every day," says Ronnie Schell, a founding member. "This is 
like therapy." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is how it all began -- as therapy for Dick Yarmy, Adams' younger 
brother, who became ill with cancer in 1991 and chose to go out laughing. 
Yarmy, an actor, wanted to crack up with the funniest people he knew, his 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
 So a handful got together at Luna Rossa restaurant in Sherman Oaks one 
Tuesday, then the next and it became ritual. Soon, a couple dozen met each 
week. The group became so rowdy that other patrons complained to management. 
The army moved to L'Express to take over its own room. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dick looked so much forward to those evenings," Adams recalls. "It probably 
did more for him than anything in his whole life." 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing was immune from their barbs, not even Yarmy's deteriorating health, 
and he happily went along with it. Once he brought his X-rays for a gag. 
</P>
<P>
 He came every week, looking like death, leaving with life. 
</P>
<P>
 His struggle ended in May, 1992. The gang got together at Theatre West in 
Hollywood for his memorial service, which, of course, turned into a comedy 
wake. It was supposed to be the army's final performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "(But) we realized we could not let go," Korman recalls. "We had to keep 
meeting. It was no longer just for Dick." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now, almost two years later, comedians keep enlisting. Nobody keeps official 
count, but several dozen claim membership, some of whom barely knew the group's 
namesake. 
</P>
<P>
 A ceremonial empty chair is always kept for Yarmy at the now-monthly 
gatherings. At the March meeting, about 35 men showed up. (There is no 
restriction against women, but there certainly isn't an aggressive campaign to 
recruit them, either.) 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after 6 p.m., the casually dressed troops begin their stand-up 
routines without introductions. A moment's hesitation, and your chance for the 
floor may be gone; shouters control the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like the Indianapolis Speedway," says veteran actor Ron Carey, attending 
for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Schell: "You got to get in and get out. That's what it's about." 
</P>
<P>
 That and trying new material. McCormick, who made frequent appearances on and 
wrote for the "Tonight Show" in the Johnny Carson days, arrives with a series 
of one-liners he's working on for a club date in Minnesota. Earlier, he had 
asked friends to supply the setups. The army roars. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, most of the jokes here are blue and can't be published. That's 
also part of the point -- it's like that in the army. This is not a politically 
correct room; there are no censors. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can do the silliest thing and there's no judgment," says 
comedian-director Howard Storm, a founding member. 
</P>
<P>
 No judgment, perhaps, but plenty of competition. That is, after all, the 
nature of the business. Some prepare stories and original one-liners in 
advance; others take a safer route, relying on jokes they heard get big laughs 
somewhere else. (Usually, though, they make sure to credit the joke's most 
recent source.) 
</P>
<P>
 It can be very intimidating. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been coming for two years," says actor Jim Beaver, Adams' son-in-law, 
"and I haven't told a joke. I sit in the car and think of stuff, but by the 
time I'm ready, they've already been told." 
</P>
<P>
 Others -- such as Korman, Knotts and Dick Van Patten -- rarely jump into the 
skirmishes. "I respect these guys so much," Van Patten says, "and I don't feel 
like I'm on their level." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Adams isn't so reserved. Throughout the evening, Schell hounds a reluctant 
Adams to "tell the Johnny Carson story." Finally, after mounting army pressure, 
Adams relents. 
</P>
<P>
 While in the coach section of a flight to Europe during the early 1970s, Adams 
says he received a note from Carson, who was in first class: "Dear Don, I heard 
things were bad, but I didn't know they were this bad." 
</P>
<P>
 A flight attendant told a humiliated Adams that an immediate upgrade would be 
expensive, but he replied, "I don't care if it's $1 million." Once in his new 
first-class seat, Adams wrote a note back to Carson, explaining that he always 
sat in coach during takeoffs because most fatalities struck first-class 
passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 "True story," Adams insists. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, however, Agent 86 is the victim. After his rise to fame in the 
1960s as Maxwell Smart, little has been heard from him. "Now," jokes veteran 
comic actor Tom Poston, "was it you or your brother who died?" 
</P>
<P>
 The army, including Adams, loves it. 
</P>
<P>
 But these soldiers are far from finished. While some have reached their 60s 
and 70s and don't work that often, others are still searching for their next 
tour of duty and occasionally find out about new career possibilities from 
their colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, that's not their prime motivation. They need companionship as much as 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were supposedly friends before," Storm says, "but there wasn't any depth. 
Now this group takes care of each other. It's a love affair."

A CLEAN START; INSTEAD OF PUNISHING PREGNANT ADDICTS, A PROGRAM AIMS TO PREPARE 
WOMEN FOR MOTHERHOOD. THE GOAL? HEALTHY LIVES FOR THEMSELVES AS WELL AS THEIR 
BABIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Four months pregnant and dangerously underweight, Kathryn Chinn called her 
husband from a Newport Beach motel and left a message on the answering machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to worry, she told him, deep into her latest speed binge. She had been 
away the last few days partying with a couple who had hired her as their 
masseuse. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kenneth Chinn was worried about the welfare of his wife and unborn child, 
so he called Orange County child-abuse authorities for help. Social worker 
Raquel Amezcua went looking for Chinn at the motel on that same September day. 
But by the time she arrived, the 23-year-old Fountain Valley woman was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Undaunted, Amezcua tracked the young woman from run-down apartment buildings 
to garages to city parks. Eventually, her doggedness paid off. Three weeks 
later, Chinn signed up for a little-known federal intervention program called 
the Abandoned Infants Assistance Project and began to turn her life around. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 15, she gave birth to a healthy 6-pound, 15 1/2-ounce daughter named 
Koralynn. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of punishing pregnant addicts for past misdeeds, the program tries to 
prepare them for the rigors of motherhood in the hope that they will be less 
likely to abuse or abandon their children once they give birth. 
</P>
<P>
 Known as Advance Outreach, the program is administered by the Orange County 
Social Services Agency. It also serves a small number of pregnant HIV-positive 
women. 
</P>
<P>
 "We reach out to the women and pursue them, and when we see a spark of a 
desire to do life differently, we are there to fan that flame and make it 
stronger," says Mary Harris, project director. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar programs operate in Tarzana, West Covina and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the time, the social workers help women meet the most basic of needs, 
directing them through the bureaucracy toward food, shelter and clothing. 
During the women's pregnancies and after delivery, counselors teach parenting 
skills, such as when to take newborns for medical checkups. 
</P>
<P>
 When gentle persuasion fails, social workers use a more forceful approach. 
Some might call it coercion, but Kathryn Chinn says it has worked for her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew (Amezcua) was there to take my kid away if I didn't stay off drugs," 
Chinn says. "But then she made me realize I really did want to stay clean for 
me -- not for no kid, not for no husband, not for nobody." 
</P>
<P>
 By helping women get off drugs, intervention programs give children a shot at 
healthy childhoods. They are spared the traumatic experience of bouncing 
between foster homes or spending parts of their childhoods in institutions -- a 
sometimes brutal existence that has been linked to criminal and other 
antisocial behavior later in life. 
</P>
<P>
 From a public policy standpoint, the $450,000 Orange County program and its 
counterparts around the nation save millions in tax money that otherwise would 
be spent on long-term care for drug-addicted babies, supporters say. 
</P>
<P>
 Women are referred by law enforcement authorities, relatives, psychiatrists 
and hospitals; even bartenders have been known to call when they notice a 
pregnant woman having drink after drink. 
</P>
<P>
 To overcome their clients' notions of them as uncaring home wreckers, Amezcua 
and other counselors act as mothers, girlfriends and therapists rolled into 
one. They carry beepers that put them just a phone call away when a woman is 
going through an emotional crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 They coax the women to doctors' offices for prenatal and postnatal care -- 
sometimes driving them to their appointments and sitting in the examining room 
to reassure them. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinn says she was introduced to marijuana in the ninth grade. She lost 
control later that year, she says, when she began experimenting with "crank" -- 
a derivative of methamphetamine. Chinn's relationship with her mother and 
stepfather grew increasingly stormy. She dropped out of school, ran away from 
home and wound up in foster care. 
</P>
<P>
 At 19, she met her husband, who acknowledges that he was drinking heavily at 
the time. They married five months later, and in 1991, she got pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Kathryn Chinn stopped taking speed during her first pregnancy, she 
says, she continued to smoke marijuana. Her husband tried in vain to discourage 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would always make jokes about (the baby) coming out with a pot leaf on his 
thumb or that something would be wrong with him," Chinn says. "But I didn't 
even think about pot causing birth defects." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after the birth of her son, Kory, in January, 1992, Chinn says, she 
started taking speed again. Things came to a head about a year later, when she 
moved out, leaving her husband with Kory and $200. The child now lives with 
Kathryn Chinn's parents, who have legal custody. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth Chinn -- who had become a Jehovah's Witness, stopped drinking and 
landed a job as a waiter at an upscale restaurant -- began calling every 
government agency he could think of to get help for his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, someone at the county health department referred him to Amezcua. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were no visible signs of pregnancy and she was well into her fourth 
month," Amezcua recalls, describing her first meeting with Kathryn Chinn. "She 
was living behind a Bank of America building." 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks later, suffering from a severe kidney infection, Chinn went to a 
hospital and asked for something to eat. About three weeks after that later, 
she made an appointment to see Amezcua. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to helping Chinn with her health and social service needs, Amezcua 
began to advise the couple about their marital problems. "Raquel has been like 
a counselor between us and made us realize that we can be friends," Chinn says. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been just more than three months since she took her last hit of speed, 
Chinn says. So far, says the pediatrician who delivered Koralynn, the baby 
appears healthy. But the Chinns know that only time will tell. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the National Assn. for Perinatal Research and Education, last 
year about 375,000 newborns were exposed to illegal drugs in the womb -- more 
than one-fourth of them in California. Many are born addicts and suffer from 
withdrawal, low birth weight, stunted growth, respiratory difficulties and 
congenital defects. 
</P>
<P>
 According to some estimates, medical treatment, foster care and special 
education for one of these children can average $400,000 before the age of 18. 
In contrast, an outpatient treatment program for a pregnant woman on drugs runs 
about $11,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But the women are difficult to reach. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the women in the Orange County program are addicted to hard-core drugs 
such as heroin and cocaine, and have criminal records dating to their early 
teens. Quite a few have other children whom the courts ordered into foster care 
because of neglect or abuse. Some are HIV positive. And a lot of the women are 
also homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Program officials are still in touch with just more than half of the 107 women 
they oversaw in 1991, the first year of the program. They have lost contact 
with the others. 
</P>
<P>
 In 67% of the cases that social workers are still monitoring, the child is 
living with the mother, says Harris, the program director. 
</P>
<P>
 "We aim for the hardest cases," she says. "These are not women pregnant with 
their first child who are getting involved with drugs for the first time. We 
get a lot of older women who have finally gotten tired of this lifestyle and 
realize they want to change." 
</P>
<P>
 Some women's periodic relapses into drug use complicate the attempt to 
determine how successful the program has been. Critics dispute the notion that 
teaching women parenting skills will alter the complex web of social ills that 
leads to child abandonment. Even program supporters believe that the federal 
government should be doing more to monitor the programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the last few years, there's been more and more money, but my concern is 
that a lot of it is being thrown out without a lot of specific questions being 
answered," says Dr. Ira Chasnoff, a Chicago physician who has studied the 
effects of drugs on newborns. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing is, nobody has really decided what effectiveness means. Does it 
mean the mother is drug-free and she is keeping the baby? Does it mean she does 
not abuse the child? Or does it mean that the child has normal, long-term 
development?" he asks. But those questions aren't easy to answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the programs are voluntary, none of the women undergo drug testing as 
they do in court-ordered drug-treatment programs. Social workers can only hope 
the women are telling the truth when they insist that they are drug-free. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathryn Chinn considers herself one of the success stories. But despite her 
determination to stay clean, temptation lurks around every corner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every two or three weeks, it'll never fail, I'll run into someone from my 
past and (Kenneth) gets a little edgy. He thinks that maybe they'll say the 
right thing to get me back out there," she says. "But the first thing I say to 
them is, 'I'm clean and sober.' "

HOORAY FOR CHOC; HOSPITAL GUILDS TAKE A CUE FROM HOLLYWOOD FOR THEIR FASHION 
SHOW FUND-RAISER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN BOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marilyn Monroe and a dozen other celluloid heroes came to life at "Lights! 
Camera! Action!," the 32nd annual Children's Hospital of Orange County 
All-Guilds Fashion Show. 
</P>
<P>
 Celebrity look-alikes joined about 2,500 guests for a salute to the silver 
screen at the guilds' fashion show luncheons Thursday and Friday and a grand 
finale dinner Friday night at the Anaheim Marriott. The $55-per-person 
luncheons and $100-per-person finale netted about $175,000 for CHOC's 
Outpatient Clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 That's Hollywood 
</P>
<P>
 With its hundreds of floating Mylar stars, the ballroom became a miniature 
Tinseltown. Celebrity teddy bears, including "Bearry Davis" and "Joan Pawford," 
sat in directors chairs atop the tables. 
</P>
<P>
 Joan Rivers, a.k.a. Dee Dee Hanson, greeted everyone at the door and gushed 
over guests' attire -- a favorite topic of the famous clothes horse. There was 
Monroe (Stephanie Anderson) waving and batting her eyelashes in a copy of the 
white pleated dress Monroe wore in "The Seven-Year Itch." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a riot" playing Marilyn, Anderson said. "People enjoy it. For them, it's 
the only way to experience Marilyn." 
</P>
<P>
 On stage, the famous Hollywood sign was reproduced in towering white letters 
bathed in multicolored lights. The fashion show, produced and directed by 
Carlton Burnett (dubbed the Ziegfeld of fashion shows), had all the elements of 
a Hollywood musical: a parade of guest "stars" including an uncanny Dolly 
Parton (Charlene Rose), can-can girls, cute kids, keystone cops and hoofers. 
</P>
<P>
 Between musical numbers, models walked the 120-foot runway wearing spring 
fashions from I. Magnin and designs by Lourdes Chaves of Travilla. Travilla, 
named after the late costume designer Bill Travilla, who created many outfits 
for Monroe, was a natural choice for a Hollywood-themed show. The company 
pulled historical costumes from its Travilla Museum so that models could show 
off a gold lame halter gown and pink strapless number Monroe wore in "Diamonds 
Are a Girl's Best Friend" as well as other Travilla originals. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the Scenes 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Davis, the guilds' general chairwoman, chose the Hollywood theme because 
she is a longtime movie buff. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the movies. I grew up in Thousand Oaks and went to school with Kurt 
Russell and Kelly McGillis. I enjoy being around stars," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fashion show is a massive undertaking for the chairwoman and guild 
volunteers. The show has grown so large it must be repeated three times just to 
accommodate the huge audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually we seat them by longevity (in the guilds) and by how much they've 
given to CHOC," said Anne Neish, who had the difficult job of figuring out 
where to seat the 1,000 who attended each luncheon and the 420 who showed up 
for the grand finale. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was up until 1:30 a.m. last night putting names into the computer," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several organizers cited the support of the 1,800 guild members for the great 
turnout. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all enthusiastic about this charity. We're all looking for something in 
our lives we can feel good about," said Helen Wardner, director of support 
groups at CHOC in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1963 the guilds have raised $2.2 million for CHOC, with most of the 
proceeds going to the hospital's Outpatient Clinic, which treats all children 
regardless of their families' financial situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those attending the shows: Thomas Penn Jones, president and CEO of CHOC; 
Kimberly Ely, CHOC executive vice president; Sue Krause, grand finale 
co-chairwoman; David Paulson, emcee; Gracie Beal, 5-year-old CHOC patient; Don 
and Marilyn Bailey, Sylvia Burnett, Pat Calderone, Tina Hughes, Jean Hamann, 
Nora and Charles Hester, Carol Ojers, Frances Stawicki, Susan Carter, Sharron 
Ribacchi, Lula Hatfield, Fran Paulson, Andrea Northcote, Beverly Singer and 
Janet Nagurski. KATHRYN BOLD

YOUR BODY / KATHLEEN DOHENY: PROGRAM EASES JITTERS OVER CHILD'S SURGERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As stresses go, it's a big one for most parents: watching as your child is 
wheeled off to the operating room. 
</P>
<P>
 To ease the ordeal, some hospitals now allow parents to stay with their 
children while general anesthesia is administered, thus eliminating separation 
anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there are no statistics on the number of hospitals with such a 
policy, it is "a growing trend," says a spokesman for the National Assn. of 
Children's Hospitals and Related Institutions in Virginia.  
</P>
<P>
 If the program isn't in place at your hospital, there are other measures 
parents can take to ease pre-surgery jitters. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Debate: Physicians remain sharply divided about the practice, which has 
been in place at some major children's hospitals for years. Advocates say it 
reduces psychological stress all-around. Critics worry that parents, unfamiliar 
with the operating room environment, will hinder good medical care, make their 
children more anxious or even faint. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Program: Those fears have proved mostly groundless, says Dr. Robert 
Kalayjian, an anesthesiologist at Long Beach Memorial Medical Center, where a 
program allowing parents to accompany their children to the operating room 
began about three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's presented as an option by surgeons who encourage it," Kalayjian says. 
"Some parents now request it. But it's controversial. Not all our surgeons 
agree to participate." 
</P>
<P>
 The program is especially helpful, he finds, for children 2 to 6 years old, 
when separation anxiety tends to be greatest. But there are exceptions, and he 
has even allowed parents of 16- and 17-year-olds to participate. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Caveats: It's important that parents be briefed. Kalayjian gives parents a 
verbal description and tells them that the entire stay in the operating room 
will probably be less than five minutes. He lets them know that their children 
may "go limp" very quickly -- a normal effect of anesthesia administration that 
might alarm the uninformed. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is for non-emergency surgeries such as tonsillectomy, hernia 
repair and ear tube placements (myringotomy), he adds, not for emergency 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not generally advised, either, for major pediatric operations such as 
organ transplants and open-heart procedures, adds Dr. Theodore Striker, an 
anesthesiologist at Children's Hospital Medical Center in Cincinnati, where 
parents are allowed to accompany their children to special induction rooms, 
adjacent to the operating rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of space limitations, many hospitals allow only one parent to 
accompany the child. The program is "a privilege, not a right," cautions Dr. 
Linda Jo Rice, an anesthesiologist at Connecticut's Hartford Hospital and 
Newington Childrens Hospital, who helped pioneer the program at Children's 
National Medical Center in Washington. "The final decision is up to the 
anesthesiologist." 
</P>
<P>
 Parents should be screened, adds Dr. Dianne Byerly, an anesthesiologist at 
Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, who participated in such a program while at the 
University of Iowa. "I would choose parents carefully," she says. "If a parent 
is too anxious, that might be transferred to the child." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Track Record: Even when briefed, some can't handle the stress. "About 10 
times a year in D.C., we'd have a parent faint or get extremely agitated," Rice 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Even parents who seem to sail through find that the experience takes its toll. 
"Parents often get kind of teary," Kalayjian says. "Later, they admit it was 
stressful." But most say they would do it again, believing it helps the child. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Perspective: Ideally, the program should be presented as an option, with 
parents who feel squeamish not being made to feel guilty. Says Rice: "No 
psychological studies in the literature indicate this has the slightest 
long-term benefit." 
</P>
<P>
 Not every parent wants to participate. One survey of 52 parents found that 58% 
expressed a wish to accompany their child to the OR. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Local Picture: Of eight Los Angeles-area hospitals polled, only Long Beach 
Memorial has a formal program in place. Five other hospitals (Childrens 
Hospital Los Angeles, Kaiser, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles 
County/USC Med Center and Valley Presbyterian Hospital) say they decide on a 
"case-by-case" basis. 
</P>
<P>
 After a planned remodeling, Childrens Hospital Los Angeles and Children's 
Hospital of Orange County might offer the service, spokeswomen say. 
</P>
<P>
 At Santa Monica Hospital Medical Center, children are often given 
pre-medication while the parents are still present to reduce anxiety, says 
spokesman Ted Braun. Then, if the physicians agree, parents can accompany the 
children up to the doors of the surgical suite. "Some of our family physicians 
and pediatricians also accompany the child to surgery, as moral support, if 
another doctor is performing the surgery," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other Measures: The American Society of Anesthesiologists and the American 
Academy of Pediatrics suggest: 
</P>
<P>
 * At the preoperative meeting with the anesthesiologist, ask what to expect in 
terms of anesthesia. Express your concerns and those of your child. Answer 
carefully all questions about family history and past surgeries so the 
anesthesiologist can determine how to care best for your child. 
</P>
<P>
 * Try to stay calm. A parent's soothing voice can go a long way toward keeping 
a child calm. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ask if the hospital provides social workers or other counselors if you or 
your child is having a tough time facing surgery.

<P>
 The Hollywood ending he'd regularly supplied to others but could never manage 
for himself finally came to Steven Spielberg Monday night. To the small 
surprise but great delight of the audience at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, 
Spielberg for the first time won Oscars for best picture and best director for 
his work on "Schindler's List." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking dazed at both awards even though he must have expected at least one of 
them, Spielberg grew increasingly emotional as he thanked first his wife, 
actress Kate Capshaw, "for saving my life 92 days in a row in Krakow," and then 
his mother, "my lucky charm." Then, his voice truly breaking, he talked of 
remembering "the 6 million who can't be watching this among the billion 
watching tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite this bravura finish, for a while it looked as if this might not be 
"Schindler's" night after all. Yes, it quickly picked up the first award of the 
evening for art direction, beating out likely winner "The Age of Innocence." 
But after that the film lost in four straight categories, including one for 
sound to in-house rival "Jurassic Park" before John Williams broke the streak 
with his victory for best original score.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After that, with the exception of the best actor category, "Schindler's List" 
took everything it was up for, invariably reducing its recipients to tears. 
Steven Zaillian, whose adapted screenplay was praised by Spielberg for its 
"inordinate restraint," took pains to thank his father for his complete belief 
in "common decency." And veteran editor Michael Kahn was equally emotional in 
referring to this experience as "the most fulfilling time of my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all these words for and about "Schindler's List," the Oscar evening 
was very nearly stolen by someone who didn't say a word. No, not the canine 
stars of "Beethoven's 2nd," who steadfastly refused to hit their marks, causing 
host Whoopi Goldberg to remark, "And they call me a bitch." Besides Spielberg, 
the night belonged to Anna Paquin. 
</P>
<P>
 The delighted winner of the best supporting actress Oscar for her 
uncompromising work in "The Piano," Paquin was so flabbergasted that at first 
she could do no more than hyperventilate onstage. Then, when her speech was 
over, she clutched the statue to her chest like a treasured doll and broke 
tradition by running directly offstage to her seat. It was the performance of 
the evening.  
</P>
<P>
 "The Piano" won two other major Oscars, both expected. Holly Hunter, who 
reminisced about pretending to play the piano on the window sill when she was 6 
years old, won for best actress. And Jane Campion, who won for best original 
screenplay, confessed that though she "used to feel deeply cynical about award 
nights like this," actually participating in one had brought her close to 
tears.  
</P>
<P>
 As always, the moments Oscar watchers treasured most were the small, 
spontaneous ones, like the unidentified woman from the group accepting the best 
documentary short award for "Defending Our Lives." Last to speak, she 
passionately blurted out: "Domestic violence is the leading cause of violence 
to women in the United States. Please, we need all your help to stop this."  
</P>
<P>
 As for memorable acceptance speeches, two stood out, one short and one long. 
The short one came courtesy of Fernando Trueba, the director of "Belle Epoque," 
the winning foreign-language film from Spain. "I would like to believe in God 
in order to thank him," he said, "but I just believe in Billy Wilder."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The most eloquent acceptance came from best actor winner Tom Hanks, who 
starred as an AIDS-afflicted lawyer in "Philadelphia." Speaking completely 
without notes, Hanks passionately thanked co-star Denzel Washington "for 
putting his image at risk" and his gay high-school drama teacher, saying, "I 
wish my babies could have the same kind of influences." He closed with a 
heartfelt "God bless you all, God have mercy on us all and God bless America." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, moments like these are getting increasingly rare, as the Oscar 
show gets more and more intent on making the trains run on time. The result is 
acceptance speeches so brief that they end up being nothing but laundry lists 
of thank-you's to no-doubt deserving collaborators.  
</P>
<P>
 Helping to ease the pain was Whoopi Goldberg, who proved especially adept at 
keeping things lively with continual ad-libs directed at targets as varied as 
Nancy Reagan, Larry Fortensky, and a certain fearless section of a great 
metropolitan daily newspaper.  
</P>
<P>
 More star power was provided by Bruce Springsteen, who displayed more onstage 
charisma in singing "Streets of Philadelphia" than did Paul Newman, winner of 
the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award. "This is the first song I ever wrote for 
a motion picture," Springsteen said as he hefted the statuette after the song 
won. "I guess it's all downhill from here." 
</P>
<P>
 For collectors of Oscar trivia, the evening provided at least one fun fact to 
know and tell. When "Black Rider" won for best dramatic short, it marked the 
second year in a row that a film from a Common Market country set on public 
transportation took home that particular prize. There's a story in there 
somewhere.

 Like many people, Brett Butler remembers watching the Academy Awards on TV 
when she was growing up in Marietta, Ga., and dishing the stars, the dresses, 
the escorts and, most of all, the attitude required to make an entrance at the 
Oscars. But the comedian and star of ABC's hit series "Grace Under Fire" had 
never attended the ceremonies -- until this year. Calendar invited Butler to 
check out the stars' arrivals from ringside at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion 
and tell us what it's really like.  
</P>
<P>
 When I was asked to cover the Oscars for the L.A. Times, I thought I could. 
But then I wondered, would I be too worshipful? After all, haven't I watched 
nearly every telecast in the 36 years I've been alive? 
</P>
<P>
 Even as a child, I was a captive listener to the teariest acceptance speeches 
of the dullest technical awards, realizing that a lifetime of work had 
culminated in that moment. 
</P>
<P>
 In the space of a year I've gone from being an unknown comedian to a 
television-generated star, the poor cousin of movie stars. That's what TV stars 
are, compared to the visiting royalty of film stars. And in the eight months 
I've been in L.A., I've waded far into the sea of celebrity. I'm proud to say I 
have a passable backstroke. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday night was the night everyone who likes swimming comes out to see how 
it's done. We watch bits and pieces of what stars do on the screen and how they 
"really" are and realize that Esther Williams and Edy Williams are not related 
at all and that, if they are, it is only at the show-biz family picnic that is 
the Oscars. 
</P>
<P>
 To stand outside the Pavilion with a notebook and a cellular phone with the 
other members of the press, I had to go through ego detox. And I will never 
cross two streets in an evening gown again. I discovered something else: Cops 
allow sequins where no jeans will tread. 
</P>
<P>
 I will say this, it was much nicer outside than I thought it would be. It was 
sunny and breezy and crisp and everyone smelled good. I think of myself as 
someone who is not star-struck, per se -- then I saw Jeremy Irons and I almost 
fainted. 
</P>
<P>
 After living for nine years in New York City, I couldn't help but wonder if 
the things yelled to celebrities would not be vastly different in that arena. 
Since this is a family newspaper, I will not say the ways in which the 
statements would be different. The most ridiculous, defining and beautiful 
moment of the evening: hearing the press yell out to the people passing by -- 
"Who are you?"  
</P>
<P>
 I did not know that fundamentalist Christians picketed the Oscars, and I was 
amused by this. There were huge signs urging the industry to repent, calling 
anyone associated with any of the films "scum" -- but someone had tacked on a 
little sign that said "except for 'Schindler's List.' " One might assume that 
these are Christians who loved "E.T." One of my favorite sights of the evening 
was watching these statuesque, gorgeous, perfectly coiffed women staring up at 
the people holding the signs that said "Repent." Talk about not a chance in 
hell. 
</P>
<P>
 My fashion scoop for this year's Academy Awards, the items that were big and 
timeless: There was a lot of big hard hair and breasts to match. And I can go 
the rest of my life without seeing a perm, a tan and a face-lift on the same 
man. The woman with Christian Slater had a tattoo on her arm, but it was under 
chiffon -- I can't think of another event that would combine those two looks. 
(But she's skinny enough to get away with it.) And another thing: The class 
lines are broken in show business. I found myself looking at the female stars 
and wondering how many of them, like me, used to count pennies to buy eye 
shadow -- the cheap kind. And look at us now, I thought wryly.  
</P>
<P>
 This is what I did to annoy some of the overly visible female stars: When I 
came up to them in the press line, I moved my finger over my teeth, as if to 
indicate a massive display of lipstick on an incisor. 
</P>
<P>
 I couldn't help but notice the less-famous spouses of some celebrities looking 
really uncomfortable. The press would scream at the stars, "Who is that with 
you?," as though the people they were with were something on a leash. I'd 
already felt weird standing next to the tabloid writers; when I had that 
thought, I realized I'd been standing too close to the tabloid writers. 
</P>
<P>
 Being outside the Pavilion amid the din of multiple helicopters felt like some 
sort of Neiman-Marcus version of the evacuation of Saigon. If you'd been a 
pregnant woman with a small child, that crowd would have saved Versace over 
you. French manicured nails would have pushed him up on the helicopter. And 
yet, I found myself waving to them, as if I thought my mom would see me at 
home. I saw some people who looked wicked and jaded -- people who looked as if 
they'd been to 20 or 30 of these things -- and I just loved them. They actually 
bulge well in sequins. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end, as I was leaving, I couldn't resist going back before the cameras 
to hear the crowd yell a little. This evening is evil and wonderful and 
titillating -- and I am inextricably in it.

CALENDAR GOES TO THE OSCARS; SPRINGSTEEN CLOSES ROCK MUSIC GAP; POP MUSIC: FOR 
THE FIRST TIME IN 40 YEARS OF ROCK 'N' ROLL, HOLLYWOOD GIVES THE BEST SONG 
OSCAR TO A PURE ROCK SONGWRITER FOR 'STREETS OF PHILADELPHIA.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Welcome, Oscar, to the rock 'n' roll era. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty years after the recording debut of Elvis Presley, a best song Oscar was 
awarded to a pure rock songwriter -- Bruce Springsteen -- for the first time. 
Too bad they didn't have a second Oscar for Neil Young. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a magical moment when Springsteen stood in his tuxedo jacket at center 
stage and sang "Streets of Philadelphia," the touching ballad about a man whose 
body is being destroyed by AIDS: 
</P>
<P>
 I walked the avenue 'til  
</P>
<P>
 My legs felt like stone  
</P>
<P>
 I heard the voices of friends  
</P>
<P>
 Vanished and gone  
</P>
<P>
 The song not only set the mood in Jonathan Demme's film, "Philadelphia," where 
it was played over the opening credits, but the simplicity of its presentation 
Monday night brought a chilling, topical urgency to the Oscar telecast. 
</P>
<P>
 As powerful as it was, Young -- whose title song from the same film was also 
nominated -- nearly matched the drama with an equally heartfelt rendition of 
his own song. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting at the piano, Young captured in his near-falsetto voice the heartache 
of someone refusing to surrender his dignity or hope: 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes I think that I know  
</P>
<P>
 What love's all about  
</P>
<P>
 And when I see the light  
</P>
<P>
 I know I'll be all right.  
</P>
<P>
 It was most fitting when Springsteen, in accepting his Oscar, said, "Neil, I'm 
gonna share this with you." 
</P>
<P>
 Before we think that Springsteen's victory is a turning point in the 
Oscars/rock gap, here's a sobering thought: Take away Springsteen and Young's 
six minutes, and what did we have? Pretty much Oscar music as usual. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Jackson sang "Again," the ballad she wrote with James Harris II and 
Terry Lewis for "Poetic Justice," with intimacy and class. Still, the song is 
fairly conventional. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolly Parton and James Ingram did their best to inject some life into "The Day 
I Fall in Love," but the song is fairly undistinguishable from 400,000 others 
in the same gushy genre. As if the song from "Beethoven's 2nd" weren't 
sentimental enough, the telecast added scenes from old dog movies. Arf . 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Carradine also tried his best to bring out the charm in "A Wink and a 
Smile," but the cutesy song by Marc Shaiman and Ramsey McLean is also in 
worn-out Hollywood tradition. This time, the supporting film clips showed 
various film stars winking at the camera. Barf . 
</P>
<P>
 Hopefully, the impact of Springsteen and Young's music in "Philadelphia" and 
on the telecast will serve as a bridge between Hollywood and the rock 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 The closest the Oscar voters have gotten to honoring rock in the past was best 
original song score awards to the Beatles in 1970 for "Let It Be" and to Prince 
in 1984 for "Purple Rain." 
</P>
<P>
 It's no wonder, then, that rock artists have been suspicious for years of 
Hollywood, sensing producers simply wanted to exploit the artists to attract a 
young audience. 
</P>
<P>
 When Demme reached out to Springsteen and Young, however, he did so with 
purpose and respect. And their responses validated Demme's decision. The 
celebration of that partnership with an Oscar on Monday night was a sign that 
Hollywood 'n' rock is an idea whose time has come. 
</P>
<P>
 Better late than never.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: CALENDAR GOES TO THE OSCARS; WHOOPI, BETTER NAUGHTY THAN 
BORING; AWARDS: GOLDBERG FAILS TO HIT A FUNNY BONE OR STIR UP ANY OF THE 
CONTROVERSY THAT WAS HYPED THE WEEK BEFORE THE TELECAST. IN FACT, HER HOSTING 
IS BALMY , PARTICULARLY COMPARED TO PREDECESSOR BILLY CRYSTAL. 
</P>

<P>
 So what did they think, she'd come out in whiteface? 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's really curious about what Whoopi will do and what she will say," 
said "Entertainment Tonight" star Mary Hart prior to Monday night's humdrum 
Academy Awards telecast on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
 All right, her private Friars Club roast turned out to be hotter than expected 
when her good friend, Ted Danson, kidded her by showing up as a minstrel. The 
overblown criticism of Danson angered her, and she said so. And four-letter 
words are no stranger to her stand-up act. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet just how Whoopi Goldberg acquired a week-before-the-Oscars reputation as 
an out-of-control, kick-ass neo-Howard Stern -- compelling viewers to tune in 
and hear what outrageous things she would say -- only Academy Awards hypesters 
know. The free-for-all buildup belied the passivity of her former late-night 
talk show. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the Goldberg who hosted the Oscars was about as uppity as the abused 
heroine she played in "The Color Purple." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than rebellious , the word balmy comes to mind here, especially in 
comparing Goldberg to her predecessor, Billy Crystal, whose rapier comic skills 
are tailor-made for hosting awards telecasts. Crystal is a relentless joke 
slinger who quick-draws from the hip. Goldberg not only was uncontroversial -- 
and who cared about that one way or the other? -- but her humor wilted in a 
blessedly brief 3-hour-and-18-minute telecast (produced by Gilbert Cates and 
directed by Jeff Margolis) that screamed out for something dramatically comical 
to raise it from its deadly lethargy. 
</P>
<P>
 It happened only once: when the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion crowd gave a rousing 
standing ovation to Bruce Springsteen, compared to a relatively tepid one given 
special honoree Deborah Kerr. Now that was funny. 
</P>
<P>
 There were a few deeply emotional moments too, headed by the awards to Steven 
Spielberg and his "Schindler's List" and an emotional acceptance speech by best 
actor Tom Hanks (for "Philadelphia"). Rather than let the emotion of Hanks' 
remarks linger, however, Goldberg aborted it by slapping on her own exclamation 
mark. "I'm really glad we do what we do, man. We are amazing." 
</P>
<P>
 Not always amazing. Several of Goldberg's jokes (apparent ad-libs) were met by 
low murmurs instead of laughter, prompting her to plead at one point to the 
unresponsive audience: "Don't tell me I have to explain this. C'mon!" 
</P>
<P>
 And what of the "dangerous" Goldberg? "There haven't been this many show-biz 
executives so nervous sweating over one woman since Heidi Fleiss," she said 
about her reputation for controversy near the top of the telecast. If so, the 
sweat was unwarranted, despite the "aren't-I-naughty?" tone that Goldberg 
maintained throughout the telecast. "I'm an equal opportunity offender," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg did take a shot at the Clinton Administration's relentless critic, 
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), urging Lorena Bobbitt to "please meet 
Bob Dole." Otherwise, there was nothing in this telecast -- not the host or 
anything else -- that was remotely offensive or even naughty. Or all that 
interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 An equal opportunity wet blanket.

 "Normally I don't do trains," said a preening, velvet-swathed Whoopi Goldberg. 
"But honey, it's the Oscars." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the tiny tattoo peeking out over the top of her sweetheart neckline, 
Goldberg -- the first woman to host the Academy Awards -- set a tone of quiet 
good taste Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Boring . 
</P>
<P>
 No beaded cornrows, no rhinestone-studded sunglasses, no excess flesh. 
</P>
<P>
 Even glamour puss Geena Davis was understated in her Ruth Meyers slip dress, 
minimal makeup and stringy Saturday morning hair.  
</P>
<P>
 Thank God for Ellen Barkin. She looked babe-o-licious, shrink-wrapped in 
Gianni Versace's gold mesh gown. And for Madeleine Stowe, who shared her charms 
in a clingy Calvin Klein. 
</P>
<P>
 Hot from Lillehammer, Norway, skating dress designer Vera Wang gets credit for 
styling two actresses and a spokes-skater, all of whom looked better, frankly, 
from the rear. Holly Hunter and Nancy Kerrigan wore similar velvet, 
midriff-baring gowns by the designer, while Marisa Tomei was light and bright 
and backless. 
</P>
<P>
 Velvet was the somber choice of many, leaving good old Shirley MacLaine to 
look like the perfect Hollywood anachronism -- head to toe in festive blue 
sequins. Nicole Kidman wore a velvet column gown with beaded bodice (Valentino) 
and Rosie Perez a black velvet tank (Giorgio Armani). 
</P>
<P>
 Hair was either tortured into waves (Sharon Stone, Joan Chen) or sausage curls 
(Angela Bassett, Rosie Perez), poked into beauty-school up-'dos (Laura Dern) or 
a complete afterthought (Geena Davis, Holly Hunter, Stockard Channing). But it 
was a lack of hair that prompted the most audience whispers: "I came disguised 
as me," Tommy Lee Jones told a tactless television reporter, who asked the 
actor to explain his balding pate. 
</P>
<P>
 Midway through the show, Goldberg changed into an Armani tuxedo dandified with 
fluffy bow and lacy blouse. "C'mon, you didn't think I was going to spend all 
night in that dress, did you?" 
</P>
<P>
 She wasn't the only one who tried to improve on the basic black tie. Christian 
Slater, Liam Neeson and Pete Postlethwaite sported black shirts beneath their 
black jackets. But going tieless was, by far, the easiest counterculture touch. 
The look, which started in force at the Grammy Awards earlier this month, has 
broken into the movie crowd, with actors Tom Cruise, Antonio Banderas, Jeff 
Bridges, Johnny Depp and Gabriel Byrne trading bow ties for banded collars. 
</P>
<P>
 The once-ubiquitous AIDS ribbon seems to be out of favor as well. AIDS 
activist group ACT UP had issued an open letter to the entertainment industry 
last week calling on Oscar-goers to send the trademark red ribbon to President 
Clinton with a message of concern. 
</P>
<P>
 In a year of few Oscar surprises, the biggest surprise may have been Winona 
Ryder's ability to resist publicity-minded designers and show up in a stunning 
vintage slip dress.

THEATER REVIEW; 'WILDERNESS' MAKES LONG NIGHT OF JOURNEY INTO O'NEILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ah, well. When it came to long-winded plays, no American dramatist was better 
than Eugene O'Neill. His dramas have a famous tendency to turn into talk 
marathons, and "Ah, Wilderness!" is no exception, although as a nostalgic 
comedy it just hints at the morose anguish for which O'Neill is most 
celebrated. 
</P>
<P>
 Widely regarded as the flip side of "Long Day's Journey Into Night" for its 
depiction of a congenial Connecticut family near the turn of the century, "Ah, 
Wilderness!" is a piece of idealized Americana that glorifies the ordinary in 
middle-class life and memorializes small-town innocence. O'Neill said as much: 
"That's the way I would have liked my boyhood to have been." 
</P>
<P>
 He might have changed his mind, though, had he attended the Laguna Playhouse 
revival at the Moulton Theatre (through April 10). His characters drift among 
words, words, words, and the players can't make them their own. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is compounded by listless pacing and static staging. At times the 
production is so sluggish you feel like you're watching an oil painting. This 
is one show you can use to catch up on your sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 A slight if lengthy work, "Ah, Wilderness!" is the only comedy among O'Neill's 
major plays. Apart from all those words, it depends to a high degree on 
atmosphere and sentiment to evoke a day in the lives of Nat and Essie Miller 
and their large, extended family. 
</P>
<P>
 All the action takes place on the Fourth of July, 1906, with attention 
centered on Nat and Essie's second-oldest son, Richard, whose coming of age 
serves as the play's real subject. (There are three other children in the 
household, in addition to Nat's sister Lily, Essie's visiting brother Sid and a 
housekeeper.) 
</P>
<P>
 Richard, still in high school but soon headed for college, is whipsawed by his 
experience of young love and seeming rejection. He also is given to spouting 
anarchist slogans, quoting the poetry of Swinburne and reading the avant-garde 
plays of Wilde, Ibsen and Shaw. And he has his first encounter -- how could he 
not? -- with that reliable O'Neill combination of alcohol and sordid sex. 
</P>
<P>
 As Richard, Rob Addison conveys a sense of the role in its overall outline. He 
portrays Richard's rebellious idealism and frustration, and he is a likable 
performer probably capable of capturing more than obvious surface details. On 
opening night, however, his characterization seemed too much a bland 
stereotype. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, George J. Woods as Nat (the wise, strong paterfamilias) and Phillip 
W. Beck as Sid (the boozy, wayward, guilt-ridden uncle) delivered more or less 
competent performances. But both were too bloodless and uninspired to ignite 
the production, notwithstanding momentary evidence of broad physical comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Laurel Kelsh's portrait of Essie, the all-forgiving mother, also suffers from 
bland acting, though she managed to put enough dithering into the character to 
make her a nonstop fusspot. Among the rest of the cast, Carolyn Crotty gives 
perhaps the freshest performance in the minor role of Mildred, Richard's 
sister. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for Richard Dwight Odle's apt costumes, which lend an authentic feeling 
to the turn-of-the-century period, the technical values of this unimaginative 
revival fail to clarify the mood of the play beyond the expected. Sometimes 
they even muddy the point. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Fourth of July firecrackers heard offstage are meant to startle 
us, but they sound muffled, like someone playing a snare drum in a closet. It's 
just a minor miscalculation, yet their lack of snap seems symptomatic of the 
production as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 Less easy to overlook are the distracting shapes that sit like a top-heavy 
layer cake on the Miller home. When you finally puzzle them out as the 
surrounding hills and neighboring roofs of the Connecticut countryside, you 
realize they're a leaden match for director Robert Leigh's generally lackluster 
conception. 
</P>
<P>
 As is customary for playhouse offerings, considerable effort and expense have 
gone into the production. But this is one "Ah, Wilderness!" without a feeling 
of adventure, a placid museum piece that never gets dusted off. 
</P>

ART / CATHY CURTIS; UNCONTROLLED SUBSTANCE; CRAFTS SHOW AT NEWPORT HARBOR 
INTRIGUES IN MANY WAYS, MOST OF THEM UNINTENTIONAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS

<TEXT>
<P>
 What do crafts lovers Dorothy and George Saxe of Palo Alto collect? Really 
good stuff and really bad stuff. What qualities do their works have in common? 
Beats me. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of 124 objects in glass, ceramics, wood and metal -- about one-fifth 
of the collection the couple have gathered during the past decade -- is at the 
Newport Harbor Art Museum (through June 5). The show is on tour from the Toledo 
Museum of Art in Ohio, which owns 63 objects donated by the Saxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most exhibitions drawn from a single private collection, "Contemporary 
Crafts and the Saxe Collection" doesn't seem to reflect a specific taste so 
much as the desire to own work by well-known practitioners in the field. But 
despite its curious lack of personality -- and the dismal way it is installed 
at the museum, which I'll get to later -- the show is intriguing in several 
ways, most of them no doubt unintentional. 
</P>
<P>
 It includes objects with strong sensual allure as well as hideous clunkers. It 
sums up some of the central problems with contemporary craft, which is 
frequently too cute, bland or overdone to be taken seriously. It demonstrates 
the frustrating scarcity of irony (as opposed to parody) in the craft world, 
and that world's tendency to repackage artistic approaches into blander, 
prettified versions. And it comes with a catalogue that minutely documents 
shifts in patronage over the past 40 years or so for each craft medium. 
</P>
<P>
 The bulk of the work on view is in glass -- the Saxes' first love and most 
assiduously collected medium -- and ceramics, media that yield nearly all the 
beauty and wit in the show. (One exception: Kay Sekimachi's enchanting 
translucent paper bowl from 1982 with its flurry of linen threads tossing 
around the rim.) 
</P>
<P>
 Beauty lurks most often in traditional vessel forms, such as Mark Peiser's 
delicately descriptive crystal vase "Leda and the Swan" and Rudolf Staffel's 
creamy floral relief porcelain vase "Light Gatherer." Both artists employ 
sophisticated techniques to heighten the qualities inherent in their media. 
</P>
<P>
 Drawing from art history's ample catalogue of visual imagery, Peiser 
introduces subtle surface effects of color and pattern that exploit the 
transparency of glass. Staffel expresses the pliant delicacy of plant life in 
the most malleable of media, one that retains the imprint and pressure of the 
artist's hand. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other works in the show reflect aspects of contemporary art, filtered in 
varying ways through the innately conservative aesthetics of the craft world. 
</P>
<P>
 The best -- and probably the most amusing -- piece is Adrian Saxe's speckled 
trio of gourd-shaped porcelain vessels, "A & B (Gourd Garniture)," from 1987. 
The comically squat gourds sit, like royalty, on stepped golden Chinese-style 
pedestals, and the little golden "crown" stoppers look suspiciously like the 
sort of candy dishes that used to be found in middle-class American parlors. 
</P>
<P>
 Each stopper, underlining Saxe's droll yet conceptually acute sensibility, 
bears an upright three-dimensional letter or elegant typographical sign (the a 
, b and & of the title). The larger central gourd wears the ampersand, as if to 
emphasize the importance of bringing together elements of design from different 
cultures -- or different points of view at a tea party. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the piece by Saxe (no relation to the collecting couple) wouldn't be 
out of place in a forward-looking show of contemporary art, Mary Shaffer's 
technically ambitious "Hanging Series No. 24" from 1978 doesn't venture into 
the more intriguing reaches of '70s minimalism. 
</P>
<P>
 The huge, slumping mass of glass dangling from a cradle of twisted wires 
incorporates some of the anarchic, gravity-determined quality of Eva Hesse's 
last sculptures of 1970. But by forming the piece to look like a garment with 
sleeves (angel wings?), Shaffer remained faithful to the figurative bias of so 
many craft artists who break away from the vessel, thereby delimiting the 
viewer's field of association. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Clifford Rainey takes a quasi-anthropological tack in "Fetish," a Coca-Cola 
bottle made of cracked and crazed recycled glass skewered with nails and 
layered with shards of plate glass. It suggests a cross between the 
bushmen-meet-Western-culture theme of the film "The Gods Must Be Crazy" and a 
symbol of the rage of the disenfranchised at corporate coercion in contemporary 
life. The problem with the piece is that it looks too much like a well-crafted 
object and not enough like the embodiment of bitter, make-do voodoo. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Voulkos, generally acknowledged as the guy who turned the finicky field 
of ceramics into a Western fine-art medium, now suffers the fate of an artist 
whose revolution inspired legions of untalented imitators -- and whose style 
has long been out of vogue. Today, his asymmetrical scarred, Abstract 
Expressionist-inspired sculptures have lost their original brute power and now 
read as stylized artifacts from the modern era. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, Viola Frey's towering ceramic figures fit in well with our era of 
skepticism and ennui. "Man Observing Series II" is a nearly nine-foot-tall male 
figure in an improbably colorful business suit. Arms akimbo, he peers at 
something or someone of lesser stature. Dwarfed by this cartoon-like befuddled 
giant, the viewer begins to feel rather like a misbehaving child. 
</P>
<P>
 Irv Tepper's outsize porcelain cup "Roger" is one of many he has imbued with 
sad-sack anthropomorphic characteristics. Broken, bashed in and ominously 
scuffed, the piece is awash in self-conscious pitifulness, all the more campily 
poignant because of the cup's ungainly size: Hey, even big guys have thin 
skins. 
</P>
<P>
 But how absurd to have to view this piece from so far away that you 
practically need a telescopic lens! Rather than display the three-dimensional 
objects in cases -- which permit full observation while protecting fragile work 
from over-enthusiastic or larcenous viewers -- Newport Harbor opted to maroon 
them on vast two-tiered platforms jury-rigged from ugly brown fiberboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually all the smaller pieces -- the detailed ones you naturally want to 
see close up -- are stashed as far away from the viewer as possible and do not 
permit viewing in the round. The temptation -- it's forbidden, of course -- is 
to scramble up on the platforms for a better view. 
</P>
<P>
 Inexplicably, at the opposite extreme, Bertil Vallien's large glass piece, 
"Crystal Arrow," hangs out in the open at hip level where guards must keep 
close watch over viewers with the urge to touch. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Work in the show that lacks strong sensuous appeal and/or viable ideas 
generally has little more to offer than cuteness (Alphonse Mattia's humanoid 
wood "Hors d'Oeuvres Server" with cocktail franks for eyebrows), chichi 
eclecticism (painter Billy Al Bengston's table, "Kane Variation No. 20"), bland 
decoration (nearly all the fiber works) or a clunky, dated attempt at artiness 
(Judy Moonelis's ceramic piece, "Untitled (Green Storm)"). 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, these qualities are in generous supply, suggesting that this 
show may not have been the best choice for a museum specializing in modern and 
contemporary art. An ideal exhibition for Newport Harbor would include objects 
on the basis of their content , and discuss them in ways that clearly relate to 
the larger world of art. 
</P>
<P>
 The point isn't that it's somehow less worthy to make work in ceramic or fiber 
instead of paint or bronze. After all, it is a commonplace today that artists 
make work out of any materials they wish, whether permanent or ephemeral, 
lovely or appalling. The issue is that some work made in "craft" media merely 
waters down ideas from the art world while other work actually extends the 
dialogue. A more pertinent show would highlight not the medium but the message. 
</P>
<P>
 "Contemporary Crafts and the Saxe Collection" remains through June 5 at the 
Newport Harbor Art Museum, 850 San Clemente Drive, Newport Beach. Hours: 10 
a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday. Admission: $4 adults, $2 students and 
seniors, free for children under 12, free for everyone on Tuesdays. (714)

 Before the ceremonies began Monday night, hundreds of fans were gathered in

 Orange County public television station KOCE-TV Channel 50 completed its most 
successful membership drive ever on Sunday, raising $295,431 according to a 
preliminary estimate, station spokeswoman Judith Schaefer said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The response to the 18-day campaign was attributed to special programming that 
included a taped concert by New-Age singer Yanni, as well as to a one-day 
extension of the spring drive, Schaefer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The drive brought in almost 27% more than last spring's record-setting 
$232,803 during a 17-day campaign. ZAN DUBIN

MARTINA MCBRIDE: COUNTRY'S RISING STAR; POP MUSIC: THE 27-YEAR-OLD SINGER 
GAINED MOMENTUM WITH HER 'MY BABY LOVES ME' SINGLE THAT TELLS WOMEN THEY'RE 
GREAT -- AND COMPLIMENTS THEIR MEN FOR NOTICING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Martina McBride is sitting at the offices of RCA Records, behind a glass table 
so big you wonder how they got it through the door -- the perfect setting for 
an upcoming country music star with a knack for making the right decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 In between interviews, the 27-year-old singer was signing posters of herself. 
Demand for such mementos dramatically increased last fall when her "My Baby 
Loves Me" single finally upgraded her from wanna-be to a real contender. 
</P>
<P>
 That record is a pop gem with lyrics for everybody. Songwriter Gretchen Peters 
has come up with a tune that tells women they're great -- and compliments their 
men for noticing: 
</P>
<P>
 My baby loves me just the way that I am,  
</P>
<P>
 He thinks I'm pretty, thinks I'm smart,  
</P>
<P>
 likes my nerve loves my heart.  
</P>
<P>
 Only a powerhouse single ("American Honky-Tonk Bar Association") from old 
friend and patron Garth Brooks kept it from going No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first heard it, I knew it was a hit," McBride said. "I'm living 'My 
Baby Loves Me' -- I'm real lucky." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm also lucky in that sense that I found a song that fits my life." 
</P>
<P>
 The video for the hit features non-show biz couples of all shapes and sizes 
lip-syncing along -- and plenty of footage of the fetching, gray-eyed McBride. 
Her husband, John, makes a cameo at the end. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think one of the reasons it's so successful (No. 1 on Country Music 
Television in America and Europe, the Nashville Network and VH-1's country 
program) is because it's very approachable," McBride said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Using real people, people can identify that this song means everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 McBride has since followed it up with another hit, "Life No. 9." She's touring 
with Brooks for the second time, and in April will open for him in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 She spent her first tour with Brooks selling T-shirts (her husband was a sound 
technician for the singer), her second as an opening act without a hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, he's been very kind -- giving me an incredible opportunity to be in 
front of a lot of people," she said of Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think maybe in 10 years, I'll look back and realize how much it meant to 
me. Not only career-wise, but personally it helped me grow. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was sink or swim, and it forced me to get my act together a little quicker 
and really dig in." 
</P>
<P>
 McBride said she also had to bear down as she was preparing to follow her 
debut album "The Time Has Come," a flop. She says her respect for traditional 
country music may have got the best of her. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I did the first album I was very concerned with that, and I think it 
showed. With this album, I was still very concerned with it, but I wasn't 
consumed by it." 
</P>
<P>

 McBride says she looks for songs from a women's point of view. Peters, author 
of "My Baby Loves Me," also wrote "Independence Day," on "The Way That I Am." 
It's about a woman leaving an abusive relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I could write like anybody, I'd like to write like her," McBride said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I like about her songs is they treat women with dignity and respect and 
strength, but some of them are also vulnerable." 
</P>
<P>
 Other songs include "Goin' to Work," about a woman immersed in her work to 
avoid a rocky personal life. "She Ain't Seen Nothing Yet" is about a woman 
being cheated on who isn't quite ready to accept it. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobby Braddock's "Strangers" charts a relationship from beginning to end, with 
dramatics reminiscent of Tammy Wynette. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds like a classic song, and it's brand new," McBride said. "Something 
about it reminds me of that big, strong 'Stand by Your Man' chorus." 
</P>
<P>
 McBride early on put her career in the hands of Canada-based manager Bruce 
Allen, who also handles Canadian rocker Bryan Adams. It was an interesting move 
for someone trying to break through in Nashville.

DEBORAH KERR: AN ACTRESS TO REMEMBER; MOVIES: THE EMBODIMENT OF 'PERFECTION, 
DISCIPLINE AND ELEGANCE' FINALLY GETS AN OSCAR, ALBEIT AN HONORARY ONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The Deborah Kerr line that everyone remembers from the 1956 film "Tea and 
Sympathy" is, of course, the one she delivers as she's about to sexually 
initiate an anguished prep school student: "When you speak of this in future 
years, and you will, be kind." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the film, however, there's a less portentous but more intriguing 
exchange between Kerr, as the compassionate housemaster's wife, and the student 
(John Kerr, no relation) about the vagaries of romance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always fall in love with the wrong people," the younger Kerr laments. 
</P>
<P>
 "But that's part of the fun," she replies, adding that what one is left with 
after such adventures are "bittersweet memories." 
</P>
<P>
 This line, far more than that oft-quoted -- and oft-parodied -- closer, helps 
explain what made Deborah Kerr more intriguing and complex than other film 
actresses who, like Kerr, were known for playing paragons. One always sensed 
that beneath the finely wrought surface of Kerr's screen persona was a molten 
streak of worldly, unbridled passion kept -- just barely -- under control. 
</P>
<P>
 That passion exploded most conspicuously, of course, in 1953's "From Here to 
Eternity," in which she portrayed Karen Holmes, an adulterous Army wife who 
engaged in that immortal beach clinch with Burt Lancaster. That role was among 
six for which she was nominated for an Oscar. Each time, she lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, the 72-year-old, Scottish-born Kerr finally got an Academy Award, 
albeit an honorary one paying tribute, according to the citation, to her 
"impeccable grace and beauty" and to a "motion picture career (that) has always 
stood for perfection, discipline and elegance." 
</P>
<P>
 Kerr now lives in Europe with her husband, screenwriter Peter Viertel. Her 
last Hollywood studio credit was in 1969 for "The Arrangement." Much of her 
work during the '80s has been in made-for-TV pictures like "Witness for the 
Prosecution," "Reunion at Fairborough" and "A Woman of Substance." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to last year's hit comedy, "Sleepless in Seattle," the hottest movie 
Kerr's been in lately is the 1957 tear-jerker "An Affair to Remember." 
"Sleepless' " homage to "Affair" has made the latter a prime home-video choice 
for couples who cocoon, and brought Kerr back into something resembling the 
spotlight. (It's also being remade as a vehicle for Warren Beatty and Annette 
Bening.) 
</P>
<P>
 Still, as funny and poignant as Kerr was in that bittersweet story of a 
thwarted shipboard romance, the role doesn't tell you what was most distinctive 
about her film career. 
</P>
<P>
 In her first featured role as a Salvation Army worker in the 1941 
British-filmed version of "Major Barbara," the 20-year-old ex-ballet dancer 
conveyed a beguiling mixture of intensity and cool. The balance between these 
traits was especially striking in "Black Narcissus," the spellbinding 1946 film 
directed by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger in which she played a nun 
struggling to keep her head while the sisters working for her in the Himalayas 
are losing theirs. MGM liked Kerr in this film enough to bring her to the 
States the following year to play Clark Gable's leading lady in "The 
Hucksters." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not hard to understand why, in retrospect, Kerr never received an Oscar, 
since Hollywood tends to reward showier, gaudier talents than Kerr's. Her last 
shot was for her performance as Ida, the stoic wife of Robert Mitchum's 
Australian farmer in 1960's "The Sundowners." She lost to Elizabeth Taylor, who 
was borne to her "Butterfield 8" Oscar on waves of sympathy from having 
sustained a near-fatal illness shortly before the awards ceremony. Of her six 
losses, Kerr later said, that one hurt the most.

WARNINGS ISSUED AS THIEVES TARGET COMPUTER SELLERS; ROBBERS POSE AS COMPUTER 
BUYERS TO ENTER HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
 A crime wave involving thieves who masquerade as buyers of pricey home 
computers prompted police and the Recycler newspaper on Monday to warn sellers 
against allowing strangers responding to classified ads into their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the latest high-tech twist to the age-old home-invasion robbery, police 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the armed thieves responding to Recycler Classified ads have struck 
at least nine homes throughout Southern California, stealing high-end Apple 
Macintosh computers and related equipment once sellers allowed them inside. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Macs are an excuse to get into the house," said Detective Bill Speer of 
the Los Angeles Police Department's Robbery-Homicide Division, which is 
investigating cases that have occurred in Reseda, on the Westside, in South Bay 
and other areas since December. Once inside, he said, the robbers have stolen 
televisions, jewelry and other valuable items. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest case occurred Saturday, when two victims were shot and wounded 
before one of them shot back, apparently injuring the suspect. That attack came 
even though the victims knew of the past robberies, possibly due to a computer 
bulletin board that allows users to communicate electronically, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were aware of a series of incidents going on. Mac has a computer 
bulletin board," said Speer. "So they were suspicious -- not just of him but 
anyone who was calling. They were on the alert." 
</P>
<P>
 After the suspect inspected the computer during a visit and then left to get 
money, the victims became suspicious, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't quite like the way the guy acted," said Detective Bob Johansen of 
the LAPD's West Valley Division. "That's why they had the gun battle. One of 
the victims had a gun on him." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their concerns, the victims opened the door when the suspect returned, 
and he produced a gun and forced his way inside, police said. After a short 
gunfight, the attacker fled without any loot. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, employees of the Recycler, a well-read Southern California 
classified newspaper, called sellers of expensive Apple Computer products who 
have placed ads with them to warn them of the attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are calling all of the high-end Macintosh ad placers all over Southern 
California and telling them to be wary in their dealings," said Recycler 
marketing manager Paul Schulz. "They should meet in a public place or not meet 
alone, and meet in daylight hours whenever possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Crime victims have been advertising computer systems worth as much as $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Recycler also has issued general warnings to the public, and published 
tips in the magazine's computer section on how to protect against such 
robberies. For example: Don't meet a potential buyer alone; most if not all of 
the robberies before the last one involved lone victims, Schulz and police 
said. Meet in a well-lit, public place. Get a home or business phone number 
from prospective buyers and call the number back to confirm that it is not just 
a pager or voice mail. All of the cases have involved a pager number, and 
Schulz said police are trying to track the suspects down that way. 
</P>
<P>
 But the opportunities for such crooks are virtually unlimited, according to 
Schulz. The Recycler takes over 100,000 new ads a week, with thousands of 
computer ads and a loyal following of buyers who pick up the paper every 
Thursday morning and scan it for bargains. 
</P>
<P>
 Avid computer fans are continually looking for new equipment, and unloading 
expensive models and related printers, software and other equipment as soon as 
they become outdated, experts said. The preferred Macintosh models, besides 
being worth thousands of dollars, are attractive to thieves because they can be 
sold easily on the black market, according to Schulz, computer experts and 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 "These victims tend to be computer junkies who have a lot of stuff," said 
Schulz. "They are just getting cleaned out." 
</P>
<P>
 Rocky Pyle, an authorized Apple service technician at the Mac Universe 
computer store in Tarzana, said he and other techs often get what appear to be 
stolen Macs. "They have a fast turnaround," Pyle said. "You don't have to be an 
Einstein to figure out how to use one." 
</P>
<P>
 But Pyle said that there is no way to determine if the computers are stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I must admit I am frustrated," Pyle said. "If somebody comes in here with a 
hot machine, what do I do? The police don't keep serial numbers, Apple doesn't 
keep the numbers either. We're stuck. We have our hands tied." 
</P>
<P>
 Speer said police can check on stolen computers if owners call them with the 
serial number on the machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities are saying little about the attacks, except that they appear to be 
the work of two black men in their 20s. They said that those selling the 
computers shouldn't stop placing ads, but should be wary. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you put your name in the paper, you better hope the right guys don't show 
up," said Los Angeles Police Detective Roland L'Heureux of the Robbery-Homicide 
Division. "Inviting someone to come over to your house to look at your Mac 
these days can be dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 In most cases, the thieves bind, gag and blindfold the victim at gunpoint 
before making off with a computer and other goods. 
</P>
<P>
 One victim of the latest attack remained at Northridge Hospital Medical Center 
in critical but stable condition Monday, with a gunshot wound to the chest. The 
other victim was released after being treated for a superficial gunshot wound 
to the chest, Speer said.

BACK TO THE ROUTINE, WITH JITTERS 
</P>

 As quake-weary residents returned to work Monday to right their tipped coffee 
mugs, it became increasingly clear that Sunday's 5.3-magnitude aftershock was 
the sort of jolt Californians have come to expect -- a shaker that leaves Los 
Angeles jittery, but still standing. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it ranks as a significant temblor in its own right, the most powerful 
aftershock since the day of the devastating Northridge earthquake registered as 
little more than another spike on the thousands of personal Richter scales used 
to gauge a quake's toll. 
</P>
<P>
 "No pun intended, but there are no earth-shaking events to report," Los 
Angeles City Fire Department spokesman Bob Collis said Monday. "We're back to 
our normal workload." 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the Jan. 17 quake that left 61 dead and caused at least $13 
billion in damage, Sunday's aftershock caused only minor injuries and 
relatively little damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the reason is that most buildings and utilities in Southern California 
are designed to withstand much stronger quakes, so "its destructive effects 
were pretty limited," said Tom Tobin, executive director of the state's Seismic 
Safety Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, in dozens of pockets around Southern California, Sunday's aftershock 
created personal headaches and heartbreaks. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sherman Oaks, a hillside home hit hard by the January quake was flattened 
by Sunday's shaking and threatened to slide onto other houses below. Wrecking 
crews finished the demolition Monday, causing the house to cave in on itself in 
a crash of cracking wood and shattering glass. 
</P>
<P>
 By late afternoon, the house Mary Bond built 38 years ago with her 
since-deceased husband was flattened by city crews. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very sad to lose my house," said the 85-year-old Bond, who stopped by 
briefly to witness its demise. "Now I'm homeless. Otherwise, I'm doing OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Crews said demolishing the house, which was slipping down the hill, was like 
putting a "block underneath a rolling tire." Demolition was done by running 
heavy cables throughout the house. The cables were then connected to a crane, 
which caused the cables to cinch up and collapse the house. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Van Nuys Superior Court building, the seventh floor was shut down 
because of concerns about asbestos contamination. The closure forced two 
death-penalty trials to move to other courtrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 During the aftershock, ceiling tiles in all four courtrooms on the top floor 
of the building were damaged. Because there is asbestos on beams and pipes 
above the false ceiling, the entire floor was closed as a precautionary 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials hope to reopen the seventh floor to normal operations on Wednesday. 
The Van Nuys courthouse is already overwhelmed because it has taken over cases 
that would have been heard in the San Fernando courthouse, which was closed by 
the January quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It delays things, with the courthouse being crowded anyway," said Superior 
Court Judge Michael R. Hoff. "But I'm sure this is going to work out as it 
always does." 
</P>
<P>
 Delays were not worsened for morning commuters. Getting to work was no more of 
a hassle than it has been since the January quake knocked out stretches of the 
Santa Monica, Golden State, Simi Valley and Antelope Valley freeways, officials 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans spokesman Russ Snyder said Sunday's shaking caused a few cosmetic 
cracks but did no further damage to bridges or overpasses. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Monday, Caltrans announced a contract to rebuild parts of a broken 
interchange in Sylmar. Work began Saturday on two transition roads connecting 
the Antelope Valley Freeway to the Golden State. Construction is expected to be 
completed by June. 
</P>
<P>
 Work on two other transition roads is expected to begin next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles city building inspector Bill King said his office saw a slight 
increase in the number of residents requesting inspections Monday, but added 
that so far there does not appear to be significant new damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are really in good shape," he said. "We're going to have aftershocks. We 
anticipate further aftershocks. I don't think there is any reason to be 
panicked. People just need to be prepared." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, said Caltech spokesman Jay Aller. Sunday's aftershock was to be 
expected, Aller said, advising that there may be more in the coming months.  
</P>
<P>
 He added that there is a 1-in-20 chance that Sunday's jolt, centered 
west-northwest of Panorama City, was a foreshock to a larger quake. But even 
that, he said, should be taken in the usual context. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's true in general for Southern California," he said. "The odds for this 
one are the same as they are in any other."

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; PLASTERERS DIVE INTO COLLEGE POOL PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 30 volunteers spackled their way into trivia lore at the Pierce 
College swimming pool Monday, undertaking what was billed as the most populous 
pool resurfacing effort in United States history. 
</P>
<P>
 To the sound of a small radio sputtering out oldies and the rhythmic scraping 
of trowels, crews from more than a dozen pool plastering companies from as far 
away as Las Vegas smoothed a new surface onto the impoverished community 
college's pool. 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteer effort involved the largest known number of plasterers on a 
single job, said Lyn Paymer, executive director of the National Plasterers 
Council, the only national association of its kind. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't doing it to break any records," Paymer said. "It just worked out 
that way." 
</P>
<P>
 That the T-shirted crews -- usually fierce competitors -- were able to labor 
side-by-side was a step forward for camaraderie among pool plasterers too, said 
Jeff Kerber of Jeff Kerber Pool Plastering. 
</P>
<P>
 "A couple of years ago, a lot of these guys probably wouldn't have even talked 
to each other," Kerber said. "It's a real cutthroat industry. But it's great to 
see them get together to do a volunteer thing, help somebody out and maybe get 
to know each other a little." 
</P>
<P>
 The donation of more than $20,000 in supplies and labor may also improve the 
rapport between swimmers and Pierce administrators, who last year threatened to 
close the 16-year-old pool because of a lack of repair funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The possible closure of the West Valley's premiere outdoor swimming venue 
prompted pool users to form Friends of Pierce Pool, which raises money for pool 
upkeep and, last fall, secured the donation of a water heater from a local 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the walls and floor of the 10-lane pool were pockmarked, no public 
funds had been set aside to replaster them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be swimming along and looking down at whole chunks missing from the 
bottom of the pool," said Harald Johnson, president of the group. "We hope that 
fixing it will encourage the administration to keep the pool open." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said the plasterers council approached his group about the possibility 
of donating the work, to the delight of swimmers and Pierce facilities managers 
alike. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know where we would have found 20 cents for this job," said pool 
manager Eldin Onsgard. "You don't know how happy this makes those of us who 
care about the pool." KURT PITZER

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; ROSEMONT SCHOOL IS NOMINATED FOR HONOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER OLDHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rosemont Middle School is one of just 103 schools statewide to be been 
nominated as a California "Distinguished School." 
</P>
<P>
 If the school wins the title, it will be the third time that Rosemont has held 
the state's highest educational distinction. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosemont was invited to apply for the title because its students scored at or 
above statewide results on California Learning Assessment System tests, said 
Vic Pallos, district spokesman. More than 1,095 seventh- and eighth-graders -- 
primarily from La Crescenta, La Canada and Montrose -- attend the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can count the number of schools on one hand who have been nominated by 
the state for this award three times," Pallos said. The school's test results, 
taken from exams given to eighth-graders for the first time in 1993, included 
75% of Rosemont's students scoring on the fourth and fifth level in reading 
skills. A six is the highest score given. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosemont was recognized as a distinguished school in 1986 and 1990. The school 
also received the national "Blue Ribbon" award in 1985 and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosemont Principal Dr. Lois Neil attributed her school's success to the high 
degree of parent involvement in Rosemont students' lives. The school -- one of 
nearly 1,400 middle schools in the state -- also has a variety of programs 
designed to boost teens' self esteem, keeping them interested in school, Neil 
said. The school allows working parents to volunteer on campus and to attend 
after-school events -- promoting a feeling of community at Rosemont, said 
Gloria Appelin, president of the Rosemont Middle School PTA. 
</P>
<P>
 Two representatives from the California State Department of Education are 
scheduled to visit classes and talk to students, teachers and PTA members at 
Rosemont on Friday. JENNIFER OLDHAM

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HILLS; GROUP WANTS TO MAKE 2 AVENUES ONE-WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to make it harder to deal drugs in the community, a North Hills 
citizens group today plans to seek community support for a proposal that would 
make sections of Orion and Langdon avenues into one-way streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The one-way proposal will be discussed at a 6 p.m. meeting of the North Hills 
Community Coordinating Council at Langdon Avenue Elementary School at 8817 
Langdon Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 An earlier meeting, to discuss ways to fund education and crime-prevention 
programs, is scheduled for 11:30 a.m. at the United Methodist Church at 15435 
Rayen St. 
</P>
<P>
 Both meetings are open to the public. The council is a non-governmental body 
of homeowners and business leaders that advises local politicians on community 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The morning meeting is expected to feature representatives from the offices of 
City Councilmen Joel Wachs, Richard Alarcon and Hal Bernson, Assemblyman 
Richard Katz and Assemblywoman Paula Boland and U.S. Rep. Howard Berman. Local 
school officials are also invited. 
</P>
<P>
 Council President Tony Swan said the morning meeting will assess the 
community's needs in the schools, the Los Angeles Police Department and social 
service agencies. The representatives will be asked to pool their knowledge to 
find resources to tackle these problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have more poverty on Langdon and Orion than they do in South-Central Los 
Angeles, but we keep getting pushed aside as far as city resources," said Swan. 
He said the area has about 40,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The night meeting involves making Langdon and Orion avenues into one-way 
streets between Parthenia and Nordhoff streets. Swan said his group wants to 
present Alarcon's office with the one-way street idea, but not without support 
from neighbors on the streets. "Instead of saying that this is what we're going 
to do, we want community approval," Swan said. JEFF SCHNAUFER

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: COUNCIL TO CONSIDER EXEMPTION PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposal to exempt senior citizens and the disabled from the costs of a 
$100-million school bond issue is scheduled to be considered by the Burbank 
City Council tonight.  
</P>
<P>
 The bond referendum has been scheduled by the Burbank Unified School District 
for April 12 as part of a $138-million plan to rebuild the public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 City and school officials have been working together for almost a year to make 
the plan work. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has promised $23 million in aid to help rebuild the schools, and 
tonight's action is being considered as another way to help the school district 
win the bond vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the exemption program, property owners in Burbank who fall below certain 
poverty guidelines and are older than 62 or are disabled, would not have to pay 
the additional taxes that would be imposed if the $100-million bond passes. The 
city would set up a fund that would be used to reimburse the eligible 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 To be eligible, a property owner would have to have a one-person household 
income of less than $16,900, or less than $19,300 for two people. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who qualify would pay their tax bills, then give the city the proof of 
payment. The city would then reimburse them within five days, said Steve 
Helvey, assistant city manager. 
</P>
<P>
 If the bond issue is approved by two-thirds of the voters, Burbank High 
School, which is about 70 years old, would be completely rebuilt. Burroughs 
High School would be renovated and expanded, and the district's middle schools 
and elementary schools would also be renovated. 
</P>
<P>
 The bonds would cost the owner of a home worth $101,000 about $36 a year, 
according to the district. ED BOND

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: KIDS' ART CHOSEN FOR CONCERT PROGRAM COVER 
</P>

<P>
 It wasn't a job to be envied. 
</P>
<P>
 Intent frowns lingered on the faces of the five judges charged with choosing 
one of 63 children's art projects Monday in Woodland Hills. The artwork they 
sought was to become the face of this season's concerts at Warner Park; it 
would be reproduced on every concert program from June until September. 
</P>
<P>
 And although the volunteer judges were equipped with a strict numerical 
grading system to aid their task, a few seemed weighed down by the 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm taking this very seriously," said Los Angeles City Councilwoman Laura 
Chick, one of the judges, who kept her pen ready on her clipboard as she made 
her way through the gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are all wonderful," said Wendy Marlett, who was trying to keep in mind 
which would reproduce well in the concert program's black and white. 
</P>
<P>
 The event was the second annual Concerts in the Park poster contest sponsored 
by Valley Cultural Center. Fourth-, fifth- and sixth-graders from area schools 
submitted entries, all built around the theme of "Friends, Family and Music." 
</P>
<P>
 The posters featured stick figures shaped like microphones, animated musical 
instruments, harps, birds and beach blankets. One featured a fluegelhorn, 
complete with caption to identify it.  
</P>
<P>
 But in the end, it was the depiction of two dragons playing saxophones that 
distinguished the winning artwork, rendered by 9-year-old Adrienne 
Herbst-Holmes, a fourth-grader at Woodland Hills Elementary School. Adrienne 
described the dragon theme as one she has been developing over the course of 
several artworks and said she prefers drawing to music. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so for third-place winner Erika Leishman, 9, of the same school. Erika 
said her inspiration for a concert scene was simple and literal: Her parents 
take her to the concerts every summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love going," she explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Adrienne will be awarded a $200 savings bond as a prize. Erika will receive a 
$50 savings bond, and second-place winner Evelyn Park of Welby Way Magnet 
School will receive a $100 bond. JILL LEOVY

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SUN VALLEY; GRANT WOULD HELP EXPAND FAMILY CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An East Valley group hopes to expand and renovate a family-care center at a 
Sun Valley school if a $400,000 grant in state funds is approved. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reality is we have very few services in our community," said Deanna 
Chechile, project director for the East Valley Family Care Center at Glenwood 
Elementary School in Sun Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant money would be used to buy new medical equipment and install a 
dental chair that had been donated by the North Hollywood Rotary Club last 
year. It would also pay to renovate two bungalows at the school for use as 
medical offices and a place for counseling sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Family Care Center started in October, 1992, as the Glenwood Family Care 
Center, offering medical screenings and immunizations for students. It expanded 
last year after the East Valley Partnership Community Council acquired a 
$50,000 state grant and $5,000 each from the Los Angeles Unified School 
District and the Sun Valley Community Venture Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Three other schools -- Roscoe Elementary in Sun Valley and Camilla and Arminta 
elementary schools in North Hollywood -- joined in a coalition with Glenwood to 
use the facility to help families in nearby neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 The center is now also being used for gang-intervention programs for parents 
offered through the Los Angeles County Department of Probation. Counseling 
services are being offered by the Valley Community Clinic in North Hollywood 
and have helped those traumatized by the Northridge earthquake, Chechile said. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if state funding is not approved, Chechile said that parents 
supporting the center through the East Valley Partnership Community Council 
plan to keep the center open and staffed with volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant application was made Tuesday by the Los Angeles Unified School 
District on behalf of the center, Chechile said. The center will learn if it 
has won the grant by May 2. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant money is being made available through a state program to provide 
services to schools with low-income students and their families. And, for the 
first time, the center is also looking for help from private foundations or 
corporate sponsorships. ED BOND

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; HIGH SCHOOLERS OFFERED BUSINESS INTERNSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Some of San Fernando High School's fledgling tycoons will soon have the 
opportunity to gain work experience through "IP '94", a six-week internship 
program for business-minded seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, sponsored by the San Fernando Chamber of Commerce, will give a 
group of students the opportunity to gain work experience at a business that 
corresponds with their career interests, said Joe Sandoval, president of the 
San Fernando Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to see how we can get young people integrated with the business 
community," Sandoval said. "It's a way to have students learn something about 
what they have indicated is their field of interest. That way, if they have 
doubts, they have plenty of time to change their mind." 
</P>
<P>
 About 15 students from the school's Business Academy, a branch of the school 
formed last year to get students interested in business, will be paired up with 
15 companies the week of April 18. 
</P>
<P>
 The students will report to the businesses for two hours every Monday and 
Thursday, earning 24 hours of work experience by the end of the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will see what it is like to actually be in the business world, what some 
of the responsibilities are," said Arlene Rosenblatt, who is in charge of the 
Business Academy, which contains about 60 students. "And maybe if some of them 
do well enough they can get a job." 
</P>
<P>
 The San Fernando Chamber of Commerce got the idea for the internship program 
after sponsoring a mentor program last October. In that program, about 50 
students from the Business Academy spent a day learning how local businesses 
operate. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: OFFICIALS WANT FEWER FALSE ALARM CALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Council member Laura Chick, who represents a section of the San Fernando 
Valley, and Police Commissioner Art Mattox are expected today to announce an 
effort to reduce the number of false alarms by home and business security 
systems.  
</P>
<P>
 The effort is aimed at increasing the amount of time police spend fighting 
crime on the streets and reducing the time they spend responding to false 
alarms, a Chick spokesperson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Los Angeles Police Department responded to about 161,000 
security alarm calls. About 95% of them turned out to be false, triggered 
either by human error, faulty equipment or bad weather, according to police and 
city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 False alarms account for about 17% of all calls police respond to, city 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 That amounts to hundreds of police hours wasted, said Karen R. Constine, 
Chick's chief of staff. "If we could address the false alarm problem, you could 
have a lot more police patrolling our streets," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Constine said Chick and Mattox will try to institute new deterrents to reduce 
the number of false alarms. 
</P>
<P>
 Police currently issue an $80 fine for each false alarm after four false calls 
within a 12-month period. But Chick and Mattox want the fine to be levied after 
the third false alarm. 
</P>
<P>
 Chick and Mattox will also propose a crackdown on the owners of home and 
business alarms who fail to pay the LAPD's $30 annual alarm-registration fee. 
The money is used to partly reimburse the city for responding to false alarms.

EMOTIONAL DEBATE EXPECTED OVER COYOTE TRAPPING BAN; WOODLAND HILLS: MEETING 
WILL CAP MONTHS OF ARGUMENT BETWEEN RESIDENTS WHO WANT PROHIBITION LIFTED AND 
CONSERVATIONISTS WHO OPPOSE KILLING THE ANIMALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A long and emotional debate is expected Wednesday night when the Los Angeles 
Board of Animal Regulation Commissioners meets in Woodland Hills to decide 
whether to continue a nine-month ban on coyote trapping. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-anticipated meeting will climax months of verbal jousting between 
wildlife conservationists, who oppose the trapping as inhumane, and residents, 
mostly from the West San Fernando Valley, who support trapping to protect pets 
and small children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, we are expecting a very, very large turnout," said Michael Lazarou, 
a Woodland Hills resident who formed a Valley homeowners group that wants the 
city to lift the trapping ban. "I wouldn't be surprised if it were standing 
room only." 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing will be held at 7 p.m. at Parkman Middle School, 20800 Burbank 
Blvd. in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 A previous hearing on the matter became so emotional that several speakers 
came close to tears and one man was escorted away by security officers after he 
accused an animal regulation officer of wrongdoing for shooting a coyote. 
</P>
<P>
 Warring between the pro- and anti-trapping groups began almost immediately 
after the Board of Animal Regulation Commissioners decided in June to halt 
coyote trapping. The decision was partly in response to pressure from wildlife 
advocates. But commissioners said later that the $100,000 annual cost of the 
trapping program was also key to their decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, increased coyote sightings, particularly in the hillside 
neighborhoods of the West Valley, have prompted board members to review the 
ban. Animal regulation officers attribute the increase in sightings to the 
abundance of food and small wildlife, the trapping ban and wildfires that drove 
coyotes into urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
 In their battle to sway the panel, both sides have contacted city officials, 
issued press releases and collected signatures on petitions. The debate has 
sparked so much interest that the ABC news program "20/20" aired a segment on 
the coyote trapping controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, a spokesperson from each side will be given 15 minutes to 
present their arguments. Other speakers from the public will be allowed one 
minute each to speak. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Bell, an Encino resident and vice president of the Wildlife Protection 
League, will speak in favor of keeping the ban in place. He has argued that 
preventive measures, such as bringing pets indoors and fencing back yards, will 
address the coyote problem in a more humane and effective way than trapping. 
</P>
<P>
 By law, coyotes that are trapped must be killed. State law also prohibits the 
city from relocating coyotes to other areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell said his group has presented the city a petition with 8,000 signatures 
and plans to present at least 300 more signatures Wednesday. In addition to the 
signatures, Bell said wildlife experts will testify in favor of continuing the 
ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Malvin Sumner, a longtime Woodland Hills resident, will speak in favor of 
lifting the ban. In the past, he has argued that the city should use traps to 
protect pets and children from the few "problem" coyotes that enter urban 
neighborhoods in search of food. 
</P>
<P>
 Also expected to speak is the mother of a young girl who was allegedly killed 
by a coyote in Glendale in 1981. Lazarou, who says his toddler son was stalked 
by a coyote in his back yard in December, will also speak.

DALE POE AVOIDS BAN BY FILING LOBBYING REPORT; ETHICS: DEVELOPER STILL FACES 
$2,000 FINE FOR MISSING ORIGINAL DEADLINE. COUNTY OFFICIALS CONCEDE THAT 
PAPERWORK WAS LATE DUE TO DEATH OF COMPANY'S FOUNDER. 
</P>

<P>
 A major development firm avoided a ban on doing business with Los Angeles 
County on Monday by finally filing a quarterly report on its lobbying activity. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dale Poe Development Corp. of Agoura listed no activity in the report, 
filed two months late and one day before the county Board of Supervisors is 
scheduled to consider a $2,000 fine against the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed sanction would be the first under the new, tough ordinance on 
lobbying, according to Larry Monteilh, executive officer of the Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials do not suspect any wrongdoing and attribute the delay to a 
shake-up in the firm following the death of founder Dale Poe last May. County 
officials say they are proceeding with action against the firm -- which last 
November also paid a $250 fine for registering late as a lobbyist employer -- 
because the ordinance does not provide for an indefinite deadline extension. 
</P>
<P>
 "I prefer not to do this," said Monteilh. "But these are the rules." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Stevenson, vice president of Dale Poe, acknowledged that the company has 
been tardy in complying with the county ordinance, but said the past several 
months have been an especially trying time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our company is going through some changes now," said Stevenson. "We're in a 
transition period." 
</P>
<P>
 Last May, company owners Poe, 61, and his wife, Margaret, 54, died in an auto 
accident. Since then, the company has been reorganizing and some paperwork has 
fallen through the cracks, said Stevenson. He said that the county paperwork is 
confusing and difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dale Poe firm, best known for building Stevenson Ranch, a master-planned 
housing community in Santa Clarita, has contributed along with its principals 
more than $80,000 in campaign funds to county supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 And the company has in the past enlisted the aid of some of the more 
successful and visible lobbyists that work the Hall of Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Simms, a registered lobbyist who has represented Poe to the county, 
said: "It's probably just an oversight because of a death in the family."  
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen Crow, another registered lobbyist who has done work for Poe, said the 
proposed county sanctions seem unduly severe. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is so minor, I can't believe it," said Crow. "I was astonished" to hear 
of the county's potential sanction against the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Simms and Crow are properly registered with the county, and neither are 
involved in the action against Dale Poe. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the county's lobbyist registration ordinance was strengthened last 
April, 219 lobbyists and companies employing lobbyists have registered, 
according to John McKibben, deputy executive officer to the Board of 
Supervisors. The law was an attempt by the county to get tough on ethics 
violations after its previous lobbyist registration ordinance was roundly 
ignored because it carried no serious sanctions. Just 13 lobbyists and 
employers filed under the previous law. 
</P>
<P>
 The tougher ordinance requires lobbyists and the companies that hire them to 
submit quarterly reports on all money spent on lobbying activities, including 
campaign contributions. Companies and special interest groups that spend more 
than $5,000 on public relations campaigns to influence county officials also 
have to report their expenses, even if they do not hire a lobbyist. The law 
also prohibits lobbyists from giving a gift with a value of more than $50 to 
public officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Violators face fines of up $2,000, and late registration fines of $250. Firms 
that fail to comply with the law could have county contracts canceled or 
denied, and may be cut off from any county dealings, such as building permits, 
until the company complies with the law.

MAN DIES IN FREAK AUTO ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Thousand Oaks man was killed in a freak traffic accident Monday when a tire 
from a vehicle traveling in the opposite direction on the Golden State Freeway 
came off and slammed into the victim's windshield, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred about 5:18 p.m. on the northbound side of the freeway 
near the Burbank Boulevard exit, said CHP Officer Shirley Gaines. 
</P>
<P>
 The southbound car lost its left rear tire, which bounced over the center 
divider and struck the unidentified victim's car, crashing through the 
windshield and causing massive head injuries, said CHP Sgt. Ralph Elvira. The 
victim lost control of his car and slammed into two other cars before crashing 
into the center divider, Elvira said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 48-year-old victim, whose name was withheld pending notification of next 
of kin, was taken to Thompson Memorial Medical Center, where he was pronounced 
dead on arrival, said Elvira. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the vehicle that lost the tire was not injured in the crash, 
Elvira said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That person didn't know what happened until the officers arrived," he said.

VALLEY INTERVIEW: NEWHALL LAND EMPLOYEES GIVE WORK TIME TO THE COMMUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many area companies encourage employees to do volunteer work after hours or on 
weekends. And, surprisingly in these hard times, some local firms allow 
employees to volunteer on company time. A notable example is the Newhall Land & 
Farming Co., which is developing the town of Valencia. Chairman and Chief 
Executive Thomas Lee, a 23-year Newhall veteran, has been involved in Valencia 
community organizations including its YMCA, the Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial 
Hospital, the Boys & Girls Club and the Child & Family Development Center. Lee, 
currently chairman of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, was interviewed by 
staff writer Jill Bettner. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Newhall has about 250 employees. How many are actively involved in 
the community?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: About 50 of our employees are active in various activities here in 
Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Why does the company give them time off for those activities during work 
hours?  
</P>
<P>
 A. We don't really have a written policy about that. But if our volunteers 
have to take some time out of the work day to go to a meeting of a nonprofit 
organization or help with a project, we don't worry about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Doesn't that hurt employee productivity?  
</P>
<P>
 A. Everybody here knows they have a job to do, and we leave it up to them 
pretty much how they get it done. They're responsible people. If they need to 
come in the office later for an hour or two, we know they'll do it. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. So that's how Newhall can afford a fairly uncommon practice?  
</P>
<P>
 A. Right, giving employees that kind of flexibility doesn't cost much. We also 
contribute money to all these organizations we're involved in. We consider all 
of it to be a great investment in the community that just comes back to us many 
times over. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What exactly are those dividends?  
</P>
<P>
 A. Certainly one of our key reasons for supporting volunteer work is that 
strong community organizations make Valencia a better place. And strong 
community organizations persuade more people to live here and more businesses 
to relocate here. 
</P>
<P>
 I think volunteerism has also opened up the lines of communication between us 
and the community. It says there are real people running Newhall and we're not 
just some big impersonal company. If somebody hears a rumor or something they 
can pick up the phone and call somebody they know here or see them at the next 
Boys & Girls Club meeting.  
</P>
<P>
 Q. Anything else?  
</P>
<P>
 A. Our ability to be successful in continuing to build the community of 
Valencia is very much tied to what the community thinks of us. Whether they 
have confidence in us and respect us for what we're doing. So for us, being 
involved in the community is a two-way street -- people can clearly see we're 
trying to make this a better place to live and work. Second, when you get your 
employees involved in a variety of activities in the community, you get to know 
the leaders in that community. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Does community involvement also help appease corporate critics, such as 
certain environmental groups that have opposed some of Newhall's development 
plans in the past?  
</P>
<P>
 A. It's not an effort to appease anybody. It's an effort to communicate as 
effectively and straightforwardly as we can with the community.  
</P>
<P>
 Q. What do employees say they get out of volunteering?  
</P>
<P>
 A. Personal satisfaction, I think that's really it. It's enabled me personally 
to meet a lot of wonderful people in the community that maybe I wouldn't have 
gotten to know otherwise. There are lots of ways people seek and obtain 
gratification in their lives -- through their families, through religious 
pursuits, through work. A fourth way is to be involved in these organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Have any community-service programs been especially popular with employees? 
 
</P>
<P>
 A. A program called Business Buddies has been very popular. It's a really neat 
program with Helmers Elementary and Meadows Elementary in Valencia where about 
a dozen employees adopt a classroom and help the teacher any way they can. 
Somebody in our computer department might help the teacher set up computers, 
for example. Another employee might go read to the kids every couple of weeks 
or give a talk on what kind of education they would need to do different kinds 
of jobs we have at Newhall. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Do employees ever get over-involved in volunteer projects, to the extent 
that their work suffers?  
</P>
<P>
 A. That hasn't been a serious issue. Over the last 10 years, it's happened 
twice where I've felt somebody was doing so much in the community that it was 
interfering with their work. I've sat down with them, discussed what their 
personal goals were in life and gotten them back on track. I don't think we've 
ever lost somebody because of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Does Newhall have any rules about which organizations are acceptable if 
employee-volunteers expect any company time off ? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Generally, our policy is that an organization be nonprofit. We steer away 
from political and religious groups and look for groups that have generated 
strong support from others in the community. We don't want to be the only one 
in the community supporting something. We want to get involved because the 
community thinks it's important. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. How important do you think corporate volunteers are to most charities?  
</P>
<P>
 A. Critical. They all need help. They're always underfunded, always need 
staff. They all desperately need volunteer support. You can tell when you do 
any little thing for them. It's great. You can just feel you're making a 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Does Newhall have a special obligation to Valencia because it is building 
the town as a master-planned community?  
</P>
<P>
 A. Absolutely, and that has always been our concept. When you're developing a 
community, you're doing a lot more than building homes, industrial buildings 
and office parks. Those are the physical parts of a community, but you're also 
developing the social parts as well. We have a lot of people coming in here, 
they're house-poor, both working. They don't necessarily have time to get 
involved in nonprofit organizations to the same degree as you might find in a 
more established community. So, we've really put some effort into getting 
things like that started here ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Did the company focus on establishing any particular community 
organizations?  
</P>
<P>
 A. Going back at least 20 years, there have been four big things we've been 
involved in getting here. One was California Institute of the Arts, where we 
contributed half of the land as enticement for them to come here. 
</P>
<P>
 Another was College of the Canyons, and we did the equivalent thing there, 
selling the land for half its appraised value. The third thing was Henry Mayo 
Newhall Memorial Hospital, for which we also contributed the land. The Newhall 
family foundation and individual family members contributed the initial equity 
so the hospital could sell bonds to raise the balance of the funds it needed.

2 GROUPS ACCUSED OF CAMPAIGN VIOLATIONS; ELECTION: COMPLAINT SAYS THE 
ORGANIZATIONS FAILED TO FILE FUNDING REPORTS. BOTH ARE SEEKING TO RECALL STATE 
SEN. DAVID ROBERTI. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two groups seeking to oust state Sen. David Roberti in an upcoming April 12 
recall election were accused Monday of violating state laws that require them 
to disclose who is funding their political activities. 
</P>
<P>
 In a complaint filed with the state Fair Political Practices Commission, the 
Coalition to Restore Government Integrity and Californians Against Corruption 
were accused of failing to file two campaign finance reports each, one that was 
due Jan. 31, the other March 3. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are denying voters the right to know," said Cecilia Gallardo, local 
government affairs director for California Common Cause, the private political 
watchdog organization that filed Monday's complaint. Common Cause urged the 
FPPC to seek an injunction against the two anti-Roberti groups, forcing the two 
groups to immediately submit their reports. 
</P>
<P>
 The FPPC enforces the state Political Reform Act, requiring candidates and 
organizations that raise more than $1,000 to periodically file reports showing 
who contributed money to them and how they spent the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Roberti campaign accused its foes of not filing the disclosure 
statements to hide the fact that the recall effort is primarily funded by 
"assault weapons extremists" seeking revenge against Roberti because of his 
support of a 1989 ban on military-style semiautomatic rifles. 
</P>
<P>
 Staci Walters, campaign press secretary for Roberti, also claimed that 
Californians Against Corruption has a history of abusing the state's Political 
Reform Act, even when it appears to comply. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, she noted, the group's FPPC disclosure reports failed to show a 
$5,000 contribution from the National Rifle Assn. and another $1,000 from 
California Gun Owners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The FPPC declined to comment on the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Californians Against Corruption spokesman, Russ Howard, said his 
group fully intends to file a disclosure report soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a grass-roots organization," Howard said Monday. "We don't have a 
full-time, paid campaign consultant or campaign accountant, like Roberti does. 
We had to make a choice, either file the report or get out a piece of campaign 
mail. We don't have the resources to do both. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided we were not going to sacrifice our right to participate in the 
democratic process and our right to get our message out to voters in order to 
do the FPPC filing," he said. "We're not trying to hide anything." 
</P>
<P>
 The entire anti-Roberti coalition, Howard said, probably raised $100,000 in 
campaign contributions during the last six months of 1993 to fund its drive to 
qualify the recall for the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the sources of the money, Howard said that he has never tried to 
hide the fact that much of the money has come from "firearms rights people." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the complaint filed Monday was that the anti-Roberti groups did not 
file reports covering the last six months of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard declined to give an estimate of how much money that Californians 
Against Corruption had raised and spent since Jan. 1. The Roberti foes were 
required to file a statement on March 3 covering their financial activities for 
the first two months of 1994.

YOUNG BOSNIAN AUTHOR LONGS FOR NORMAL LIFE; GLENDALE: ABOUT 150 PEOPLE ATTEND A 
BOOK SIGNING BY 13-YEAR-OLD ZLATA FILIPOVIC, WHOSE DIARY FROM WAR-TORN SARAJEVO 
HAS MADE HER AN INTERNATIONAL CELEBRITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Zlata Filipovic, the Bosnian teen-ager whose diary brought the everyday 
reality of the bloody Balkan war to life, said Monday she wishes to shed her 
sudden celebrity status to once again become a young girl. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very much looking forward to school, to being a kid again," Zlata said at 
a book-signing appearance at the Super Crown bookstore in Glendale. She hopes 
to start the eighth grade in Paris after the Easter holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 About 150 people crowded around as Zlata, 13, read 10 passages from her 
197-page memoirs, "Zlata's Diary: A Child's Life in Sarajevo." 
</P>
<P>
 The daughter of a chemist and a lawyer, Zlata began keeping a diary two years 
ago when she was about to enter the fifth grade. The bestseller chronicles her 
journey from MTV and birthday parties to sniper fire and long days spent 
trapped in a cold cellar with little or nothing to eat. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the readings from the diary, each of which Zlata began with "Dear 
Mimmy," a made-up friend, was one on June 29, 1992. "BOREDOM!!! SHOOTING!!! 
SHELLING!!! PEOPLE BEING KILLED!!! DESPAIR!!! HUNGER!!! MISERY!!! FEAR!!!" 
Zlata, who said the diary quickly became her best friend because she could not 
go outside to play with schoolmates, also read a passage from May 7, 1992, the 
day her best friend, Nina, was killed when a shell fell on the park where Nina 
was playing. "A piece of shrapnel lodged in her brain and she died. She was 
such a sweet, nice little girl. Is it possible I'll never see Nina again?" 
</P>
<P>
 The book signing was the first stop on a brief West Coast promotional tour by 
the Bosnian girl, who is scheduled to read her diary and answer questions from 
Los Angeles Unified School District students today at the Simon Wiesenthal 
Center in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Erin Condit-Bergren, 12, who attended Monday's reading, said the diary taught 
her how fortunate she was to be able to "curl up and read a book and watch 
television." 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of us come from sheltered lives in the suburbs. Zlata can show us what 
real life is like," Erin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zlata said she is sad her book hasn't "stopped the war," but hopes it has 
helped "all the people that read it and the newspaper articles and hear me talk 
to think about the war for at least five minutes. . . . Maybe they won't 
forget." 
</P>
<P>
 The diary was responsible for Zlata's escape along with her parents, Malik and 
Alica, from war-torn Sarajevo to Paris in December. 
</P>
<P>
 After reading a 45-page excerpt of the diary published by UNICEF, the French 
minister of defense arranged for the family to be taken from Sarajevo to Paris 
by armored car under cover of darkness. UNICEF printed the excerpt in Sarajevo 
in Zlata's native Croat on the suggestion of Zlata's teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 After her escape, Zlata embarked on a whirlwind international tour to promote 
the book. This tour included a visit to America, where Viking won the rights to 
print the diary after bidding $540,000 at a January auction. 
</P>
<P>
 The publisher quickly printed 200,000 hardcover copies of the diary because of 
an urgent need to get Zlata's message out, said Paul Slovak, director of 
publicity for Viking. 
</P>
<P>
 Zlata also toured Universal Studios on Monday, which paid a reported $1 
million for the film rights to the diary and has drafted "Field of Dreams" 
director Phil Robinson to direct the drama. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of her American tour, Zlata met President Clinton last week, who 
assured her that politicians will quit fighting like "kids" -- as she calls 
them in her diary -- and will work to bring an end to the Balkan conflict.

BIKE, JOGGING PATH ALONG SANTA CLARA RIVER EXPECTED TO BE BUILT NEXT YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A bicycle and jogging lane that runs parallel to the Santa Clara River is 
expected to be constructed next year, but planners aren't sure of its exact 
cost or route. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council tonight will authorize the bid process for work on the Chuck 
Pontius Commuter Rail Trail, a three-mile corridor along the river and Soledad 
Canyon Road, between Camp Plenty Bridge in Canyon Country and the Santa Clarita 
Transit Center in Saugus. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita has $1.05 million in state transportation funds to spend on the 
project. A bare-bones trail can be built for $1 million, but amenities such as 
lighting or landscaping could drive the cost up to $3.6 million, said city 
civil engineer Kit Nell. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is our one opportunity to clean up the Soledad corridor," said Nell. 
"We'd like to take advantage of it." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed corridor would be 25- to 30-feet wide with two six-foot asphalt 
lanes for bicycles, a five-foot decomposed granite jogging track, a four- to 
eight-foot concrete sidewalk and five feet of landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost concerns may whittle down the corridor to little more than the basic 
asphalt path. Added costs include up to $900,000 for landscaping, $800,000 to 
remove billboards and reimburse owners for the loss of income, $750,000 to bury 
electrical lines at the corridor's east end, $325,000 for trail lights and 
$275,000 for Soledad Canyon Road street lights. 
</P>
<P>
 Cyclists can still ride on Soledad Canyon Road, which no longer has a bike 
lane, but the off-road trail is considered safer for commuting. The corridor is 
named after James (Chuck) Pontius III, a 28-year-old city employee who was 
struck by a car and killed March 31, 1993, in Val Verde while bicycling. 
</P>
<P>
 Crews removed the bike lane from Soledad Canyon Road on Monday to add a third 
traffic lane in each direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Funds set aside for future work on Santa Clarita's planned 25-mile network of 
trails might be shifted to fund trail improvements, but there are no plans to 
charge residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not even considered as an option at this point," Nell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The trail is to be south of Soledad Canyon Road, but its exact route is 
undetermined. A public meeting is scheduled for April 25 at 7 p.m. at the 
William S. Hart Union High School District main office to discuss specific 
alignments for the trail. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction of the Chuck Pontius Commuter Rail Trail is scheduled to begin in 
1995 and take about three months to complete.

MAN JAILED AFTER RAFT IS SHOT ON LAKE; CRIME: SUNBATHER IS UNHURT AS INFLATABLE 
DEVICE IS SUNK. TRANSIENT IS ARRESTED AFTER EIGHT-MILE FREEWAY CHASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An inflatable raft was shot out from under a bather on Lake Elizabeth Monday 
and a 43-year-old transient was arrested a short time later, after leading 
police on an eight-mile freeway chase. 
</P>
<P>
 Enzo Orello was taken into custody by the California Highway Patrol after he 
was spotted traveling northbound on the Golden State Freeway in a van matching 
the description of the vehicle used by a gunman who sank the raft with several 
shots at about 8:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The unidentified man in the raft was not injured in the attack and was able to 
swim to shore, authorities said.He gave authorities a description of both the 
armed suspect he saw standing on the bank and of the van the suspect drove off 
in, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 CHP Officer Brian Lottermoser said he saw Orello make an illegal lane change 
on the freeway and believed the van matched the description of the vehicle that 
had been identified as the suspect's. 
</P>
<P>
 Lottermoser said he chased Orello eight miles north on the Golden State 
Freeway before Orello pulled over and was arrested without incident. The CHP 
knew of no motive for the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Orello was booked on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon at the Los 
Angeles County Sheriff Department's Santa Clarita station. His bail was set at 
$55,000, authorities said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; CITY OPENS LONG-AWAITED RAIL OVERPASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON MOESER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The freight and commuter trains that several times a day stop east-west 
traffic in Lancaster will no longer be a problem for drivers on busy Avenue L. 
</P>
<P>
 With much pomp and circumstance, the city Monday opened its long-awaited 
$12.4-million Avenue L overpass, the first of two railroad over-crossings 
planned as part of a network of roads that will create a loop system around the 
perimeter of Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "Welcome to the Avenue L overpass," Mayor Arnie Rodio told about 100 local 
leaders and residents. "It only took 30 years to get here." 
</P>
<P>
 One reason that it took so long was that the city's original method of 
financing the overpass was challenged in court. Lancaster wanted to pay for the 
project, budgeted at $14 million, with money from its Redevelopment Agency's 
low- and moderate-income housing fund. 
</P>
<P>
 A two-year legal battle ended last month when the state Supreme Court declined 
to reconsider a lower-court ruling that rejected the use of the restricted 
funds for the overpass, which city officials believe will lead to an increase 
in development on the east side of the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I truly believe this is going to change how we do business in this town," 
Councilman George Runner said. "It's going to open up the east side. I think in 
a couple years we'll wonder how we did it before." 
</P>
<P>
 The overpass, measuring 2,542 feet end-to-end with a bridge 25 feet high and 
350 feet long, can carry up to 70,000 vehicles daily. 
</P>
<P>
 When the overpass was opened Monday, it carried the Antelope Valley High 
School marching band, more than a dozen vintage cars carrying city officials 
and a host of residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster Councilman Frank Roberts, who said the view of the Antelope Valley 
was fantastic from atop the bridge, believes the overpass represents a "new 
era" in the region. Construction on the second railroad overpass, on Avenue H, 
is slated to begin in July.

THE WEEK AHEAD: KIEV; ELECTIONS IN UKRAINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ukrainians will go to the polls Sunday for their first elections since 
independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.More than 3,600 candidates will 
contest 450 seats in the Rada, Ukraine's Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the competitors are the Communist Party, powered by ethnic Russian 
industrial managers from the eastern Ukrainian rust belt; Rukh, the movement 
that agitated for independence before the disintegration of the Soviet Union, 
and nationalists who are up in arms over a separatist movement in the 
Russian-dominated Crimea. 
</P>
<P>
 If President Leonid M. Kravchuk finds himself with a Rada dominated by 
Communist or nationalist forces, he will likely be forced to face presidential 
elections in June.

NEXT STEP; ITALY / TURNING POINT; DISGUSTED WITH CORRUPTION, VOTERS LOOK RIGHT 
AND LEFT FOR A POLITICAL REBIRTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM D. MONTALBANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maria Luisa Boccia, a rookie political candidate puzzling out campaign tactics 
in a smoky basement headquarters, symbolizes her expectant and perplexed 
country. Boccia knows where she wants to go, but isn't sure how to get there. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy heads this weekend into national elections marked by scandal, 
uncertainty and unlikely alliances, all punctuated by tumult enough for a 
temperamental diva. 
</P>
<P>
 But none of the tempest should obscure the significance of the balloting 
Sunday and Monday: the election marks a traumatic, ground-breaking search for 
political rebirth in a rich but leaderless country disgusted with its corrupt 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 A radically re-textured political fabric has divided into forces of the left, 
center and right, all gathering for a high-stakes leap into an unclear future. 
</P>
<P>
 Reformers once portrayed the election as a preface to a more open and honest 
"Second Republic," a renewed democracy with overhauled and modernized 
structures of government. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, it seems unlikely that the voting will produce either a clear-cut winner 
or the decisive, new-look rule that most Italians say they seek. Nonetheless, 
it will be pivotal. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are fed up; the political system has collapsed. If we can't restore 
legality and legitimacy to government, democracy itself is at risk," said 
Boccia, the first-time candidate who is running under the banner of a left-wing 
alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 A philosophy professor, Boccia, 48, is one of hundreds of newcomers vying for 
parliamentary seats in the two days of voting. They range from left-wing 
academics to technocrat engineers, doctors, businessmen and journalists. And 
they all promise a moral reawakening as the foundation for modern, 
post-ideological government in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief among the debuting candidates is self-professed anti-Communist crusader 
Silvio Berlusconi, one of the country's richest men and -- suddenly -- Italy's 
most popular politician. 
</P>
<P>
 He portrays himself as the one figure who could short-circuit chances of a 
leftist victory. The collapse of international communism had made Italy's left 
less threatening, and the subsequent decimation by scandal of its domestic 
opponents had elevated it to the position of clear election favorite until 
Berlusconi jumped into the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Five former prime ministers, several Cabinet ministers and numerous 
parliamentarians, along with some of the country's most prominent 
industrialists, have been scarred by a two-year investigation that has 
documented official corruption. More than 3,000 in all have been touched by the 
probe, which has uncovered millions of dollars of theft and illegal payments to 
politicians of virtually every party in every part of the country. The scandal 
has provoked national soul-searching and personal tragedy. Well-known Italian 
officials and business leaders were among almost a dozen who took their lives 
after being implicated in the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone knew, everyone is guilty," former Prime Minister Bettino Craxi, 
himself under investigation, told a magistrate in Milan who inquired how deeply 
ran the rot. 
</P>
<P>
 Known to Italians as Tangentopoli, or "Kickback City," the expanding scandal 
centers on years of payoffs for public contracts, most of them made to 
political parties. 
</P>
<P>
 The Christian Democrats, so long esteemed by Italians, Washington and the 
Vatican alike as a bulwark against communism, stand foremost among the major 
parties painted with ignominy by judicial inquiry. Their principal allies in an 
unbroken skein of political power that has lasted nearly half a century also 
have been shamed, including Craxi's Socialist Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, seeking a break with the past, Italy has fashioned a new electoral 
system, scrapping proportional, vote-for-parties rules that have produced 52 
weak, look-alike coalition governments since World War II, all of them forged 
in smoke-filled rooms far from public gaze. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the reforms, Italians will vote for individual candidates for the first 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Three-quarters of 630 deputies and 315 senators will be elected in the 
winner-take-all, American style. Probably for the last time, the remaining 
seats will be distributed proportionally, allowing continued representation by 
sliver parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Also for the first time, candidates are campaigning, all'Americana , in 
factories, supermarkets, schools and neighborhood coffee bars to sell 
themselves and their programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I try to meet people outside a post office or a hospital, there is a 
great curiosity about who I am and what I think," said Boccia, a member of the 
renamed Italian Communist Party who is running against a centrist and a 
rightist in the working class San Giovanni district of Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 National issues preoccupying Italian voters parallel those in the rest of 
Europe: recession, employment and job security, social service, taxes, 
privatization, government debt and bureaucratic inefficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy's overriding down-home concern, though, is the quest for moral 
authority. With institutional credibility hostage to scandal, voters tell 
pollsters that they are perplexed and mistrusting. 
</P>
<P>
 "The children of Tangentopoli are confused, lost. They need security and don't 
know where to find it," said the Rome newspaper La Repubblica in an analysis of 
a recent opinion poll. "They want a candidate who is innovative, but mature; 
who has experience but is honest." 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Silvio Berlusconi.  
</P>
<P>
 At 57, he is a self-made industrialist, billionaire and media baron whose 
holdings range from advertising agencies and magazines to the country's three 
largest private television networks, to red-and-black Milan, which is Italy's, 
and perhaps the world's, most famous professional soccer team. 
</P>
<P>
 In a delicious play on words in a country where cardinals are referred to as 
"Sua Eminenza," (Your Eminence,) Italian newspapers call Berlusconi "Sua 
Emittenza," (Your Broadcastship.) 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Surveying the Italian political universe late last year from his 
entrepreneur's perch in Milan, Berlusconi did not like what he saw. With 
Christian Democrats under Mino Martinazzoli in disarray and about to split, the 
center was shrinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Reformer Mario Segni, who was responsible for the electoral reform, seemed 
slow and weak in forming a centrist movement called Pact for Italy (Patto Per 
L'Italia) as focus for a new center -- the traditional home for 30% to 40% of 
Italian voters, most of them conservative Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
 In the absence of a strong center, Berlusconi concluded, the most likely 
winner of the election would be the left, led by the former Communist Party, 
long Italy's second-largest political movement and since 1991 called the Party 
of the Democratic Left, PDS for its acronym in Italian. 
</P>
<P>
 Under bland, self-effacing party leader Achille Occhetto, the former 
Communists have persuaded most Italians that they are just that: their 
pro-U.S., pro-NATO, pro-Europe policies are social democratic, and their 
pro-privatization economics conservative enough to draw applause for Occhetto 
on a recent visit to The City, London's financial district. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to hold together efficiency and solidarity," he said there, proposing 
lower taxes for families and businesses and more productive government 
investments. His party's platform calls for "a government of reconstruction" to 
continue privatization and the reduction of Italy's huge public debt, a 
campaign now directed by Prime Minister Carlo Ciampi. 
</P>
<P>
 Edging pointedly toward the center, Occhetto said he would even support 
another prime ministerial term for Ciampi, an apolitical technocrat and widely 
respected former central bank president. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington, which laid on all sail to help keep Communists out of Italian 
governments during the Cold War, has given clear signals that it would view a 
lefist PDS-led government without alarm this time around. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi is not sure, arguing that any government led by former Communists 
would be "an intolerant regime" poisonous for business. Even with a new name, 
the former Communists have "a mentality and a way of acting that is still pure 
Stalinist, pure dictatorship," said the billionaire businessman, whom admirers 
sometimes compare to Ross Perot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not want to live in an illiberal country governed by immature forces and 
men closely tied to a politically and economically bankrupt past," Berlusconi 
said in January, announcing that he would personally lead his new right-wing 
movement, which is called Forza Italia (Go, Italy), a rallying cry of Italian 
sports fans. 
</P>
<P>
 At the head of 267 Forza Italia candidates across the country -- all of them, 
like their party leader, seeking national office for the first time -- 
Berlusconi is running for a parliamentary seat from central Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 When a ban on further publication of poll results went into effect 10 days 
ago, Forza Italia, the newest national political movement, was also its most 
popular. The last sounding gave the right 43% (26% for Forza Italia); the left 
38% (20% for the former Communists), and the center, dominated by the Christian 
Democrats, now called the Italian Peoples' Party, the remaining 19%. 
</P>
<P>
 In search of a parliamentary majority of the right, Berlusconi has acquired 
two electoral allies: Umberto Bossi, the bumptious head of the 
populist-federalist Northern League (7%) and Gianfranco Fini, polished boss of 
Italian neo-fascists newly renamed the National Alliance (10%). 
</P>
<P>
 The rightist parties have agreed on common candidates in most districts. But 
candidates are answerable to their own parties, and the prospect of effective 
governmental collaboration among the three movements is dim. 
</P>
<P>
 Bossi, who threatens secession of the rich north, will have nothing to do with 
Fini, whose support is strongest in the south. Bossi also rails publicly 
against Berlusconi for his ties to the old order and to his friend Craxi. 
Berlusconi has been personally untouched by Tangentopoli, but his younger 
brother Paolo and five managers of his Fininvest financial empire are under 
judicial scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, the former Communists have forged an eight-party Progressive 
Alliance that includes Greens, an anti-Mafia party, leftist Catholics and -- 
embarrass ingly -- a hard-line splinter of the old Communist Party backed by 
about one voter in 20. Called Refounded Communism, it is still loudly Marxist 
in its rhetoric and program -- and profoundly discomfiting to would-be 
statesman Occhetto, who dreams of a place in government for his party after 
almost 50 years in opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Confronted with a confusing new political constellation, many voters will not 
make up their minds until the last minute, but judging from the last polls 
Italians will see before they vote, neither left nor right will emerge with a 
parliamentary majority. 
</P>
<P>
 That might give a key broker's role to the reduced center, itself certain to 
be pushed from the driver's seat for the first time since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Post-electoral jockeying could produce a left-center coalition, a right-center 
coalition, or perhaps a government of "national unity" to continue economic 
reforms that are common goals of all three alliances. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost nobody expects Italy to emerge with a definitive "Second Republic" in 
its first experience with new faces and rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, this bellwether election is apt to mark the beginning of what could be 
a long and perhaps unsettling transition toward a simpler, more transparent and 
ultimately more respected political system for Italy. Many Contenders

DOCUMENTARY; NO WINDOWS, NO HEAT, NO HOT WATER -- AND NO VACANCIES AT SARAJEVO 
HOTEL; JOURNALISTS FLOCK TO THE CITY'S ONLY OPERATING INN, BARTERING LIQUOR, 
EGGS AND BATTERIES FOR THE MISSING AMENITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By CAROL J. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 About halfway up the 11 flights to my room in the ozone layer of the Holiday 
Inn, I ran into my friend Jamie Graff from Time magazine, bounding down the 
glass-strewn stairwell in the opposite direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm getting an omelet in exchange for a bath," he declared gleefully, 
brandishing the immersion water heater that would be his part of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 The uninitiated might assume the coiled metal rods Graff was carrying had 
something to do with the omelet, as the device looks like an oversized egg 
beater. 
</P>
<P>
 But any journalist who has holed up at Sarajevo's Holiday Inn to cover the war 
in Bosnia instantly recognizes it as a means for heating water and knows its 
incalculable value. 
</P>
<P>
 At the tail end of a brutal winter in a hotel that has no running water, heat 
or intact windows, anything that can help you get warm or clean is a desirable 
barter good in the media's daily flea market of favors, talents and 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 The immersion water heaters, which take about two hours to warm a full tub, 
can be seen changing hands in the hallways at all hours of the day and night, 
in trade for everything from granola bars to cough medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 As the only working hotel in this battered Bosnian capital and the sole place 
where journalists can get access to a satellite telephone to file their 
stories, the Holiday Inn, despite its dearth of amenities, has been the refuge 
of the foreign press corps since the Serbian siege of Sarajevo began two years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel itself, which is no longer affiliated with the international chain, 
has been at the center of the conflict. It stands only a few hundred yards from 
the front line cutting through this ruined city. Dozens of rooms on the south 
side, facing the Serb-held neighborhood of Grbavica, have no windows, indeed no 
exterior walls. 
</P>
<P>
 While its charms are lost on all but those desperately seeking a "sat" phone 
and access to the outside world, the Holiday Inn has become a strangely 
comforting -- almost familial -- retreat for the journalists who are compelled 
to live and work there. 
</P>
<P>
 Confronted with physical hardships and the hazards of sniper fire and 
shelling, the press corps engages in a rare symbiosis, swapping creature 
comforts and generally ensuring that everyone gets by. 
</P>
<P>
 I earned the use of a coveted space heater from the Philadelphia Inquirer 
correspondent for bringing in a supply of contact lens solution. The Washington 
Post correspondent got Russian translation in exchange for driving me across 
the siege lines to Serb-held Lukavica in his armored car so that we could both 
talk to the Russian troops about their role here. 
</P>
<P>
 In return for use of his water heater, Graff exacted two eggs from the crate 
that a Time colleague had purchased in the rebel Serb stronghold of Pale and 
smuggled in his armored car into the hungry government-held part of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh food is almost nonexistent in Sarajevo, which has been cut off from 
trade and commerce by a Serbian blockade for two years. Some goods are swapped 
across the trenches by daring black-market dealers on both sides, making 
onions, potatoes and cabbages available at war-economy prices, but seldom is 
something so fragile as an egg to be bought for any amount of money. 
</P>
<P>
 When journalists with armored cars and the necessary sheaf of credentials from 
all warring factions brave a crossing of the dangerous no-man's-land between 
the inner circle of Bosnian government defense troops and the outer ring of 
Serb nationalist rebels, they stow caches of oranges, cheese, eggs and other 
goodies out of sight in their trunks or truck beds to keep them from being 
pilfered by gunmen who paw through each vehicle crossing the gantlet of 
checkpoints. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in Pale, the Serb staging ground 10 miles east of here where residents 
are safe from the shelling and able to continue with farming and some industry, 
many items are unavailable, like imported cigarettes, chocolate, batteries and 
liquor. 
</P>
<P>
 After water boilers and space heaters, these luxury items are most in demand 
and have become the price of favors, like securing a room at the hotel when 
events overwhelm the staff's ability to provide even the shell of a room. 
</P>
<P>
 When at least 400 foreign journalists thronged to Sarajevo ahead of the Feb. 
21 threat of NATO air strikes, enterprising colleagues already ensconced at the 
hotel secured the last available rooms for their friends or held them in 
exchange for promises by latecomers that they would bring in some scarce item 
as a payoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Because each passenger allowed on relief flights operated by the Office of the 
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees is limited to 20 kilograms (44 pounds) in 
luggage -- including laptop computers, body armor and emergency rations -- 
there is precious little allowance left for heavy breakables like bottles of 
booze. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, to pry my humble cubicle from a Newsweek stringer, it cost two 
bottles -- one Scotch and one cognac -- plus four packs of AA batteries, in 
addition to the normal $90 per night for the heatless and waterless room in 
which even the interior walls are nicked with bullet holes and shrapnel scars. 
</P>
<P>
 Most days, staying at the Holiday Inn differs little from camping. 
</P>
<P>
 Plastic sheeting has replaced the glass long ago blasted out of the windows by 
artillery shells, making it a challenge, even with a space heater, to keep the 
inside temperature much higher than that outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 Electricity comes and goes, with an outage of several hours fairly common in 
early afternoon. But if the city supply is still pinched off by the surrounding 
rebels as European newspaper deadlines approach, the hotel turns on its 
gas-powered generator, fed with U.N.-supplied fuel, to provide power to most 
rooms -- but just one outlet -- allowing journalists to plug in their 
rechargeable laptops or portable satellite telex units. 
</P>
<P>
 Water is even scarcer than power, which has taught the hotel regulars to 
immediately plug and fill their bathtubs when it's available so a sizable 
supply is on hand to replenish the toilet tank when outages stretch to several 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 The bathtub plug is missing from most rooms, however, so one has to be added 
to a journalist's travel supplies. I forgot one on my last visit and had to pay 
for the oversight by hauling gallons of water up 11 flights of stairs each day 
until I bribed a hotel maid to bring one from home in exchange for two packs of 
cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 Running water has become such a rare service these days that the Holiday Inn 
management has arranged for a water tanker to be parked outside so guests can 
fill and ferry containers to their rooms to have a survival ration to boil for 
drinking and washing. 
</P>
<P>
 Those journalists who don't know to bring collapsible water bags have to fill 
empty wine bottles from the restaurant to carry their supplies upstairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Restaurant workers sometimes fill a few dozen bottles after the communal 
dinner each night so those who didn't have time to fetch water before the 10 
p.m. curfew have something to use overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 It works this way: The waiters prune the tables of empty one-liter bottles 
that contained some of what seems an inexhaustible supply of cheap white wine 
and fill them with water they say has been filtered. I usually grab a couple of 
these bottles anytime I make the long trek upstairs. That way I can keep a 
supply of six or eight liters on hand for those times the power is on and I can 
boil up enough hot water for a sponge bath. 
</P>
<P>
 One morning, as I heated up successive cupfuls in my tiny electric kettle and 
dumped them into the bathroom sink, I detected a smell I couldn't quite 
identify, but I was suddenly overcome with images of apres-ski revelry and cozy 
fires. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hot spiced wine!" I eventually realized. "Some people really know how to 
prepare. Here I can't even bathe properly and someone on this floor is having a 
party." 
</P>
<P>
 It was only after dumping the newly boiled contents of my electric kettle into 
the sink that I realized the aromatic brew was of my own making. Apparently, a 
full bottle of wine had been accidentally placed among the bottles of filtered 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 But having already soaped up and not wanting to bear the chill for as long as 
it would take to boil a new sinkful, I rinsed in my warm cocktail and thought, 
"Only in Sarajevo."

THE WEEK AHEAD: MOSCOW; RUSSIAN BUDGET BATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Russia's Parliament begins debate Wednesday on the government's proposed 1994 
budget in what is expected to be a long and fractious session. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite belt-tightening that cut subsidies to most industries, President Boris 
N. Yeltsin's draft budget forecasts a massive deficit -- over $36 billion, or 
10% of Russia's gross national product. 
</P>
<P>
 The Parliament will face heavy pressure from Russia's cash-strapped industrial 
managers and regional leaders to restore the government subsidies on which 
Russian industry has long been dependent. 
</P>
<P>
 The hardest lobbying may well come from the military, which received only $22 
billion in the draft budget -- less than half of what the defense department 
requested.

THE WEEK AHEAD: BRUSSELS; EU MEETS ON ACCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The European Union's executive commission meets here Wednesday to confront one 
of the Continent's most important long-term challenges: how to facilitate the 
integration of the fragile new democracies in the former Communist eastern 
countries into the developed markets of the 12 West European countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The test for the affluent western members of the EU will be their willingness 
to throw open their own highly protected markets in agriculture, steel, 
textiles and other politically sensitive areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatively advanced post-Communist economies such as those in Poland, Hungary 
and the Czech republic are pressing for more market access. 
</P>
<P>
 They also want full EU membership far sooner than the union's western leaders 
foresee. The western countries speak vaguely about admission in the year 2000.

THE WEEK AHEAD: LONDON; A JEWEL IN THE TOWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Queen Elizabeth II will open the new Jewel House at the Tower of London on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiber-optic lighting and Italian-made glass showcases will let visitors have a 
closer look at the Crown Jewels, a major tourist draw, than before. 
</P>
<P>
 In the new showcases, some of the jewels will be within 18 inches of the 
viewing window. Previously, four feet was the closest distance. 
</P>
<P>
 The larger, heavier security Jewel House cost about $1.5 million to build and 
will accommodate up to 20,000 visitors a day. Admission is $11.

CHANGING LIFESTYLES; LET THE DRIVER BEWARE ON ALBANIAN ROADS; BANNED BY THE 
COMMUNISTS, PRIVATELY OWNED CARS ARE NOW THE ULTIMATE STATUS SYMBOLS. 
UNFORTUNATELY, FEW PEOPLE KNOW HOW TO DRIVE THEM.

<P>
 For the poorest country in Europe, there sure are a lot of Mercedes-Benzes 
here. They glide down the dirt-encrusted streets, nosing aside donkey carts and 
scattering pedestrians who leap for high ground like spry Albanian goats. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't always so. Private cars were banned under the long, brutal, 
Stalinist dictatorship of Enver Hoxha, who shut his country off from the rest 
of the world and believed that all good Albanians should walk or take public 
transport. For the lucky ones, there were also bicycles. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until 1991, when Communist rule collapsed, that privately owned cars 
-- many of them dented and smoke-belching Benzes -- began appearing on Tirana's 
wide, tree-lined avenues. They since have become the ultimate consumer icon for 
an impoverished nation of 3.2 million people who are starved for Western goods. 
</P>
<P>
 From only 5,300 cars in Communist times, the number of private cars soared to 
120,000 by the end of 1993, with thousands more imported each month, according 
to the Ministry of Public Order. 
</P>
<P>
 And therein lies a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Roads built more than 60 years ago are inadequate for today's traffic. Drivers 
lack basic skills. They speed recklessly along roads clogged with peasants, 
cows, carts, tractors and Russian-made Stalin trucks from the 1950s. Many drive 
without lights at night to spare their batteries. And pedestrians -- who grew 
up on empty streets -- possess none of the survival instincts that are second 
nature to urban dwellers elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 For many Albanians, this has proved fatal. In the first nine months of 1993, 
there were 300 deaths because of auto accidents and 111 injuries, the Ministry 
of Public Order reported. It recorded 563 accidents, but that figure is 
believed to be low. 
</P>
<P>
 The anarchy on the roads is an apt metaphor for Albania today, as two 
generations of totalitarian control and repression give way to chaos. The 
disintegrating highway system also creates a concrete impediment to trade and 
tourism. 
</P>
<P>
 Conditions are so bad that many taxis refuse to use the steep coastal road, 
which offers breathtaking vistas of the unspoiled Adriatic coastline. At least 
two-thirds of the 85-mile-long Albanian road, which runs east-to-west from the 
Macedonian border to the Adriatic port of Durres, is potholed, narrow, 
mountainous or unpaved. Millions of dollars are needed to realize the first leg 
of a wider Balkan dream to rebuild the ancient Via Egnatia of the Roman Empire, 
a corridor from the Adriatic to the Black Sea. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's absolutely necessary that Albania put priority on reconstructing roads," 
said Nasi Lesku, director of the Albanian-American Trade Assn. "They can't hope 
to get tourists or trade otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
 After declining by 40% to 50% in 1991 and 1992, the Albanian economy grew by 
11% in 1993, the International Monetary Fund says. But at least 60% of 
Albanians are unemployed. Most of the country's factories are abandoned steel 
skeletons. 
</P>
<P>
 Running water is only a memory for most in Tirana, and power outages are 
common. Albania survives on international aid and the $350 million in 
remittance payments from its citizens working abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 In such an environment, sliding inside a car and punching the accelerator 
offers Albanians a visceral surge of power, one that can be lethal to those in 
the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "We Albanians like big cars, luxury cars," says Rafael Feogi, who works for 
the Albanian Telegraphic Agency. "But we have no habit of driving because 
there's no history of cars in Albania, and the streets are narrow. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're from the time of King Zog," Feogi adds, referring to the country's 
onetime monarch, who fled Albania in 1939 as the Italians marched into his 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 Carmelo Campillo, a visiting Madrid businessman who carries plastic containers 
of gasoline in his sport utility vehicle because he never knows whether he will 
be able to find fuel, puts it more bluntly, saying: "Albanians are the worst 
drivers in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 It is common in all Albanian cities to see cars barreling the wrong way down 
one-ways, speeding along the sidewalk or literally cutting corners. In the 
countryside, farmers get around on their government-provided tractors, which 
have no lights and chug along at 5 to 8 m.p.h., says Lesku. 
</P>
<P>
 To make matters worse, Tirana, a capital city of 300,000, has only a dozen 
traffic lights; they are often on the blink because of sporadic power outages. 
</P>
<P>
 A Western diplomat last fall explained that Tirana was safer than most U.S. 
cities because the occasional robbers rarely hurt people who surrender their 
wallets. 
</P>
<P>
 "However, there is another kind of Albanian who does pose a grave threat to 
your life and limb," the diplomat continued, "and that is the Albanian behind 
the wheel of a car." 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, an Albanian secretary for the Peace Corps was hit and killed by a 
car as she stood on the sidewalk between the Tirana Hotel and the National 
Museum. An American lawyer doing consulting work for Albania's Ministry of 
Labor was run over and killed by a motorcycle in Tirana last May. A clerical 
worker with the U.S. Information Office had her leg amputated at the hip last 
year after being hit by a car as she walked along the seafront in Sarande in 
southern Albania. 
</P>
<P>
 By law, Albanians who want a license must prove they have graduated from 
driving school, which costs about $100 -- more than twice the average monthly 
wage. Thirty-five such schools have sprung up to meet the demand, and it is not 
unusual to see 50-year-old men squeezed into wheezing Fiats, hands gripped 
tightly around the wheel, attempting a tricky mountain curve as their 
instructor gesticulates wildly. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a country where corruption is endemic, residents say it is equally 
common to bribe the school for a certificate of completion. Bribery is also a 
way of life on highways, where buses and cars are subjected to an Albanian 
mordida from police officers who set up roadblocks and charge from $5 to $50. 
</P>
<P>
 Women drivers are still rare sights in this male-dominated society, where even 
those women who work go directly home when their shift ends. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Albanians in villages still gape when a Western vehicle whizzes by. 
Some line up at the side of the road and wave. Sometimes, children beg or throw 
rocks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The anger and awe revolve around the knowledge that cars remain beyond the 
reach of most people, since the average Albanian makes about $29 per month, 
according to state statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the grim realities of life today, a recent poll by Eurobarometer found 
that 46% of Albanians believe that the economy has improved. The International 
Monetary Fund says there are now 50,000 private shops in Albania -- many tiny 
kiosks plunked down on Tirana's sidewalks. The IMF and the World Bank recently 
approved loans to Albania totaling $79 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Albania's thriving merchant class -- including black marketeers -- shop at 
Benetton's Tirana and carry cellular phones into the fancy restaurants that are 
sprouting throughout the capital. They favor new Mercedes-Benzes and 
American-style four-wheel-drives. 
</P>
<P>
 There is one Corvette in Tirana, famous for its New Jersey license plates, and 
people drop what they are doing to watch the muscle car power down the dusty 
streets. Others must settle for more anonymous models, stolen in Western Europe 
and sold here for as little as $3,000. Many more are dumped on the Albanian 
market because they do not meet strict emission standards enforced in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 Albania even has its own Autogate scandal, in which government ministries were 
discovered to have spent more than $1 million of credit from the World Bank to 
buy cars for official institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Albania struggles under a foreign debt of more than $600 million.

NATIONAL AGENDA; KABUL RESIDENTS ENDURE SIEGE BY FACTIONAL MUSLIM FIGHTERS; THE

 Another mortar round crashed among the jumbled houses of the old city, 
exploded with a bone-jarring crack and threw up a cloud of dust and smoke. A 
stream of people hurried out of the warren of old bazaars and dashed across a 
bridge over the filthy Kabul River, crouching low to avoid shrapnel and stray 
bullets. The bundled figures carried sacks or pushed carts of possessions they 
had managed to salvage. 
</P>
<P>
 Machine-gun fire rattled from the crumbling medieval walls of the Bala Hissar 
fortress that sits on a ridge overlooking the shattered buildings of the old 
city. A fire ignited by an explosion in the morning blazed uncontrollably, 
spreading through shops in the bazaar area and sending a column of black smoke 
into the clear air beside the minaret and battered red dome of Kabul's main 
mosque. 
</P>
<P>
 The Afghan capital is at war again. Since New Year's Day, fighting has raged 
in Kabul as the combined forces of two of Afghanistan's most ruthless warlords 
have tried to drive the current ineffective government from power. 
</P>
<P>
 The Afghan war, fueled by Soviet, U.S. and later Arab-supplied weapons, is one 
bloody struggle the world would rather forget. Most people believe that it 
should have ended two years ago, when President Najibullah fled and his 
Soviet-backed government in Kabul collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 The fighting has not ended because of a power struggle between rival leaders 
of the Islamic moujahedeen, or "Holy Warriors," which broke out as they marched 
in to take control of Kabul in the spring of 1992, after a 13-year struggle 
against Soviet troops and their Afghan proteges. This power struggle has led to 
three previous bouts of severe fighting in the capital, reducing large areas to 
rubble. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As fighting continued in the old city and along the Kabul River, which now 
forms the front line between government and rebel forces in the midst of the 
city, a steady flow of wounded arrived at Jumhuriyat Hospital. This is in the 
center of the city, near Chicken Street, once the hangout of Western hippies 
and carpet dealers in the more carefree days before the war. 
</P>
<P>
 As the crash of shells repeatedly shook the hospital and rattled the windows, 
a horn blared and a jeep roared into the compound. Two young boys, butcher's 
assistants from the old bazaar, were taken out, one unconscious, the second 
grimacing with pain, his clothes stained with blood. 
</P>
<P>
 A third man lay on the floor of the jeep, his face a greenish hue in death and 
his jaws already tied shut with a rag. The two boys were taken in on stretchers 
to have their wounds patched up, and the stretcher was wiped clean for the next 
patient. 
</P>
<P>
 "The past few days have been quiet," said a French doctor of the volunteer 
group Medicins Sans Frontieres. "Today we're getting back to normal." 
</P>
<P>
 Kabul is in its 12th week of fighting between the government of President 
Burhanuddin Rabbani and rebel forces of the former Communist militia leader 
General Abdul Rashid Dostum, supported by the renegade prime minister Gulbuddin 
Hekmatyar. 
</P>
<P>
 Hekmatyar, an outspoken critic of the United States, has always presented 
himself as the "purest" of the Islamist leaders. His alliance with Dostum, the 
most unrepentant of the remnants of the former Communist government, has 
seriously damaged his credibility, however. Dostum, a powerful militia leader 
from the north of Afghanistan, precipitated the collapse of the former 
government in 1992, when he suddenly turned his back on President Najibullah in 
Kabul and joined the moujahedeen in fighting against the government. 
</P>
<P>
 The maneuvering for military advantage, the making and breaking of alliances, 
matters little to the civilians, the main victims of this latest round of the 
Afghan power struggle. Few of them any longer support any of the five factions 
that control various parts of Kabul. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone hates these leaders," said a middle-aged Kabul man whose house was 
destroyed in the fighting. He now lives in a tent in a vast camp for Kabuli 
refugees near the eastern city of Jalalabad. "All the leaders want is one thing 
-- power. It has nothing to do with religion, just power." 
</P>
<P>
 The fighting has centered on the old city and Microrayon, a once-fashionable 
Soviet-style residential area of half-finished high-rise apartment buildings 
and immobile building cranes. 
</P>
<P>
 President Rabbani's troops, led by the popular moujahedeen commander Ahmad 
Shah Massoud, control the north and center of Kabul, while Dostum's and 
Hekmatyar's forces occupy the Bala Hissar and the southeastern corner of the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 The south of Kabul, flattened in earlier bouts of fighting, has been largely 
peaceful this time. It is under the control of yet another faction, Hezbi 
Wahdat, a party of ethnic Hazaras, who are Shia Muslims. The majority of 
Afghans are Sunni Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gul Mohammed, administrator of a hospital in the south Kabul area of Karte-Se, 
is not optimistic that the fighting will stop. He voices a general 
disenchantment with President Rabbani, who took office in 1992 shortly after 
the moujahedeen takeover. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has not provided security for any part of Kabul," Gul Mohammed said. "He 
should have started reconstruction, but he says he is too busy fighting." 
</P>
<P>
 Life for Kabul residents was difficult enough when there was no fighting. Now, 
it has become unbearable. 
</P>
<P>
 There was little electricity before, but there has been none at all since the 
fighting began, and many people are without heating while snow covers the 
mountains surrounding the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Sufficient food and fuel have become unaffordable for many people. A curfew is 
enforced after 10 p.m., but Kabul is like a city of the dead by sundown as no 
one dares leave home. 
</P>
<P>
 The most frightening aspect of the fighting is its arbitrariness. Rockets and 
shells are fired mostly into the old city, Microrayon and the diplomatic and 
government district around the Presidential Palace, but they can land anywhere. 
On one apparently quiet morning, several passersby were wounded when a rocket 
fell near the Bulgarian Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
 The same morning, a young man stood crying on Chicken Street. "He's just heard 
that his mother has been killed by a mortar in Shor Bazaar," said a friend. 
Shor Bazaar, near the Bala Hissar fortress, has undergone some of the heaviest 
shelling. 
</P>
<P>
 During lulls in the fighting, panic-stricken men, women and children hurry 
from areas of fighting to relative safety elsewhere, pushing carts or carrying 
huge bundles of bedding and other household goods. The crack and boom of 
artillery is a constant background. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 30,000 people have been displaced within the city. They are 
sheltering with relatives or in mosques and schools in safer parts of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Aerial bombardment by Dostum's jets adds another element of arbitrary death. 
One young man commented: "When you see jets flying over, you watch and wonder, 
will this one drop a bomb and kill me? But what can you do? In the mountains 
you could always hide in a cave, but here there is nowhere to hide." 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of thousands of people have fled altogether from Kabul, which was a 
city swollen by refugees to about 2 million people during the later stages of 
the anti-Soviet war. More than 60,000 of these have gone to Jalalabad, most 
hoping to continue to neighboring Pakistan, which harbored more than 3 million 
Afghan refugees during the war. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1.5 million refugees still remain in Pakistan, but the government of 
Benazir Bhutto in Islamabad has decided that it does not want another wave from 
its war-torn neighbor. The border crossing at the Khyber Pass has been closed, 
and Afghans who hoped to go there have been forced to camp on a wind-swept 
gravel plain outside Jalalabad. 
</P>
<P>
 International relief agencies are doing their best to provide tents, blankets, 
food and water for these wretched people, but new arrivals from the fighting in 
Kabul have often had to sleep in the open. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Dostum lost ground in Kabul early in this round of fighting, the 
government has not managed to dislodge his forces from the city, and the battle 
has ground to a stalemate. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most people here, Gul Mohammed from the Karte-Se Hospital sees the 
situation simply. "The anti-government forces say (President) Rabbani should 
resign. He says he will not resign. So they keep on fighting." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond this, little is certain. The long-suffering people of Kabul must simply 
grit their teeth and bear the pain.

AMERICA FROM ABROAD; DEPARTING GIS CAN'T STOP THE MUSIC; SOMALIS LOVE U.S. ROCK 
'N' ROLL, BUT WASHINGTON'S POLICIES ARE ANOTHER MATTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In the rickety stalls of Mogadishu's Bakara market, in the heart of the 
neighborhood where 18 U.S. Army Rangers were killed and dozens more wounded in 
the most intense firefight involving U.S. troops since Vietnam, the 
hottest-selling items in the final days of the U.S. deployment were cassette 
tapes of American rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
 They were pirate tapes recorded from Armed Forces Radio broadcasts here during 
the 15 months that U.S. soldiers took the lead role in the U.N. mission to 
feed, pacify and rebuild war-torn Somalia. And they were recorded by some of 
the same clan militiamen who shot down U.S. helicopters, held an American pilot 
hostage, blew up passing Army patrols and ambushed Marines on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We love American music -- you know, Guns 'N Roses, man," one of the 
militiamen, who identified himself only as Abdi, told me as the U.S. presence 
drew to a close this month . "Hey, we even like your soldiers. Very tough. Very 
strong. In fact, we like America. It's the American policy that was wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a poignant image that caught the ambivalence of so many Somalis toward 
the people who came to save them from starvation, killed hundreds of Somalis in 
armed combat, lost dozens of their own soldiers in the process and finally 
chose to leave rather than risk losing any more. 
</P>
<P>
 As the U.S. military mission approached its scheduled departure Friday, 
America's image in this still-ruined land seemed to run the gamut from the 
militiaman's love for rock 'n' roll, to respect for the foreign soldiers he 
fought so hard to drive out of town, to the satisfaction of his leaders that 
the Americans were finally going home. 
</P>
<P>
 On a night when hundreds of U.S. troops left Mogadishu's harbor in early March 
in a high-security naval withdrawal, scores of Somalis packed into an open-air 
theater to watch the movie "Patton." It was the largest crowd the theater's 
owner could remember since the Marines landed here in December, 1992. There was 
even a smattering of applause when a mammoth American flag filled the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 On the higher political level, there was enduring anger -- particularly from 
the leadership of former Somali Gen. Mohammed Farah Aidid's Somali National 
Alliance, which declared war on the United States and the United Nations when 
Aidid and his men became convinced the foreign forces were trying to 
marginalize their party and their clan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before they came, I had a different concept of America," said Abdul Karim 
Ahmed Ali, secretary general and spokesman for Aidid's party. "From childhood, 
I thought America is the most democratic country in the world after England. 
When I grew up, I changed my mind. I thought America was the most democratic 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 "But when they arrived here, things went the opposite. They immediately 
started marginalizing us -- supporting our rivals. Now I believe the policy of 
the American government and the feelings of the American people are different. 
And this is a contradiction I can no longer understand." 
</P>
<P>
 For Ahmed Ali, there's a personal dimension. In January, during one of the 
last U.S. troop convoys through Mogadishu's streets, his eldest son was 
accidentally caught in a cross-fire and shot in the stomach, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, of course, I wish they had never come to Somalia. My son would be 
healthy now." 
</P>
<P>
 But outside of politics, and at the grass roots of what's left of Somali 
society, the view was far different. 
</P>
<P>
 There was an almost universal gratitude for the initial Marine intervention 
that helped break a war-induced cycle of famine. Most Somalis appear to believe 
that the intervention saved the lives of hundreds of thousands of their 
compatriots. 
</P>
<P>
 "If President Bush hadn't sent the Marines in, I think 50% of the Somali 
people would have died," said former Somali Gen. Mohamed Nur Galal. "What is 
not clear to me now is what kind of policy America has on Somalia. The U.S. 
Congress is saying, 'We have no interest in Somalia.' And I see the U.S. 
ambassador here, and he tells me the United States is going to stay involved in 
this country and they are going to still support the U.N. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't understand this. It's all very strange to me." 
</P>
<P>
 It's less strange for Hirei Gassem, who has visited the United States four 
times and whose son graduated from a U.S. university. Once among Somalia's most 
prominent businessmen, Gassem lost his detergent and soap factories during the 
civil war that destroyed most of the capital and the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 But as he started to rebuild from the rubble, beginning with the 10-room 
Quality Inn motel he plans to open this month near Mogadishu's international 
airport, Gassem said he too is somewhat confused about America's intentions in 
Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know the American mentality is progressive," he said. "And the Americans 
can still do much here. But they must get involved with the local people. I 
always thought the Americans, if anyone, would understand this. But for some 
reason, they failed in this here. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looking back, I would say the Americans succeeded about 70% here. Before they 
came, people were starving. Battle wagons roamed the streets. We were in a 
state of civil war, and maybe we're about to be in the same state again. 
</P>
<P>
 "But today, at least, we are talking. We are surviving. We are moving around. 
We are seeing a little ray of hope. For me, this is a success. And for me, they 
are not successful because they withdraw just like that." 
</P>
<P>
 There was yet another perspective from the Somali women, who suffered in the 
clan wars and had perhaps the highest hopes for the U.S. troops when they first 
arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "After all, we were the real victims of this civil war. It is not us who took 
up arms, it is the men," said Habiba Nur Raghe, who ran a small hotel before 
the war destroyed the capital. "We lost our sons, our husbands, our fathers and 
our brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the Americans arrived, we hoped only that this would stop. And the 
Americans have fulfilled their obligation, morally and politically. So it is 
time for them to leave. Now, we only hope that, in their leaving, we will 
somehow resolve our differences among ourselves."

NEXT STEP; PANAMA REPRISE?; MANUEL NORIEGA'S OLD PARTY SEEMS POISED FOR VICTORY 
IN UPCOMING ELECTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Four years and three months after U.S. troops invaded Panama and captured Gen. 
Manuel Antonio Noriega, the country appears poised to restore Noriega's old 
political party to power in the first free elections in decades. 
</P>
<P>
 The startling turn of events reflects general disenchantment with the 
U.S.-backed government of President Guillermo Endara, whose administration has 
been racked with corruption scandals and anger over economic policies that have 
deepened poverty and unemployment for many Panamanians. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernesto Perez Balladares of the Democratic Revolutionary Party, or PRD, 
Noriega's onetime political arm, leads most polls by a wide margin. He is 
followed by the government's former comptroller, 73-year-old Ruben Dario 
Carles. 
</P>
<P>
 The wild card in the elections, which are scheduled for May 8, is actor and 
salsa star Ruben Blades. The singer returned to Panama last year from his home 
in Santa Monica and founded a party called Papa Egoro, or Mother Earth in the 
indigenous Embera language. 
</P>
<P>
 Blades, 45, prides himself on an unorthodox presidential campaign that 
represents a clean break from Panama's shaky past of rule by military dictators 
or pro-U.S. oligarchs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ours is an anti-party," he said in an interview at his apartment overlooking 
the Panama Bay. "More than a simple change of parties, we are trying to present 
a change of attitude . . . a change in political behavior."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After a promising start, however, Blades' candidacy has been hurt by 
desertions from the party and his own failure to campaign effectively. He had 
fallen to third place in a poll released early this month.  
</P>
<P>
 The elections will be Panama's first conducted without military controls in 
more than 25 years and are expected to be the cleanest in its history. A large 
number of international observers will monitor the voting. 
</P>
<P>
 Panama has long been a focus of strategic importance to the United States 
because of the U.S.-built Panama Canal, which connects the Atlantic and Pacific 
oceans, and as the headquarters site of the U.S. Army Southern Command, which 
oversees U.S. military operations south of the Rio Grande.  
</P>
<P>
 Noriega was the de facto ruler of Panama through most of the 1980s, despite 
the presence of a series of civilian figurehead presidents from the PRD. After 
years on the CIA payroll, the Panamanian strongman fell out of favor with 
Washington in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 As anti-Noriega demonstrations led by business leaders and others began to 
spread in Panama City, the U.S. government indicted Noriega on drug charges and 
slapped stringent economic sanctions on the isthmus nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, with Noriega refusing to step aside, then-President George Bush 
ordered the Dec. 19, 1989, invasion of Panama. Hundreds of Panamanians and 
about two dozen U.S. troops were killed, and Noriega was eventually captured, 
transported to the United States and tried and convicted for drug crimes. He is 
serving a 40-year prison term in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 In a ceremony at a U.S. military base, the Americans installed Endara, who had 
won the 1989 presidential elections, which were promptly annulled by Noriega. 
Endara and his coalition of three conservative parties, however, soon proved to 
be a disappointment to many Panamanians who had high hopes of better lives 
under a well-run, truly democratic government. 
</P>
<P>
 Endara's administration has been caught up in one scandal after another, while 
money-laundering and drug running -- the ills once blamed on Noriega -- 
continue to flourish. The government's free-market policies have triggered 
impressive economic growth, but unemployment and crime soar while wages 
languish. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Perez Balladares and the PRD have been effective at capitalizing on the public 
discontent, analysts say. Universally known by his nickname, the Bull, because 
of his hulking build, Perez Balladares is careful to distance himself from 
Noriega and to pledge that the military domination of the past will not return. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he and the party are reviving their traditional ties to the policies 
and rhetoric of Gen. Omar Torrijos, the military strongman who preceded Noriega 
and who was admired by many Panamanians for his attention to the poor and lower 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Torrijos, who died in a still-mysterious plane crash in 1981, exploited class 
differences to retain the support of Panama's largely dark-skinned masses, who 
resent a white elite that ruled in the 1950s and '60s. Some Panamanians see the 
current Endara government as representative of that elite. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the fact that he is a multimillionaire businessman, Perez Balladares 
invokes themes of social equality in stump speeches and campaign appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are committed to democracy, to real democracy, where not just one social 
class benefits," he told workers gathered in a sweltering grocery warehouse 
earlier this month.  
</P>
<P>
 "An elitist democracy, one that only responds to the privileged social class, 
is by definition a lack of democracy, and one that contains the seed of its own 
destruction."  
</P>
<P>
 Yet here at this warehouse, as in many of his appearances, Perez Balladares 
was questioned about members of the party who represent throwbacks to the most 
repressive elements of the Noriega regime. He told the crowd that the PRD has 
been purged and made more democratic. 
</P>
<P>
 It is this kind of doubt that dogs Perez Balladares and the PRD, and is 
handily exploited by their opponents. Newspapers controlled by anti-PRD forces 
routinely publish photographs of Perez Balladares with Noriega and run cartoons 
that suggest he will govern with an iron fist. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps to combat those ghosts, Perez Balladares has become a tireless 
campaigner who easily might handle a dozen appointments one day, fly off in his 
private jet to meet Mexico's presidential candidate the next day, and return to 
Panama in time for a six-city car tour of the countryside. 
</P>
<P>
 The polls show his strategy is working. In the last eight months, he has 
climbed steadily from single-digit support to hold a nearly 2-1 lead over his 
closest opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, many observers in Panama believed that it would be the salsero 
Blades -- not Perez Balladares -- who would capture the wave of discontent. 
</P>
<P>
 But Blades' failure to make many public appearances, while the other 
candidates launched expensive, highly publicized campaigns, has eroded early 
support. Blades has also been largely ignored or attacked by a Panamanian press 
controlled by the traditional political parties and their allies. 
</P>
<P>
 "People know Ruben Blades is against the government, but they don't know how 
or why," political analyst Marco Gandasegui said. "Papa Egoro has not gotten 
its message across. . . . The figure of Ruben Blades commands a great deal of 
affection, but there is no (party) organization that can channel that affection 
in a concrete, effective way." 
</P>
<P>
 Blades has promised to intensify his campaign, blaming inexperience and a lack 
of money for many of his problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we are trying to do is not easy," Blades said. "We have the huge problem 
of not only confronting the Panamanian public's disappointment (with its 
political leaders) but also of trying to work outside the traditional political 
apparatus." 
</P>
<P>
 A number of disillusioned party members have deserted, accusing Blades of 
remaining inaccessible while surrounding himself with a small group of 
intellectuals. Blades chalked the desertions up to the party's growing pains.

POSTSCRIPT; AN UNSENTIMENTAL JOURNEY TO RUSSIA'S BOMB-MAKING CITY; YOU WON'T 
FIND ARZAMAS-16 ON ANY MAP. BUT IT IS FAMOUS ANYWAY. AND ITS 100,000 RESIDENTS 
ARE HEIRS TO A LONG TRADITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SERGEI KOZYREV and IGOR MOROZOV, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES: The writers, Russian 
television journalists, were given permission to visit Arzamas-16 after six 
months of negotiations with the city's officials. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The journey begins at an unremarkable pharmacy stall at Moscow's smallest 
airport, Bykovo. 
</P>
<P>
 A clutch of people, most carrying just their briefcases, gather around an 
official who checks their names against a list. 
</P>
<P>
 Ignoring passport and security controls, and not even producing their tickets, 
the passengers then move across the airfield to a small transport plane.  
</P>
<P>
 Their flight is not on any of Aeroflot's schedules. Both the plane and the 
flight do not exist officially. And when the plane touches down about 45 
minutes after taking off, it lands in a town that cannot be found on any map of 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, this city is quite real, and even famous in its own special way. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, about 250 miles east of Moscow, Russian atomic bombs are made. This is 
the Russian Los Alamos. 
</P>
<P>
 The city, home to 100,000 people, has had many names, from KB-II to Object No. 
550. It was also nicknamed New Jerusalem, a reference to the predominance of 
Jews among top Soviet atomic physicists. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it is known as Arzamas-16. It is the most significant and most clandestine 
of Russia's 10 most secret cities, the main bulwark of Russia's 
military-industrial complex. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a unique city. At its well-equipped maternity hospital, we are shown an 
infant, newborn and still wet. The doctor slaps him lightly on the backside and 
tells us proudly: "What a wonderful baby! Some day he will make the best bomb 
in the world!" 
</P>
<P>
 This is a joke, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a local cemetery, which the residents of Arzamas-16 call Arzamas-17, 
symbols of the atom and of fat little bombs are found amid the usual crosses 
and stars. And this is no joke. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction of Arzamas-16 began in 1946 at the site of a small provincial 
Russian town called Sarov, known as the home of a Russian saint and as the site 
of a spring held holy by Russian Orthodox faithful. With the arrival of the 
wave of new people to the area, the spring was cemented over. The new residents 
had a different religion, a different driving idea. 
</P>
<P>
 They had to master the secrets of nuclear weapons as fast as possible. By the 
summer of 1949, they had produced an atomic bomb ready for testing at 
Semipalatinsk. 
</P>
<P>
 The physicists of the city believed that in case of failure they would almost 
surely be severely punished. They were right. 
</P>
<P>
 Newly opened archives revealed recently that the notorious chief of Soviet 
secret police, Lavrenty Beria, had drawn up a list of leading physicists who 
were to be executed or imprisoned if the bomb failed. But it worked, and 
instead they all got medals. 
</P>
<P>
 Beria so dominated Arzamas-16 that the first street was named in his honor. He 
demanded a level of secrecy so intense that scientists used to joke that the 
Soviet Union could have other, competing centers of atomic weaponry and they 
would not know about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Needless to say, scientists knew how to keep secrets in the Soviet Union. 
Through the 1970s, all the Arzamas-16 residents were officially registered at 
the same address, according to their passports: Moscow, 1 Oktyabrskogo Polya, 
Apt. 36. 
</P>
<P>
 (On our return to Moscow from Arzamas-16 we visited this apartment, just out 
of curiosity. It is an ordinary Moscow communal apartment. The inhabitants were 
shocked to find out that at one time as many as 100,000 people were 'living' in 
their flat.) 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, leading scientists in Arzamas-16 were lodged in spacious cottages. 
The nicest villa in the city -- on the banks of a pond, right in the middle of 
a splendid park -- was built for Andrei D. Sakharov, the brilliant physicist 
who later became a human rights activist. He refused to live in it. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, this city had nothing to complain about at all. For instance, 
when Arzamas-16 still did not have a town laundry, dirty linen would be 
delivered to Moscow and back by air. The regional center, Gorky, was closer, 
but Moscow laundries had better reputations and Arzamas-16 was entitled to the 
best. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1958, during preparations for a series of tests, the scientists from 
Arzamas-16 demanded several pounds of mercury. It was delivered, and for the 
next four years it was impossible to buy a mercury thermometer in Soviet 
drugstores. 
</P>
<P>
 The standard of living seemed at least twice as high here as in any other 
region of the country. Nearly every family owned a car. There was negligible 
crime. The KGB took care of that. Even today, a woman alone is not afraid to 
walk along the empty streets of the city at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents still prefer to live behind their barbed-wire boundary, with all the 
security features of a national frontier: a strip of sand to show footprints 
and border guards with submachine guns and trained dogs who guard this 
state-within-a-state day and night. This is what they are used to. 
</P>
<P>
 The last several years, which have turned Russia upside down, have made little 
difference in Arzamas-16, at least outwardly. Its walls are not covered with 
graffiti as Moscow's are. There are no political groups. And the state still 
calls the shots. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A few changes are seeping in. Kiosks and shops carry the inevitable Snickers 
and Marlboros. The holy spring has been reopened, and a cathedral is being 
built in the center of the city. Georgy Kulichkov, an expert on local lore, 
tells us that the splendid new gate for the church was made at the workshop 
where atomic bombs are assembled and from the same steel used to encase them. 
</P>
<P>
 But for many, change is not coming fast enough. The city's current director, 
Vladimir Belugin, tells us that he learned from a train conductor that her 
salary was 50% higher than the salaries of his leading bomb designers. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, paychecks for Arzamas-16 residents were delayed for three months; 
they gathered in the city stadium and seriously threatened to strike. Only a 
government agreement to pay off part of the debt averted a walkout by workers 
whose loyalty to the state had been tested again and again by the KGB. 
</P>
<P>
 "How sad," said Leonid Ognev, one of the most prominent members of the Arzamas 
scientific elite, "But I have a feeling that we have become unnecessary people 
in our country." 
</P>
<P>
 Others hold hope that the time will come again when a top-drawer physicist 
will be making more than a train conductor.

MEDIA; NEW OWNERS RESCUE MILLS & BOON FROM STRONG HEROES, PLIANT HEROINES; 
VENERABLE BRITISH PUBLISHER UPDATES ITS ROMANCE NOVELS WITH MATERIALISM, MORE 
SEX AND A BOLD SEDUCTRESS OR TWO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While few Americans have heard of the publishing house, Mills & Boon is a 
household name in Britain -- as familiar to women as brand names of lipsticks. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Mills & Boon claims that eight out of 10 women have heard of the 
publishing house (but not necessarily any of its authors) because of the 
classically corny romantic fiction, rooted in traditional stereotypes: strong, 
masterful heroes; chaste, pliant heroines. 
</P>
<P>
 Mills & Boon now sells about 15 million copies annually, translated into 26 
languages in more than 100 countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Since its founding in 1908, the publisher has been the leader in romantic 
fiction. The format never varied: Woman meets man, man mates woman -- but only 
after marriage -- and they live happily ever after. 
</P>
<P>
 But this year the winds of change have rustled through the corridors of Mills 
& Boon. The publisher's efforts to update the man-meets-woman story prompted 
the resignation of Managing Director Robert Williams and Editorial Director 
Frances Whitehead when, insiders say, it was "suggested" to them that their 
tastes were too old-fashioned. 
</P>
<P>
 Mills & Boon's Canadian owner, Harlequin, is demanding a sexier image for the 
1990s fiction -- and getting it. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in 1923, for instance, a typical Mills & Boon romance called "A Perfect 
Little Fool" read: "One of his conquering hands took command of her burning 
face. Nothing could ever be the same again." 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as 1986, "Passionate Choice" concluded: "His display of masterful 
jealousy excited and pleased her. He was the lover she needed, a man who could 
sweep her off her feet." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, that was pretty mild stuff for the 1990s, concluded the new Mills & Boon 
editors. 
</P>
<P>
 So this spring's leading offering features T.J. Harris, an Atlanta-based 
journalist who accepts a marriage proposal to live with her lover at his island 
resort -- on condition that he has "satellite television hook-ups, a computer 
modem and a fax machine." 
</P>
<P>
 The latest M & B heroine is Molly Hill, an important Hollywood agent, who 
seduces the naked hero in her office while she completes a business deal on the 
telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 In Britain, such fare has given Mills & Boon 4 million faithful readers in 
Britain and 54% of the $100-million paperback romantic fiction market -- a 
category that constitutes the largest single sector of the adult paperback 
fiction market. 
</P>
<P>
 About 500 Mills & Boon novels hit the shelves every year, selling at the rate 
of one book every two seconds in the United Kingdom alone. 
</P>
<P>
 The company draws on about 300 authors from a variety of backgrounds, mainly 
part-time writers. More than 5,000 unsolicited manuscripts are received each 
year. Most writers are unknowns -- though once the publishing house boasted 
authors such as Jack London, Hugh Walpole, Georgette Heyer and P.G. Wodehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The company was founded when Gerald Mills and Charles Boon joined forces with 
their first book, a romance, titled "Arrows From the Dark." The romance novels 
were priced low, designed for a mass market. 
</P>
<P>
 With the rise of local lending libraries, and the readers' appetites for 
escapist romances during the Depression, Mills & Boon came into its own -- with 
the company concentrating on hardcover romances. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the post-war period, the publishers moved quickly into paperback, 
pioneering sales through newsstands to increase volume. In 1964, John Boon, son 
of Charles Boon, became managing director, with his brother, Alan, as editorial 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 The standard tome ran 192 pages: Rich, handsome hero; beautiful young girl, 
and always a happy ending. Injured soldiers were popular during the war. Later 
a series about doctors and nurses was a phenomenal hit and sold well abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1972, Mills & Boon merged with Harlequin and in 1981 came under the wing of 
the Canadian Torstar Group. By then Caribbean cruises and backgrounds often 
served as a romantic backdrop. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, the classic theme was enunciated by outgoing director Whitehead, 
who said that marriage was the goal of the hero and heroine. 
</P>
<P>
 "To have them decide they don't want to spend their lives together would be 
comparable to James Bond admitting defeat or Hercule Poirot failing to solve a 
case." 
</P>
<P>
 With the new sexier approach, Mills & Boon has souped up its covers, with less 
starry-eyed and more sensual heroines. Plenty of cleavage and thigh is now 
mandatory in the "Temptation" series. 
</P>
<P>
 Why change such a successful format? M & B Marketing Director Heather Walton 
replies: "It's true that we are a household name, and that we have over 4 
million regular readers, but there are still a lot of people who don't read 
Mills & Boon -- many because they mistakenly believe the books to be somewhat 
old-fashioned. 
</P>
<P>
 "Research proved that many of these people would be genuinely and pleasantly 
surprised at how different our books are from their current perceptions." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Walton maintains that the new Mills & Boon treatments "mirror the lives of 
contemporary women" and that readers enjoy sexual realism. Critic Alison 
Henegan, editor of a feminist book club, "Open Letters," suggests that the 
Mills & Boon appeal may be "giving yourself permission not to be bright, to 
read something that technically someone like you shouldn't want to read." 
</P>
<P>
 Writer Jackie Wullschlager, in describing the appeal of romantic fiction even 
in the 1990s, says: "At its heart lies classic female fantasies which never 
change. In identifying with a beautiful, beloved, lucky Mills & Boon heroine, 
women readers fall in love with an idealized self-image. Both heroine and 
reader see life through sensual-tinted spectacles: themselves in that dusky, 
pink bikini, waiting for their lover on a beach, writhing with desire." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone, including the ousted executives, agrees with Mills & Boon's new 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Dame Barbara Cartland, the queen of romantic fiction authors, says: "I think 
they are making a big mistake going down that road. I've read one or two of 
their (previous) books and they were very nice, very clean, very pleasant for 
young girls. Gradually people are realizing that sex, sex, sex is wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Dame Barbara is also adamantly opposed to including safe sex -- or even unsafe 
sex -- in romantic fiction. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know it happens," she says, "but we don't want to read about it. I never 
have anything to do with sex whatsoever -- not in my books."
