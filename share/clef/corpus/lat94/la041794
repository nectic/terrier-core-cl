 'A comedian is . . . a historian. He reflects the times and the mood of the 
country and the world."  
</P>
<P>
 -- Godfrey Cambridge 
</P>
<P>
 I had a dream last night That almost turned me white --  
</P>
<P>
 From "Under the Chicken Tree" 
</P>
<P>
 Last night I dreamed I was a comedian. That wasn't so bad, until I realized 
who my audience was: Richard Pryor, Bill Cosby and Redd Foxx. 
</P>
<P>
 That was not all. There were traditional African comics -- griots -- in 
chains. These were the brothers who, once enslaved in the New World, used their 
humor to mislead white slave-holders into thinking that they were naive, 
contented children. 
</P>
<P>
 At another table sat two comics from the 1890s -- Bert Williams and his 
partner George Walker. They humanized the denigrating blackface caricature by 
creating dramatic characters with dignity. At another table, I recognized the 
great comedy team from the 1920s, Miller and Lyles. There were Moms Mabley, and 
Pigmeat Markham from the '40s. 
</P>
<P>
 At another table were Jimmie Rogers, Slappy White, George Kirby. Representing 
the '50s, where they performed the first interracial jokes, these guys had 
taken a big step in the history of black comedy when they stripped off their 
chauffeur and bus-boy uniforms, hand-me-downs from the minstrel tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 At the next table were Dick Gregory, Bill Cosby and Godfrey Gambridge -- the 
'60s comics who went even further by telling jokes to an interracial audience. 
At the '70s table were Flip Wilson and Redd Foxx, who paved the way for today's 
African-American comedians by using black street language. 
</P>
<P>
 At a table by himself sits Richard Pryor -- representing the '80s. Behind him 
at another table sits Eddie Murphy and Whoopi Goldberg. 
</P>
<P>
 My dream turned into a nightmare, when I realized that I was to entertain 
them! 
</P>
<P>
 While I was thinking this, the doorman rushed in. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a white guy out there saying he should be in here. His name is Lenny 
Bruce!" 
</P>
<P>
 Somebody at the first table -- the early slave joke tellers -- said, "Massa 
Bruce? Doan know hem." Finally, Pryor said, "Let him in. Tell him he can come 
over and sit with me." 
</P>
<P>
 After Lenny was seated, I took a deep breath and went for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ladies and gentlemen, I'm not a comedian and what I say next may not be 
funny, but I want to tell you about a history of comedy -- a book by journalist 
Mel Watkins called 'On the Real Side' -- and you're all in it." 
</P>
<P>
 They nodded their approval and wanted to know how much space was devoted to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was the most important comic figure in all of the films in the '20, '30s, 
and '40s," Stepin Fetchit said. "What did he say about me?" 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most thoroughly researched and brilliant essays in this book is on 
Stepin Fetchit, who promoted his career by playing the role of "dumb nigger" 
off the black circuit comedy stage. When Darryl Zanuck asked Stepin Fetchit -- 
whose real name was Lincoln Theodore Monroe Andrew Perry -- for a decision, he 
would say, "It sounds good to me, Mr. Zanuck, but I'll have to talk it over 
with my manager, Mr. Goldberg, and get back to you." 
</P>
<P>
 One day Zanuck, fed up with delays, demanded the phone number of Mr. Goldberg. 
"I guess you had to find out one day," Fetchit confessed, "I'm Mr. Goldberg. " 
Stepin Fetchit took "playing the fool" to its ultimate expression. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Playing the fool' is a tradition we inherited in Africa," the griots said. 
"We had to use that in slavery to preserve a connection to our past and to 
shake off the hatred of the white man." 
</P>
<P>
 "But don't forget the work we did," Pigmeat Markham shouted. "We worked the 
chitlins circuit, where we could only perform to a black audience; without us 
paving the way, there couldn't be no Flip Wilson or Red Foxx." 
</P>
<P>
 "Now wait a minute," Cosby said. "I am against this idea that a comic has to 
refer to his race in order to be funny. Humor is universal, hello? Hello?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, that's because you begin working in the Village to a white audience," 
Moms Mabley snapped. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's all well and good, Mr. Cosby," Eddie Murphy put in, "but you are not 
the world's most popular black comedian now are you?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Richie," Cosby said to Pryor, "help me out." 
</P>
<P>
 "Bill, you helped me out many times, and now I'll return the favor. You don't 
have to be a black to be funny. But it helps." 
</P>
<P>
 I was glad I had them all here so that I could ask them questions about their 
appearance in this great book. 
</P>
<P>
 The book is really four books into one: an encyclopedia of everybody and every 
term related to black humor, a biography of leading comedians, a history of the 
social and cultural movement, and finally an analysis of what black humor is. 
</P>
<P>
 "This book begins with a history of black laughter," I told them. "At first, 
whites found the laughter of African slaves to be abhorrent." As late as 1944, 
Gunnar Myrdal, in his massive study of American black life, "The American 
Dilemma" (1944), would write confidently that the "Negro's cackling laugh," 
which amused the white man and often staved off punishment or brought rewards, 
"was a indication of blacks' ignorance and their 'accommodation to class.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Needless to say, these white observers never studied exactly what blacks found 
so humorous or why they were laughing. In fact, black humor is often distorted 
by the outsider: Watkins' aim here is to "trace and examine the social 
functions of two disparate strains of humor: the often distorted outside 
presentation in mainstream media (initially by non-blacks) and the authentic 
inside development of humor in black communities . . . as well as in folklore 
and black literature, films, and race records." 
</P>
<P>
 As my audience smiled appreciatively, I went on. 
</P>
<P>
 "However, the crux of this book is the transformation of Richard Pryor from 
diffident comic to comic genius. According to Watkins, Berkeley was the epic 
center of what the world would later come to known as the Richard Pryor Quake. 
I was there in the years 1966-70 when Pryor was "undergoing a major crisis 
involving his comic identity," according to Watkins. "The novelist Cecil Brown 
met Pryor at Mandrake's," Watkins writes, "after a friend told him 'There's a 
comedian down there who's crazier than you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 I did go to see Pryor at the Mandrake Club -- now it is an Animal Shelter and 
Hospital, and I immediately liked him. He liked me too. At first I didn't see 
Pryor as a professional comedian. He was just somebody I had known all my life. 
He was also how I saw myself. 
</P>
<P>
 In those days, the Mandrake was about as laid-back as you could get. Pryor's 
audience was college students. But that night it was packed with a different 
crowd, a blacker crowd. He did a parody on superman called Super Nigger. It was 
raw, exciting -- hilariously funny. These routines were never taped, but they 
were the raw materials for his next album, "Craps (After Dark)." 
</P>
<P>
 I had brought a camera that night. On stage, every time the flash went off, 
Pryor playfully struck a pose. Right after his show, we went out into the 
parking lot. "What did you think of my show?" he asked me. I told him I thought 
it was great -- it was. I introduced Pryor to Ishmael Reed, David Henderson, 
Claude Brown and other black artists in Berkeley in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pryor's Berkeley retreat ultimately proved to be a source of genuine 
inspiration" and by 1971, Watkins writes, when "Richard felt confident at least 
of the direction in which he wanted to take his humor, he returned to Los 
Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 We would go to movies. Pryor's favorite was the surreal "El Topos." We went to 
see a film in which giant insects took over the world. Pryor drew his comedic 
material from the life he lived, even when that life was made of matinees. 
</P>
<P>
 After Pryor's show, we would retire to his hotel room -- then to his apartment 
on California Street. With five or six other black men, we had many laughing 
sessions where we would stay up all night talking and watching late night TV, 
deconstructing white films. Late one night we lucked up on the Zulu uprising 
against the British. Why did the British win? I asked. Because Zulus don't make 
films, Pryor laughed. Like a pack of hungry dogs on shred of meat, we plundered 
white films -- the whiter, the cornier, the better -- for unintended laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an insular kind of humor, the kind that comes out when black men come 
together in the privacy of their shared humiliation and experience in white 
racist America. 
</P>
<P>
 Pryor would stay up all night. When we left, it would be 8 in the morning and 
he would sleep into the early afternoon. Then he would eat some dinner and 
stage his show, recreating some of the same scenes we had howled at the night 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 Pryor generated a sexual energy in his audience. "Don't worry about the money 
you spend on the ticket and the drinks," he told a young black man in the 
audience, "because I'm going to get her hot for you!" Women enjoyed the sexual 
undercurrents in Pryor's comedy and were attracted to them. Watkins describes 
Pryor's Mudbone, the rise of the major themes and characters of his albums, 
concerts and movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Watkins believes that it was this transformation that created Pryor's greatest 
art. "He had taken the humor of the streets, black American's presumed 'low' 
comedy -- with much of its vulgarity, profanity, explicit sexuality, and 
unvarnished satirical perception -- and, without losing any of its intensity, 
turned it into high art." 
</P>
<P>
 Watkins ranks Pryor with Bert Williams. "If Bert Williams was, as some claim, 
the finest American comedian of his time, then Pryor may have inherited that 
mantle. Without out, he changed American attitude about black folk humor, 
lifting it from obscurity and establishing it a preeminent form of humorous 
expression." 
</P>
<P>
 In my dream, the comedians were applauding suddenly. 
</P>
<P>
 "You did a great job entertaining us," Pryor said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank you, Richard," I said. "But tell us? How much of the truth did Watkins 
guess out? Did you jump on that table and yell 'Black Jack?' Did Cosby save 
you?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm writing my own book," Pryor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, I've heard that before. Watkins does a good job of reporting all the 
rumors and making plausible sense out of them. We will have to wait for Pryor's 
own autobiography for the facts. 
</P>
<P>
 And then I woke up. I wasn't white after all.

NUCLEAR MISSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the most shameful chapters in contemporary history is the denial and 
cover-up of the death and destruction caused by the pursuit of nuclear 
technology ("The Atomic Trail of Tears," by Michael D'Antonio, March 20). In 
the name of national security, technological superiority and plain old greed, 
generations of citizens have been lied to, victimized and sacrificed. 
</P>
<P>
 Nuclear proponents in industry and government continue to promote a deadly, 
expensive and unforgiving technology as the panacea of the future. Unable to 
sell new nuclear plants to the U.S. public, American companies are aggressively 
promoting their nuclear programs abroad. Third World nations and the former 
U.S.S.R. are high on their agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks for having the courage to deal with this issue.

 As a young wife and mother of four diagnosed with thyroid cancer, I recall 
asking my doctor, "What caused it?" With all the information on nuclear 
facilities now coming to light, his answer continues to resound in my mind: 
"Oh, we find people from specific areas of the country more prone to it." 
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, that's a casual explanation. However, reading and research 
have made it obvious to me that residing or working near a nuclear facility is 
indeed hazardous to human health. And with that in mind I have joined the class 
action against the Hanford nuclear facility. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be interesting in the coming decade to see how our government responds 
to the dangers it has allowed to be inflicted upon its own people in the name 
of national defense. I, and many others, don't feel very grateful for having 
been so well defended during the Cold War, only to be left with continuing 
health problems that have taken an incalculable physical, emotional and 
financial toll.

THE INVISIBLE MOTHER; THE PLAYGROUP: THREE WOMEN CONTEND WITH THE MYTH OF 
MOTHERHOOD, BY NINA BARRETT (SIMON & SCHUSTER: $21; 208 PP.)

<P>
 Jeez, don't the rest of you sometimes wish we'd just shut up and take care of 
the kids? It was so much quieter back when we were little girls, in the 1950s 
and early 1960s, when the sounds of our mothers' discontent were limited to a 
little late-night bruxism and the solitary scratching of Betty Friedan's 
prophetic pen. 
</P>
<P>
 But then the women's movement shoved open the door of possibility, and a rowdy 
crowd of dames stumbled into a new future. We could do anything: We could mimic 
men and stampede up the ladder of success (to a point, we would later learn, 
but nobody knew that at first); we could postpone childbirth until we owned 
fewer eggs than a foreclosed farmer; and if we wanted to we could have it all. 
Career, kids, happiness. 
</P>
<P>
 Except . . . guess what? Most women hit their late 30s and 40s feeling not 
that they had it all -- but rather, to their exhausted, brain-shredding dismay, 
that they had too much, and none of it quite the way they wanted it. Having a 
career meant not seeing enough of the kids; having a kid meant not being 
committed enough to a career, and the husband, too often, took the backseat. 
</P>
<P>
 So a new breed of women emerged: the stock-takers, determined to make sense 
out of chaos. Writer Nina Barrett is one. Her first book, "I Wish Someone Had 
Told Me," was the story of her first pregnancy and her early experiences as a 
mom. "The Playgroup" is the story of Nina and her son Sam, and the two other 
women who met weekly for a play group -- Grace and her daughter Phoebe, and 
Angie and her son Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrett speaks for a disenfranchised group, the mothers who stay at home, not 
because they are economically or emotionally predisposed to do so, but because 
circumstance conspires to remove them, at least temporarily, from the work 
force. Barrett showed up very pregnant for her New York Times job interview and 
was greeted by a less-than-enthusiastic interviewer. When her son Sam turned 
out to be a colicky baby, she put her dreams of a journalism career on hold and 
eventually started writing about what she knew: momhood. Grace wanted to be a 
theatrical director, but there was no way she could dovetail long evening 
rehearsals with Phoebe's nurse-on-demand schedule. And Angie, the most troubled 
of the three, took on parenting as her full-time career, with a passion that 
would eventually be her undoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrett didn't see their play group as a book project while it was going on; 
when the light bulb went off in her head she backtracked and tried to 
reconstruct the triangular friendship, based on interviews with her friends and 
a lot of her own well-footnoted soul-searching. Her method is responsible for 
the book's rolling structure: Grace's vivid memories of her first childbirth 
almost demand that it be the scene that opens the book, while the three 
fathers, who exist only in the women's reminiscences, are painted in pale 
watercolor gray. 
</P>
<P>
 And much of what transpires is meant to serve as the narrative foundation for 
Barrett's philosophical musings -- her genuinely heartfelt attempt to make 
sense of an event that should have thrilled her but instead made her feel 
isolated and confused. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, one rather demanding friend rejects the notion of reconstructed reality 
altogether, his objection being that any two people will remember a 
conversation differently five minutes after it's over. I don't go that far -- 
since wonderful books like "Indecent Exposure" depend on recreated dialogue -- 
but I find I do have a little trouble with a whole book of remembered material. 
I guess it's a memoir, more than a book of reportage. 
</P>
<P>
 That's my real dilemma. Heaven knows, we could afford to pay a little 
attention to the plight of American moms: Society still tells us that the best 
mom is the full-time mom, yet women who assume that role, as Barrett did, 
become instant "disappeareds" -- ignored, or, if noticed, often ridiculed and 
resented. Working moms have the unenviable opportunity to live their lives 
feeling they've done nothing as well as they might. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is a societal issue, not the fault of any single individual, and that 
is why Barrett's focus bothers me. For all her talk of the big picture, her 
book is devoted, finally, to a microscopic examination of three women's lives. 
Some narratives manage to leap to larger meaning, often because of the writer's 
ability to see universal truths in tiny details; Tracy Kidder's books about 
everything from computers to home-building to old age always manage to resonate 
with meaning. Barrett has written a more narrowly focused book, one that is 
often crystalline, thoughtful and articulate, but finally smaller than the 
subject demands.

WHERE THE PAVEMENT ENDS; 'WHEN THEY CUT THE FOREST DOWN TO MAKE A CITY, DO THE 
FOREST RANGERS BECOME POLICE?' THE WRITER'S SON ASKS.; THE GEOGRAPHY OF 
CHILDHOOD: WHY CHILDREN NEED WILD PLACES, BY GARY NABHAN AND STEPHEN TRIMBLE 
(BEACON PRESS: $22; 216 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Francesca Lyman, Francesca Lyman, a contributing editor of the Amicus 
Journal, is writing a book on cities and the environment. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Twenty years ago, a summer volunteer for a group that took Atlanta city 
children out to the country made a comment I'll never forget -- though it was 
20 years ago. These kids didn't "know how to walk" on the grass, she marveled, 
describing how her charges rolled gleefully around in the meadows as though on 
another planet. "They had only walked on cement before." 
</P>
<P>
 Today the number of children exposed to wild lands and animals is smaller than 
ever before in human history, lament naturalist writers Gary Nabhan and Stephen 
Trimble, in a provocative and compelling collection of essays, "The Geography 
of Childhood." City kids get most of their information about wilderness and 
wild animals -- nowadays, even farm animals -- through picture books and 
television, a fact these authors find troubling. Even the parks and playgrounds 
children play in are often denuded of natural vegetation "with which to form 
nests, shelters, wands, dolls and other playthings," Nabhan writes in one 
essay. 
</P>
<P>
 In the opening essay, Nabhan recounts the grim statistics on how many children 
will be born this decade in urban slums (57% in developing countries, 25% in 
the United States alone). And the authors note in their preface that for 
children of the most dangerous inner cites, survival depends more on learning 
to discriminate between sounds of different automatic weapons rather than any 
natural sights and sounds of generations past. 
</P>
<P>
 While some may regard wilderness and nature experiences as a luxury many 
parents can ill afford, these writers regard them as a necessary part of a 
child's education, in fact a "basic human need," that our culture too often 
ignores. "To counter the historic trend toward the loss of wildness where 
children play, it is clear that we need to find ways to let children roam 
beyond the pavement, to gain access to vegetation and earth that allows them to 
tunnel, climb or even fall," they urge. 
</P>
<P>
 Offering children experiences in the wild is one of the most important gifts 
that parents and teachers can give them, the authors write, because it can 
teach caring, humility, tolerance for other creatures and "nourish a lasting 
attachment to the earth." They even give nature experiences credit for 
nurturing self-esteem, that trendy buzzword of child development experts. 
</P>
<P>
 Children are becoming, for lack of a better term, environmentally handicapped. 
To answer the question posed in their book's subtitle, "Why Children Need Wild 
Places," Nabhan and Trimble bring to bear intimate personal vignettes from 
their own children's and friends' children's experiences and reminiscences from 
their own childhoods, as well as useful insights from less subjective sources 
-- child development experts, psychologists and environmental educators. 
</P>
<P>
 Ethnobotanist and nature writer Gary Nabhan, author of several volumes of 
nature writing, including three on the plants and people of the desert 
Southwest, is co-founder and director of Native Seeds/Search, an organization 
dedicated to preserving wild native seeds. Joining him is a less well-known 
photographer and author of books on Southwest landscape, Stephen Trimble, who 
adds a number of new essays to this anthology of pieces, several of which have 
been previously published. Both writers have long explored the proper 
relationship between human beings and nature. But here these writers explore 
the wondrous, fascinating and adventuresome response of children to being in 
nature -- new terrain through their children's eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 The world from knee-height is a marvel where Nabhan finds "Lilliputian 
landscapes often overlooked by educated adults seeking The Big Picture." His 
probes show kids adventuring down holes and hollows, up trees and 
mountainsides, on hands and knees, while documenting their discovery of frogs, 
lizards and other creatures, their taking of found objects, their finding 
shelter in nooks and crannies. Trimble finds ranch and farm kids who "rely on 
animals as friends when human friends are few and far between." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike many new books on the market that dutifully laud the benefits of 
instilling environmental awareness in children, "The Geography of Childhood" 
suggests that children also have a lot to tell us adults about natural 
exploration, wonder and renewing bonds with nature. As the authors explain in 
their foreword, the book is hardly a how-to-handbook for parents and teachers 
on how to bring children into nature or a tip sheet on how to guide them in it. 
"Rather it is an exchange of ideas, images and stories between two natural 
historians who are finding their ways as fathers while they watch their own 
children's behavior in the world unfold." 
</P>
<P>
 Because nature doesn't judge, Trimble reflects, "one route to self-esteem, 
particularly for shy or undervalued children lies in the out-of-doors." 
Likewise, he notes, nature teaches, through its astonishing diversity, an 
inherent democracy. "The endless forms generated by evolution subconsciously 
reassures us of our validity. No matter that we differ a bit from our peers: 
Difference is the norm." 
</P>
<P>
 As with any book of essays originally published elsewhere this one proceeds in 
a fairly unstructured fashion, with shifting perspectives and some overlap. 
(Several are expansions of earlier shorter pieces, such as Nabhan's opening 
essay, "A Child's Sense of Wildness," which appeared in Orion and Northern 
Lights before that.) But the book hangs together as a whole nevertheless, with 
essays alternating between the two authors like a dialogue between them, two 
friends who have known each other a long time, Nabhan originally a city boy, 
Trimble a country boy, both now fathers of two small children. 
</P>
<P>
 Nabhan's essays are rich with anecdotes about his children, Laura and Dusty 
(aged 5 and 7 at the time of writing) and comments from them. "Over time," he 
writes, "I've come to realize that a few intimate places mean more to my 
children . . . than all the glorious panoramas I could ever show them." 
Children's responses are the real subject of this book, and, not surprisingly, 
some of the passages that ring truest come from the children themselves. "When 
they cut the forest down to make a city, what do the forest rangers do then? Do 
they become police?" asks Dusty in a conversation about encroaching 
urbanization. 
</P>
<P>
 Trimble, son of a map-maker for the U.S. Geological Survey, grew up in the 
West. One of his best essays in this volume has much to say about the impact of 
geography on one's sense of self. "My childhood in the West -- where geology 
overwhelms biology, lightly vegetated landscape commands attention, and weather 
is intense -- surely gave me an edge in mental map-making." 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, too, the reader is introduced to some wild and woolly 
characters of the West, such as a hermit of the O'odham Native tribe living on 
the Cabeza Prieta Wildlife Refuge, who does "a great imitation of a 
Zebra-tailed lizard running with its tail curled up like that of a scorpion." A 
board member of a unique ranch on the California-Nevada state line, Deep 
Springs, designed to teach teen-agers the value of "a life of service" through 
hard work, describes what is gained: "A breakfast table looks different to 
someone who has milked cows, churned butter, slaughtered hogs, candled eggs, 
and dug potatoes." We meet also Kamau Kambui, a member of Minnesota's Wilder 
Forest staff who has made a conventional nature walk "into something far more 
emotionally rich," a re-enactment of abolitionist Harriet Tubman to relive what 
it feels to escape slavery by passage through the wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
 There is much refreshing and informative material in this book, which comes 
with a useful bibliography to boot. However, it could have benefited from less 
nostalgic reminiscence and more fresh creative suggestions about how children 
can be offered more nature experiences in places far from wilderness. The few 
programs that are described here just make us hunger for more discussion of 
practical solutions: We learn about innovative programs scattered about the 
country, such as Vision-Quest, to put troubled youth in better touch with 
nature, and hence, through vital rites of passage to adulthood. And Nabhan, at 
least, offers an intelligent critique of modern formal playgrounds, arguing 
that children should be encouraged to do more exploration in real natural 
habitats in parks. He also urges parents and teachers to do what they can to 
encourage spontaneous hands-on contact with plants and animals, especially in 
native habitats. 
</P>
<P>
 Can urban gardens serve the same purpose as wilderness? the authors 
provocatively ask. The answer lies in this passage: "We need not try to do what 
television does, which is to set up the assumption of immediate intimacy with 
all animals, even when that cannot be achieved in the field," writes Nabhan. 
"Real attention to a covey of quail, a swarm of termites, a litter of pack rats 
will do for most kids I know."

 Gene Hackman's best work, ranging from "The French Connection" to 
"Unforgiven," seems to derive its power from characters who either tyrannically 
assert authority or rage against it ("Hackman, Beyond It All," by Hilary de 
Vries, March 20). Could it be that Hackman alternates between an emotional 
identification with his own authoritarian father and himself, in a rebellious 
rage against his father? If so, in a negative way Hackman owes his father a 
great debt indeed.

 David Wharton's reflections on the kilted look for men caused me to reflect, 
too (Style, March 20). As owner and wearer of a real Scottish kilt, I'm bemused 
at what we consider "traditional views of masculinity."Modern pants go back 
only to Beau Brummel in the early 1880s, while some of history's most macho men 
-- Alexander, Caesar and members of the Black Watch and Gordon Highlanders 
among them -- wore kilts or tunics. 
</P>
<P>
 As for how to carry one's wallet, how about the Scottish sporran? Too few 
compartments? Wear a fanny pack. It's just an updated sporran. 
</P>
<P>
 If Wharton is really worried about what is worn under a kilt, try this on 
anyone who asks: "Why, nothing's worn. Everything's in perfect order."

UNFRIENDLY SKIES?

 It was dismaying to see in print that airline attendants refer to flights to 
Los Angeles as "the fruit-and-nut run" (L.A. Speak, Palm Latitudes, March 20). 
</P>
<P>
 While in Boston a short time ago, I came across a button in a card shop that 
said: "California is like granola; take away all the fruits and nuts and all 
you have left are flakes."While intending to be cute, it was still California 
bashing, and its subtle anti-gay message was frightening. Yet the store that 
sold it, the chain that supplied it and the manufacturer that made it were 
obviously perfectly at ease with it. I was not amused when the manufacturer 
telephoned me with the assurance that the button's only intent was humor. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps you at the magazine thought that the "humor" of the flight statement 
made it OK to print. Most likely, you didn't question it because it was about 
"fruits," rather than being about another minority -- one that, by way of 
legislation and education, it has become unacceptable to slur in the press. I 
find such insensitivity frightening.

RICHARD EDER: IN FANTASY AND IN FACT; ROALD DAHL: A BIOGRAPHY, BY JEREMY 
TREGLOWN (FARRAR, STRAUS & GIROUX: $25; 322 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By RICHARD EDER

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Your threat to leave Knopf after this current contract is fulfilled leaves us 
far from intimidated," Robert Gottlieb wrote Roald Dahl in 1980, after a long 
association that saw "James and the Giant Peach" and "Charlie and the Chocolate 
Factory" become two of the best-loved and best-selling children's books in 
history. "You've managed to make the entire experience of publishing you 
unappealing for all of us. . . ." Gottlieb continued: "To be perfectly clear, 
let me reverse your threat: Unless you start acting civilly to us, there is no 
possibility of our agreeing to continue to publish you." 
</P>
<P>
 Civilly was not an adverb of Dahl's grammar -- boorishly, perhaps, and 
prodigally, piggishly, generously, childishly and enchantingly. As his editor, 
of course, Gottlieb knew it. How many editors today, out of sheer self-respect, 
would dismiss an author who ran up royalties of about $5 million a year? 
</P>
<P>
 Dahl stomped over to Farrar, Straus & Giroux for four successful books, huffed 
along to Viking for one more and died three years ago, leaving behind an uneasy 
reputation. He had written virulently about Israel and the Jews, had broken 
with his fellow literati -- who never accepted him as one of their own -- by 
denouncing Salman Rushdie instead of Salman Rushdie's death sentence; and had 
distilled some odd, dark flavors in his writing that put off children's book 
specialists, though not children. 
</P>
<P>
 Visiting Dahl's grave in Great Missenden, England, Jeremy Treglown found it 
garlanded with plastic toys and a large onion. He has written the onion. His 
biography is as fumy, cantankerous and uneven as Dahl himself; sometimes mean, 
often funny and yet, after layers of peeling, offering us a fair-minded and 
even generous portrait. You wouldn't want to know Dahl, perhaps, but you are 
glad to know of him. 
</P>
<P>
 Children's classics tend to divide into the settling and the unsettling. The 
first may offer all kinds of distressful adventures along with their magic, but 
there is a framework that suggests that finally things are golden and OK: for 
example, "Winnie the Pooh," "The Wind in the Willows," the Oz books, "Black 
Beauty." The second leave a quivering imbalance, not necessarily dark but 
perturbing: "Alice in Wonderland," "The Princess and the Goblin," Maurice 
Sendak's books and Roald Dahl's. Order does not prevail and cannot quite 
reassure; on the other hand, it does not suppress a child's own disorder. 
Disorder is liberated instead -- in Dahl, for example, with the dispatching of 
Charlie's unpleasant aunts or, in "The BFG," with the Big Friendly Giant's 
proclivity for breaking wind at state occasions. 
</P>
<P>
 Treglown gives a concise but effective account both of the children's books 
and of the clever, grisly short stories that Dahl wrote in the 1950s. Without 
straining, he portrays a Dahl who remarkably resembles his writing: a 6-foot-6 
child of a man, with a need to bring off marvels and slay dragons. All too 
often both the marvels and the dragon-slaying were performed upon his friends 
and family, who lived in a steady din of feats and prowess. 
</P>
<P>
 As a bachelor in Washington, D.C., he painted the genitals of the rhinoceroses 
on the Q Street Bridge. After telling his children bedtime stories of a giant 
who prepared dreams and blew them through the windows, he put up a ladder 
outside the nursery, climbed it and rustled their curtains. When Olivia, his 
animal-loving daughter, died, Dahl went for consolation to Geoffrey Fisher, the 
retired Archbishop of Canterbury, only to leave in a fury when Fisher informed 
him that heaven had a no-dogs policy. The man's life was agitated and 
agitating; one in which fantasy was all the more disruptive because to a 
considerable measure he made it come true. 
</P>
<P>
 Dahl was the son of a wealthy Norwegian ship broker who settled in England and 
died when he was young; he was raised by his mother and several doting sisters. 
He joined the Royal Air Force in World War II, and almost immediately crashed 
in the Egyptian desert after running out of fuel. He would embroider the 
embarrassment into a tale of heroic action; on the other hand, once recovered 
from severe injuries, he went on to become an authentic flying hero. 
</P>
<P>
 Assigned as an air attache in Washington, his real mission was to be a dashing 
example of British military prowess to capital circles whose Anglophilia 
Churchill counted as a main war resource. He hung out with the likes of Ian 
Fleming, C. S. Forester, Martha Gellhorn, Ernest Hemingway; and made love to a 
number of glamorous women including, by his account, Clare Boothe Luce. The 
Saturday Evening Post printed his embroidered first-person account of being 
"shot down"; Walt Disney planned for a while to make a movie from a Dahl 
scenario about gremlins. In an exchange of correspondence that prefigured his 
poker-faced fictional fantasies, Dahl warned Disney against depriving the 
gremlins of their bowler hats. They might, he wrote, make trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, he became the close friend and lifelong protege of Charles 
Marsh, a wealthy oilman with a taste for fantasy and game-playing equal to 
Dahl's. Marsh's money helped him keep going when he returned to England to 
write; his and his wife's friendship helped steady Dahl's stormy marriage to 
the actress Patricia Neal. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a remarkable marriage and it serves as the appropriate centerpiece of 
Treglown's biography. It lasted 30 years, and divided with the drama of a Dahl 
tale into two sharply contrasting parts. For the first half Neal was the great 
figure: a Broadway and Hollywood star, beautiful and loved as well as courted 
by an array of glamorous friends. She had the money and the fame; Dahl, whose 
short stories had won him modest shares of each, had not yet begun the 
children's books. The inequality made him all the more flamboyant and 
imperious; he dominated or overturned every dinner table. Neal, by Treglown's 
absorbing account, loved and understood him enough to keep things going. He 
managed the money; she made his breakfast and lunch and bathed the babies -- 
they had five -- before going to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve years later, in 1964, she had three disabling strokes, which put an end 
to the career, the glamour and her ability to care for her family. It seems to 
have been a spectacular if faintly queasy liberation for Dahl. With his first 
children's books catching fire, he was the moneymaker. At home he became the 
immensely present father, and the fiercely authoritarian supervisor of Neal's 
long convalescence. Like Mr. Willy Wonka of the chocolate factory, as Treglown 
points out, he could be the great magus and panjandrum, both in fantasy and 
fact. 
</P>
<P>
 Treglown, a former editor of the Times Literary Supplement, gives a full 
account of Dahl's arrogance, intemperance and bullying qualities. His story of 
Dahl's tantrums with his publishers, which grew worse as he grew more 
successful, virtually turn him into one of his own fairy-story monsters. Yet 
Dahl's monsters had a comic charm; and so does Treglown's Dahl. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, throughout this combative biography, something else shines 
through. As in his days in the RAF, Dahl was both a fantasy hero and a real 
one. He could be revoltingly unpleasant during the years his wife overshadowed 
him; yet, he had the great sanity to retreat with apparent weakness into his 
own strength, and give up adult fiction for the seemingly modest role of 
children's writer. At home, his insistence on taking ferocious charge of 
everything including Neal's rehabilitation may have been bullying. But it saved 
her life and gradually encouraged and tormented her into a recovery which, 
though not complete, allowed her to pursue a genuine if diminished career on 
the stage and in television. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually -- 18 years after the strokes -- Dahl left Neal for Felicity 
Crosland, with whom he had been having an affair for several years. But 
Treglown talked at great length with Neal, and more briefly with two of their 
daughters. (The second Mrs. Dahl and a third daughter, who is also writing a 
biography, did not cooperate.) And what he found was a mixture of gratitude, 
anger and awe at the memory of this human whirlwind, who blew debris along with 
dreams in through their windows, and blew them promptly out again through their 
door.

BELOW THE SURFACE; CAROL SHIELDS' CHARACTERS MEDITATE ON THE QUESTION WE'LL ALL 
EVENTUALLY ASK OURSELVES -- HAVE WE LIVED AS FULLY AS WE MEANT TO?; THE STONE 
DIARIES, BY CAROL SHIELDS (VIKING: $21.95; 361 PP.) ; HAPPENSTANCE, BY CAROL 
SHIELDS (PENGUIN BOOKS: $10.95, PAPER; 390 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Elizabeth Benedict, Elizabeth Benedict's first novel, Slow Dancing, was a 
finalist for The L.A. Times Fiction Prize. Her most recent novel, Safe Conduct, 
was published last spring. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The two brief, wonderful novels that make up "Happenstance" were written in 
the late 1970s but not brought out in the U.S. until now, in a 
two-for-one/his-and-hers paperback package. If you are unfamiliar with the work 
of American-born Canadian novelist Carol Shields, this set is a splendid place 
to start. 
</P>
<P>
 Her most recent novel, "The Stone Diaries," which was short-listed last summer 
for the Booker Prize, is being published at the same time. In between, she 
wrote "Swann" (1989) and "The Republic of Love" (1992). 
</P>
<P>
 I doubt that many hostesses would choose Chicago suburbanites Brenda and Jack 
Bowman, the his-and-her of "Happenstance," to transform their dinner parties 
into a latter-day Algonquin Round Table, but in Carol Shields' gifted hands, 
their ordinary lives are hugely engrossing and sharply, satirically fixed at 
the edges of the social and intellectual trends of the late 1970s, though there 
is nothing dated about the material. 
</P>
<P>
 The novels tell the story of housewife-turned-quilt-maker Brenda's five-day 
trip to a crafts convention in Philadelphia, from her point of view and, when 
you flip the book over, from her husband Jack's. At 40, Brenda has not been 
touched by "the new sexual freedom" and hasn't taken a trip on her own in 20 
years of marriage. Jack, who will for the first time stay home with their two 
teen-age children, is a second-rate historian who works at a think tank and has 
been lethargically writing a history of Indian trading practices for many 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The novels' his-and-her format will bring to mind Evan Connell's "Mrs. Bridge" 
and "Mr. Bridge," but Brenda and Jack are a different breed -- contemporary 
suburbanites with an above-average sex life, a sense of humor and history, and 
a profound gratitude that their children are not drug addicts. Unlike the 
Bridges, Brenda and Jack are deliciously, delightfully introspective, 
especially for these five days when their roles are so dramatically reversed. 
</P>
<P>
 Separation forces them to master life skills they've never had to use (Jack 
changes a typewriter ribbon for the first time; Brenda flirts with infidelity), 
but beneath the surface challenge, both are preoccupied with whether they have 
lived as fully as they meant to, whether they have made enough of their lives, 
a subject that animates many of Carol Shields' characters. When she got married 
in the late 1950s, Brenda wanted nothing more than a pink kitchen and Armstrong 
flooring, but now, "there was a reluctance . . . to say: well, that's the way 
it is. When she looked at something these days -- a face, a house, an expanse 
of scenery -- she was more likely to think, is this all there is?" 
</P>
<P>
 When Jack's only friend Bernie is abandoned by his wife and comes to him for 
comfort, Jack is not really up to the job. "A better man -- where was he? -- 
would give his full attention and sympathy to his oldest friend, his friend who 
has today suffered a major catastrophe in his life, who is feeling lost and 
alone and frightened and even tearful." Instead, Jack drags him to a cocktail 
party. 
</P>
<P>
 Shields is wickedly accurate about the intricacies of marriage, parenthood and 
the battle of the sexes, and an astute observer and satirist of social trends. 
One of the great pleasures of "Happenstance" is the way she manages to turn a 
crafts convention into a bed-swapping Feydeau farce with feminist overtones and 
a very moving outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 There is something wonderfully illicit about this pair of books, because we're 
privy to so much about Brenda and Jack's lives they will never tell each other, 
the big secrets and the small, like this one: "Once, years ago, when she was 
painting her bedroom, she stood on a stepladder and saw carved into the molding 
over the door frame the words 'Jake Parker, builder, 1923.' She thought of 
telling Jack about it, but never did. He would overprize it, lead friends 
upstairs to see it. She kept it to herself: Jake Parker, young, muscular, 
audacious." 
</P>
<P>
 In "The Stone Diaries," a luminous, wonderfully ambitious novel, Shields is 
also driven by the unbearable lightness of living an ordinary life. The "diary" 
is Daisy Goodwill Fletts' brilliantly inventive account of her 80-plus years, 
told in the first person, the third person, photographs, letters, menus and a 
family tree, whose most glaring omission involves Daisy's mother, Mercy Stone, 
who died in childbirth. Not even the names of Mercy's parents are known, and 
this huge absence -- of a mother, of antecedents -- makes Daisy feel throughout 
her life "that she belongs to no one," that she has spent her many years 
"hurling herself at the emptiness she was handed at birth." Yet Daisy takes 
care to remind us that "she is not always reliable when it comes to the details 
of her life; much of what she has to say is speculative, exaggerated, wildly 
unlikely." 
</P>
<P>
 Born unexpectedly in Manitoba in 1905 -- her obese mother hadn't known she was 
pregnant -- Daisy spends her final days in a Florida nursing home in the 1990s, 
rewriting her life and imagining the judgments her children will pass on her 
once she's gone. Looking back over her motherless childhood, her reunion with 
her stonecutter father at age 11, her two marriages and three children, she 
knows her only genuine fulfillment has come from writing a much-loved gardening 
column for a local newspaper in her late 50s, only to be abruptly fired when a 
burned-out news reporter (male) wanted a change of pace and laid claim to her 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after, she falls into a deep depression and, as is typical in the diary, 
gives everyone in her life an imaginary chance to theorize about why. Best 
friend Fraidy concludes that she's sexually frustrated. Her son says she "must 
be in mourning for the squandering of her life," and her career-woman daughter 
is certain it's because she lost her job. Brilliant ventriloquist that Shields 
is, we forget for pages at a time that Daisy is the only narrator of this tale; 
every utterance, every hard-edged interpretations, has her name on it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Stone Diaries" has the scope of a Dickens novel, the wit of Muriel Spark 
and the stylistic inventiveness of Graham Swift's "Waterland." The cast of 
characters is large, rowdy, and lovable; all are sharply rooted in their own 
time and place. 
</P>
<P>
 Daisy is obsessed with what she feels is her insubstantiality, the fact that 
she has spent her life "moving right along, and along, and along. . . . Numbly, 
without thinking." Yet she was born of stone: her mother's maiden name was 
Stone; her father and father-in-law were both stonecutters. Her greatest glory 
may have been her gardening column -- flowers being beautiful but evanescent, 
the opposite of stone -- but the novel Shields has fashioned from her 
extraordinary ordinary life has the strength and iridescent beauty of a 
diamond.

THREE ON THE TOWN: THE PAINTING ON THE WALL; BUILDING BRIDGES INSTEAD OF 
BARRIERS, A MURAL HELPS THE HEALING BEGIN

 It's a workday afternoon and except for an occasional docent or security 
guard, I have the entire Detroit Institute of Arts to myself. I'm alone in the 
garden court, absorbed by the frescoes of Mexican muralist Diego Rivera. I'm 
overwhelmed by the magnitude of Rivera's angular Amazons. Beyond the elemental 
symbolism of industry, desire, fertility and creation, what strikes me most is 
that they look like me and I look like them , the first images of the feminine 
with which I can identify . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I'm in the seat next to Bobbi as she jumps from the car and dashes across the 
busy Sydney street. As she hurries into the bank, a fiercely white, squat 
stucco building, my eyes are drawn along stark, staid corporate walls and 
captured by a single handprint the color of blood dried to blackening. Four 
inches below its ruddy base, the insolent palm drizzles to nothing. I suddenly 
feel it to my bones . As my pulse roars in my ears, I'm flooded by a strange 
sense of recognition, awed by something aboriginal, metaphorical and 
insurrectionary. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 We're driving east along Sunset Boulevard. "Look," my husband points to the 
wall of an Echo Park building. "They covered it up! Whattta shame." His 
favorite stylin'-and-bombin' wall, tagged with the rebellious urban scrawl of 
graffiti artists, has been painted over with a pedestrian business 
advertisement. That particular wall always excited his aesthetics, aroused 
sightings of his bohemian past as if he'd suddenly discovered that a bit of 
dear ol' Manhattan had broken off and slid west to the cultural wastelands. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 On a diamond-blue spring afternoon, I find myself among the pleased and the 
preening at the unveiling. In the wake of the verdict in the Rodney King 
beating trial, and the violence that followed, the staff of the California 
Employment Development Department was inspired to do something to help heal the 
community. And so the Art Team Mural Project was born. After nearly two years, 
the 27-foot-long wall inside the department's South-Central office, at Avalon 
and El Segundo, has been completed by six high school students under the 
guidance of artists Sally Howell Comaire and George Evans. Bouquets and 
certificates of merit are presented to Patricia Ayala from Jordan High; Iesha 
Perkins from Locke High; De'Shaun Brown, also from Locke, but now studying 
civil engineering at Cal State Long Beach; Reyna Mendez and Horacio Serrano, 
from Jordan, both awarded Restyle L.A. scholarships to art school; and Milo 
Pipkins from Inglewood High. 
</P>
<P>

COVER STORY: THE LIONS OF YALTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The sound stages at CBS Studios in Hollywood, the home of daytime game shows 
and soap operas, have quite literally been invaded by the lavish production 
"'World War II: When Lions Roared." The four-hour NBC drama stars three lions 
of the acting profession: Michael Caine as Joseph Stalin, Bob Hoskins as 
Winston Churchill and John Lithgow as Franklin Roosevelt. 
</P>
<P>
 Written and produced by David W. Rintels ("Day One") and directed by Joseph 
Sargent ("Miss Rose White"), "When Lions Roared" explores the strategies, 
competition, friendship and rivalry of these wartime Allied leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is the first American drama to be produced in HDTV -- High 
Definition Television. Through the innovative editing techniques of HDTV, the 
production combines vintage World War II footage, still photography and live 
action. Michael Caine (Joseph Stalin) 
</P>
<P>
 The very British Caine, who has starred in such acclaimed films as "Alfie," 
"Hannah and Her Sisters," "Educating Rita" and "Sleuth," may seem like an odd 
choice to play the Soviet leader. Caine is blond and tall; Stalin was 
dark-haired and short. But thanks to a terrific makeup job and commanding 
Russian accent, Caine is quite impressive as he shoots a scene in which he 
dictates a communique to Roosevelt and Churchill. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oscar winner achieved his accent using an innovative copycat method: "I 
had a Russian actor record my entire part speaking in English," he explains. 
"You've really got to move your mouth in Russian. My mustache falls off three 
times a day. And I take it off for lunch or I'll eat it!" 
</P>
<P>
 Relaxing in his tiny dressing room during a lunch break, Caine is all Cockney 
charm. He's joking about the fact that the production would be moving to Prague 
during the middle of winter. "It's going to be nice and warm," he quips. "We 
are going to take our shorts. We will take sunscreen just in case we get burned 
up. I am fair-haired, you know." 
</P>
<P>
 He's also been raising a bit of Cain with everyone, he says, in his effort to 
portray Stalin authentically. "They brought in an actor the other day who plays 
an officer, and (the actor) was 5 feet 6 inches. I said, 'I'm 6 feet 2 inches. 
And (Stalin) is supposed to be 5 feet 4 inches. This guy would then be 5 feet 2 
inches. He wouldn't be in the Army, let alone on my bloody staff. I said, 'Get 
some guys who are taller than me.' They don't understand it." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in 1933, Caine has very clear memories of World War II. "We were taught 
what was going on in school, and Stalin didn't die until 1953. I was very aware 
of everything. I'm a news and current affairs buff." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the British intelligentsia, Caine says, agree that Hitler was a 
monster. That's not the case with Joseph Stalin. "The majority thought Stalin 
was a wonderful person," he says firmly. "A least a third of them still do." 
The fact is that Hitler killed millions of Russians and so did Stalin. "Yet, 
you still get intellectuals who think Stalin is a bigger hero than Churchill." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the reason may be that, during the war, Stalin was known in America 
and England as "Uncle Joe." People didn't know that he killed some of his own 
generals, "in case the army turned against him. He was paranoid and completely 
schizophrenic because on one side there was this lovely old man, and then you 
had this other man we brought out for this film. He was always very diplomatic 
and quiet, even while giving orders to shoot 700 men. He was always very calm. 
He never ranted and raved like Hitler, except with his own generals in his 
bunker. They discovered that since the war." 
</P>
<P>
 Caine also discovered that Stalin could be very funny, "but then he also was 
extremely cunning politically because he screwed these two, Churchill and 
Roosevelt. They didn't know quite what happened at Yalta. They gave half the 
world away and we ended up with 45 years of the Iron Curtain." 
</P>
<P>
 Even for those who lived through the war and thought they knew all about it, 
"When Lions Roared" should be a learning experience, Caine says. "You find out 
just how Machiavellian Stalin was with these two and how these two were at 
loggerheads over loads of things. What we say has been taken from transcripts. 
It's not invented dialogue. It was all said or recorded or communicated. With 
this technology, we talk to each other and react in split-screen in London, 
Washington and Moscow. The main problem is to make the people human. It turned 
out to be a lot easier than I thought." 
</P>
<P>
 There is a trick to playing someone evil, Caine says. "If you think in terms 
of someone who is evil, they never see themselves as evil. So many actors play 
tyrants and wicked people from our point of view, instead of being inside the 
person looking out at the world and saying, 'I am a nice guy.' Hitler said, 'I 
killed 6 million Jews, but I love children and I love dogs.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I play a lot of bad guys and one of the things people have often said is that 
somehow you make them sympathetic. The reason for that is I don't see them as 
bad guys. The facts speak for themselves. You see what Stalin had done." 
</P>
<P>
 After watching a "wonderful" French documentary on the Soviet dictator, the 
one thing that struck Caine about Stalin was that he didn't look evil at all. 
In fact, Caine says, "he looked rather nice. You look at Stalin and say, 'He is 
a nice guy.' The evil was completely hidden." John Lithgow (Franklin D. 
Roosevelt) 
</P>
<P>
 Actor John Lithgow has never been a World War II buff. "But my parents 
absolutely adored Roosevelt," he says with a smile. "When I told my mother I 
was playing him, she burst into tears!" 
</P>
<P>
 Lithgow acknowledges it's been hard playing such a legendary figure. "It's not 
actually difficult doing it," he explains. "What you have to contend with is 
coming far short of the mark. He's such an icon. People know him and revere him 
so much, no matter how close you get, you're not only far from the real thing, 
you are far from people's fantasies of him. But what also makes it's hard, is 
what makes it fascinating. I think this is a brand new, very close-up look of 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing Roosevelt also was literally painful for Lithgow. Roosevelt wore 
braces after losing the use of his legs from polio, and so did Lithgow to make 
his performance more real. "I went through a lot of fittings," he says. "They 
are very painful, so they constantly remind me (of what Roosevelt went through) 
because I have them on. I'm sitting all day and sitting is harder than 
walking." 
</P>
<P>
 The historical deification of the 32nd President also has presented a 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I think must happen with every major figure in history who is deemed 
successful, the minute he steps from the stage there is no longer a realistic 
perception of him," Lithgow adds. "He's deified. Look at what happened to 
Kennedy. Going back and reading about F.D.R., the scales fell from my eyes. I 
learned so much about him, not all of it flattering." 
</P>
<P>
 Roosevelt, he says, "was by no means a godlike figure. Certainly a great man, 
but his greatness was sort of circumstantial greatness. It's exactly what the 
country needed for the Depression and the war." 
</P>
<P>
 Lithgow believes that Roosevelt could be devious in his political dealings, 
play people off each other and then go ahead and do what he wanted. "He could 
cover up his tracks and lie. The things I find absolutely fascinating about him 
don't necessarily have a part to play in this piece. I'm really enjoying this 
piece, but one of my frustrations is when I research a part, you learn much 
more than you can possibly use." 
</P>
<P>
 The Tony- and Emmy-winning actor envisions Roosevelt as an actor playing a 
part. "He loved the heroic role," Lithgow says. "I think role is a good word 
for him because he was playing the part of a President." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's something very compelling abut our knowing that they actually said 
these things," Lithgow says of the dialogue taken from historical records. 
"It's incredibly potent. It's pure history and the key to this whole piece." 
Bob Hoskins (Winston Churchill) 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Hoskins so immersed himself in the role of Winston Churchill, he can 
"probably take a Ph.D. in history. I've read about 10 books and seen about 10 
hours of video and God knows how many speeches I listened to." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoskins, who received a 1986 best actor Oscar nomination for "Mona Lisa," was 
a bit worried about playing the legendary aristocratic British politician who 
guided his country through World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the man who talks with a lisp," Hoskins says in his pronounced 
Cockney accent. "But then when I went to the costumer in London and I started 
putting this padding on and got this shape: It was Winnie. Once you start to 
get into a role, you start to think in the voice. And once you start thinking 
in the voice, you talk in the voice." 
</P>
<P>
 Churchill, Hoskins believes, was a warmonger. "He didn't have much actual 
contact with the working man. He was quite hated (by the working man). But 
Winston ran the war and running the war, you needed someone like that to spur 
the people on and make them fight." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoskins says he learned "odd things" about Churchill during his research: "His 
sense of humor, his wit. He was a very selfish man. He wasn't aware of other 
people at all. Secretaries would collapse exhausted. If you are brought up to 
be from (the aristocratic) class, there is not very much awareness." 
</P>
<P>
 The actor hopes "When Lions Roared" will educate youngsters and adults about 
the global conflict. "Let's face it, the standard of education both here and in 
England has gone down the drain," Hoskins says. "John (Lithgow) was getting 
changed into his costume and one of the actors from one of the soap operas John 
knew -- the guy was in his mid-30s -- came over (to the set) and was looking at 
the picture of Churchill, Stalin and Roosevelt at Yalta. And he said, 'Who was 
who?' " 
</P>
<P>
 "World War II: When Lions Roared" airs Tuesday at 8 p.m. and Wednesday at 9 
p.m. on NBC.; the drama also will be available on MPI Video beginning the week 
of April 25th for $40.

 THE LOTUS EATER by Marc Laidlaw (St. Martin's: $19.95; 240 pp.) "The Lotus 
Eater" reminds me of the old Alcan Highway, the one made of parallel logs: If 
you moved fast enough you wouldn't notice the bumps.Zip right through Marc 
Laidlaw's fictional Bohemia Bay, a Southern California coast town sometimes 
known as Fire Island West. Don't pause to ask why an assortment of singularly 
scabrous youths belong to the One-Way Club, a Christian conclave presided over 
by Hawk, an ex-con who lives on a dirt lot in a "trailer squatting in the sun 
like a lunatic's chapel," and who preaches the Gospel of "the straight-talkin', 
woman lovin', two-fisted fightin' Jesus." Don't probe too deeply into the 
motivations of a rival gang led by Sal Diaz, a local scuz who deals drugs only 
to provide a more magnanimous milieu for his gang, a giggle of runaway boys 
whose nicknames run to "Marilyn" and "Bogey." 
</P>
<P>
 Laidlaw, author of "Kalifornia", writes at the speed of squeam. He is a master 
of the lurid, the vile: A squashed skull examined in detail; a bilious drainage 
pipe; crawly little blind things. Not much, though, in the way of a plot. 
Nonetheless, there's a certain fascination, a sidelong glance at a freeway 
accident. But again, don't stop to smell the flowers. There aren't any.

 MACARTHUR MUST DIE by Ian Slater (Donald I. Fine: $21.95; 336 pp.) There were 
heroes in those days, and villains. You knew who was whom, and so did they.Nor 
did we have a corner on bias. Prime Minister Hideki Tojo, for his part, had 
convinced Japan that whites were inferior -- and they didn't take much 
convincing. Thus when young Tomokazu Somura is tagged to kill Douglas 
MacArthur, it is an honor, "a holy command" to avenge the death of Isoroku 
Yamamoto, "the genius of Pearl Harbor." Tucked into Ian Slater's rousing, 
splendidly told adventure is the shaky psyche of wartime Australia, directly in 
the line of fire of all-conquering Japan. Historically, Darwin has been bombed, 
New Guinea is about to fall and there is a contingency plan to abandon the 
northern two-thirds of Australia to the enemy. MacArthur is in Brisbane, 
rallying the troops, and Somura -- who had studied in Brisbane -- is en route 
in one of Japan's monster aircraft-carrying submarines. Searing suspense rides 
along on Somura's mission, underscored by racial tension. Somura -- flinty, 
resourceful, pitiless -- enlists the aid of his trusting Australian girlfriend, 
whose father has been beheaded in Singapore and whose brother has been tortured 
to death. MacArthur's legendary insouciance in the face of danger plays nicely 
against Somura's fanaticism. . . . Prime-time stuff.

 Bugsy (TMC Sunday at 12:05 p.m.), written by James Toback and directed by 
Barry Levinson, is about the life and times of gangster extraordinaire Benjamin 
Siegel (Warren Beatty). It is an overall satisfying 1991 film that delivers a 
full measure of stylish entertainment.Key developments are Siegel's growing 
infatuation with good-time girl Virginia Hill (Annette Bening) and his dream of 
turning Las Vegas into a gambling mecca. 
</P>
<P>
 My Own Private Idaho (Bravo Sunday at 5 and 11:30 p.m.; Saturday at 5 and 11 
p.m.) is Gus Van Sant's highly idiosyncratic 1991 odyssey of two male hustlers, 
one gay (River Phoenix), the other straight (Keanu Reeves). This film is so 
distinctive and effective that it can even sustain a curious, counterproductive 
inclusion from Shakespeare's "Henry IV, Part I.

 SPEAKING OF WASHINGTON: Facts, Firsts and Folklore by John L. Moore 
(Congressional Quarterly: $14.95, paper, $26.95 hardcover; 307 pp.) How does it 
work, this cumbersome government of ours? How did it evolve from a handful of 
brilliant, dedicated men playing it by ear to a Congress that had to create 
five new regulatory agencies just to deal with the consequences of bank de- 
regulation? Or, symbolically, from a White House with no plumbing (John and 
Abigail, the original Adams family, used an outhouse) to an executive mansion 
with 32 bathrooms and a staff of 97, including five calligraphers? 
</P>
<P>
 In a book at once amusing and informative -- no mean feat -- John Moore takes 
us on a quick-step tour down the boulevards and back alleys of our heritage. 
Along with Teapot Dome, Watergate and the folly of the PAC, we're treated to a 
variety of factoids we either never knew or have long forgotten: The first 
monarch to visit the White House (1874) was David Kalakaua, king of the 
Sandwich Islands. The first coins minted bore the admonition to "Mind Your 
Business." In the early 1800s, the Supreme Court met for a year at Long's 
Tavern. Way ahead of her time was Victoria Claflin Woodhull, who ran for 
President in 1872 (with a black running mate: Frederick Douglass). 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the difference between civil rights and civil liberties, between 
Mugwumps and Whigs, Moore answers questions we never dreamed of asking: What 
were the White House "petticoat wars"? Which First Lady was called "Lemonade 
Lucy" and why? Who was "His Rotundity"? Why is there still an electoral 
college? Finally, a timeless bon mot from Sen. Simon Cameron (R-Pa.): "An 
honest politician is one who, once he is bought, stays bought."

 You're pulling out of the gas station and your mind is on the road when 
suddenly a loud ka-thunk alerts you that the nozzle has been yanked out of your 
tank and is whipping through the air. Suddenly, that $14 tank of gas skyrockets 
into three figures. I know more than I'd like to about this subject. 
</P>
<P>
 When I did this a few months ago, I got out and checked out the hose; it 
looked just fine, and the attendant was unable to demonstrate that it had been 
damaged. But he took an accident report, and three months later a bill arrived 
from Shell Oil Co. -- $504. That's about average if the damage is restricted to 
the hose, says Gardena-based C&S Maintenance, one of about two dozen Southern 
California pump-repair firms. 
</P>
<P>
 But if you damage both the hose and the pump, repairs might run $2,000 to 
$3,000 and up. The worst-case scenario is driving off and taking the whole 
$10,000 pump with you. One unlucky driver in Marina del Rey recently did this, 
and after noticing what he'd done, kept right on going, dragging the pump all 
the way to the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh sure, you think, it won't happen to me. But regional pump maintenance 
companies get from two to six calls a day about these incidents. On one recent 
weekend, one firm got 40 calls to repair drive-off damage in San Diego County 
alone. Chris Lanz, manager of a Manhattan Beach Mobil station, says that at 
times he's had drive-offs every day for a week. A Chevron representative says 
California has more accidental drive-offs than any other part of the country, 
and Los Angeles has the highest incident rate of all. Chevron is conducting a 
study to find out why. 
</P>
<P>
 Gasoline companies are also taking some steps to prevent big damage. Some 
hoses now possess a "breakaway" feature that allows the hose to snap off, shuts 
off the flow of gas and keeps the pump from being uprooted. 
</P>
<P>
 These hoses, naturally, are the most expensive of all to replace. Jane Spiller

 GEORGES DE LA TOUR by Jacques Thuillier (Flammarion: $90; 318 pp). A Lorraine 
artist, born in France in 1593, Georges de la Tour remains an enigma even 
though he is thought to have painted some 400-500 canvases.Only a scant 30 or 
so canvases are signed and another 50 or so canvases are attributed to him, 
some may be copies of original works by other artists and many are lost. And so 
might have De la Tour himself if it hadn't been for a French scholar who 
published a brief study on him in 1863. In 1934 and 1948 French exhibits made 
abundantly clear his was the hand and eye of a great master. Thuillier clearly 
lays out in the extensive and scholarly text as much as he can about so obscure 
an artist of whom next to nothing can be found of in writings by his 
contemporaries; but of course, it is the portraiture of De la Tour that 
literally shines off the pages. The strong darks and lights, the serenity and 
stillness even when dealing with real characters, makes De la Tour's 
distinctive vision a joy to behold, as full of mystery as the facts of his life 
and the existence of his oeuvre. Sue Martin

TRAVELING ON CREDIT, BY DANIEL HALPERN

<TEXT>
<P>
 They would think up trips on Sundays --  
</P>
<P>
 Traveling to Lahore via Persia, 
</P>
<P>
 Sliding through the Khyber Pass, 
</P>
<P>
 Dropping into India like Polo. 
</P>
<P>
 The trips began off Fire Island 
</P>
<P>
 On a beach day with high red winds, 
</P>
<P>
 Swimming nude in South Bay 
</P>
<P>
 Together.The residents looked away, 
</P>
<P>
 Cared for their gardens which suffered 
</P>
<P>
 From the whip of the salt wind 
</P>
<P>
 And the Patchogians, who 
</P>
<P>
 Came with bayberry sandwiches 
</P>
<P>
 To hawk their bodies in the sun 
</P>
<P>
 And hurry back on the last 
</P>
<P>
 Watch Hill ferry. They lived 
</P>
<P>
 In Bayberry and thought up trips 
</P>
<P>
 With the marina's population 
</P>
<P>
 (A Calcutta of boats) 
</P>
<P>
 Looking on from polished wood. 
</P>
<P>
 They were, for the most part, in love, 
</P>
<P>
 Traveling. Sundays, to Lahore 
</P>
<P>
 In three cars with two wolfhounds, 
</P>
<P>
 Four afghans and a setter --  
</P>
<P>
 A Packard, a Daimler and a Ford. 
</P>
<P>
 They were set on Lahore: 
</P>
<P>
 Stops in Izmir and Isfahan, 
</P>
<P>
 The long crawl through Persia. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sundays, in fine weather, 
</P>
<P>
 They set out with a pocketful 
</P>
<P>
 Of visas and rolled east, content 
</P>
<P>
 With itineraries of sand 
</P>
<P>
 And postcards back on the weekend.

 Lionheart (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m.), a sub-Schwarzenegger 1991 thriller set in 
the illicit bare-knuckle fight game, has the grotesquely off-scale exaggeration 
of many '90s action movies. Within 15 minutes we're asked to believe that 
Jean-Claude Van Damme's Lyon, or Lionheart, has learned of his brother's 
burning by wacko L.A. drug peddlers, gone berserk at a North African Foreign 
Legion Post, escaped from three jailers, stolen a Jeep and rammed it through a 
fence, escaped on foot across the desert, journeyed across the ocean as a 
stowaway stoker and then escaped again by diving into New York Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Casual Sex? (KTLA Monday at 8 p.m.), directed by Genevieve Robert from a 
script by Judy Toll and Wendy Golman, proves you don't have to be a man to make 
lewd, preposterous comedies. This 1988 movie is set mostly at a swinging 
bucolic health farm where good buddies (Lea Thompson, Victoria Jackson) journey 
in pursuit of aerobics and eros. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Mazursky's Scenes From a Mall (KTLA Tuesday at 8 p.m.) has moments that 
are as good as any in his other L.A. films: the knockabout insights and oddball 
bits of business that keep you on your toes. A shopping mall can be a 
fantasyland for people who want to go around the world without every moving 
very far from the parking lot. The mall as L.A. microcosm is more than a great 
metaphor; it's also the truth, or at least it's the truth for the characters in 
this movie. What's disappointing is that the film doesn't live up to the high 
style of its premise. Starring Woody Allen and Bette Midler as a couple whose 
marriage breaks up during a shopping spree at the Beverly Center, the movie is 
geared up for grand-scale farce, but the pairing of Allen and Midler never 
takes flight. The film is far from terrible, but it doesn't excite the senses, 
a failure no self-respecting L.A. movie can afford. 
</P>
<P>
 Desperate Hours (KTLA Thursday at 8 p.m.) is a suburban nightmare out of the 
'50s, erupting in garish, elegant fury in the '90s. In Michael Cimino's sleek 
but spotty 1990 version of Joseph Hayes' famous melodrama, the plot is an 
Eisenhower-era nightmare: Three escaped convicts hide in a suburban 
middle-class home, holding the entire family hostage as they wait for help. The 
filmmakers fast-forward "Hours" into a world of adulterous high-tech cops and 
media-savvy criminals, but it's still in limbo, trapped between eras. It's a 
mix of A-Thriller and grand opera, full of crazy opulence and arias for both 
bad guy Mickey Rourke and beleaguered husband and father Anthony Hopkins.

 THE SPORT OF QUEENS: The Autobiography of Dick Francis (Otto 
Penzler/Macmillan: $20; 254 pp.) Dick Francis won his first purse at the age of 
5 -- sixpence, from his brother Douglas, for jumping a donkey over a rail 
fence, on the fourth try, while facing the donkey's tail. He never looked back 
again. "The Sport of Queens" chronicles the rare good fortune of a man doing 
exactly what he wants to do with one exception, an exception that proves a 
blessing and a boon to millions of readers. From an exuberant youth spent on 
the farm of a Welsh grandfather who rides to hounds, through a tour of duty 
with the RAF, to a career as Britain's (and the queen's) top steeplechase 
jockey, Francis' life, to hear him tell it, is straight out of the Barnyard 
Beatitudes. Underscored by genuine and disarming modesty, with honest praise 
for rivals and colleagues alike, with rare communion with God's noblest beasts, 
the updated reissue of Francis' autobiography is odds-on to delight. He has 
broken dozens of bones (a fence-jumping jockey is thrown an average of once 
every six races; one pal shattered collarbones so frequently he had them 
removed). He's been kicked in the abdomen and the back -- riding a few days 
later with a brace. He's been driven off the course in the "blood wagon" more 
times than he can count. But his book, written in deceptively simple, almost 
lyrical prose, is a model of balance. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, the one "failure"? While leading the Grand National at Aintree, Liverpool 
-- the long (4 1/2-mile) grueling Super Bowl of steeplechasing -- after his 
last fence, his (and the queen's) mount fell, an excruciating and still 
inexplicable mishap. A newspaper asked him to write about it. He did. Then he 
tried a novel. And another. . . . Yes, that Dick Francis.

 SCHEMES & SCAMS: A Practical Guide for Outwitting Today's Con Artists, For the 
50-Plus Generation by Douglas P. Shadel and John T. (Newcastle: $12.95; 239 
pp.) Let's get one thing straight. Ed McMahon is not going to come to your door 
tomorrow with a check for $10 million. OK, he might; but your chances are about 
one in a googol. Even at that, his odds are infinitely more favorable than 
those of that sincere, solicitous, smarmy guy on the boiler-room telephone who 
calls to tell you you've already won that Cadillac/trip to Paris/diamond 
necklace. All you have to do is send in the "gift tax" and. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The shame, of course, is that a book like this has to be written at all. The 
fact is there are predators out there, vicious underneath the sheen, and like 
the four-footed raptors they emulate, they prey on the old, the sick, the 
feeble. And the dumb. The really, really dumb. To the tune of $40 billion 
annually. Douglas Shadel, a longtime fraud investigator, has teamed with "John 
T.," a longtime fraud perpetrator turned righteous, to describe the more 
popular scams, how and why they work, how to avoid them, and whom to call when 
you have been stung. (Among the more despicable schemes is the one where the 
caller ascertains, through a series of conversations, that a mark has 
Alzheimer's. The next call: "Sam, we haven't got that $15,000 you promised to 
send last Thursday.") 
</P>
<P>
 No model of grammatical excellence, the book could prove valuable to those 
fitting the victim profile, those most at risk of losing their "hard-earned 
life savings" (are life savings ever easy-earned?). The question, though, is 
whether a scamee ready to pay an itinerant tar-man in advance for new blacktop, 
invest in a time-share in Bhutan, or buy rare coins from a guy called Slick, is 
savvy enough to buy this book. We hope so.

 HONOR AND DUTY by Gus Lee (Knopf: $24; 425 pp.) It was tough enough to be a 
Plebe at West Point in 1964: 24-hour hazing by upperclassmen "who would chop 
off your foot and then write you up for limping at parade"; exams in all 
courses six days a week; outranked by everyone including "small animals that 
poop in the woods."How hard, then, to be a nearsighted, full-blooded Chinese 
Plebe raised in a black neighborhood in San Francisco by a taciturn, 
militaristic father and a sadistic white stepmother who calls him "pitiful, 
wretched, ugly" and tells him he was the cause of his birth mother's cancer. 
Not to mention a heritage grounded in Confucius' "Three Bonds and Five Constant 
Virtues," and a scholarly, patriarchal uncle who thinks military school is an 
oxymoron. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee's evocation of West Point (he was once a cadet himself) is riveting, a 
blend of rite, honor and humor, and his portrait of Kai, wrenched between 
conflicting East-West values, is masterful. Outside the Point, Kai loves, 
loses, loves; inside, he's co-opted to sniff out a cheating scandal. His story 
does not end happily in a conventional sense, but his passage from boy to man 
is a triumph.

SHOWS FOR YOUNGSTERS AND THEIR PARENTS TOO; 'ON PROMISED LAND'S' STORY HOPES TO

 On Promised Land explores familiar territory: Civil Rights-era race relations. 
But rather than focus on the better-known and graphic events of the movement, 
the Disney original film concentrates on the inherent drama in personal 
relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 "On Promised Land" concerns two families, one white and one black, and the 
friendship between the oldest of one family and the youngest of the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Set in the rural South of the 1950s, the film stars Joan Plowright, Judith 
Ivey and 9-year-old Norman D. Golden II ("Cop and a Half") as Jim Jam. 
</P>
<P>
 The semiautobiographical story was written by Ken Sagoes, who stars as Jim 
Jam's uncle, Bo Henry. "I wanted to write about a black family that showed 
love," Sagoes says. "My father was not around when I was growing up. My African 
American brothers and sisters need fathers so much. I write stories about how I 
wanted things to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Sagoes hails from Stockbridge, Ga., the home of Martin Luther King Jr.'s 
father. He says that much of "On Promised Land" is based on incidents in his 
childhood that left a profound impression on him. 
</P>
<P>
 "On Promised Land" tackles such issues as familial bonds, loyalties, 
loneliness, friendship, tragedy, pride, pets, promises, oppression and 
repression. 
</P>
<P>
 Actress Ivey says of Sagoes' screenplay: "I love writing where you tell a 
story and in spite of it, you get a lesson, and I think that's what the writer 
did." 
</P>
<P>
 Ivey, who plays the bigoted Olivia, adds: "The film takes an important issue 
-- racism -- and gives it a forum in which to discuss it within families. You 
can discuss it on several levels of sophistication." 
</P>
<P>
 "I find racism very simple," she says. "It's just a fear. There are many 
people living their lives through fear. The story is so much about being 
enlightened and having consciousness raised." 
</P>
<P>
 "On Promised Land" airs Sunday at 7-9 p.m. on the Disney Channel. For ages 8 
and up. Parents should be warned that some children may find a scene with a 
dead dog disturbing. More Family Shows 
</P>
<P>
 Batman and District Attorney Harvey Dent face off when a secret is revealed in 
a two-part special episode of Batman: The Animated Series (Monday and Tuesday 
4:30-5 p.m. Fox). Dent's secret isn't known even by his best friend, Batman's 
alter ego, Bruce Wayne. For ages 4 and up.

 If it's time to put another candle on your child's birthday cake, tune in to 
Home Matters (Monday 1:30-2 p.m. Discovery), which features a segment on 
"Birthdays for Children." Marla Edlestein, associate food editor of Parents 
magazine, offers creative ideas for a child's birthday party at home. For 
parents.

 OK, so he has a few loose screws, but Inspector Gadget (Thursday and Friday 
7-7:30 a.m. Family Channel) is deeply concerned about the environment. With the 
future of Mother Earth at stake, Gadget urges people to plant more trees and to 
conserve water. In Thursday's "Dry Spell," Gadget's nemesis M.A.D. steals all 
of Metro City's water and holds it for ransom. Gadget's discovery of the 
missing water puts a hole in the baddie's plans. In "Tree Guesses," which airs 
on Earth Day on Friday, M.A.D. threatens to destroy America's forests with a 
wood-rotting formula. After Gadget erroneously blames termites and a helpful 
beaver for the disappearing trees, it's not too long before he puts his finger 
on the iron fist of M.A.D. For ages 2 to 12.

COMMENTARY; STANDARD-MODEL SITCOMS ARE BECOMING THE ORDER OF THE EVENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRAZIER MOORE, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seriously, are sitcoms supposed to be funny? 
</P>
<P>
 The issue came up on a recent Wednesday during lunch with a friend, as he 
recounted certain sitcoms he had happened upon the night before. 
</P>
<P>
 One had a buzzed-cut, bespectacled nerd as a supporting player. Another had a 
fat boss. Both starred stand-up comics whose first name is John. But which 
show's hero was a sports columnist? Which show had the blond wife and the nice 
living room? 
</P>
<P>
 Then, the friend began trying to remember the story lines, and here he really 
stumbled. "Good Life" and "Second Half" -- less than 18 hours later, he 
couldn't recall much of anything that happened, much less which show it 
happened on. 
</P>
<P>
 His inevitable conclusion: What a pair of wretched sitcoms! 
</P>
<P>
 Then, the friend turned to a third sitcom, the premiere of "These Friends of 
Mine," starring standup comic Ellen DeGeneres (which continues Wednesdays on 
ABC). 
</P>
<P>
 He condemned "Friends" as a shameless rip-off of "Seinfeld," even down to its 
billing ("A new comedy about ... whatever," as opposed to "Seinfeld," which, of 
course, glories in being about ... nothing). 
</P>
<P>
 His inevitable conclusion: Another wretched sitcom! 
</P>
<P>
 But wait. Could it be that the indistinguishable nature of the sitcoms he 
watched, and their forgettability, aren't shortcomings after all? 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it's a good thing, not bad! 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's what the producers set out to accomplish for the viewers. Maybe 
it's what viewers -- most of them, anyway -- look for when they tune in. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, funny is the promise sitcoms make to the viewer, at least officially. 
But cigarettes promise pleasure and satisfaction, while what they actually 
deliver is a nicotine hit and something to do with your hands. Which is what 
the smoker wants. It's all understood. 
</P>
<P>
 What, then, does the sitcom viewer really want, and get? 
</P>
<P>
 "The best comedy series have made us feel that we have made new friends whom 
we invited into our homes every week," advises Jurgen Wolff in his how-to book, 
"Successful Sitcom Writing." 
</P>
<P>
 You heard it from an expert: The viewer seeks out comfort and community, in 
non-demanding, 30-minute doses. Certainly every sitcom, not just the best ones, 
come standard with a comfortable circle of friends. And if the comfort level is 
sufficiently high, laughs are unimportant. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wolff is wrong about one thing. The sitcom viewer doesn't invite these 
virtual friends into his home. On the contrary, he teleports into theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 The sitcom viewer doesn't ask to take something away from the experience, but 
to leave something behind: 30 minutes' worth of consciousness. The level of the 
jokes doesn't matter, as long as they come thick and fast. The story matters 
even less. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there are sitcoms that reach a little further. Overachievers -- 
"Roseanne," "Cheers" and "MASH," to name just three -- are celebrated by 
critics as what sitcoms should be. 
</P>
<P>
 But maybe those critics are wrong. Instead, maybe "Gilligan's Island" and 
"Full House" -- programs every critic loves to hate -- are what sitcoms should 
be. 
</P>
<P>
 And what they are, without fail. That is, whether it's "Petticoat Junction" or 
"All in the Family," a sitcom traffics in escape and effortless friendship. 
What thrills the critics are luxury options such as wit and intelligence, but 
the truth is, any sitcom drives fine without them. 
</P>
<P>
 Decades after you first saw it, you may still smile at the thought of racist 
Archie Bunker being trapped on an elevator with a black man. You may still 
savor a 20-year-old joke from "Mary Tyler Moore" (overweight Rhoda eyes a piece 
of candy and wonders aloud, "Should I eat this or just apply it directly to my 
hips?"). 
</P>
<P>
 But if you can't remember the sitcom you saw last night -- gee, it must have 
really been good!

 IN THE SHADOW OF DENALI: Life and Death on Alaska's Mt. McKinley by Jonathan 
Waterman (Delta/Dell: $11.95; 246 pp., illustrated, paperback original). 
Eschewing "because its there" cliches, Waterman strives to convey the special 
excitement of climbing mountains, especially the tallest peak in North America 
-- Denali, "the high one" in Athabascan: "I wanted insight into this 
magnificent mountain, but I also wanted to exploit all my weaknesses, and by 
stripping myself bare to the mountain, discover of what pith my soul was made." 
But he also acknowledges the darker side of the sport, conceding that the 
desire to prove himself sometimes transcended the bounds of rational behavior: 
He made one ascent while suffering from bronchitis and an injured ankle. Better 
written and more thoughtful than most outdoor adventure books, "Shadow" 
launches Delta's new "Expeditions" series.

 OMEGA AND AFTER: Bloomsbury and the Decorative Arts by Isabelle Anscombe, 
photographs by Howard Grey (Thames & Hudson: $19.95; 176 pp.) . Anscombe traces 
the story of the short-lived (May, 1913 to June, 1919) atelier that involved 
some of the most prominent members of the literary movement. Organized to spur 
interest in the British Post-Impressionist painters and to give jobs to the 
founders' artist-friends, Omega specialized in the decorative arts. The 
ingenuous forms, muted primary colors and faux-naive decorations of their 
ceramics, furniture and fabrics have a surprisingly contemporary look.

 BIOLOGIC: Designing With Nature to Protect the Environment by David Wann 
(Johnson Books: $14.95; 284 pp., illustrated) and IN OUR BACKYARD: A Guide to 
Understanding Pollution and Its Effects by Travis Wagner (Van Nostrand 
Reinhold: $19.95; 320 pp., illustrated, paperback original). Wagner uses a 
question-and-answer format to present basic information about the sources and 
effects of various types of pollution, as well as alternative and preventive 
measures.Some of the information is depressing: A single gallon of gasoline 
leaking from a storage tank can render 1 million gallons of water undrinkable. 
Other figures are encouraging: Despite the rising number of cars in the U.S., 
the Clean Air Act has produced a 51% decrease in carbon monoxide and a 93% 
decrease in lead in the air. Intelligent and well-researched, "Backyard" 
provides an easy-to-grasp introduction for anyone who wants to learn more about 
an important issue. David Wann takes a more upbeat approach to the subject, 
arguing that Americans need to consume less and learn how to avoid 
environmental damage before it occurs, rather than devise new ways to clean up 
messes. Although his tone often seems a little too cheery, Wann ruefully notes, 
"America still doesn't have an itinerary, only an open highway, littered with 
burger wrappers and billboards."

 AN UNCOMMON SCOLD compiled by Abby Adams (Fireside: $8; 268 pp., illustrated). 
Adams' collection of quotes from famous women ranges in subject from modern 
relationships ("As I look around the West End these days, it seems to me that 
outside every thin girl is a fat man, trying to get in" -- Katherine Whitehorn) 
to the value of learning ("Lack of education is an extraordinary handicap when 
one is being offensive" -- Josephine Tey). These bons and mals mots could spice 
up a letter or a term paper -- or just provide a distraction while waiting for 
a guest or a phone call: As Marilyn Monroe remarked, "I've been on a calendar, 
but never on time."

 NOUVELLE SOUL by Barbara Summers (Amistad Press: $8.95; 247 pp.). Summers' 
stories are set in middle-class neighborhoods in New York, the Eastern Seaboard 
and Paris; her characters' relationships are complicated by questions of social 
mobility and deeply ingrained racial attitudes.Some of the most affecting 
stories are told from multiple viewpoints, including "Free Skies," an account 
of the first Afro-American woman stunt pilot. A blend of strength and humor 
gives these stories a rare appeal. As three daughters clear out years of their 
mother's accumulated junk in "Nothing Like Daddy," one reflects, "Black women 
always last to give up. We just don't know how. Mother to the world even if 
we're a single mother. If we collapse, the world collapses. Women running the 
world and got to carry it too."

 THE GUINESS BOOK OF RECORDS edited by Peter Matthews (Bantam: $6.99; 819 pp., 
illustrated, paperback original). The 1994 edition of the famous reference book 
contains a great deal of useful information about the fastest, tallest, 
biggest, etc. Unfortunately, the serious aspects of the volume have been 
overshadowed by its sillier contents: The world's largest cookie (34 feet in 
diameter) contained almost 4 million chocolate chips; the largest cocktail 
included 1,650 gallons of rum, triple sec, sour mix, orange juice and 
grenadine. Even more depressing are the lists of dim-bulb stunts people stage 
to get into the book -- jumping on pogo sticks, threading needles, balancing 
milk crates, etc.

 Jackie Hargrave plays a woman out on a date in an MTV rock video. Gordon Dixon 
stars in a cigarette commercial on German television.Vivian Spurgin's gigs 
include a graveyard scene for an American Film Institute project, a KCET promo 
and a just-booked rock video. 
</P>
<P>
 Hargrave is 74. Dixon is 69. A cagey Spurgin says, "I play the age range from 
60 to 70." They're some of the success stories from a commercial-acting class 
at the Claude Pepper Senior Center on La Cienega near Pico. 
</P>
<P>
 Adrienne Omansky founded the class a year ago, inspired by her mother's 
late-blooming acting career. "I'd been taking her to auditions and saw a huge 
need for actors in this age group," she says. Her mom, Celia Kushner, 80, 
counts McDonald's and Miller Lite ads among her credits. 
</P>
<P>
 Omansky's stage-daughter role extends to her students as well: She acts as 
their unpaid manager and preps them for auditions. "Seniors are no longer 
limited to acting in commercials for Geritol or Polident," Omansky notes. "IHOP 
aired one with a senior dribbling a basketball." But the weekly class does more 
than just get old folks on the tube: It also combats isolation. Marty Coggan, 
75, whose disability confined him to a walker and a social life of visiting 
"doctors, doctors, doctors," says the class "gave me a reason to go on with 
life." Ellen Alperstein

PALM LATITUDES: THINGS TO COME; CLEAN, GREEN FLYING MACHINE

 Catherine Anderson and Bob Curtin swear it's the future. But when their 
eight-foot-long, 100-foot-wide solar-powered plane is wheeled out of its hangar 
at Edwards Air Force Base, it looks more like a balsa wood model made by a 
50-foot kid. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't be fooled. Their low-power, high-tech idea could undermine the growing 
global satellite-launching business. The young engineers of Monrovia's 
AeroVironment say that planes like the pilotless, radio-controlled Pathfinder 
can do most of the jobs a satellite does, but at a fraction of the cost. 
Development so far has cost a cheap-for-serious-science $2.5 million; funds 
have come from several government and private sources. 
</P>
<P>
 They hope to fly the plane in a test this summer at 65,000 feet. If it's 
successful, AeroVironment, which also developed much of the technology for GM's 
Impact electric car, plans to launch a bigger version -- Helios, with a 
200-foot wingspan. 
</P>
<P>
 "On Helios," says Anderson, "there'll be a large enough solar array soaking up 
sun-power during the day to fly the plane through the night." And Curtin says 
its bigger payload would give it the potential to carry out satellite duties 
"without paying the $100 million a year a satellite typically costs to maintain 
in orbit." Solar planes could do the same job for about $20 million, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 One added benefit: Pollution-free take-offs. Many satellites are placed in 
orbit by a space shuttle, which destroys more ozone in a single launch than the 
annual chlorofluorocarbon output of most individual industrial plants. Bill 
Manson

IN THE AIR

<TEXT>

 If literature has given us great smokers, it has also given us a few wonderful 
quitters. Italo Svevo's "Confessions of Zeno" is one of the most precocious 
novels of this century and for anyone who has ever smoked and tried to quit, 
one of the funniest. Written in the early 1920s, poor Zeno goes off to a 
psychiatrist to help him quit smoking. What follows is a lengthy smoker's 
autobiography and the most intricate contemplation of smoking and quitting ever 
written. And he finally does quit too. If smoking is the modern vice, quitting 
is the modern dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
 James Barrie, best known as the author of "Peter Pan," also wrote a tasty 
little volume with the delicious title, "My Lady Nicotine." If Zeno dealt with 
the psychological, Barrie's narrator dwells on the sensual: the aroma, taste 
and handling of his favorite pipes and cigars. He doesn't shy away from the 
corporeal downside either: the sharp pains, breathlessness and fruity cough. 
But he's forced to decide. It is either his "Lady Nicotine" or his fiancee, who 
won't marry him unless he quits. And he does quit, amusingly, and with no 
regrets. 
</P>
<P>
 The battle between male smokers and female nonsmokers seems very antique in 
contemporary society. But it was a theme of much of the early literature on 
smoking. Perhaps best known is Kipling's poem, "The Betrothed." 
</P>
<P>
 "Open the old cigar-box, 
</P>
<P>
 get me a Cuba stout, 
</P>
<P>
 For things are running 
</P>
<P>
 crossways, 
</P>
<P>
 and Maggie and I are out." 
</P>
<P>
 If Barrie's character decides in favor of his own betrothed, Kipling's decides 
otherwise -- and gives literature one of its most delightful and ridiculous 
lines: "And a woman is only a woman, but a good cigar is a smoke." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, literature is of small importance in the creation of the cult of 
smoking in modern times. That honor goes to the movies. Everyone can call to 
mind Humphrey Bogart or Bette Davis and feel all the powerful associations we 
have with cigarettes. Smoking is a great prop and powerful definition of mood 
and character. We've learned very well how to pretend to be ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a great scene -- a wonderfully sly parody -- in the film "Merry 
Christmas, Mr. Lawrence," in which David Bowie, imprisoned and without 
cigarettes, mimes very meticulously the act of smoking to give himself a little 
solace. Without the subject, the event is seen more clearly and humorously. 
</P>
<P>
 I've felt a little like that David Bowie character lately. Or like private eye 
Lew Archer in the Ross Macdonald mysteries. Archer is always commenting that he 
reaches for a pack of cigarettes in his shirt pocket, though he quit years ago. 
There is a laborious, difficult, and sometimes amusing process that has to be 
gone through in order to give up smoking. Discovering new gestures, new ways of 
handling space and time. There are lots of things one grows accustomed to doing 
with cigarettes; learning to live without them takes time. 
</P>
<P>
 I know very well the ambivalence Charles Lamb wrote of in his little poem, "A 
Farewell to Tobacco." I hope I know, too, his resolve. He ended the poem by 
saying, "For thy sake tobacco, I would do anything but die." Dean Stewart

'GENERAL HOSPITAL'S' MOONLIGHTING STAND-UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY M. REICHARDT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By day, Sean Kanan plays the very serious A.J. Quartermaine on "General 
Hospital." By night, Kanan lets his hair down as stand-up comic. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost like an alter ego," says Kanan. 
</P>
<P>
 Kanan, who has performed stand-up in clubs such as The Funny Bone in 
Pittsburgh and Dangerfield's in New York City during the past few months, takes 
his gig seriously. He collaborates on his material with Eddie Feldman, who also 
writes for comedian Dennis Miller, and studies with coach and comedian Carol 
Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an aspect of balance that stand-up offers me," says Kanan. "I wish I 
could bring some of the humor of my personality into A.J., while maintaining 
the integrity of the character. I think A.J., historically, has been kind of a 
smart-aleck. There's no reason why -- when push comes to shove -- he couldn't 
come up with a zinger every now and then." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Kanan is content to confine his "zingers" to the stage, where 
he's constantly recognized by soap fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was coming up with my routine, I realized people were going to know 
who I was from 'General Hospital,' " says Kanan. "I couldn't ignore that. I 
needed to address it. My first five minutes of material are about what it's 
like being on a soap and playing A.J. People are interested to hear that. It 
also allows them to suspend their recognition of me as A.J. and get on with the 
material I'm doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Kanan says that jokes about the soaps provide his "best material. I talk about 
the fact that A.J. was shipped off the show when he was 11 years old and came 
back two years later as a 21-year-old alcoholic. Then I go into how A.J. worked 
as a desk clerk at a hotel until he got bored and did what every kid does -- 
borrow $1 million from his grandfather and bought it." 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing gets in the way of a Quartermaine, especially logic. "I also do stuff 
that isn't soap-related," he adds. "I do impersonations of Marlon Brando, Sean 
Connery and Don Knotts." 
</P>
<P>
 While Kanan insists that he doesn't have a favorite between his two 
professions -- "they're like apples and oranges" -- he considers himself an 
actor first. "I love acting," he says, noting that he is anxiously waiting for 
his story line to heat up. "I don't think A.J. is being utilized to his full 
potential. A.J. is always on the edge. He's very insecure on the inside. He's 
afraid of screwing up and everybody seeing it. That's why he's always trying to 
be this overachiever. The interesting part is the subtext. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been on the show for over a year, and I'm really waiting for something 
to sink my teeth into," he says. "I loved my story with Crystal Carson (who 
played Julia Barrett). We got a great response from fans. Then Crystal was 
written off the show. That was unfortunate. I enjoyed working with her. I hope 
in the future I get to do something really heavy. I feel I'm up to the 
challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 "General Hospital" airs weekdays at 2 p.m. on ABC.

 As delineated by David Mamet, in adapting his Pulitzer Prize-winning play to 
the screen in 1992, the real estate salesmen who work in this corner of New 
York City are a ferocious lot, abrasive, abusive and tormented by turns. But 
when they talk, everybody listens, for Mamet is a true magician with streetwise 
words, a writer who recognizes the poetry hidden in the most scalding language 
and creates dialogue hot enough to suck all the air out of the screen and leave 
an audience gasping. It is filled with bravura verbal arias, but under the 
discreet direction of James Foley, a high-profile cast -- including Al Pacino 
(pictured), Jack Lemmon, Alec Baldwin and Ed Harris -- go through it all 
flawlessly (TMC Monday at 11:05 p.m.). Kenneth Turan

 The life, not the art, is what French filmmaker Maurice Pialat wants in this 
extraordinary film, which has Jacques Dutronc's stinging performance as its 
centerpiece.As a director, Pialat is the master of the spontaneous moment, and 
here he and a remarkable cast convey something of the giddy pain of a life 
burning passionately over an abyss. We flatter ourselves that if we were around 
in 1890 we would have recognized Van Gogh's genius and changed his fate. But we 
probably wouldn't have -- just as we probably don't recognize the Van Goghs 
among us now. In this sad, brilliant 1992 film, Pialat (pictured) gives us a 
terrible inkling of why (Cinemax Wednesday at 8 p.m.). Michael Wilmington

 Although in some ways as capable as its ex-Marine/ex-CIA hero (played by 
Harrison Ford, pictured), this 1992 release could use more of this gentleman's 
moxie.The second of techno-master Tom Clancy's novels to be filmed, it's a 
perfectly adequate action-thriller that neither disappoints nor exhilarates. If 
it doesn't exactly crackle with energy, it lets off a good buzz now and again. 
Now a Naval Academy instructor, Ford's John Patrick Ryan, while in London to 
give a speech and enjoy a family vacation, almost literally stumbles on an 
attempt by Irish terrorists to assassinate a cousin of the queen (Ryan was 
played by Alec Bladwin in "The Hunter for Red October.") Cinemax Friday at 2:45 
a.m.). Kenneth Turan

 This 1988 release is a surprise: A little ragged blast of a science-fiction 
film that packs more energy and ideas in its shots than many pictures twice its 
size. Some will find it crude, misogynistic, tasteless and, in parts, just 
plain bad.But the best of it has an almost raving, full-throttle comic 
intensity. A chilled-to-the-bone Dennis Hopper (pictured) and a planeload of 
counterculture Vietnam vets run the ultimate outlaw TV station from a bomber in 
the sky, and they bombard the airwaves with rock 'n' roll videos and terrorize

Q & A: DENNIS MILLER; LATE-NIGHT UPDATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dennis Miller is back on late-night. The popular 40-year-old comedian brings 
his razor-sharp wit and political perspective to HBO in the cable network's 
first-ever late-night live series. The weekly "Dennis Miller" show kicks off 
the first of six programs Friday at midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, a journalism major from Pittsburgh, got his start doing comedy in 
local clubs in the late '70s. By 1982, he was a regular on the comedy-club 
circuit and soon joined "Saturday Night Live" as the acerbic "Weekend Update" 
reporter. He stayed with "SNL" for six seasons, until 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Miller hosted the syndicated late-night series "The Dennis Miller 
Show." Though it developed a cult following, the show was canceled after nine 
months because of low ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller also has starred in three critically acclaimed stand-up specials for 
HBO: "Mr. Miller Goes to Washington," "Dennis Miller, Black & White" and "They 
Shoot HBO Specials, Don't They." 
</P>
<P>
 Times Staff Writer Susan King caught up with Miller by phone in Las Vegas, 
where he had just opened for a two-week engagement at the MGM Grand hotel with 
Rita Rudner. 
</P>
<P>
 Are you excited about the new HBO show? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, TV is pretty much alchemy, so I don't know how it works, but I hope it 
goes well. 
</P>
<P>
 Will you do the show before a studio audience? 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, about 150 people -- a smaller audience than I had before. It has four 
components. It's me encapsulating the week for people, through my perspective. 
The first part is the monologue and after the monologue, we will zero in on a 
specific topic and have a guest on the screen, a la Ted Koppel, to talk about 
the particular issue. 
</P>
<P>
 So it won't be celebrity driven? 
</P>
<P>
 Unless the big story that week happens to be celebrity driven, like if 
'Schindler's List" came out. There are weeks when the big story is an 
entertainment story. For the most part, it isn't, so I'd like to have guests 
who speak purposefully about something that happened that week. They might be 
complete unknowns, but they would be whoever the player is in any particular 
drama that played out that week. Then after that I am going to let the guest go 
because I'd like to take phone calls at that point, but I don't want them to be 
specifically about that. I just want to hear what America is thinking about. 
Then at the end I'll wrap it up with sort of an update thing. It's a half hour. 
There are no commercials on HBO, so it's a legitimate 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 I know you had a hard time getting guests for your old show. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, sometimes on my show I would get people who didn't want to do my show 
because I would ask questions that they weren't prepared to answer. I have a 
natural curiosity that demands I ask certain questions that are off the beaten 
track. Some people weren't comfortable with that. They want to come on; they 
want to say, "Hi." They want to talk about the project they have coming out. 
There's a place for that. I'm not trying to act like some show biz overlord 
here. I know that part of the biz. But for me, I like talking to advocates 
because advocates want to talk. You know what I mean? That is there raison 
d'etre. They want to get out there and talk about what they believe fervently. 
I would rather do more of that. 
</P>
<P>
 But TV is metronomic at some point. It is somebody dangling a watch in front 
of you and hypnotizing you on some level. TV can lull you in. I've sat there 
and said, "I have seen this interview before," and I don't even turn it off. I 
read with TV on. I realize TV to me is a more animated grandfather clock. It's 
just sitting in the corner of the room and I kind of hear it over there. I know 
when I go on the road to perform, when I leave to go to the stage, I always 
turn the TV on, so when I come back to the room I am not immediately reminded 
of how alone I am on the road. I hear some noise when I walk in. TV is like a 
security blanket. 
</P>
<P>
 Do you think you will have the same ratings pressure on HBO as you did with 
your syndicated show? 
</P>
<P>
 There's ratings pressure everywhere, but let me put it this way: If (HBO 
chairman) Michael Fuchs had read the tea leaves on my show after six months, he 
would have kept it on. He wouldn't have looked to dump out. I think it was a 
mistake to dump out. I don't want to get into arguments with those people, but 
I think they were strictly a syndication deal. It was a math equation about 
money, strictly money. I think they could have thought it was the best show on 
TV, but they still would have taken it off. Fuchs, I think, likes things. If he 
likes things, I think you are in there with a shot. I had a talk with Garry 
Shandling and Garry was maybe in a similar situation as I am and HBO was there 
for him, too. So they believed in them. But I'm not naive enough to think that 
if, at some point, it doesn't work on a couple of levels for HBO, they are 
going to get rid of you, too. But right up until that moment, they'll be in 
your corner, really trying to make it work. 
</P>
<P>
 Do you enjoy performing in Las Vegas? 
</P>
<P>
 I love Vegas. You don't swear here because it is a family place, so I swear 
minimally here. But I have never predicated my act on swearing. When I get to 
Vegas, I slow my rhythms down. I remember it's a family joint, and it is. I 
love to bring my kids here. It's fun. I just dig Vegas. I'm a Vegas guy. 
</P>
<P>
 You know who called me? Col. Tom Parker. As soon as I get in my room I get a 
call from Col. Parker, Elvis' manager. He lives in Vegas and is 85. He always 
calls me. He likes me. We meet on the phone. I don't know if he wants to meet 
(in person), but he always calls. He is nice to me. He called me yesterday and 
said, "Can't wait for that new HBO show." The Colonel! Beautiful! 
</P>
<P>
 "Dennis Miller" airs Fridays at midnight on HBO.

FOCUS; BREAKING AWAY; 'COACH'S' CRAIG T. NELSON MERGES HIS PASSION FOR RACE 
CARS WITH A FILM ABOUT BIKE RACING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's just been a few days since Craig T. Nelson's Screaming Eagles auto team 
participated at the famed Sebring race in Florida. Unfortunately for the Emmy 
Award-winning star of ABC's hit comedy "Coach," things didn't go according to 
plan at the 12-hour event. 
</P>
<P>
 "We only got five laps," Nelson says good-naturedly. "So basically, one guy 
did five laps and then the engine went. I was standing in the pit being an 
owner watching my investment go up in smoke." 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson, 50, is eating a huge seafood salad at one of his favorite restaurants 
on Lankershim Boulevard in North Hollywood, not far from where "Coach" films at 
Universal Studios. He's in an amiable mood despite the fact that the race 
forced him "into a real kind of reality check, not only about the money being 
spent, but, 'Is this a viable format to be racing in? Is it a real thing or an 
imaginary ego boost? Is it something that you really want to do? How much are 
you committed to?' " 
</P>
<P>
 He's already made some decisions about the future and is putting together a 
plan to really "take a look at what we are doing in terms of the season, as far 
as racing goes." 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson, who also is executive producer and recurring director on "Coach," 
became hooked on racing three years ago when he came in third place at the 
Toyota Celebrity Long Beach Grand Prix. The sport, he says, not only pumps up 
his adrenalin but also demands incredible concentration and physical sense. 
</P>
<P>
 "You really have to work at it, and for that period of time when you are in a 
race car, you're so focused that nothing else goes on," Nelson explains. At the 
same time, Nelson adds, racing also "reveals a sense of identity. It gets you 
back to real important basics like, 'I really want to stay alive right now.' It 
forces you to take stock of yourself. It forces you to pay attention. It's a 
real moment-to-moment sport." 
</P>
<P>
 Not so coincidentally, Nelson plays a professional bike racer in the film 
"Ride With the Wind," which premieres Monday on ABC. Nelson also wears the hats 
of executive producer and co-writer on the drama. 
</P>
<P>
 Sporting long hair and a beard, Nelson plays Frank Shelby, a veteran racer 
whose years on the track have taken their toll. Not only does he race in the 
fast lane, he also lives in one. Abusing alcohol, drugs, friends and women, 
Frank is at the end of his tether. Ultimately, he finds hope and recovery when 
he meets two people: sophisticated bank manager Katherine (Helen Shaver) and 
Danny (Bradley Pierce), her young son, who is dying. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson says he and the TV-movie character share the same type of thrill from 
racing. "It's a different mentality," Nelson says, sipping on iced tea. "One is 
almost a journeyman, Gypsy nomad who follows the route of the caravan, and the 
other is someone who enjoys it perhaps as a hobby. The majority of the guys I 
met (who raced) were from the Midwest and had done it from childhood on. 
</P>
<P>
 What drew him to the project, Nelson says, was not only the journey Frank 
takes in the drama but Frank's drug abuse. "Finding at one time in your life a 
chance to give that up and making the decision to do that," explains Nelson, 
who, like Frank, battled substance abuse. 'If you have that problem, this 
choice will come up." 
</P>
<P>
 In Frank's case, he says, a miracle saves him. "Sometimes it's through other 
people, and sometimes it's not. It happened through this kid who he responded 
to, for whatever reason." 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson, a perfectionist, says he's not sure he did an "adequate" job in 
rewriting the original script. "I'm not altogether pleased with what happened 
in the end result," he says candidly. "It's a combination of things. I feel 
somewhat that because of the restrictions I had network-wise, in terms of who 
this person was, I had to de-emphasize all of the rough aspects of him." 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson says his aim was to explore "the emotions, feelings, the looks and the 
changes that occur in us without this pinpointing everything and making it so 
apparent. I don't think I was entirely successful with that either. It's a love 
story and I felt the love occurred in a strange and interesting way. It 
happened through hands, touch and the ability of two people from completely 
different worlds to find some repose in each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of good things in it, a lot of good characters. There were 
some ideas I really liked which I will use again, if I ever do this again. I am 
proud of a lot of it." 
</P>
<P>
 "Ride With the Wind" airs Monday at 9 p.m. on ABC; "Coach" airs Tuesdays at 
9:30 p.m. on ABC.

RETRO; THE LATEST MUPPET CAPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By N.F. MENDOZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A collective fuzzy feeling is settling by now over the homes of TV viewers 
plugged into Nickelodeon and the idiosyncratic, lovable -- and very human -- 
behavior of the Muppets. 
</P>
<P>
 The furry inventions of the late puppeteer Jim Henson are back and critics are 
doing handstands about the revival that began two weeks ago. Though "The Muppet 
Show" had one rerun on TNT after its 1976-1981 production in London ended, it's 
the show's appearance on Nickelodeon that's caught both an old and new 
audience's attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Henson company, the Henson name and the Muppet characters were one of 
those unique things in entertainment," says Herb Scannell, senior vice 
president of programming for the cable network. "For parents, it means quality. 
For kids, it means fun." 
</P>
<P>
 With its vaudevillian staging, complete with cranky and ecstatic audience 
members, "The Muppet Show" offers irreverent, campy fun the whole family can 
enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Muppets had no trouble booking their show or filling the theater. The 
stars came out in droves, including Elton John, George Burns, Steve Martin, 
Diana Ross, Julie Andrews, Carol Burnett, Candice Bergen, Linda Ronstadt, Harry 
Belafonte, Ethel Merman and George Burns. None of the stars minded chiding -- 
or being chided by -- Jim Henson's foam-and-fabric creations. 
</P>
<P>
 With emcee Kermit the Frog at the mike, the Muppets -- Henson's own name for 
his combination puppets and marionettes -- made much merry. The syndicated show 
spawned three feature films and an animated program called "The Muppet Babies." 
</P>
<P>
 There was comedy, singing and dancing. Popular and standard tunes were given a 
new edge. Look for Kermit again belting out "Lydia, O Lydia, The Ta-tooed 
Lady." 
</P>
<P>
 The show's appeal was universal. At one time it had an estimated 235 million 
viewers in 100 countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Explains Scannell: "The adult guest stars were a way for parents to get the 
humor, which was both sophisticated and simple, with the slapstick stuff. That 
humor appealed to parents. Kids were attracted to the physicality of the show 
and were amazed by the Muppetry." 
</P>
<P>
 Nickelodeon is presenting 65 of the original 120 episodes, airing them daily 
at 11:30 a.m. and 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important that this show is airing in two slots," says Scannell. "The 
kids watching during Nick Jr. are typically a very young audience, and that's 
very meaningful. They will be attracted to the puppetry. Parents look at it as 
the kind of thing that TV does well." 
</P>
<P>
 The early evening airing, which was the show's original time slot, is equally 
important to Nick. "The show was created for and is the perfect 7:30 p.m. 
show," Scannell adds. "This was meant to be a time of transition to prime time, 
when kids and parents are together, where kids could bring their parents to TV 
or visa versa. Not like all the tabloid shows on now." 
</P>
<P>
 The animated "Muppet Babies" will remain in its 11 a.m. time slot, thus 
creating the "Jim Henson Muppet Hour" during the "Nick Jr." time period between 
9 a.m. and 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Muppet Show" airs weekdays at 11:30 a.m. and 7:30 p.m. on Nickelodeon.

ROBIN ABCARIAN: A VISION OF VENICE PAVILION AS AN ARTS CENTER FOR CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN ABCARIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Te'amir Sweeney is a talkative, gregarious boy who lives in Oakwood, a Venice 
neighborhood where mothers are said to put their babies to bed in bathtubs to 
protect them from drive-by bullets. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know if Te'amir, 7 1/2 and a passionate gymnast, spends much time 
thinking about street violence and gang intrigue, but he needs to be protected 
from it. And, like all the children in this violence-plagued city, he needs a 
safe haven to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, his mother enrolled him in a photography workshop sponsored by 
Venice Arts Mecca, a nonprofit neighborhood group founded by actor Bingwa 
Thomas after the riots. The idea was to offer up the arts as an alternative to 
the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas spoke to residents of Oakwood to learn what their pressing needs were; 
he discovered that child care ranked first, followed by activities for 
children, teens and young adults.  
</P>
<P>
 "There are always sports available, but as far as teaching a love for the arts 
and creativity, these people can really offer something," said Ramona Sweeney, 
Te'amir's mother. 
</P>
<P>
 This spring, Venice Arts Mecca has offered video, photography and painting 
workshops; a jazz ensemble, and a theater group. Venues vary; the organization 
could offer a whole lot more if it had a permanent space. 
</P>
<P>
 I propose to take over a controversial and underused building -- the Venice 
Pavilion -- and turn it into a community arts center, with a day-care facility 
for children and job training for teen-agers. Lynn Warshafsky, president of the 
board of Venice Arts Mecca, estimates that 100 jobs -- not all of them 
permanent -- would be created by the renovation. 
</P>
<P>
 The group has several potential corporate donors lined up -- including 
Southern California Gas Co. and L.A. Gear -- and figures an initial investment 
of $1.6 million will suffice for renovation and operating expenses in the first 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 All it wants from the city is a long-term lease. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Pavilion sits on the sands of Venice Beach like a moribund whale. It 
commands singular views of the bay -- better than those of the swanky beach 
clubs up the way in Santa Monica, better than those of the ritzy homes along 
the Marina Peninsula to the south. 
</P>
<P>
 Decaying, graffiti-scared, ignored and smelling of urine, it is, in many ways, 
a symbol of the way this city treats its youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1961 on more than five acres, the Pavilion contains a large indoor 
theater; an outdoor stage; a wind-sheltered, palm-dotted picnic area with 60 
picnic tables; a police substation; kitchen facilities for a seaside cafe; 
shuffleboard and boccie ball courts.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, when the financial going got rough, the city gave up on the place. 
Today, the theater is closed and in disrepair, the kitchens are not used, and 
the picnic area is a fierce-looking graffiti pit. The only viable operation in 
the place these days is the police substation. In Venice public meetings, 
discussion of the Pavilion's fate is guaranteed to raise a ruckus. 
</P>
<P>
 A plan to renovate the Boardwalk is being formulated, and because the city has 
had neither the will, apparently, nor the imagination to recapture an 
invaluable asset, the Pavilion's days may be numbered. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, who has supported Venice Arts Mecca's programs, 
said she has taken no position on whether the Pavilion should be renovated or 
removed. "Its future needs to be addressed," she said, "along with the whole 
future of the beachfront area." 
</P>
<P>
 Many people want the thing gone -- too ugly, too hard to make it work. Too 
attractive to drug dealers and the homeless. Others, with a little more vision, 
see an unparalleled resource for a community virtually under siege by gangs -- 
last weekend alone, four people were shot in Venice drive-bys. They are asking 
the city to give the Pavilion, and the children of Venice, another chance.  
</P>
<P>
 You could argue, if you were so inclined, that the spirit of the law requires 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In November, 1992, L.A. County voters passed Proposition A, aimed at improving 
the county's parks and open spaces with the express intent of providing "safe 
places for children to play and alternatives to gangs." The law also gives high 
priority "to help prevent gangs by using funds from this act to employ youth to 
work on restoration or rehabilitation projects . . . in their communities." 
</P>
<P>
 Venice Beach has been allocated a modest $10 million to carry out the mandates 
of Proposition A, which include repair of the pier, restoration of beach 
facilities, improvements to the median of Venice Boulevard and to Ballona 
Lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the discussion at rancorous public meetings has centered on whether 
the boardwalk should be repaved with brick or asphalt, how much to spend on 
trash cans and restrooms, and how best to restore the historic picnic pagodas. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the Board of Recreation and Park Commissioners will consider 
whether to ask nonprofit groups for Pavilion restoration ideas. This could be 
good news for the Venice Arts Mecca.  
</P>
<P>
 But it could be even better news for the children.

 For four days, they blurt out secrets, slug pillows while yelling "Mama, Mama, 
Mama," and pretend to be aboard a sinking cruise ship that has only one life 
raft. 
</P>
<P>
 They also pray, listen to music from "Beverly Hills, 90210" and -- 
occasionally -- claim to hear whisperings from God. By the time it's over, many

 The program is called Momentus, a $500 jump-start for the spirit that is 
raising eyebrows among charismatic and evangelical Christians in Orange and Los 
Angeles counties, Northern California, Texas and Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 Started in a church gymnasium, Momentus is an unusual mix of conservative 
Christianity and rough-and-tumble psychological techniques. In it, people 
confess sins, wrestle with past hurts and role play in an attempt to better 
understand themselves and their relationship to God. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the seminar has won praise from a former co-host of Pat Robertson's 
"700 Club" TV show, dozens of pastors, a Nicaraguan contra general and the man 
who ran the Border Patrol's western headquarters under President Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 But it also has split one church, created a stir at others and come under 
question for its confrontational approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Momentusites acknowledge the program is rigorous -- even humiliating at times 
-- but say it needs to be to shake Christians from their complacency. "Jesus," 
explains founder Dan Tocchini, "is not Mr. Rogers." 
</P>
<P>
 Tocchini, 38, is the lightning rod for Momentus' detractors. 
</P>
<P>
 A former altar boy who later sold movie theaters, he says he was "born again" 
15 years ago in his sister's living room. From there -- and this is what 
disturbs his critics -- he went to work for Lifespring, a controversial 
self-improvement seminar similar to est.  
</P>
<P>
 To a number of Christians, Lifespring's New Age philosophy and methods -- 
which borrow from Eastern religions, existentialism and encounter-group 
psychology -- are not only at odds with biblical teachings, but potentially 
dangerous. Although most of Lifespring's 500,000 customers have enjoyed the 
seminars, the company has been sued more than 40 times for allegedly causing 
psychological injury or death -- charges it denies -- and its insurers have 
reportedly paid millions in settlements. 
</P>
<P>
 Tocchini, however, was intrigued with the idea of converting Lifespring's 
techniques to Christian ends. When his Pentecostal sister prophesied that "God 
would do a mighty work" with him at Lifespring, he signed on. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Catholic schools, I learned a lot about the Bible and Jesus Christ," he 
says. "But knowing truth is very different from being true. . . . In 
Lifespring, I saw that people were able to take on principles and use them like 
second nature in a short period of time. I wanted to learn how to (use the same 
teaching methods) to make biblical principles more (real) in people's lives." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, two years after quitting Lifespring, he was ready. At that time, he 
was involved in a home Bible study group at an Episcopal church in Petaluma, 
Calif., and "there was a buzz about our (meetings) in the congregation at 
large. . . . I (had developed a skill for) honing in on what people were 
concealing and the concerns of their hearts." 
</P>
<P>
 When the priest asked him to create a spiritual-growth program for the entire 
parish, Tocchini came up with Momentus. It had no name and lasted just two 
days, but the effect was electric. 
</P>
<P>
 "People came out and were really excited about doing things," Tocchini 
recalls. "And that got the priest kinda jumpy. He said, 'You've gotta put the 
reins on these people,' and I replied, 'I don't have any.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The jumpiness continued after Momentus moved to Santa Rosa, Calif. At first, 
the reviews were glowing. Broken marriages were healed, non-Christians accepted 
Jesus into their hearts, believers found new fervor for the Lord. 
</P>
<P>
 But soon, a vague uneasiness crept in. There were questions about the "living 
mirror" exercise, the odd lingo spoken by seminar graduates and the 
"peepee-to-peepee" hugs. 
</P>
<P>
 It sounded to skeptics like Lifespring in sheep's clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 (Lifespring officials say their program has no association with Momentus. 
"Only Lifespring is Lifespring," says company president Jeffrey L. Cosby. 
"We've assumed that what (Tocchini) is doing is quite different.") 
</P>
<P>
 "The debate isn't over the purpose of (Momentus), which is to get people to 
make full commitments to Christ," says John Strong, an evangelical Santa Rosa 
pastor who cautiously endorses the seminar. "The issue is the tools being 
used." 
</P>
<P>
 The underlying argument boils down to this: Is it possible to Christianize the 
psychological methods of human-potential groups, or are they inherently 
"man-centered" and anti-God? 
</P>
<P>
 The most controversial of those methods -- one that has been used by 
Lifespring and adapted by Momentus -- is the living mirror, an exercise in 
which individuals stand in front of other people at the seminar and listen to 
what those people think of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who don't know you from Adam are giving you a rundown on what they 
think you are, and some of it is just really uncalled for," says Wayne Coombs, 
a Palos Verdes minister who otherwise loves Momentus. "It's said with a real 
sense of unkindness (and) for me, there was some damage." 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, a Los Angeles woman, who asked not to be named, says the "harshness 
and verbal abuse" left her depressed for two months: "Christians are supposed 
to reach out in love and be gentle . . . (but) this just ripped me apart." 
Tocchini refunded her money. 
</P>
<P>
 But many others describe the exercise as illuminating. "I'd been wearing this 
mask of always smiling and being the life of the party," says Lynn Thompson of 
San Jose. "I got found out. It forced me to take a look at myself. . . . I 
realized I wasn't allowing people to know me. . . . Some of the stuff went back 
to when I was a kid."  
</P>
<P>
 Another image problem for Momentus involves Tocchini's apparent inability to 
put his message into conversational English. 
</P>
<P>
 People come out of the seminars spouting such phrases as "showing up," "where 
do you stand" and "who we are will show up in how we engage with others 
regarding the commitments that define our relationship."  
</P>
<P>
 Says Strong: "It gets (outsiders) riled up." 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Tocchini has begun replacing some of the psychobabble with weird 
constitutional language. He talks about "governing the capitol that you are" 
through your personal legislative, executive and judicial branches, and says 
that getting "aligned with our God-designed identity . . . (enables us to) 
enjoy the privileges and benefits of a constitutional republic." 
</P>
<P>
 Other factors that put off non-Momentusites include the relentless pressure 
many graduates use to recruit them into future seminars, the secrecy 
surrounding Momentus (participants sign agreements not to reveal seminar 
contents, a rule Lifespring recently dropped), and the infamous, but now 
discarded, peepee-to-peepee embrace -- a fully clothed, pelvis-to-pelvis body 
hug that has also been used by Lifespring. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you imagine the apostle Paul . . . writing to the saints, encouraging 
them to hug one another penis to vagina?" one minister asks. 
</P>
<P>
 A few have also been irked by the perceived elitism of Momentus graduates. 
</P>
<P>
 "The attitude seemed to be that anyone who had doubts or questions about 
Momentus would be fine if you just got him through the (seminar)," says Charles 
Berlin, an early Santa Rosa supporter who later changed his mind. "But Jesus 
never said, 'You have to do the seminar.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, tension soon swept Santa Rosa's evangelical and charismatic 
Christian community, the primary target for Momentus' word-of-mouth 
advertising. At Tocchini's home church, a quarter of the 800-member charismatic 
congregation left when pastor J.R. Young refused to condemn the seminar. 
Several conservative Sonoma County preachers began branding Momentus satanic. 
And the Santa Rosa Press Democrat ran a front-page story describing the uproar. 
</P>
<P>
 "In all my life, I've never seen people as energized as the ones from those 
early seminars," says Dennis Peacocke, a Santa Rosa Bible teacher and author 
who initially endorsed Momentus, then switched sides and led the revolt at 
Tocchini's church. "But it took over the energy of the church. It sucked 
everything into its orbit." 
</P>
<P>
 Tocchini says the ensuing controversy was "like a witch hunt." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem predated Momentus, pastor Strong says. At Tocchini's 
church, for example, some congregation members were automatically suspicious of 
the seminar because of fallout from a 1980s movement called shepherding. Under 
that program, which at one time involved charismatic churches across the 
country, individuals submitted control of their personal lives to church 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose, Strong says, was to help believers follow biblical teachings, but 
it got to the point where "people were being told how often to have sex with 
their wives." That, he says, "left many wary of the next fad. And when that 
next fad came through -- in the form of Momentus -- a bunch of people not only 
said 'no,' but 'hell no.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Tocchini had expected to make waves. After leaving the Episcopal church in 
Petaluma, he halted the seminars for more than a year because "I knew what kind 
of upset was coming and I wasn't sure I wanted to pay the price."  
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until mid-1992, after a few more trial runs of the seminar in Santa 
Rosa, that he incorporated Mashiyach Training Services (from a Hebrew word 
meaning anointed ) as a nonprofit religious organization. (A few months later, 
the nonprofit status was changed to for-profit, with Tocchini controlling 78% 
of the corporation's stock.)  
</P>
<P>
 He also created a $400 advanced course, launched satellite offices in Tustin 
and Houston, and now holds seminars in Dallas, Sacramento, Florida and Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tocchini, a raspy-voiced college dropout who looks somewhat like a big 
Danny DeVito, says Momentus has yet to make a buck. In 1993, the corporation 
grossed $250,000, paid Tocchini about $35,000 and lost money, he says. This 
year, with a second seminar leader on staff and a new audiocassette sales 
division, Tocchini expects to move into black ink. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although Southern California and Texas haven't seen the sort of church split 
that rocked Santa Rosa, occasional small problems have arisen. Mission Viejo 
Vineyard Christian Fellowship, for example, lost 15 to 20 of its 300 adult 
members after church leaders criticized the program. And a 550-person 
Assemblies of God church near Houston lost about 50 members when it endorsed 
Momentus. 
</P>
<P>
 To counter criticism, Tocchini has made some changes. In addition to dumping 
the peepee hugs, he also jettisoned his use of profanity in the seminars 
(although attendees themselves are free to swear if they wish) and a 
visualization exercise that had people picture themselves soaring to heaven to 
retrieve a package that contained the baby Jesus (opponents consider such uses 
of the imagination occultic). 
</P>
<P>
 But skeptics say the changes are cosmetic. "You're dealing with a greased 
pig," says Santa Rosa pastor Dick Williams, who went through Momentus and liked 
it, then decided he had been psychologically manipulated. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter what you say, they can say, 'Oh, we're not doing that anymore.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Says Tocchini: "No matter how thoroughly we document our ministry with a 
Biblical rationale, (some) will never cease their opposition." 
</P>
<P>
 Momentus supporters acknowledge that their approach defies religious 
convention. Although Marriage Encounter, Cursillo retreats and some other 
accepted Christian programs have also adapted a few encounter-group techniques, 
none uses Momentus' discomforting style. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a retreat," says pastor Coombs. "It's a major confrontation -- 
with yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea, Strong says, is to break through the "anger, bitterness and old 
tapes" that hold people back from fully following Christ. People are forced to 
look at discrepancies between their behavior and their beliefs, which "brings 
up issues of repentance, confession and forgiveness." 
</P>
<P>
 Psychological exercises are only used to reinforce points or draw out emotions 
that get people to look seriously at their relationships with God and other 
people, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 If it seems heavy-handed at times, well, Jesus was the same way, Tocchini 
says: "About 80% of what Christ said was harsh. Driving people from the 
marketplace with a whip was harsh. . . . He was as much a lion as a lamb 
(because) he was after the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The guy clutching the microphone was a liar and Wayne Coombs wasn't going to 
let him get away with it. It was day three of a Momentus seminar in Orange 
County and Tocchini had opened the floor to anyone who wanted to share. Coombs 
sprang from his seat and challenged his fellow enrollee. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't love your wife, do you?" he recalls asking. 
</P>
<P>
 "What?" the speaker sputtered. "Of course I do." 
</P>
<P>
 "No, you don't. You're a liar, man." 
</P>
<P>
 The verbal sparring continued briefly, until finally the man broke down 
sobbing and admitted that he still loved his first wife. Then, as the rest of 
the room listened in stunned silence, he added: "She was stolen from me by 
another man -- and I hate his guts." 
</P>
<P>
 Coombs asked: "Have you ever told him how you feel?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," came the grim reply. "I beat the (hell) out of him. And then I went to 
his house and set it on fire." 
</P>
<P>
 At that moment, the man's second wife -- also attending the seminar -- walked 
forward, visibly shaken. "Why didn't you ever tell me this?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband hugged her halfheartedly, but she pulled away and told the group 
about their empty marriage, how they hadn't had sex in ages. It was, says 
Coombs, an emotional bombshell. 
</P>
<P>
 Then something amazing happened. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, the woman approached Coombs and told him that she and her 
husband had somehow worked things out overnight and fallen "in love." Her 
entire countenance, Coombs says, had shifted dramatically. A few weeks later, 
she showed up at Coombs' church, still enthralled with the marriage -- and 
pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 Coombs sees only one possible explanation: "No (psychological) manipulation 
can do something that dramatic. That's the power of the Holy Spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 Others report equally surprising changes of heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobby Herron, an African American missionary with Athletes in Action, says the 
seminar disarmed the "distrust and animosity I felt toward white people. . . . 
I'm still an activist, but I realized that holding onto bitterness and hurt 
doesn't produce good fruit. . . . I hope other individuals of color will avail 
themselves of Momentus." 
</P>
<P>
 For some, Momentus has been a spiritual epiphany. Of the 250 non-Christians 
who have gone through the seminar, about 200 have converted to Christ, Tocchini 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 He adds that Momentus doesn't proselytize nonbelievers -- a statement attested 
to by a Jewish couple who attended a recent Manhattan Beach seminar -- but says 
anything can happen once the sessions get under way. 
</P>
<P>
 A few even claim to have heard whisperings from God. Williams, the Santa Rosa 
minister who is among those most critical of Momentus, says he "experienced the 
Holy Spirit speaking to me in some of the exercises." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Tocchini: "It's a real potent environment. . . . It's powerful. I've had 
40 or 50 people remember molestations they never remembered before." 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, something backfires. "If you put a jerk through this, he comes 
out a dynamic jerk at the other end," Strong says. But most of the 1,200 people 
who have taken Momentus -- including a growing roster of Christian celebrities 
-- seem to rave about it.  
</P>
<P>
 Harold Ezell, a former Border Patrol chieftain and Der Wienerschnitzel exec, 
says it helped him become "more forgiving." And Christian musician Sheila 
Walsh, onetime sidekick to Pat Robertson, testifies in Momentus brochures that 
it enabled her -- after 26 years as a believer -- to "finally begin to grasp 
hold of what it means to love God with everything and to love my neighbor as 
myself." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Leading the opposition is the Christian Research Institute of Irvine, an 
anti-cult organization that wields considerable influence among conservative 
believers. Last year, CRI issued a statement that it was investigating 
"disturbing reports" about the seminar because "it appears that a number of 
principles embraced and promoted by the human potential movement (in particular 
Lifespring) have been carried over to Momentus under a thin veneer of 
Christianese." 
</P>
<P>
 But CRI officials admit that they have done virtually no firsthand research on 
the seminar. And several former CRI staffers say the institute's methods and 
credibility have slipped in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, CRI acknowledges that its most current critique of the Vineyard 
-- a popular, nationwide network of charismatic churches -- was written nine 
years ago by a free-lance researcher who based his entire report on a four-day 
Vineyard conference about church growth. The information was never 
double-checked or updated. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Momentus, CRI has relied on statements from "seven to 10" 
unhappy seminar attendees (but says only two of them will allow their names to 
be released), a handful of skeptical Santa Rosa ministers and a theological 
analysis written by a premed student from Orange Coast College who left a local 
seminar after a day and a half. 
</P>
<P>
 Not good enough, say several other researchers. "(You) don't make blanket 
statements based on somebody's rumors," explains Gretchen Passantino, a 
Christian investigative journalist who once worked for CRI. 
</P>
<P>
 Although somewhat dubious about Momentus herself, Passantino says the only 
accurate way to assess the seminar is to send a trained researcher through 
undercover. Interviews with Tocchini and other knowledgeable sources -- pro and 
con -- also would be sought. 
</P>
<P>
 CRI says it can't put anyone through Momentus anonymously because enrollment 
questionnaires ask where the person works and it's against CRI policy to lie. 
(Requests by The Times to have a reporter attend the seminar without signing a 
secrecy agreement were turned down by Tocchini.) 
</P>
<P>
 As for interviewing Tocchini, CRI researcher Marian Bodine says she met with 
him once -- at his request -- but "Waco was burning that day and we really 
didn't have time to talk." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the limited investigation, Bodine drafted a five-page critique of 
Momentus last September. But it hasn't been released to the public, she says, 
because Tocchini threatened to sue. Tocchini denies hinting legal action, and 
CRI continues to distribute various materials it has collected about the 
seminar. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers suggest that the controversy over Momentus may be a lot of 
sound and fury over nothing. The effects of the seminar on graduates, say 
several supporters and critics who have watched it long term, often fade or 
disappear after a few months. 
</P>
<P>
 Rex Julian Beaber, a psychologist and attorney familiar with encounter groups, 
says that isn't surprising: 
</P>
<P>
 "The grand lesson of the whole marathon group encounter movement is that the 
effects are very short-lived. . . . It is very difficult to change another 
human being." 
</P>
<P>
 The only reason people think their lives are different is because "they 
confuse emotional intensity with significance. What are they doing now that 
they weren't doing before? Were they unemployed people who now have jobs? . . . 
Are they best friends with someone they couldn't forgive? The evidence of real 
change is usually trivial." 
</P>
<P>
 The exceptions, Beaber says, are people who attend a seminar at a critical 
juncture in their lives and are thus more susceptible to a "conversion 
experience." They usually join the group or stay involved to solidify the 
effect, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 For most others, however, "it's like a roller-coaster ride -- a brief 
emotional flurry that disappears in time." And that, he says, is the secret to 
any successful self-help or spiritual conversion movement: "A truly great idea 
can be written down in a book or article and transmitted to millions. But a 
mediocre idea has to be shrouded in emotional intensity." 
</P>
<P>
 That's not to meant to imply that such ideas are useless, he adds: "People's 
lives are so bland that anyone who makes them feel anything is a miracle 
worker." 
</P>
<P>
 Butch Pluimer, a charismatic Tustin minister and Christian radio personality 
who is cautiously introducing Momentus at his church, agrees: 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, (the seminar) is meeting a need in many people's lives that the 
church isn't. Some say it's the most transforming thing they've seen. Others 
say it's the most egregious. Let's talk and see if we can make it better. . . . 
I don't want to say that everything they're doing is perfect, but I don't want 
to shut the door just because it's fresh and new." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, the verdict on Momentus is still out. Even critics admit that they've 
had a hard time staking a position. As Santa Rosa's Peacocke wrote in his 
eight-page critique of Momentus: "I have never been less certain in attempting 
to evaluate and discern if something was or was not of God."

 Oscar Green: In the past few years, an increasing number of charities have 
tried to ride Oscar's coattails on Academy Awards night. While Hollywood uses 
the evening for hype, the charities make use of it for fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that all the expenses have been paid, here's the bottom line on 1994's 
Oscar-night charity affairs: 
</P>
<P>
 * The party at Maple Drive for the Elton John AIDS Foundation (underwritten by 
Cartier) netted $200,000 for patient care. 
</P>
<P>
 * The AIDS Healthcare Foundation party at the Directors Guild netted $70,000 
for clinic and hospice care. 
</P>
<P>
 * Women in Film's party at the Regent Beverly Wilshire raised $41,800 for the 
organizations work in supporting and promoting professional women in the 
entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
 * El Rescate's party at the Mondrian Hotel netted $25,000 for aiding Central 
American immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 * The party in the CAA lobby for the Bobby Brooks Foundation netted $22,000 
for Cities in Schools to launch a learning center in Newark, N.J.  
</P>
<P>
 * The party at Roxbury for the L.A. Chapter of the American Red Cross netted 
$10,000 for disaster relief. 
</P>
<P>
 To put the Oscar-night dollars in perspective, according to the Hollywood 
Reporter the cost of airing a 30-second commercial during the Oscar telecast 
was $630,000. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Bigger Bucks: And speaking of money, the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation 
hopes opera lovers will pay big to hear their favorites. Tickets for "Encore! 
of the Three Tenors" (Jose Carreras, Placido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti 
conducted by Zubin Mehta) July 16 at Dodger Stadium begin at $2,500 each. 
Packages -- which include 20 prime tickets, an "opportunity for private meeting 
with stars," a chance to buy otherwise unavailable World Cup soccer tickets, 
and two tables at the post-concert dinner -- go for $150,000. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Rink-Side Stories: As a coda to the Tonya Harding-Nancy Kerrigan tragicomedy 
on ice, not one, but two comic books outlining the story are now on newsstands. 
One from the River Group includes a "Whack Attack" fold-out diagram that 
follows the plot against Kerrigan from inception to Lillehammer. The other from 
He Said/She Said Comics takes Tonya story from one side of the book and her 
ex-husband's, Jeff Gillooly, from the other. 
</P>

<P>
 Ruling Party?: Although the details of the imperial visit haven't been 
finalized, it looks as if the Emperor and Empress of Japan will be in L.A. at 
the end of June. Although the Japanese Embassy in Washington would not confirm 
this, there's a formal dinner tentatively scheduled for June 20 to be hosted by 
local and state officials.

 America's closest approximation to a crack passenger train, the best that's 
riding the rails these days, has just pulled into Reno -- 6 hours, 4 minutes 
late. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to worry, writer Henry Kisor assures a reporter who has been waiting there 
to join him on-board. Kisor is philosophical as he takes his latest ride over 
the scenic Chicago-to-Oakland Amtrak route.  
</P>
<P>
 Bring a sunny disposition aboard with your luggage, he advises, and maintain 
it, "no matter what." Surly attendants? Continually occupied toilets? 
Horrendous delays? Relax. Enjoy the good stuff: Watch the country slide past, 
schmooze with a stranger for a change, read.

<P>
 The California Zephyr departs Reno station, inching past the jammed-together 
gambling joints, rolling west toward the blue Sierra.

 From long experience, Kisor arrived at this balanced judgment of the nation's 
substandard passenger rail service: It's worse than it used to be, worse than 
its foreign counterparts, but still worth the ride. 
</P>
<P>
 As a day job, he is book editor and literary columnist of the Chicago 
Sun-Times, one of that city's two major daily newspapers. But he has ridden 
Amtrak across the country for years. He has ridden this 2,416-mile route, his 
favorite, 15 times in researching his new book, "Zephyr: Tracking a Dream 
Across America." 
</P>
<P>
 But experience as a "railfan" -- the breed hates the term "train buff" -- does 
not begin to explain the rare perspective Henry Kisor brings to this or any of 
his endeavors: 
</P>
<P>
 Award-winning journalist, storyteller, literary expert, railfan, husband, 
father -- and now at age 53, on the verge of earning his private pilot's 
license. 
</P>
<P>
 And he is also, as he puts it, deaf as a post -- the result of contracting 
meningitis at 3. He has no memory of what sound is like. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The train winds along the Truckee River gorge, flanked by the beige, 
brush-dotted, first undulations of the leeward Sierra. Kisor, his wife , Debby, 
and the reporter settle into a first-class compartment for a talk.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kisor was raised in the "hearing culture," meaning he learned to lip read and 
to speak instead of learning sign language, the province of the "deaf culture" 
that Kisor rejects, at least for himself. He wrote about his silent world in a 
1990 book, "What's That Pig Outdoors: A Memoir of Deafness." 
</P>
<P>
 As a professional writer and communicator, Kisor is denied essential tools 
that others in high-voltage careers take for granted. His lip reading 
occasionally fails him -- which explains the humorous title of the earlier 
book. His speech, which he describes as "my deaf person's breathy monotone," is 
at once noticeable, and can be a source of hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Riding the train, "When I get into a conversation in the lounge car or the 
diner, some people are completely buffaloed by a deaf person. They can't handle 
it. I will say, 'Oh, by the way, I am deaf,' and the person will get up, leave 
right away."  
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, just as often, someone else will come along and ask, "Did you say 
you are deaf?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah." 
</P>
<P>
 "What's it like?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I will tell him. Within 20 minutes, we are old friends." 
</P>
<P>
 In "Zephyr," Kisor picks up all manner of auditory nuance -- the woman "with 
just an occasional Russian-style locution in her precise but melodious speech," 
the man who "spoke in that odd, whiny accent which makes questions of 
statements." 
</P>
<P>
 There is a section on a disoriented, half-drunk woman, page after page of 
quoted dialogue between the woman and a train attendant, written to show how 
Amtrak handles confused people (very gently).  
</P>
<P>
 How did Kisor get all that? 
</P>
<P>
 "I just leaned over with a small recorder concealed in my hand and taped the 
whole thing." A professional transcriber going through his tapes later left out 
the parts "about that drunk woman. Didn't think you'd want that." 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, my god," Kisor recalls saying. "That's the best part." He retrieved the 
tape and had the transcriber do it over. 
</P>
<P>
 As for other subtleties, "I pay attention to how writers render sound and I 
try to imagine what sound is like. When Debby tells me a person has a high, 
nasal quality of speech, I don't know what that sounds like. But I can hold my 
nose and feel what it sounds like by feeling the vibrations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll say to people, 'Give me a metaphor. This person sounds as though he has 
a gravely voice, you say? What does that mean?' And someone will say, 'It 
sounds like a cement mixer.' Ah, cement mixer. Now I know." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Zephyr leaves Truckee on the long crawl toward the 7,032-foot top of 
Donner Pass. Presenting one of the most scenic rides in American railroading, 
the double-tracked roadbed cuts through stands of evergreens, across 
granite-strewn inclines, past patches of weeks-old, graying snow.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kisor is a solid, compact-looking guy, square-shouldered and upright. He gazes 
straight into his interlocutor's face -- the better to read lips -- and makes 
his points forcefully. When he speaks, his artfully shaped, naturally flowing 
sentences make it seem as if writing should come easily to him -- an 
observation he finds hilarious, given the drafts he describes piling up as he 
strives to get a single paragraph just right. 
</P>
<P>
 A careful thinker with a tough intellect who disparages the phrase "on the 
other hand," Kisor does not buy into the notion that he is defined by his 
deafness. 
</P>
<P>
 "This book is not about a deaf man's travels," he replies rather testily. 
"It's about a man who is a railfan who happens to be deaf." 
</P>
<P>
 In this railfan's "Zephyr" are found: 
</P>
<P>
 The journalist's nuggets of fact about Zephyr chef John Davis' struggle, 
against all odds, to present his movable feasts with tastiness and variety 
three days, two nights, running. 
</P>
<P>
 The literary critic's invocation of T.S. Eliot to describe people's 
dispositions changing for the better on the train, then changing back again as 
soon as they get off.  
</P>
<P>
 The social critic's complaint of the neglect plaguing the small farmers of the 
Great Plains, noted as the Zephyr sneaks through Nebraska only after dark, a 
metaphor for our indifference. 
</P>
<P>
 The railfan feeling "the tug of the high iron," as railroading is romantically 
described; recognizing the logos on the passing boxcars; steering clear of the 
"foamers" -- the occasional bore on the subject who unfailingly foams at the 
mouth while pontificating. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there is his just plain storytelling. Sex, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
 With all those beds on board, men and women traveling alone usually have no 
trouble arranging get-togethers, if they are so inclined, Kisor reports. As 
long as one or the other has paid for the compartment, "conductors and 
attendants will not stand in their way." 
</P>
<P>
 It is their worldly nature. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also their nature to pass on their best stories about such trysts. 
There's the one about the man booked on a Zephyr sleeper coach on the 
Oakland-bound portion of the train who took to his bed a woman ticketed to Los 
Angeles. Her compartment was on a section of the train scheduled to split off 
at Salt Lake City the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Failing to remember this detail, she "traversed the dining car, occupied only 
by waiters setting up for breakfast (and) suddenly spotted daylight through the 
window of the far door" where her coach had been. "All her baggage and 
belongings were rolling unaccompanied hundreds of miles southwest toward Los 
Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 "My God!" the waiters heard her wail, "What am I going to tell my husband?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The train follows a wide arc, south through canyons of dense new-growth 
forest, then loops back, again heading west. We are in the dining car now, 
gazing down from a stupendous height on the sapphire sheen of Donner Lake.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kisor's deafness, in some small way, seems to have helped steer him to the 
story of the late-rising woman and to similar yarns. Relating fast tales of the 
rails, with embellishment, is a tradition of the country's mostly African 
American passenger-coach crews. 
</P>
<P>
 "Black crew members have a rich storytelling tradition," Kisor says. "It goes 
all the way back to the old-time sleeping car porters who had to put up with 
many indignities." To help cope, "They would tell each other stories about 
unreasonable or crazy white passengers." 
</P>
<P>
 Today's crews, many the sons and grandsons of the old porters, keep the 
stories coming, always with maximum impact. 
</P>
<P>
 That their stories tumbled out one after the other for Kisor, who is white, 
bears on a mutual bond that developed. For his part, "I think one of the 
reasons I chose to write a book about trains was that on the train trips Debby 
and I used to take, we noticed early on that my deafness didn't bother (the 
crews). They have seen so many different kinds of people that I was just a 
man." 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, the service crews talked because someone showed rare serious 
interest in them. "When people write books about trains, they never think of 
the crew." 
</P>
<P>
 And finally, he says, as if tightening the bond, he compares himself to "a 
black person living in a white suburb" because of the isolation he feels as a 
deaf person. 
</P>
<P>
 "To carry the metaphor any further than that would be demeaning to both blacks 
and the deaf." But the fact is, Kisor says, black people complain when a white 
person walking toward them crosses the street to avoid an encounter and 
"likewise, a number of hearing people I know will see me coming and cross the 
street . . . because they are afraid of an awkward moment." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Zephyr is down-mountain bound, toward Emigrant Gap, Colfax in the 
foothills, Roseville in the valley.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie Howard, the conscientious train chief much quoted in Kisor's book, is 
aboard. A locomotive breakdown somewhere in the Midwest and a bunch of freight 
trains piling up in Salt Lake City behind some bent track set the Zephyr's 
timetable reeling on this run, he explains. Howard wears the forlorn look of a 
coach who has lost another one. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been worse delays. In his book, Kisor writes of the time the Zephyr 
limped into Oakland 14 hours late, at 7 a.m. on Christmas Day. The passengers 
were ready to lynch the train chief because "of course, it was (his) fault." 
</P>
<P>
 Kisor defends the Amtrak crews, among whom are some heroes, such as Howard and 
the chef, Davis. Amtrak does the best with what it has -- shabby equipment, 
unreliable locomotives -- Kisor says, but when the best isn't good enough, the 
passengers take it out on the crew members. It is not surprising that some 
become "apathetic or downright surly." 
</P>
<P>
 But there is "still enough pride among the people of Amtrak to make it a good 
railroad if given half a chance," Kisor says. "It requires money." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Zephyr reaches Sacramento, deposits Kisor's visiting reporter at the drab, 
grimy depot, and heads out into the night, 85 miles to go before arrival in 
Oakland, end of the line . 
</P>
<P>
 Late again.

Q & A; CHARITY BEGINS AT HOME; AFTER FOUR DECADES OF VOLUNTEER WORK, GINNY 
MANCINI IS LEAVING PHILANTHROPY TO DEVOTE TIME TO HER FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNINE STEIN, TIMES SOCIETY WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ginny Mancini's first volunteer job was working for SHARE (Share Happily and 
Reap Endlessly), raising money for mentally retarded children and adults. 
</P>
<P>
 That was 40 years ago, and since then she's gone on to serve on the boards of 
the L.A. Philharmonic, the L.A. Opera, the Board of Governors of the Music 
Center and the Royce Center Circle at UCLA (the support group for the UCLA 
Center for the Performing Arts). She's also the founder of the Society of 
Singers, which raises money to aid professional singers in need. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1989, she's produced and chaired the Society's annual benefit, which has 
saluted Tony Martin, Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald -- for whom the "Ella" 
lifetime achievement award is named. 
</P>
<P>
 But after four decades of work, Mancini, 69, a former singer herself, is 
leaving the philanthropic world to pursue other interests. She wants to devote 
more time to her family, especially her husband of 46 years, composer Henry 
Mancini, who has cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 But first, she will be on hand for an April 19 "Tribute to Henry Mancini" at 
UCLA's Pauley Pavilion. And on May 9, Peggy Lee will be honored by the Society 
of Singers, which Ginny will again co-chair and co-produce. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting on the sofa of her spacious Holmby Hills home, she talks about the 
changes in her life. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: You've decided at this point in your life to bow out of the 
philanthropic work that you do. Why? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: I've decided to take a bit of a sabbatical for personal reasons. Henry 
is battling a serious disease and I just feel the need to back off of the 
fund-raising component of my life. (These are) causes that I really believe in, 
and of course I will always support them. I've done it for 40 years and I think 
it's time that I spent some quality time with my family. Our lives, for obvious 
reasons, are very different, suddenly. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Did it take you a long time to come to this decision? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes it did, because it's a lifestyle that I have created for myself and 
it's been very gratifying. I'm about to reach a new decade of my life as well, 
and I do kind of an assessment of how I want to spend the next 10 years. I want 
to maybe go back to school and study things that I've put on the back burner. I 
just want to do some different things. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What would you like to study? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Art history, and I'd like to go back to my first language, which was 
Spanish. I was very fluent as a child and I want to be able to get that fluency 
back under my belt. And I suppose if I'm going to be able to function in the 
next decade, I'm going to have to become more computer literate. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why do you do these 10-year assessments? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I have to be sure that if I'm lucky enough to have (the time), I have to be 
sure that it's spent in ways that are fulfilling. And I just need a little 
change of pace. Obviously, I've been forced into a little change of pace by the 
revelation of Henry's illness. It's such an insidious disease, but I do believe 
there are miracles and we pray for them. 
</P>
<P>
 I have to do everything in my power to remain strong and healthy. We have such 
a terrific family -- they are so loving and supportive. We're take-charge 
people. So we'll manage. And the outpouring of love and affection (from friends 
and fans) has been quite extraordinary. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: There's always been a special feeling at the Society of Singers events. 
Even though there are hundreds of people in a huge ballroom, when the 
entertainment begins, the room seems much smaller and more intimate. 
</P>
<P>
 A: When you get singers in a room together, something magical happens. We've 
had singers here (at the house), and when everybody gathers around the piano, 
it's like a religious experience. 
</P>
<P>
 I think that's the feeling that's generated at the Society of Singers. It's 
contagious and it's wonderful, and everyone goes out of there higher than a 
kite because it's like they've been infused with joyfulness. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only that, but people relive moments in their lives as a singer is singing 
a certain song, and they can identify a time and place and a feeling instantly. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you get out of doing these events? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I think I get a feeling of gratification knowing that I'm giving back to 
singers who have impacted my life. I have been able to get through the depths 
of despair with Frank Sinatra and I have felt down and depressed with Billie 
Holiday. I've been joyous and happy with Nat Cole. It's a way to express 
yourself through them. You can't imagine your life experience without singers. 
So I think that's the feeling of satisfaction I get, a feeling of repayment and 
appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What was your first experience in fund raising? 
</P>
<P>
 A: My first experience as a young woman in a volunteer situation was when I 
joined SHARE in 1954. That was to raise money for mentally retarded children 
and adults (the group now funds many other charities). I worked actively in 
SHARE for 25 years and became president for two years. From there, I decided to 
really devote myself to the arts and felt that all of my energies would be 
expended in that direction. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you think this will be a difficult adjustment for you, having spent four 
to five days a week working on projects and boards? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I will enjoy the luxury of not having to book meetings and that kind of 
thing. I'll look forward to more freedom to spend time with my family. And I 
love my home and I want to spend more time in it than out of it. I think I'm 
ready. One seems to know these things.

GARDENERS LEARN TO GROW WITH THE BIODIVERSE FLOW; HOBBIES: A NEW TREND IN HOME 
LANDSCAPING, GROWING INDIGENOUS PLANTS -- AND LOTS OF THEM -- ATTRACTS WILDLIFE 
AND IS GOOD FOR THE ECOSYSTEM, PROPONENTS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN EGERTON, THE BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bruce Leopold has crammed fruit trees, shrubs and "thousands" of plants from 
bloodroot to sea lavender to Joe Pye weed into his one-third-acre yard. The 
Ruxton, Md., psychiatrist says some of his neighbors probably think "it looks 
like Dr. Seuss has gone mad." 
</P>
<P>
 But Leopold says he has achieved what he wanted, "a breadth of flora and 
fauna," or what some now call a biodiverse garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Landscape designer and nurseryman Robert A. Schultz calls it gardening with, 
instead of against, the grain. Grass lawns dotted with weed-free flower plots 
are unnatural. It's that simple. 
</P>
<P>
 By forcing the land to accept our constant grooming -- via mowing and planting 
flora not indigenous to the region -- we interrupt the interworkings of the 
plant and animal kingdom. "We disturb and tear the fabric of the natural 
environment," says Baltimore gardener and landscape designer Frances Horich.  
</P>
<P>
 But some gardeners are seeing the folly of their ways and are turning their 
gardens into units of biodiversity, which literally means "diverse life." Their 
plantings produce flowers and/or seeds and berries that attract a variety of 
wildlife -- birds, butterflies, small mammals, toads, earthworms and ants, 
right down to the necessary fungi and bacteria that make the soil hospitable to 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
 The 42-inch lily and fish pond in Leopold's garden attracts frogs that eat 
insects. Sometimes, he gets more biodiversity than he bargained for: "One day 
last summer, a heron dropped out of the sky and helped himself to some of our 
goldfish. My wife was a little upset." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a situation that Sara Stein would applaud. A leader of the biodiversity 
movement, Stein wrote "Noah's Garden: Restoring the Ecology of Our Back Yard," 
published by Houghton Mifflin last year. Horich calls "Noah's Garden" as 
definitive a work on the environment as Rachel Carson's "Silent Spring" was 31 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Stein, there is no sin she and her husband did not commit in 
their quest for the perfect garden. Their manic clearing and mowing yielded a 
static garden with no wildlife.  
</P>
<P>
 On their six acres in Pound Ridge, N.Y., they extended their lawn, and the 
pheasants stopped coming. They planted trees and shrubs, whose sterile blooms 
produced no berries and thus attracted no birds; they cut down milkweeds, 
destroying food for Monarch butterfly larvae (which eat only milkweed). In 
adhering to the standards of landscaping, they destroyed the habitats and food 
of countless living beings. 
</P>
<P>
 When they realized what they had done, the Steins went to work to reverse the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 Her book describes their efforts, and its most important advice, echoed by 
Horich and other area gardeners, is "plant, plant, plant" to create a diversity 
of plants. They will attract a diversity of wildlife that will, she says in a 
telephone interview, "benefit the entire ecosystem." 
</P>
<P>
 Successful biodiversity, proponents agree, requires a change in one's 
thinking. Says Schultz, the nurseryman: "You plant in layers, in 
micro-environments of perhaps a tree, some shrubs and flowers in a group at 
varying heights, which will have a more interesting look and which will always 
be changing." 
</P>
<P>
 Schultz suggests noting "where the most moisture is and planting 
moisture-loving plants there" -- such as fern, Jack-in-the-pulpit, iris -- "as 
well as where the dry spots are and planting accordingly" -- such as black-eyed 
Susan, coneflower, liatris. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore gardener Nan Paternotte warns against planting too much of the same 
plant, however. "If you have a blight, you're really in trouble," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Another challenge to native plants is invasive imports such as kudzu, Japanese 
honeysuckle, English ivy and Norway maple (which secretes a toxin that kills 
plants under it). Biodiverse gardeners urge removing or controlling imports. 
</P>
<P>
 Many native species of plants are diminishing at a dizzying pace, thanks to 
development and the best intentions of this country's 35 million or so 
gardeners. 
</P>
<P>
 Stein says: "From 1800 to 1950, 90 native species of plants became extinct in 
the United States. It is projected that in the period between 1950 and 1998, 
another 475 native species will be lost."

WESTSIDE WATCH: ARTISTS PUT THEIR FEARS ON DISPLAY IN SANTA MONICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hundreds of people have attended the L.A. Gun Show in Santa Monica, but the 
visitors don't exactly fit the National Rifle Assn. mold. 
</P>
<P>
 The hanging-plant-and-quiche crowd, in fact, came out in force for this 
occasion -- a show of "art" guns at the Julie Rico Gallery on Main Street. The 
show featured wooden Uzis, sweet-smelling shotguns made of soap and -- for 
those with a sweet tooth -- chocolate pistols. 
</P>
<P>
 Its curator, Tricia Watts, said she wanted to highlight the encroachment of 
guns on the art community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many artists are living in cheap lofts downtown. They need the affordable 
space, and because they're living in a war zone they've had to arm themselves," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 One piece attracting attention is a vulture/dragon sculpture made out of 
weapons that have been confiscated and destroyed by the LAPD. The skeletal 
figurine hangs from the ceiling and is constructed with gun parts ranging from 
barrels to cylinders to triggers. 
</P>
<P>
 The show also includes airbrush paintings, audio displays, and photographs 
illustrating the artist's personal relationships with L.A.'s "tools of ill 
omen." 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit runs through May 8, and prices for the artworks range from $20 to 
$7,000.

 FALLEN ANGEL: One of "Charlie's Angels" has fallen in her bid for Los Angeles 
County Democratic Central Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelley Hack, who once played Tiffany Welles on the ABC detective show, was 
set to compete in the 41st Assembly District for a seat on the committee, which 
-- among other things -- conducts fund raising and recruits candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 But a signature-gathering snafu has caused her to be disqualified, returning 
the race to a contest among lesser knowns. The disqualification was the result 
of a series of problems. The two main ones: Hack came down with the flu and the 
man who took over her signature-gathering did not live in the 41st District, 
which technically rendered the signatures invalid. 
</P>
<P>
 Hack notes that county election officials had previously told her surrogate 
signature-gatherer that he did live in the district. Still, she was not overly 
disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 "My concern is less elective office and politics," she said. "My concern is 
community service, and there's plenty to do." 
</P>

 AD CAMPAIGN: Laura Huxley's conference, "Children: Our Ultimate Investment," 
starts April 28. But the 82-year-old widow of author Aldous Huxley got off to 
an early start last week by staging a demonstration to denounce a jeans 
advertisement. 
</P>
<P>
 Her target was a sign on Sunset Boulevard showing a baby with a leash around 
its neck and the message, "A child is the ultimate pet." 
</P>
<P>
 "This depiction of children is the kind of thing which contributes to the 
abuse and neglect of children," says Huxley, a writer, therapist and lecturer. 
"(It) shows the lack of awareness people have about children's sensitivity and 
intelligence." 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, says Heiner Maasjost of Backer Spielvogel Bates Inc., the advertising 
company running the Joop Jeans campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a satirical interpretation of an attitude some people have in our 
society that use children as props," he said. ". . . The purpose of the ad was 
to put a mirror on the face of society to show that this is not right." 
</P>
<P>
 Huxley, who is organizing her conference on children this month to celebrate 
the centenary of her husband's birth, plans to urge a boycott of Joop Jeans.

BUMPS IN THE ROAD; TRANSPORTATION: REOPENING OF THE QUAKE-DAMAGED SANTA MONICA 
FREEWAY HAS EASED CONGESTION BUT REPAIRS ARE CONTINUING ON PORTIONS OF THE 
HIGHWAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Not everything was back to normal last week after the long-awaited reopening 
of quake-damaged portions of the Santa Monica Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Those who live north of the I-10 still found it hard to get onto the freeway's 
eastbound lanes at La Cienega Boulevard, for example, because continuing repair 
work there was blocking La Cienega's southbound traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an outrageous experience," scientist Aron Wolf said of the circuitous 
route he had to use to reach the eastbound I-10 -- and his job at the Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. "There are still pitfalls out there for the 
unwary motorist." 
</P>
<P>
 But the southbound lanes of La Cienega under the newly rebuilt -- and newly 
vandalized -- freeway bridge will be open by early this week, transportation 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 And what a relief it was to have all that extra traffic off chronically 
congested thoroughfares, not to mention the once-quiet side streets that became 
popular shortcuts during rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
 How much traffic was there? 
</P>
<P>
 A lot. The Jan. 17 earthquake severed the busiest freeway in the world, an 
elevated roadway that carried 271,000 cars a day across the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 During the time repairs were being made, traffic clogged surface streets, 
boosting the volume on east-west thoroughfares in some cases by more than 100%, 
according to city of Los Angeles traffic officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The highest percentage of growth -- 122% -- was measured on Jefferson 
Boulevard, which runs south of the freeway before cutting down to the beach at 
Marina del Rey. But the biggest numbers were counted on Pico Boulevard, where 
traffic swelled to highs of 55,600 cars a day at the corner of Robertson 
Boulevard, up from an average of 32,900 before the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the pain was eased by the introduction of extra-long east-west green 
lights, a move that won praise from commuters. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were just as many complaints from north-south travelers, and the 
timing is now virtually back to normal, with slight changes to allow for 
drivers who learned to like the idea of taking surface streets. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Tuesday, the daily flow along Pico was measured at 35,400, up a bit from 
pre-quake figures, said Tom Conner, assistant general manager of the city 
traffic department. 
</P>
<P>
 The computer that helps his staff manage traffic flows is programmed to adjust 
itself for small-scale variations, he said, and engineers want to do what they 
can to encourage commuting by way of alternative routes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want the freeway to go back to the old congested patterns because 
that also has an impact on city streets," said John E. Fisher, the city's 
principal transportation engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 The return of the freeway was immediately noticeable to business people like 
Reuven Nitka, manager-owner of Nagila, a kosher pizza parlor on Pico Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 With the parking lane outside his establishment eliminated between 3 and 7 
p.m., "it took people from just around the block half an hour to get here 
sometimes," he said Thursday. "It's much better now." 
</P>
<P>
 While the freeway was down, federal funds helped the city of Los Angeles 
provide special bus service from the Westside to downtown and back. It was only 
faintly successful, carrying between 200 and 300 commuters a day from the 
Veterans Administration compound at Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 But a deal has been worked out with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority 
to continue providing express commuter service for riders who have gotten into 
the bus habit, Conner said. At a cost of $1.50 each way, the service will take 
rush-hour riders back and forth along Olympic Boulevard or the San Diego and 
Santa Monica freeways. Schedules are available by calling (213) 485-7201.

TRAFFIC STOP FOCUS OF PROBE BY POLICE; LAW ENFORCEMENT: AFRICAN AMERICAN CHURCH 
WORKER CLAIMS HE WAS HARASSED BY OFFICERS AT GUNPOINT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Beverly Hills police are investigating an African American church worker's 
complaint that police pulled a gun on him and verbally harassed him during a 
traffic stop that did not result in a citation being issued. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident marks the second time in less than a year that an African 
American has claimed he was unfairly stopped by police in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Earthly, a handyman at All Saints Episcopal Church in Beverly Hills and an 
aspiring musician, says police stopped him on Jan. 7 after he pulled into a 
parking structure on Roxbury Drive while on his way to a doctor's appointment. 
</P>
<P>
 The 27-year-old Los Angeles resident says one officer demanded to know why he 
had not pulled over when police first began trailing him, and drew a gun when 
the church worker climbed out of his car. 
</P>
<P>
 Earthly asserts he had not seen police following him. He says the officers 
called him derogatory names, warned he would be shot if he moved and asked his 
reason for being in the city. After producing his car registration and license, 
he was told he could go, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Earthly, who has worked at All Saints since August, says police stopped him 
six times previously, but that the Jan. 7 incident was particularly 
threatening. He reported it to his supervisor, parish administrator Jean "Sam" 
Williamson, who passed word on to Rector Carol Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 The two church officials were scheduled to meet with Beverly Hills City 
Manager Mark Scott on another matter the same month, and they used the occasion 
to bring up the alleged harassment. Scott referred the matter to the police 
department for investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a terrible story. It's not the kind of thing that is supposed to 
happen," Scott said last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Lt. Joseph Lombardi says Earthly has been unable to identify the 
officers by looking at photos of the city police department's 128 members, 
adding that he had "come up with a name that may be a possibility." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're checking into that," Lombardi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lombardi calls Earthly "very credible." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very down-to-earth and a nice person," Lombardi said. "He never really 
(said) it's a racial thing, but I think he's looking at it that way. My only 
questions were why did they stop him, had a crime just occurred and did he fit 
(a suspect's) description?" 
</P>
<P>
 Earthly, a native of Louisiana, said he had not complained about other times 
he had been stopped and questioned by police while driving through the city 
because he considered the incidents minor annoyances. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to blow them all out of proportion," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lombardi describes Earthly's complaint as "pretty uncommon." However, last 
year Edward Lawson, a 46-year-old African American, complained that he, too, 
was unfairly stopped -- and then arrested -- by Beverly Hills police. 
</P>
<P>
 A civil-rights activist and actor, Lawson had been the subject of a landmark 
1983 Supreme Court ruling that individuals who do not appear to be involved in 
criminal activity have no obligation to carry or produce identification when 
stopped by police. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawson pursued that case after his habit of taking long nighttime walks in 
predominantly white neighborhoods in San Diego led to his repeated arrests on 
vagrancy charges. 
</P>
<P>
 He was stopped by Beverly Hills police on March 30, 1993, in front of the 
Beverly Hills apartment of a business associate and was charged with a trio of 
misdemeanors after police reported that he failed to produce a driver's license 
or other identification on request. 
</P>
<P>
 But last May, the charges were dropped in Beverly Hills Municipal Court after 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Lisa Hart agreed that "there was insufficient evidence to 
justify the stop of the defendant." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawson, a Venice resident, has said repeatedly that he believes racism was the 
reason police pulled him over -- a charge police deny. He was stopped after a 
Beverly Hills resident told police she saw a black man in a car with a license 
number similar to Lawson's vehicle in the vicinity of an elementary school. 
According to police, children had been sexually harassed at the school in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
 The police found no evidence that Lawson had behaved inappropriately near the 
school. After he was arrested, he said he had slowed down in the area of the 
school because he was required to do so by law.

PEOPLE: HELPING STUDENTS OVERCOME ROADBLOCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL CHASTANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A handwritten cardboard sign that reads "School on Wheels will be here Today" 
rests in her car's rear window. The seats are covered with books, toys, 
notebooks, stacks of paper and plastic foam cups. 
</P>
<P>
 Retired elementary school teacher Agnes Stevens apologizes for the mess. But 
she has more important concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past year she has organized School on Wheels, a group of 56 volunteers 
who visit three Westside homeless shelters to tutor students. Stevens, 58, got 
the idea for the program after working as a volunteer tutor at Venice's Coeur 
d'Alene Elementary School, where several homeless students are enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
 School on Wheels began tutoring homeless children last October at the Sunlight 
Mission in Santa Monica, the Salvation Army shelter in West Los Angeles and the 
Bible Tabernacle shelter in Venice. The program gets its name from its mission 
to drive anywhere volunteers are needed. 
</P>
<P>
 A soft-spoken woman who is totally absorbed when talking to a child, Steven 
said she wanted to do something to help homeless children "get the best 
education, given their circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 During the year it took her to put School on Wheels together, Stevens tutored 
youngsters at the shelters, earning the trust of officials and explaining the 
idea for her program. 
</P>
<P>
 "The shelters are very protective," said Stevens. "They're not just going to 
let anyone come in and run a program." 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent afternoon, Stevens and two new volunteers helped several youths 
with their homework. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Sunlight Mission, in a converted meeting room with large chunks of 
plaster on the rug, Stevens patiently worked with two students on their math 
and spelling. "Wow! You figured that out for yourself," Stevens said to Robert 
Guerrero, 12, working on his math. "I'm so proud of you," she added, smiling 
with the enthusiasm of a high school cheerleader. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know how to do my homework, and they said they'd help," said Robert, 
a budding artist. "(Stevens) helped a lot. She's really nice." 
</P>
<P>
 Usually a good student, Robert said he had fallen behind in the 7th grade at 
John Adams Middle School in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the children have endured major upheavals in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert, for instance, was sent to live with his father, Lou, about six weeks 
ago. They were unable to stay with Lou's girlfriend and have been living in the 
shelter for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeless children need and thrive on the attention they get from the tutors, 
said Patricia Feldman, the director of the Sunlight Mission. 
</P>
<P>
 "The parents are pleased, and the children's grades are starting to improve 
because of the tutors," said Feldman. Moving from shelter to shelter is 
difficult for the children -- and their grades often suffer, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 To launch School on Wheels, Stevens spent a year reading books and talking to 
teachers about the problems faced by homeless students. Friends staged a 
fund-raiser that provided $600 in seed money. 
</P>
<P>
 The program has a monthly budget of about $1,000 for books, toys, pencils, 
paper and, of course, gas. She covers the expenses with her pension checks and 
by tutoring private clients. Corporate sponsorship, she said, would be a big 
help. 
</P>
<P>
 Through word of mouth and a newsletter she started publishing last June, the 
tutoring staff has grown from a couple of friends to several dozen volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens screens and interviews the tutors and only accepts those with 
references. The volunteers include high school students and senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 New tutor Victor Sadiarin, 28, a salesman, spent his first session working on 
spelling with a fifth-grader named Cornelius. "He is so bright," Sadiarin raved 
about the 10-year-old. Sadiarin said he was going to "run out to a bookstore 
and buy some books for Cornelius. And I'm going to bring my chessboard, so we 
can play chess." 
</P>
<P>
 Sadiarin volunteered because when he was younger "there was someone who helped 
me. So I can do this." 
</P>
<P>
 Finding a way to keep track of the students and expanding School on Wheels' 
geographic area are Stevens' biggest dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have an 800 number, which we want to put on pencils and business cards and 
give to the families when they move," Stevens said. The idea, she said, is for 
the families to call the number to let her know how the children are doing and 
if they need help. 
</P>
<P>
 But the tracking idea, said Marina Barnett, a counselor at Coeur d'Alene 
elementary, may be too big a dream. School officials have been frustrated in 
keeping tabs on the children once they move. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if there is anyone who could do it," Barnett said, "it would be Agnes. 
She has such an indomitable spirit, and she is so sure it will be done." 
</P>
<P>
 Just helping the students now makes a difference, Barnett said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been a terrible neglect of these children," she said. "But it's the 
Agneses of the world that will change this."

COMMUNITY NEWS: WEST HOLLYWOOD: BICYCLISTS WILL PUT PEDAL TO THE METTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marty Starr knows pain. Every day, his overtaxed muscles tell him that, at 40, 
he's just not as nimble as he used to be. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ache all over," says Starr, a health insurance analyst at UCLA. "I get up 
in the middle of the night to stretch and then I'll go back to bed." 
</P>
<P>
 There's a point to his misery. Starr is in training for the California AIDS 
Ride '94, a charity event in which more than 500 bicyclists will pedal from San 
Francisco to Los Angeles during the first week in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the 500-mile trek has an added significance for Starr. The West Hollywood 
resident lost a friend to AIDS and has tested positive for HIV. Just this week, 
his roommate was admitted to the hospital with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a biker," admits Starr. 
</P>
<P>
 But since November, he has averaged 100 miles a week in training rides, 
sometimes through rugged mountain courses, and has followed a regular 
weightlifting and aerobics regimen. That he pedals on despite limited athletic 
gifts, he says, just proves his devotion to the cause. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would do anything in my power," he says, "to stop this illness." 
</P>
<P>
 Starr has raised about $5,000 in pledges so far. Organizers estimate that $1 
million will ultimately benefit the Jeffrey Goodman Special Care Clinic of the 
Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Community Services Center, one of the largest AIDS 
clinics in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The journey, which starts May 1 at San Francisco's Fort Mason, will snake 
along Pacific Coast Highway, occasionally darting inland to such sites as 
Pinnacles National Monument and the town of Solvang, the "bicycling capital" of 
California. The trip ends May 7 at West Hollywood Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizer Dan Pallotta, a professional fund-raiser, hopes that the ride, to be 
inaugurated this year, will become an annual event. To qualify, riders have to 
collect at least $2,000 in pledges. Pallotta says some participants have met 
that sum in one night at fund-raising parties held on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes the ride unusual is that 10% to 15% of the participants, like 
Starr, are HIV-positive or have AIDS. While the trip would be exhausting even 
to a person in the best health, doctors say it should pose no special hazard to 
an HIV-infected person. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not known what the effect of long-duration exercise is on the immune 
system and HIV infection," says Dr. Douglas Lowery, an assistant professor of 
emergency medicine at UCLA who is taking part in the bike ride and will be one 
of four physicians available to treat riders. "But it is known that a positive 
mental attitude and healthy exercise can benefit the immune system." 
</P>
<P>
 Starr concurs. He sees the ride as a chance to "re-channel" his anger over the 
disease and to memorialize his friend, David Lyon, who died of AIDS in 
November, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time he starts to lag, (Marty) thinks about David," says Bruce Bailey, 
a free-lance television producer. 
</P>
<P>
 The aching quadriceps have been worth it, Starr says. But the AIDS Ride is 
just a small part of a larger personal journey. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just going through the process of illness has made me a strong person," he 
says. "People say to me, 'You're not the same person you were a few years ago.' 
I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing, but I know I've come out a 
fighter." SCOTT COLLINS

COMMUNITY NEWS: VENICE: BATTLE LINES DRAWN OVER THE BOARDWALK; LANDMARK: HEATED 
DEBATE ON RENOVATION PLANS AND VENDING RULES IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE WHEN 
OFFICIALS TAKE UP THE ISSUE AGAIN THIS WEEK.

 Debates over the look of the Venice Boardwalk and what to do about illegal 
vending there will resume this week as Los Angeles recreation commissioners 
consider a $10-million renovation as well as ways to restrict sales on the 
walkway. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Recreation and Park Commissioners will meet in Venice on 
Wednesday to decide the next step in planning the renovation, the subject of a 
raucous public meeting two weeks ago. Two groups have proposed ways to use the 
funds, which were designated for Venice Beach improvement by county voters in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The board, which will meet at the Penmar Recreation Center at 4:30 p.m., is 
expected to approve a rough plan for allocating the money. But it will probably 
put off controversial matters, such as repaving the boardwalk with brick, until 
concluding a series of workshops aimed at mediating the fierce disagreements. 
</P>
<P>
 To be aired for the first time is a plan to close loopholes in the city's law 
restricting the sales of goods by political groups, charities and individuals 
who set up tables on the west edge of the boardwalk, which is city park land. 
</P>
<P>
 Past efforts to restrict vending have prompted outcries from artists and 
performers, who say the limits violate their constitutional freedoms and dampen 
the boardwalk's street fair spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission will consider testing a summertime program -- proposed by the 
Venice Boardwalk Assn. -- to crack down on illegal vending. It would limit the 
table size used by groups to six-feet-long and seek a change in city law to 
require that anything sold must bear the group's precise political or religious 
message. 
</P>
<P>
 Private boardwalk merchants complain that they are losing business to vendors 
who hawk everything from T-shirts to incense. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal also asks for a change in the municipal law to allow city park 
rangers to enforce the vending law along with police. 
</P>
<P>
 A city task force is still studying additional proposals, such as requiring 
permits for artists and nonprofit organizations to sell their wares. Performers 
would not be affected. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission will also take up the controversial renovation, the center of a 
debate pitting local organizations that favor brickwork and other features of a 
historical make-over against boardwalk activists and residents who oppose what 
they see as a lavish move to gentrify the funky tourist attraction.  
</P>
<P>
 A public meeting April 5 drew more than 200 people, many of them critical of 
the price of some renovations envisioned in a plan proposed by the boardwalk 
association and the Venice Action Committee, a group of neighborhood merchants 
and residents. Audience members interrupted rival speakers with hoots and calls 
to shut up. 
</P>
<P>
 Planners have recommended spending about $3 million to fix the closed Venice 
Pier, planning for which is already under way, and about $7 million for the 
boardwalk renovation. 
</P>
<P>
 They also suggest that the commission hire a Venice architectural firm -- the 
same one that developed the association's proposal -- to oversee workshops 
aimed at giving residents a chance to hash out details of the refurbishment. 
Thirty-two candidates were interviewed for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommended architects, Diana Pollard and Michael King, drew up the 
association's plan last year, free of charge. A leading foe of the plan, 
boardwalk activist Jerry Rubin, says it is unfair for the city to hire them to 
lead workshops and sketch a final design because of their ties to the 
association plan. King said the two would be unbiased in their work. 
</P>
<P>
 The association's design also includes installing antique lighting, restoring 
wooden-roofed pagodas and adding decorative trash receptacles to evoke historic 
Venice. The plan includes special performers' areas, a second bicycle path and 
the eventual demolition of the idle Venice Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents have said some of the features are too costly and assert that a 
brick surface is too rough for roller skaters, wheelchairs and strollers -- a 
complaint that the association disputes. A group affiliated with Rubin is 
promoting an alternative plan that excludes the brick and proposes saving the 
pavilion and creating a skating area, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
 The board will also consider soliciting proposals from nonprofit groups to 
restore the pavilion for community use. A group called the Venice Arts Mecca 
proposes raising $1 million to renovate the former theater and create a 
community theater and arts center that would include day care, a cafe and arts 
bazaar. KEN ELLINGWOOD

COMMUNITY NEWS: WILSHIRE AREA: POLICE STATION ON WHEELS GETS FUNDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Law enforcement: LAPD receives $95,000 in federal money for special project to 
help patrol crime-infested areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department has received a $95,000 federal grant to help 
pay for a mobile police station to operate out of the Wilshire Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that the station will cruise the entire division, but heavy 
emphasis will be placed on patrolling neighborhoods in Koreatown, where during 
the past year residents and business owners have become increasingly vocal 
about crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something should have been done a long time ago. Nevertheless, we think the 
mobile unit is a great idea," said business owner Yohngsohk Choe, an anti-crime 
activist and member of the Wilshire Division Community Police Council. "We need 
all the assistance we can get." 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilshire Division, which patrols part of Koreatown and portions of the 
Mid-City and Southwest areas, is the most violent of the four precincts in the 
department's West Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, the division logged 77 homicides, 132 rapes, 3,856 robberies and 
2,864 assaults, according to department data. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the mobile station will help the department reach out to the 
division's heavily immigrant residents, many of whom are afraid or unable to 
travel to the Wilshire station. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to create a lot more interaction with the community," said Sgt. 
Frank Hurtado, who coordinates the station's lead officers involved in 
community-based policing. "This will be a welcome addition in Wilshire." 
</P>
<P>
 Choe agreed. "Residents will have access to cops right in the problem areas," 
he said. "It's what community policing is all about." 
</P>
<P>
 Hurtado said the station will be a mobile home outfitted with department 
computers and telecommunications equipment. It will also have a small holding 
room where suspects can be processed. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal grant is part of the U.S. Justice Department's Community Projects 
for Restoration Program and will be augmented by a $20,000 from the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal grant was announced last week by U.S. Sens. Dianne Feinstein and 
Barbara Boxer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crime in Los Angeles is simply out of hand," Feinstein said in a written 
statement. "This mobile unit will be the fourth of its kind, working out of the 
Wilshire area community police station and focusing on the Koreatown 
community." ROBERT J. LOPEZ

HANCOCK PARK; AS URBAN WOES THREATEN, RESIDENTS OF THIS EXCLUSIVE ENCLAVE ARE 
FIGHTING TO PRESERVE THE STATUS QUO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 When the city threatened to sully Hancock Park's elegant ambience by proposing 
to install concrete light fixtures, residents sprung into action to keep the 
homely posts from being planted on their tree-lined streets. 
</P>
<P>
 To better accent their 1920s mansions and homes, residents wanted decorative 
light fixtures and told the city they were willing to pay the extra cost. 
</P>
<P>
 The homeowners prevailed. By the end of next year, new "ornamental, 
residential-style" street lamps will shine on every street in Hancock Park, 
while most other Los Angeles neighborhoods will have to settle for the standard 
steel or concrete poles. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign for new street lamps is one of the many battles that Hancock Park 
residents have waged and won due to their persistence and unabashed clout. But 
as the city continues to change and urban problems threaten to spill into even 
the most exclusive areas, jittery residents of Greater Hancock Park are 
determined to fight even harder to maintain the status quo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the years, the community has changed, but some things haven't," said Jim 
Wolf, president of the Hancock Park Homeowners Assn. "There still is a strong 
desire to preserve the neighborhood and maintain a certain character." 
</P>
<P>
 Bounded by La Brea Avenue to the west, Wilton Place to the east, Melrose 
Avenue to the north and Olympic Boulevard to the south, Hancock Park and its 
adjacent neighborhoods have long been an exclusive enclave for some of Los 
Angeles' most influential and well-to-do families. 
</P>
<P>
 Radical change had not swept Greater Hancock Park since the neighborhoods were 
developed in the 1920s. But once a predominantly white haven, the area is now 
home to thousands of new Asian residents, particularly Korean Americans, who 
have been lured to the area by its luxurious homes, reputable schools and 
proximity to Koreatown and Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 The influx of Asians, as well as some Latinos and African Americans, has not 
led to blatant racial tensions in this tony Central Los Angeles community. But 
longtime residents are greeting the newcomers cautiously, wondering whether 
they will make good neighbors and maintain that "certain character." 
</P>
<P>
 "By being in the neighborhood, you have a responsibility to be a good 
neighbor," said Sidney Adair, an attorney who founded the Windsor Square 
Hancock Park Historical Society. "There is a real sense of community that 
residents here want to maintain." 
</P>
<P>
 Greater Hancock Park, including Hancock Park, Windsor Square, Brookside, La 
Brea-Hancock, Larchmont Village, Fremont Place, Windsor Village, Wilshire Park 
and Ridgewood-Wilton, is at the heart of the city, but in a small-town setting. 
</P>
<P>
 Maintaining this cozy character has always been a priority for local 
residents, and they have gone to great lengths to preserve it. Whether it is 
crime, chain stores, panhandlers, traffic, high-rise buildings or any other 
so-called urban ill, Hancock Park residents are ready to rally against anything 
that threatens their serenity. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1978, area homeowners lobbied the city to establish a zoning ordinance 
prohibiting retail outlets and high-rise buildings along and near Wilshire 
Boulevard, between Highland Avenue and Wilton Place. The so-called Park Mile 
ordinance was created to protect the single-family nature of the area and to 
promote development that provides Park Mile with an "image and sense of 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 When city officials considered putting a subway stop for the new Red Line at 
the corner of Wilshire and Crenshaw boulevards, local homeowners were quick to 
voice their opposition. Because of their efforts and the potential for methane 
gas leaks in the area, the station is now destined for Olympic and Crenshaw 
boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, after longstanding complaints by members of the Windsor 
Square Assn., the Scottish Rite Masonic Temple, a Wilshire Boulevard landmark, 
was closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although its zoning permit allowed it to be rented only to nonprofit 
organizations and groups affiliated with the lodge, financial difficulties led 
the temple to rent the facility to commercial groups. Such actions angered 
homeowners, who complained to the city about parking, noise and trash problems 
at the temple. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people here are very politically aware and they have the know-how and 
savvy to know where to go and how to get things done," said Jane Gilman, editor 
of the Larchmont Chronicle, a monthly newspaper that covers the Greater Hancock 
Park area. "As a result, they've been very successful at getting things done on 
behalf of the community." 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that some of the city's most influential leaders live in the 
community also has enabled residents to get what they want. City Council 
President John Ferraro, arts advocate Dorothy Buffum Chandler, former 
California Secretary of State March Fong Eu and nearly a dozen consul generals 
from around the world live in the Greater Hancock Park area, and Hancock Park 
itself is home to the mayor's official residence. Past residents included 
billionaire Howard Hughes and entertainers John Barrymore, Nat King Cole, 
Katharine Hepburn and Mae West. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with being a hub for movers and shakers, the Hancock Park area is 
welcoming many new Asian families, both recent immigrants and those who have 
lived in this country for many years. 
</P>
<P>
 "For many residents in this affluent area, the replacement generation didn't 
come around, so the vacuum is being filled by Asians," said John Lim, a Korean 
American attorney and resident of Windsor Square. "For Korean Americans, it is 
the only affluent area near Koreatown." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, Asians made up 13.7% of the community's population. In 1990, that 
figure more than doubled, to 28.3%, according to U.S. Census figures. Of the 
area's roughly 40,000 residents in 1990, 42.6% were white, 6.1% were African 
American and 22.5% were Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the Korean families moving in own businesses in the Downtown area 
and want to be close to them," said Chun Kim, a Korean American realtor for 
Coldwell Banker on Larchmont Boulevard. "They also want to be near Korean 
churches and stores. You're seeing a lot of (white) sellers and Korean buyers." 
</P>
<P>
 The changing face of the community is best reflected in the changing student 
population at Third Street Elementary School in Hancock Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Third Street has always been attended mostly by neighborhood children. 
</P>
<P>
 About 56% of the 820 students now attending the school are Asian and Asian 
American, and most of them are Korean Americans. About 19% of the students are 
white, 16% are Latino and 9% are black. Ten years ago, the Asian and white 
figures were reversed, Principal Suzie Oh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarded as one of the best public schools in the city, Third Street 
Elementary is struggling to involve more Asian parents in its Parent-Teacher 
Assn. and other volunteer groups. About 90% of the school's PTA leadership is 
white, Oh said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most Korean mothers just drop off their children because they're so busy 
running businesses that they have very little time for anything else," said 
June Ahn, a Korean American PTA member. "Hopefully, as time goes on, we can get 
more Korean parents involved." 
</P>
<P>
 The involvement of newcomers is a topic that extends far beyond the local 
elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
 "On a one-to-one basis, the Korean people here are very nice," Adair said. 
"But they do not want to participate in the block parties or homeowners 
associations. They do not have the same sense of community involvement and 
giving back to the community as other residents." 
</P>
<P>
 But Kim said many Korean families work long hours and cannot participate in 
neighborhood activities. Korean residents want to get involved in the 
community, she said, but it may take some time before they feel comfortable 
mingling with other residents or joining neighborhood groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many work from 5 a.m. to 10 p.m. and they have no time for anything else," 
she said. "A lot of Koreans want to befriend their neighbors, but the language 
and culture barriers make it difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite complaints about their lack of involvement, Korean Americans and other 
minority residents say, for the most part, they have felt welcome in their 
neighborhoods. Until recently, Brookside resident Lourdes Montejano also felt 
welcome, but the strength of solidarity among her neighbors became painfully 
evident after a new paint job on her home failed to conform to community 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Montejano decided to paint her family's home a color called 
"Mexican straw." Although the yellow color turned out to be brighter than she 
hoped, she could not afford to paint over it. 
</P>
<P>
 "While the painting was going on, the neighbors told me I had to stop 
painting," said Montejano, who immigrated from Mexico as a child. "They said 
we're going to make the neighborhood look like a barrio, and that the price of 
homes in our neighborhood would go down. . . . I was shocked that a color would 
offend people so much." 
</P>
<P>
 Tensions between Montejano and her neighbors have since simmered, but she says 
the incident has made her feel leery of her neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think when people see that you're a minority, they'll try to take advantage 
of you, but when you can defend yourself, they'll lay off," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Owen Smith, president of the Brookside Homeowners Assn., said he was not aware 
of the controversy, but -- when told the details -- said he doesn't believe it 
was racially motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what happened is that there's kind of an unwritten idea that 
residents should keep the area looking traditional," Smith said. "There's a 
sense not to overpower the neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses and residents who don't blend in with the neighborhood have always 
tried the patience of those who prefer to keep the community traditional and 
conservative. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are certain characteristics and attributes of the neighborhood that 
residents and others recognize as being desirable, and residents want to 
preserve that," said Wolf of the Hancock Park Homeowners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Aesthetics and good neighborliness aside, it is crime that residents say is 
the biggest threat to preserving those characteristics. They talk incessantly 
about crime and how to combat it. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past six months, 140 robberies, 131 burglaries and 239 auto thefts were 
reported in the Greater Hancock Park area, which is about average, according to 
the Los Angeles Police Department's Wilshire Division. The figures were 
gathered from the Wilshire Division's reporting districts within the Greater 
Hancock Park area. Figures from the Hollywood Division, which covers a small 
area of the community, were unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some problems, but compared to other parts of the division and the 
city, crime there is very low," said Chuck Newman, a senior lead officer in the 
Wilshire Division. "But there is a disproportionate amount of fear there." 
</P>
<P>
 Crime is a big concern in the Hancock Park area, Newman said, because it is 
bordered by Koreatown and Hollywood -- two relatively high-crime areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the crimes being perpetrated in the Koreatown area are coming to 
Hancock Park," Newman said. "And I think the citizens are frustrated because 
they get substantially less police service than some other more busy areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Westec Security, a private security company, has more than 800 clients in 
Hancock Park. Another 800 of the company's clients live in Windsor Square and 
about 300 others live in adjacent neighborhoods, according to company figures. 
</P>
<P>
 "We respond mostly to burglaries and property crime in the area, but we've 
also seen an increase in violent crime, home invasions and carjacking," said 
Earle Graham, vice president of Westec's patrol and communication services. "We 
don't see a lot of tagging and graffiti." 
</P>
<P>
 Various Neighborhood Watch groups also have formed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Windsor Watch group formed during the 1992 riots, when some residents 
armed themselves to keep looters and rioters out of their neighborhoods. Though 
Koreatown and Hollywood sustained substantial damage during the unrest, the 
Greater Hancock Park area was barely touched. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot on the line," said Barry Greenberg, a resident of Windsor 
Square and member of the Windsor Watch group. "We're homeowners, not renters, 
and we've already seen the value of our homes go through the toilets. This is a 
fragile structure we're trying to maintain." 
</P>
<P>
 Like most of Los Angeles, home values in the Hancock Park area have declined 
in recent years, but realtors say the drop in home prices is mostly linked to 
the recession and not to crime. The median price of a single-family residence 
in the area is about $450,000, according to Dataquick Information Systems. 
</P>
<P>
 But the concern remains. Last year, a group of Larchmont Boulevard business 
owners hired a full-time security guard to chase away thieves and other 
troublemakers from the commercial district. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I basically keep the panhandlers away and make sure there's no trouble," said 
Mike Craig, the security guard assigned to the job. "Lately, there hasn't been 
too much activity, but I love this job because the people make me feel 
appreciated." 
</P>
<P>
 As he waves at merchants and shoppers along the boulevard, Craig acknowledges 
that his main mission is far more than chasing away the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to keep the atmosphere like it is," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, maintaining that atmosphere is of particular concern to those who shop 
and do business on Larchmont Boulevard. Lined with specialty shops, restaurants 
and a few banks and real estate offices, it is regarded as the community's hub, 
reflecting its preference for fine products, personalized attention and a 
small-town atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I go to Larchmont Boulevard, I get dressed for it," said Winifred Smith, 
a longtime Brookside resident and former president of its homeowners 
association. "I don't wear my hair in rollers because I know I'm bound to see 
someone I know. It's the type of place where if I go to the book store, the 
merchant will say, 'Here's a book I set aside that I think you might like to 
read.' . . . That's personalized service, and people here can afford that." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Larchmont Boulevard Assn. was able to enact limitations on the 
number of banks, restaurants and real estate offices on the boulevard, it was 
not able to stop a Payless Drug Store from coming to the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When the corporate giant announced it would be opening a store on Larchmont, 
residents were outraged and said it would threaten the economic vitality of 
other stores, blemish the boulevard's quaint atmosphere and attract undesirable 
people to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 To fend off critics, Payless, which opened last month, has tried to blend in 
with the neighborhood. Aside from a large sign outside the store, its facade is 
similar to other stores on the boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've made special efforts to provide the community with things they need," 
said Payless store manager Peter Irvin. "We're carrying items that we normally 
don't carry, like eggs and milk. And we have an old-fashioned ice cream bar 
where we sell ice cream for 55 cents a scoop." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there is bitterness. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to pretend it's not there," said Andrew J. Fenady, a television and 
movie producer who works in an office across the street from Payless. "I don't 
think it has enhanced the boulevard, and it doesn't provide the 
person-to-person relationship that other stores do. I also think the sign is 
abominable. It looks like it was made in a Boys and Girls Scout camp." On the 
Cover 
</P>
<P>
 Palatial homes that line June Street in Hancock Park hark back to a more 
gilded era in the city's history. Although property values continue to be much 
higher and crime is much lower than in neighborhoods bordering Greater Hancock 
Park, residents fear that urban ills are fast encroaching and eroding their 
quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an island in the city," said Winifred Smith, a longtime Brookside 
resident. ". . . And the people here are making a valiant effort to keep the 
community's identity as it has been." Greater Hancock Park 
</P>
<P>
 Although residents in the Greater Hancock Park community are unified by common 
concerns, Hancock Park is just one of the area's nine neighborhoods. Each has 
its own homeowners association and considers itself distinct from the adjacent 
neighborhoods. Ethnic Breakdown

<P>
 It's an unfortunate fact of life in Southern California: The next major 
earthquake could be centered under your town. What do you do if you live in the 
next Northridge? 
</P>
<P>
 If you reside on a particular street in northwest Pasadena, you swing into 
action. You know that block lieutenant Louis Jefferson will make sure than 
someone checks on Selma Stevens, 72, who is partially paralyzed with back 
problems, and her 73-year-old husband, Booker. 
</P>
<P>
 Block captain Henreen Nunley would immediately dispatch an able body to help 
another resident who lives alone and recently had triple-bypass surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Red rags would fly in the yards of houses where someone is injured; first-aid 
teams would be dispatched to those houses. A shrill whistle would signal that 
someone is trapped. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernie Duke and Michael Mims would make the rounds to shut off leaking gas and 
water lines all along the street. Emergency supplies could last the residents 
two weeks without any outside help. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to resident Bunny Wilson, she and her neighbors would have a fighting 
chance in a major earthquake. Wilson took one look at the trauma and confusion 
sparked by the Northridge earthquake and realized that the city and county 
could not provide all the needed lifesaving actions. Neighborhoods would have 
to fend for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "The worst can happen," Wilson said. "We think about the worst-case scenario 
and work our way backward. It's as if Los Angeles doesn't exist, that there is 
no fire department, no police department. . . . People are going to have to 
understand that if there is a major earthquake, we are on our own." 
</P>
<P>
 The 43-year-old businesswoman and mother sent out flyers and rallied neighbors 
to the first meeting of the Prepared Block Assn. on Jan. 29. Twenty-five 
members of the street's 43 households showed up. Since then, participation has 
grown to more than 90%. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort already has brought unforeseen benefits to this racially mixed 
street. A block of neighbors, who for the most part never knew each other's 
names, have found a new sense of community and caring for each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's filling a void in every neighbor's heart -- that they wanted to 
get to know their neighbors but didn't know how," Wilson said. "We have the 
best block in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 The block realized that preparing for the worst also meant providing for those 
like Selma Stevens, who might require help getting to safety, and for those who 
might need immediate emergency attention in the critical hours after the quake 
-- when the city is paralyzed with confusion and communications are 
inconsistent.  
</P>
<P>
 Organizers inventoried the block's strengths, weaknesses and schedules. 
Residents filled out forms charting household members, daily routines, special 
needs, and talents and tools that could be offered. 
</P>
<P>
 Households also plotted the locations of cut-off valves for water, gas and 
electricity. This information was distributed to the eight block lieutenants 
who are responsible for six- to seven-house sections, and the block captain. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with this information, the block association now knows who would need 
what, where and when in an emergency situation, and who on the block can get it 
to them. After the earthquake, the block lieutenants are supposed to assess 
damage and report to Nunley, the block captain, by two-way radio. Nunley will 
then dispatch search-and-rescue teams as needed.  
</P>
<P>
 When things stop shaking, and everyone's emergency needs have been met, the 
block has organized a security patrol to keep looters and criminals at bay so 
their "city within a city," can survive intact until more permanent rescue and 
recovery arrives. 
</P>
<P>
 Ardith Duke, a homemaker with a 3-year-old, said she was the type who would 
scream and run through the house in panic during an earthquake. Now she is a 
block lieutenant. "There's no fear because I'm prepared," Duke said. "Now, you 
just take action." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson and Nunley are quick to credit an outsider, Ted Wright, with helping 
the block transform from frightened to prepared. "We would have done what we 
were doing had we not met Ted," Wilson said. "What Ted Wright brought to us is 
expertise."  
</P>
<P>
 Wright is a British-born, self-described "back-yard survivalist." The spry 
71-year-old said he outlasted the Nazi bombings of London by living in a 
back-yard bomb shelter for seven months. The Lancaster resident had been 
preaching preparedness ever since a minor earthquake in 1980 made him realize 
that despite the London Civil Defense Force training he received as a rescue 
volunteer, he was woefully unprepared for a major earthquake.

SAN PEDRO; HARMAN JOINS THE FIGHT AGAINST HOMELESS SHELTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN WOODWARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 San Pedro community leaders and local politicians have enlisted Rep. Jane 
Harman (D-Marina del Rey) in their fight to stop a large homeless shelter from 
being set up on surplus federal land. 
</P>
<P>
 The shelter is expected to open on a 27-acre site on Taper Avenue after the 
Navy moves out this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman told a meeting of about 50 homeowners on April 9 that she may introduce 
amendments to the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act. The legislation 
gives homeless programs priority on surplus federal land. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the act ought to be changed and I will work with the (Los Angeles) 
mayor and others to get it changed, but that doesn't do anything for this 
particular issue," Harman said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was her first meeting with the San Pedro community since controversy over 
the shelter began last month. More than 1,000 protesters gathered at several 
meetings to oppose a project they say would dramatically change their 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman brought with her Department of Health and Human Services representative 
Judy Breitman, who reviews applications for surplus federal land. 
</P>
<P>
 Breitman fielded questions about how a South-Central Los Angeles homeless 
advocacy group, Turner's Technical Institute, was given permission to use the 
Taper Avenue site and buildings. She said the group had shown suitable 
experience and the ability to apply for program funding and "we had no reason 
to disapprove it." 
</P>
<P>
 The issue is not unique to San Pedro, she said. Other communities are angry 
about bases being transferred under the McKinney Act because the law does not 
allow for public discussion of the applications. Approval of the shelter does 
not mean it will be on the site permanently, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under department regulations, Turner's must have its program running in a 
year, provide a written report to the department every year and undergo on-site 
checks every three to five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council is expected to approve four recommendations by Councilman 
Rudy Svorinich Jr., who represents San Pedro, when it meets next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendations, which were unanimously approved at a meeting of the 
council's Intergovernmental Relations Committee last week, would allow the city 
to join lobbying efforts to ensure that the community is consulted on future 
decisions about federal surplus land. 
</P>
<P>
 Although opposition to the project is growing, Turner's has no plan to give up 
its application, director John Marzet said. However, Turner's will continue to 
work with Svorinich's office to find an alternative site, he said.

HERMOSA BEACH; PETITION DRIVE OPPOSES OIL DRILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BENNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Several Hermosa Beach residents opposed to oil drilling have begun a drive to 
put an anti-drilling initiative on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica-based MacPherson Oil Co. holds a lease from the city to dig 30 
wells at a slant under the city, in some cases reaching beneath Santa Monica 
Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Three residents recently notified the city that they plan to circulate a 
petition. Rosamond Fogg, a proponent of the petition, said the project would 
threaten Santa Monica Bay and the health and safety of residents, and would 
precipitate a series of similar projects along the coast. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents must collect 1,454 signatures by May 25 to get the initiative on 
the November ballot, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil company engineers expect the wells to produce 27 million barrels of oil 
over the next 25 years, generating as much as $104 million for the city under 
the lease. 
</P>
<P>
 The project was endorsed by the State Lands Commission last month and requires 
the approval of the California Coastal Commission. Donald MacPherson Jr., 
president of the oil company, said he hopes the company can begin work on the 
project by summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Hermosa voters approved two pro-oil initiatives in 1984. Fogg said voters were 
swayed by a gasoline crisis at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, oil prices are in the basement and the quality of the oil here is 
low," she said. JAMES BENNING

FOR SENIORS; AT 71, HELEN SIMOS STILL HAS A LIFETIME OF LIVING TO DO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA FELDMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The floor of Helen Simos' modest living room in Santa Monica is piled with 
travel books, clipboards filled with calendar events and handwritten notes of 
things to do. While the radio plays an old Eagles song, Simos praises thrift 
shops and the bargains she's furnished her apartment with. 
</P>
<P>
 For Simos, 71, freedom is another way to say there's a lot to do and she wants 
to do it all. She retired last year, but has remained busy. As always. She's 
always had an indomitable spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 Simos does not have a great deal of money. But what she does have is a need to 
live, rather than just survive. Too many women of her generation have allowed 
that spirit to die. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although Simos is out there with enough enthusiasm and zest to party every 
day, her life could easily have gone another way. 
</P>
<P>
 The eldest of six children of Greek immigrants, she grew up in a strict 
household in Ridgewood, N.J. All major decisions in the home were influenced by 
her father. His opinion mattered to her even as an adult. She sought his advice 
about her marriage, which she said had gone bad after 10 years. He told her to 
get out of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know anymore who I was," Simos recalled. "The one thing I did know 
was that I couldn't fake passion. That's what saved me. I was in my early 30s 
and divorce was such a stigma in those days for the woman." 
</P>
<P>
 She decided to leave her husband to live with her sister in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told my father, 'Pop, I can't take it anymore. I'm going to California to a 
psychiatrist.' I thought it was all my fault, and he said, 'You're the oldest 
of my children and I want your happiness.' " 
</P>
<P>
 That's all Simos needed him to say. "A big rock came off my back and I stood 
up straight. No one was there to belittle me. I got a checking account, my own 
credit rating, and I went to my boss of the electronic business I was working 
for at the time and asked him what do I have to do to get ahead. And then I 
made up for lost time," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simos never remarried but she had a lot of boyfriends. Many wanted to marry 
her but she demurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowadays, she has men friends to go dancing with, and although marriage is out 
of the question, she always dreams of romance. 
</P>
<P>
 "At my age, I don't want to take care of anyone. I like to do for people but 
not on a day-to-day (basis). Some of my friends have husbands who can't find 
their socks, for crying out loud. But if I met someone with my outlook and he 
said, 'Helen, let's go climb that mountain' or even brought over some hot dogs 
and a six-pack and took me on a picnic -- just surprise me, for goodness sake 
-- I'm going to jump (at him)," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Simos is not waiting around for that to happen. Besides planning a trip to 
Italy, she's gathering information for a safari to Africa and another visit to 
Portugal. Her big dream is a river-rafting trip down the Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year she went on a retreat in Northern California run by the 
Greek Orthodox church to get back to her ethnic roots. 
</P>
<P>
 She studied icons, Greek orthodoxy, music and slept in a convent. 
</P>
<P>
 Her everyday life, though, is connected to Emeritus College of Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 "Monday mornings, I study philosophy. What a good-looking guy teaching it. 
Monday afternoon, literature -- American short stories. Tuesday, gospel singing 
at the Calvary Baptist Church in Santa Monica. I love it!" 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday and Friday mornings Simos walks five miles with the Santa Monica 
Strutters, a group of seniors who take walks around Santa Monica Place three 
times a week. Wednesday afternoons, she's at the Farmers Market. Thursdays, 
she's at the Ocean Avenue Senior Center doing aerobics. "We dance to all kinds 
of music, shakin' it up a little. It's a beautiful spot to exercise and the 
teacher, Yvonne, is this big (Simos holds her hands six inches apart) and I 
love her," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday is her day to do errands and take care of friends who need help. She 
usually visits the library and borrows Billie Holiday or Maria Callas compact 
discs. This week she'll take out books about herbs. "I love libraries. I just 
like to go into them. I want to know about planting an herb garden. Someone 
told me about making these healthy drinks from basil," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes Simos has friends to go hiking with on the weekends. But many times 
she's alone, which doesn't bother her because she's always meeting people. 
Sunday she walks alone to the Venice Boardwalk to watch the action on the 
beach. "I never mind being alone. I stop for a beer, meet people. I find with 
young people if you make the first move they come right along. Sometimes I just 
say, 'Isn't it a beautiful day?' and a conversation starts," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Simos expects to live alone for the rest of her life, but she does not expect 
to be lonely. Her closeness to her brothers and sisters gives her the warmth 
that keeps her fire alive. She admits that if she was truly alone, without 
family, her life would be full of activities, but not necessarily with the love 
and history that only a family can give you. 
</P>
<P>
 "My sisters and brothers are the older generation now. There used to be always 
someone older and now we're the oldest. By God, I'm 71. What happened to 40? 
What happened to 50? How did I get to be this age?" she asks in complete 
wonderment. 
</P>
<P>
 People are always asking Simos for her secret formula for energy. For her it's 
not terribly complicated. Her family provides the warmth. Her women friends 
provide the sisterhood and the laughs. "We're all alike underneath," she says. 
"We let our hair down and you could wet your pants with some of the stories 
they tell."

TRAVEL INSIDER: BUCK UP, AMERICA: DOLLARS BUY MORE AGAIN IN EUROPE; CURRENCY: 
ITALY, SPAIN, PORTUGAL AND GREECE OFFER THE MOST VACATION FOR YOUR MONEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS, TIMES TRAVEL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most Americans heading to Europe this year -- and the European Travel 
Commission predicts that there will be a record 8 million of us -- will arrive 
with this question hanging somewhere in their heads: How far will our money go? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is far indeed, if your destination is Italy, Spain or Portugal, and 
if you're comparing this year's prices with those of last year and the year 
before that. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're bound for Greece or Turkey, the dollar's strong exchange numbers 
will cheer you up. But racing inflation has been grinding away at the drachma 
and the Turkish lira, and your dollars will be left with only slightly more 
clout than they had last year at this time. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, if you're bound for England, France or Germany, your 1994 dollars 
will carry essentially the same weight that 1993 dollars did. 
</P>
<P>
 On the whole, travel professionals and currency traders say, Europe remains a 
reasonable bargain, with lingering weak economies holding down inflation in 
most nations. European Union officials calculated that 12-nation group's 
combined inflation rate at 3.3% for the 12-month period that ended in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Wallace, a senior analyst for Ruesch International Financial Services, 
foresees a stronger dollar in coming months -- though as usual, jarring 
political developments could change that. 
</P>
<P>
 Rolfe Shellenberger, senior consultant for travel management firm Runzheimer 
International, suggests that "the banner year that they're going to have (in 
Europe) -- largely from U.S. money spent on tourism -- is going to help them 
turn around faster. I think they're probably at the nadir of their economic 
cycle right now." And as they grow, our dollars will buy less. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a quick look at the dollar's prospects in several popular European 
destinations, all scenery and character aside. The exchange rates quoted below 
come from Thomas Cook Foreign Exchange, as reported on March 25, 1992; March 
23, 1993, and March 22, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 (Travelers should keep in mind three important caveats. First, rates vary from 
one company to another. Second, you may get better rates at financial 
institutions in foreign countries, rather than exchanging money in the U.S. 
before you leave. And third, the rates below are those available to individual 
travelers. Other statistics, including the tables in this newspaper's Business 
pages, instead use the rates granted to currency traders dealing in $1 million 
or more. Those rates are usually 2%-5% more advantageous than the rates 
individual travelers get.) 
</P>
<P>
 In England, a dollar bought 55 pence two years ago, 65 pence one year ago and 
64 pence last month. Inflation ran 2.4% in the year ended in February. 
Runzheimer International, which calculates per diem rates for executives using 
first-class hotels and restaurants, in February, 1994, set its daily London 
figure at $315.85. (Keep in mind that the per diem numbers measure top-notch 
places in the center of principal cities -- some of the most expensive places a 
traveler can find in most countries.) 
</P>
<P>
 In France, a dollar bought 5.31 francs two years ago, 5.25 francs one year ago 
and 5.45 francs last month. Inflation barely existed, running 1.7% in the year 
ended in February. But Paris may never be cheap. Runzheimer's last per diem 
figure there, set in August, was $352.80. 
</P>
<P>
 In Germany, Austria, Belgium, Holland, Ireland and Switzerland, fluctuations 
of the dollar against local currencies have been relatively minor in the last 
year, and inflation rates have run at or below 3.4%. 
</P>
<P>
 Now to the countries that seem to offer larger bargains: 
</P>
<P>
 * Italy. In March, 1992, a dollar bought 1,178 lire. In March, 1993: 1,488 
lire. Last month: 1,570 lire. That's a 33% gain over two years. And if 
hoteliers and restaurateurs are racing to keep their tariff cards and menu 
prices up with those exchange rates, their efforts don't much show in the 
nation's inflation figures. Italian inflation ran 4.4% for the year ended in 
February, 4.5% for the year before that. Runzheimer cut its daily rate for Rome 
from $349.85 in August, 1992, to $259.25 last August. 
</P>
<P>
 * Spain. In March, 1992, a dollar bought 96.6 pesetas. In March, 1993: 107.7 
pesetas. Last month: 128.1 pesetas -- another 33% gain over two years, matching 
Italy. Spanish inflation ran far behind at 5% for the year ended in February, 
up from 4.1% the year before. Runzheimer, which assigned Madrid a $359.05 per 
diem figure in August, 1992, slashed it to $260.60 last August. 
</P>
<P>
 * Portugal. In March, 1992, a dollar bought 129.87 escudos. In March, 1993, 
137.63 escudos. Last month, 158.1 escudos -- a gain of 22%, while inflation was 
falling from 8% to 6.1% in the year ended in February. Runzheimer's per diem 
for Lisbon has fallen from $245.75 in February, 1993, to $192.40 in February, 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
 * Greece. In March, 1992, a dollar bought 172 drachmas. A year later, 200 
drachmas. Last month, 222 drachmas. That's a 29% gain, but against inflation 
it's 11% for the year ended in February, 14.5% the year before. Runzheimer, 
which was assigning Athens visitors $249.35 in February, 1992, adjusted that to 
$251.30 in February, 1993, and $259.15 in February, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 * Turkey. Turkey's economy leaves an outsider wishing everyone would just hold 
still for a moment. In March, 1992, a dollar bought 5,263 Turkish lire. In 
March, 1993: 7,874 Turkish lire. Last month: 19,231 Turkish lire -- up 265% in 
two years. Meanwhile, inflation advances at an estimated 70% per year, 
neutralizing nearly all of the gain. Runzheimer gave Istanbul a $221.40 per 
diem in February, 1992, cut it to $204.95 in February, 1993, then cut it again, 
ever so slightly, to $203.05 in February, 1994. Bring a calculator.

 Today, for the first time in its long history, the Amalienborg Palace in 
Copenhagen -- official residence of Queen Margrethe II of Denmark -- is opening 
one of its wings to the public.Highlights include the private studies of King 
Christian IX (1818-1906) and King Christian X (1870-1947) and the drawing room 
of Queen Louise (1817-1898), pictured, which is filled with original rococo 
pieces, late-Victorian furniture and family portraits and photographs. The 
porcelain chandelier was a golden wedding gift from Wilhelm II of Germany. A 
costume gallery and jewelry room are also open. Summer hours are 11 a.m. to 4 
p.m. daily. Admission is about $5.50 for adults and 80 cents for children.

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS; VAT -- A TAXING ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 VAT -- Value Added Tax -- is a sales tax with a difference: It's usually 
refundable to foreigners. To get refunds, travelers must make a minimum 
purchase per merchant and must have refund forms stamped by customs officials 
before leaving the country.Below are minimum expenditures required to obtain a 
refund, and the amount of the purchase price that is VAT. Must stores include 
the VAT in their price tags, instead of showing the tax separately, so it's 
easy to overlook how much money is going to taxes. For a free brochure, write 
or fax Europe Tax-free Shopping at its American headquarters, 111 W. Monroe

WEEKEND ESCAPE: OJAI; LOOSEN UP!; AT THIS RUSTIC HIDEAWAY, THEY SPLURGED ON 
PAMPERING WITHOUT SPENDING THEIR LIFE SAVINGS ON ACCOMMODATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANE HAITHMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is a great place to pretend you have more money than you've got. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea was to pamper ourselves: to spend a luscious weekend being fed, 
massaged, hot-tubbed and coddled for two blessed days and nights. To order from 
the wine list without peeking anxiously at the price (and after seeing it, not 
having to explain to the waiter why we were suddenly taken with a yen for a 
good bottle of Snapple). For once to be able to say -- after endless weeks of 
bargain matinee movies and pasta dinners at home -- "Money is no object!" 
</P>
<P>
 The problem was, money was an object: We needed more. And we remained 
stubbornly unwilling to bring our craving for self-indulgence into line with 
our somewhat modest budget. 
</P>
<P>
 So we decided to compromise. We would head for Ojai and spare no expense on 
cuisine, massages and other trappings of the good life. We would take a side 
trip to Wheeler Hot Springs to try out the hot-tub experience so highly 
recommended to us by recently married friends. We would visit Wheeler's 
casually elegant restaurant, and boldly order wine. And we would read the 
newspaper by cozy fires in the lobbies of the swankiest hotels in town. 
</P>
<P>
 But, we would do it all from a secret base: The Ojai Rancho Motel. 
</P>
<P>
 In looking for accommodations, we immediately crossed off cozy-sounding bed 
and breakfast places (which range from $75 to $100 a night), partly because 
sharing a bath was reminiscent of college dorm days. Also, most B&B's don't 
offer in-room fireplaces -- one romantic perk we felt we couldn't live without, 
since nights can get chilly here. 
</P>
<P>
 And we didn't allow ourselves to even think about pricey lodgings such as Ojai 
Valley Inn & Country Club, which offers rooms at $195-$260 per night. We also 
avoided the Oaks at Ojai, a spa that offers reasonable weekend "program rates" 
of $125-$169 per person per night, which includes all meals and a range of 
athletic facilities and activities. But a brochure provided by the Ojai Valley 
Chamber of Commerce discusses such goal-oriented options as 7 a.m. walks, 
"Creative Aerobics and Aquatoning," vitamin packs and diets. For us, that was a 
little too reminiscent of the workweek back in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily, friends steered us to the Ojai Rancho Motel -- a small, quirky 
establishment that sounds like it might be the motel Norman Bates managed 
before he got his own place. But we loved it. 
</P>
<P>
 For $85, you can get one of 16 rooms that Rancho management describes as 
"cabin-like," which we were told have beamed ceilings and "woodsy" interiors. 
But for $105, you can rent Rancho's only free-standing real cabin. Located at 
the back of the motel parking lot, this plain, large, clean and comfortable 
one-room cabin features a bed that seems only slightly smaller than a football 
field, as well as a view of the pool and Jacuzzi through the back windows. 
Because the cabin tends to be snapped up quickly, we reserved it about three 
weeks in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai Rancho offers nothing as sophisticated as room service, a restaurant, or 
even a bottle opener. The cabin does have a telephone, a TV and a small 
refrigerator. A motel brochure boasts a "fountain;" in reality, it is more of a 
sprinkler. But Regal's Wine and Cheese Store, a mile or so down the road, can 
provide you with cold cuts and cheese to eat in front of the fireplace, and 
they might even throw in some free avocados from the owner's tree. And, during 
a Saturday night rainstorm, we just ordered a pizza. 
</P>
<P>
 It's about an hour-and-a-half drive to Ojai, a half-rustic, half-New Age 
hideaway in a coastal valley below the Topa Topa Mountains, about 85 miles 
northwest of Los Angeles. On a Friday, it's best if you can hit the northbound 
101 before rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
 With the look and feel of Northern California wine country, Ojai seems much 
farther from L.A. than mere miles would suggest. Surrounded by citrus and 
avocado groves, as well as oak trees, the town offers a quaint main street with 
shops, taverns, cafes, and holistic book and crystal emporiums. Trolley 
transportation is available for 25 cents a ride. There are hiking, biking, 
horse and skateboarding trails. Also nearby is Lake Casitas Recreation Area in 
the Ojai Valley, offering fresh-water fishing and boating. And there are plenty 
of neighboring campgrounds. (If you send $5 to the Ojai Valley Chamber of 
Commerce, P.O. Box 1134, Ojai, Calif. 93024, you will get back maps and 
information on hotels, restaurants and recreation.) 
</P>
<P>
 After arriving on Friday, we took a 15-minute drive to Wheeler Hot Springs, 
located in a canyon six miles above Ojai at the bank of a mountain stream. We 
indulged in Wheeler's $72-per-couple dinner (not including wine, tax and tip) 
and hot tub package. 
</P>
<P>
 The package is available Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights. Also available 
is a hot tub and champagne brunch special for $45 on Saturday and Sunday. Hot 
tubbing at $10 per person per half-hour and massages ranging from $36-$78 can 
be booked separately from Thursday through Sunday. The spa recommends making 
reservations for the packages a week and a half in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 This lovely experience includes a half-hour soak in a dark, private redwood 
tub room, fed by naturally hot mineral waters. Each tub is equipped with 
hydrojets, and an adjoining cold tub (really cold) is fed by a separate spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, after being cooked medium-rare, we headed across the way to an elegantly 
rustic dining room with a huge fireplace to enjoy "California Mediterranean" 
cuisine which changes seasonally. We ordered (and shared) warm quail salad, 
buffalo mozzarella salad with tomatoes and artichokes, rack of lamb, filet 
mignon and light-as-air chocolate mousse cake and mango mousse cake. Warning: 
Watch it on the wine, and not because of price: After a 105-degree hot tub, a 
nice bottle of Merlot packs an unexpected punch. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Wheeler Hot Springs also offers massages, we decided to save them for 
the next day -- after a restful afternoon of wandering the shops, including the 
amazing Bart's Books, a used-book establishment with endless stacks outdoors 
and indoors, plus a very friendly cat. 
</P>
<P>
 There may be a local law that says you can't leave Ojai without getting a 
massage. The area offers all sorts. Many hotels have in-house masseurs who also 
welcome walk-in clients and the local paper and telephone directory list plenty 
of private massage therapists. Massages are also available in combination 
packages with body wraps, facials, hot tubs and saunas, and even brunches and 
dinners. Most basic massages cost $40-$60, but it's easy to run up the bill 
with extras. 
</P>
<P>
 We chose to stop by the Oaks for an "aromatherapy" massage, which combined the 
basic body kneading with a selection of scented oils such as lemon and 
lavender. We called Saturday morning for an afternoon appointment. During my 
session, the music of choice was a tape of wolves howling, which was relaxing 
in a hey-I-don't-mind-being-lost-in-a-dark-canyon sort of way. And the massage 
experience was a particular thrill for my companion, who received the ultimate 
compliment from his masseuse: "You don't feel like a lawyer. You are much too 
loose." 
</P>
<P>
 After a rainy Saturday we woke up to a sunny Sunday, so we took advantage of 
the fine weather to go for a two-mile morning hike, followed by a coffee shop 
breakfast. Then, we visited one of the treasures of Ojai -- 101-year-old 
ceramic artist Beatrice Wood, who holds court in her home and studio in Ojai's 
Happy Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 A roadside sign invites you to drop by. When we did so in the early afternoon, 
her young assistant showed us around her home -- packed with memorabilia of her 
worldwide travels -- as she chatted with two invited guests. We joined the 
conversation and the irreverent Wood -- who speaks casually of having Monet as 
a neighbor while studying acting in Paris -- canceled out the compliment that 
had been paid my companion by his masseuse by saying cheerfully: "Oh, you are a 
lawyer? I'm so sorry." 
</P>
<P>
 While there are no set visitation hours, Wood, oft-quoted as saying her two 
passions are "chocolate and young men," is usually available to discuss a 
flamboyantly romantic life that has included love affairs with French 
diplomat-turned-novelist Henri Pierre Roche and artist Marcel Duchamp. And she 
might even offer you a chocolate.

TAKING THE KIDS: FROM JUNK TO SOUVENIR TO TREASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EILEEN OGINTZ

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brass bugles hung from the stalls. Army medals, old-fashioned postcards and 
toys, World War I helmets and antique watches were laid out with a jumble of 
other junk and waiting-to-be-discovered treasures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't decide what to get," Matt confessed. Usually a reluctant shopper, he 
was enjoying himself immensely, darting from stall to stall comparing prices, 
questioning the gruff peddlers about their wares. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is that a real bullet," Matt asked one peddler. "From the Falklands War," the 
man responded. We walked on until Matt found just the "right" bullets. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, souvenir shopping with kids can be grim. "Shopping with a preschooler is 
not fun," acknowledged Chicago child psychologist Victoria Lavigne, whose 
specialty is young children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let them pick something and then leave, go get an ice cream cone," she said. 
If you don't want to buy something, explain that today is a "looking day" and 
that you'll buy something tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 Older kids are another matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The key is setting the ground rules before you leave home. Let the kids know 
how much they may spend. Some parents allow kids to bring allowance or birthday 
money they've saved and then supplement it with a set amount. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find when Christian is spending his own money, he's more careful about his 
choices," said Lynn Heistand, a Chicago attorney. In selecting an item, 
Christian is allowed "to follow his interests, within reason." The results are 
interesting: Last summer, the 10-year-old returned from Africa with a warrior's 
shield and sword. He hung them over his bed and took them to school when the 
class was studying Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Kids love artifacts they can touch, said veteran third-grade teacher Lynn 
Sperling, herself the mother of three children. One big hit in her class was a 
bleached cow skull from the Southwest. Another was cotton, still on the plant, 
from the South. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look for things that are different from where you live," she said. "You can 
read about the place you're going ahead of time and talk about what you're 
going to look for. It helps kids to focus." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, if you're going to visit historic places like Williamsburg, Va., 
search for old-fashioned toys. Or let the kids choose a replica of a famous 
site they've visited: the White House, the Golden Gate Bridge, the Statue of 
Liberty. Buy a children's book set in the region you're visiting. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephanie Shipow's kids came home from Montreal with souvenirs from an Expos 
baseball game and from London with Beefeater teddy bears. When kids pick things 
about the places they're visiting, said the suburban Los Angeles teacher, "it 
helps keep the trip alive for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Souvenirs don't have to be expensive to be meaningful. Bring back foreign 
money from another country and encourage the children to start a collection. 
Take an album or special box and then look for items they find interesting 
wherever you go: rocks, pins, patches, bumper stickers, pencils. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Weinberg started collecting matchbox covers when he was in high 
school. "I've got them from all over the world," said Weinberg, who is now 
director of the University of Minnesota's Institute of Child Development. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Foster's family collects T-shirts. "It's become a family tradition," she 
said. Even better, the kids don't expect to buy much else. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking the Kids appears weekly.

TASTE OF TRAVEL: ENGLAND: AFTERNOON TEASE; IT MIGHT SPOIL YOUR DINNER, BUT WHO 
CAN RESIST THESE LAVISH SPREADS IN AND OUT OF LONDON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN GIORDANO, Giordano is editor of Mary Mac's TeaTimes newsletter in 
Langley, Wash.

<TEXT>
<P>
 As we entered the quiet elegance of the Dorchester Hotel's outer lobby, I 
paused a minute to slip my flat walking shoes into my tote and don my dressier 
heels. The day was humid and the cool, soft greens of the lobby were soothing 
to my lagging spirits. I sank into a plump, cushioned sofa and ordered the 
Dorchester blend, which was billed on the menu as: "Grown in Sri Lanka . . . a 
broken orange pekoe tea with a delicate flavour and delicious bouquet." A short 
time and a few scones later, totally refreshed, we left the comfort of the 
Dorchester for a leisurely stroll along Hyde Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Afternoon tea in England is like that, as I was about to find out. 
</P>
<P>
 Growing up, I thought all families took tea. Not a full afternoon tea, maybe, 
but at the very least, a bit of bread and jam served with a "cuppa" when school 
was out for the day. 
</P>
<P>
 For my mother, who was born in Scotland, afternoon tea was normal and 
traditional. And for my sister and me, it was an honor to be asked to be 
"mother" for the afternoon and pour the tea. Just handling the equipage of 
silver sugar tongs and tea strainer transported us to another, faraway place. 
</P>
<P>
 It did not surprise any of our family and friends, then, when in 1992 my 
sister, Gail Jiles, and I began writing and publishing Mary Mac's (for 
MacIntyre) TeaTimes newsletter, which is dedicated to afternoon tea and named 
for our mother. Its success led to requests from many of our 3,000 readers to 
plan a tea tour to England, the birthplace of afternoon tea. 
</P>
<P>
 And so early last summer, my sister and I packed our suitcases, left our 
families and flew off to England in search of the perfect pot of tea. 
</P>
<P>
 We based our exploration in London but also reached out to two other places 
that are rich in tea culture. One of them was Devonshire, home of the cream 
tea. The other was a train trip northeast to Norwich for a visit to Norwich 
Castle -- home of the Twining Teapot Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 After a 3 1/2-hour ride on an unusually hot and steamy day, we arrived in 
Norwich and found the free public mini-bus that makes the short trip from the 
train station up the hill to Norwich Castle where the teapot museum is housed. 
Although the gallery is not large, perhaps 25 feet in length, it contains a 
collection of more than 2,000 ceramic teapots -- what is thought to be the 
greatest collection of British teapots in the world. (The entrance fee is about 
$3.) 
</P>
<P>
 The shapes, colors and designs were astonishing in their variety and many were 
hand-painted. One we saw was Wedgwood blue with cameos. Another had a handle 
made of a little white swan. There was one shaped like a lion's head; another 
was an Aladdin's lamp of cobalt blue porcelain; another in the shape of a fish. 
Committed tea enthusiasts like us would find this museum, and the pretty little 
castle in which it sits, well worth a day's trip. 
</P>
<P>
 On our return to London we discussed tea history, while we plotted our next 
few days. Although the British aristocracy had been drinking tea from China 
since the mid 1600s, afternoon tea with sandwiches did not become popular in 
England until the 1700s when it was created by royalty as a snack between lunch 
and dinner. In exploring this history, high on our list of places to visit was 
the Bramah Tea and Coffee Museum on the Tower-of-London side of the Thames 
River near Tower Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Bramah, who still holds court in his museum and loves to talk tea with 
visitors, was a tea and coffee executive who collected tea-related artifacts 
around the world, including Africa and Asia where he lived and worked. His 
modest museum houses his own fascinating collection of tea and coffee 
memorabilia, including antique tea pots and accouterments (mote spoons -- 
slotted spoons used to remove tea leaves from cups -- tea caddies, tea urns) 
and a wide variety of teapots that were purchased by Bramah or given to him as 
gifts over the past 40 years. There is a small gift shop and cafe where tea is 
sold both packaged and freshly brewed, although never from tea bags, which 
Bramah told me contributed to the downfall of the Empire. (I think he was 
kidding.) 
</P>
<P>
 Like Bramah's museum, Fortnum and Mason has a most serious attitude toward 
tea. They sometimes offer special clients a service that analyzes samples of 
local tap water and offers recommendations about the type of tea that blends 
best. They even sell a tea designed to complement New York City water. I guess 
the rest of us must content ourselves with brewing our tea the proper way, with 
bottled or other high quality water. 
</P>
<P>
 Buying tea on the ground floor of Fortnum and Mason's food court is almost a 
dizzying experience. The displays are spectacular; the aromas delicious. And 
afternoon tea, with a full complement of scones and sandwiches and sweets, can 
be enjoyed upstairs in the staid but lovely St. James's Restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Each afternoon of our trip was, of course, spent enjoying afternoon tea at one 
of London's great hotels. By far our favorite experience was at Claridge's, 
where Queen Victoria met the Empress Eugenie of France for tea in 1860. We 
could well imagine the regal pair in the magnificent Reading Room, where tea is 
served. Groupings of over-stuffed furniture offer as much privacy and comfort 
as possible. The room's marble columns and potted plants add to the elegant 
atmosphere. The price is about $23 per person and includes a choice of several 
marvelous brewed teas. 
</P>
<P>
 The service at Claridge's is personal and excellent. Formally dressed waiters 
brought each course to our table and carefully arranged each plate so that the 
decorative "C" on the edge was precisely centered. 
</P>
<P>
 The menu began with an assortment of tea sandwiches: salmon, cucumber, ham, 
egg with watercress and roast beef. This savory beginning was followed by hot 
scones with clotted cream and strawberry jam. 
</P>
<P>
 As our waiter offered us the scone accompaniments, I noticed a small silver 
pitcher on the tray. Curious, I asked its purpose. He responded by quickly 
dipping a spoon first into the pitcher of warm water and then into the clotted 
cream. The serving of cream slid easily onto our plates without the usual 
tapping necessary to release it. 
</P>
<P>
 A dessert trolley displaying trays of cakes, tarts and pastries was pushed to 
our table. By then our appetites had reached "elegant sufficiency" -- as my 
mother used to say to imply being stuffed -- but we relented and enjoyed a 
small sweet or two. After several cups of the excellent Claridge's house tea -- 
a Darjeeling blend -- the comfort of the soft cushions and sated appetites took 
effect. We felt pampered beyond description. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brown's Hotel was still to come. Our visit here turned out to be not just 
an eating experience, but a lesson in history. On the second floor, we peeked 
into the Roosevelt Room, where members of the Roosevelt family had been quietly 
and inconspicuously married. 
</P>
<P>
 We also saw the Niagara Room, where world leaders met to discuss the planning 
of the Suez Canal. Finally, we visited the Alexander Graham Bell Room, which 
holds the telephone Scottish-born Bell used to make his famous first call. But 
not all of the goings on there were historical. 
</P>
<P>
 When we explored the Claredon Room, we saw that it was set up for a group of 
prominent members of Parliament as a place to enjoy cigars and port after 
dinner that evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Afternoon tea is served each day in Brown's very English and slightly 
masculine dark wood lobby. We were not surprised to see a "tweedy" elderly 
gentleman taking tea alone, from the comfort of one of Brown's heavily brocaded 
chairs. He glanced at his pocket watch, which he removed from his vest, and 
timed the brewing. After exactly three minutes, he lifted the teapot lid, 
gently stirred the brew and carefully poured his first cup. 
</P>
<P>
 The afternoon tea itself was charmingly served on a three-tiered silver tray 
that held a selection of excellent sandwich rolls, toasted scones and rich 
pastries. 
</P>
<P>
 As at Brown's, simple afternoon tea usually consists of finger sandwiches, a 
selection of tea breads such as scones, plain or Madeira cakes, a variety of 
sweets and, perhaps, a special dessert such as English trifle. All of this is 
followed by pot after pot of tea. 
</P>
<P>
 In its main restaurant, Brown's also serves a high tea -- a meal that has 
traditionally been common among the working class of England and Scotland as a 
substitute for dinner. It usually includes a light entree, such as Welsh rabbit 
or steak and kidney pie, and is served at supper time, around 6 p.m. Brown's 
high tea is served from 5:30 to 6:30 p.m and is, perhaps, a little tonier in 
nature. When we were there, the "light entrees" were salmon fish cakes, chilled 
slivers of York ham, and a dish made of potatoes and cabbage that was served 
with a green tomato chutney. These were accompanied by scones and other 
traditional afternoon tea offerings. 
</P>
<P>
 Lest you believe that our entire trip was devoted to taking tea, we also 
visited the R. Twining and Co. tea shop, which has been in the same location on 
The Strand since 1706. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who are claustrophobic might want to think twice about entering. Long, 
narrow and rather dark, the shop is jammed with tea and tea accouterments of 
every description. But it is a treasure trove for tea lovers. Packed into 
floor-to-ceiling shelves on either side of the aisle, tea books, tea strainers, 
tea towels, teapots and, of course, tea, all seem to be fighting for shelf 
space. We thought we were familiar with Twining tea, but the variety available 
in this shop is overwhelming. (I recommend the Queen Mary blend, sold only in 
Britain.) 
</P>
<P>
 In the middle of this hectic whirl we again abandoned London and headed down 
to Devon. In Exeter we took a taxi to the village of Bickleigh and our 
17th-Century thatched-roof Cottage Country Hotel. The tiny nine-room hotel 
embraces the banks of the river Exe and is cradled in a colorful English 
garden. Just down the road was a local dairy farm and our first chance to enjoy 
an authentic Devonshire cream tea. 
</P>
<P>
 The farm grounds of the dairy included a small shop selling local arts and 
crafts (weavings and blankets and handmade pottery; hand-carved walking sticks 
and children's toys) and an even smaller tea room. We sat on the sun porch with 
blades of sun streaming in through the glass. We talked with other tourists, 
all of whom were British, as we sampled cream tea composed of two fresh hot 
scones, one fruited and one plain, a small plate of homemade strawberry jam and 
a dish of thick, yellow-gold clotted Devonshire cream. We added a pot of brewed 
English tea and pondered our cholesterol levels. Despite all this, the next day 
found us back on the train returning to London and ready for more afternoon 
tea. 
</P>
<P>
 Afternoon tea at London's famed Ritz Hotel was to be our final tea. World 
famous for its quality and service, this tea experience is considered by many 
to be the measure against which all others are judged. 
</P>
<P>
 We were somewhat disappointed, however. While the hotel itself is exceptional 
and the ambience of the Palm Court, where tea is served, is one of elegance and 
sophistication, we bridled at being served tea in unison with all the other 
diners -- making the tea service seem rather mass produced. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ritz Tea is served at 3 p.m. and again at 4:30 and is not begun until all 
guests have been seated. Everyone is served the same course at the same time 
and this continues throughout the menu. While the quality of the food was 
certainly excellent, we prefer the more personal, individualized service that 
we had received at Claridge's, Brown's and the Dorchester. 
</P>
<P>
 Other tea experiences: 
</P>
<P>
 * Often wonder how tea is served in an English home? A company called Heritage 
Touring arranges an opportunity to enjoy tea with an English family in Exeter, 
London, Bath, Salisbury, Winchester and York. Called Home Hosting, the service 
involves afternoon tea prepared by the host family and consisting of an 
assortment of home-made scones with clotted cream and jam, a selection of 
finger sandwiches and cakes and tea -- all complemented by the family's best 
china, table linen and conversation. About $17 per person. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Waldorf remains the only London hotel to offer a tea dance every 
Saturday and Sunday. Dating back to 1913, when so-called Tango Teas first 
became popular among England's aristocracy, the tea dance has a long standing 
tradition at the Waldorf. Step into the magnificent Palm Court and back in time 
to the rhythms of a live orchestra and waltz, fox trot and tango the hours and 
calories away. The tea dance is presented each weekend from 3:30 to 6:30 p.m. 
About $30 per person. 
</P>
<P>
 * Look carefully, behind that potted palm in the splendid Conservatory dining 
room, and you might spot the contented faces of Princess Diana, Princess 
Margaret, Prince Edward or Viscount Linley . . . perhaps even a rock star or 
two. The Lanesborough has become the place to partake of tea. Between 3:30 and 
6 p.m. each day, London's smartly dressed society crowd, even heads of state, 
can be seen sipping tea and buttering scones. 
</P>
<P>
 * Take tea on a Venice Simplon Orient-Express day-trip, as the train travels 
between Victoria Station and Folkestone, on England's southeast coast. Built 
during the heyday of the British railway system in the 1920s and '30s, the 
train cars have been faithfully restored to their original splendor. The trip 
departs from Victoria Station and includes a champagne lunch en route to 
Folkestone. After a leisurely stroll along the famous Leas coastal walk, board 
the train once again and enjoy a sumptuous afternoon tea as the train returns 
to London. About $245 per person. GUIDEBOOK: England . . . to a Tea

DESTINATION: SWITZERLAND; OLD TOWN, NEW MONEY; BUSINESS AND PLEASURE MIX IN THE 
PRISTINE LAKESIDE TOWN OF ZUG -- A LOW-TAX HAVEN FOR FOREIGN FIRMS THAT'S 
NEARLY TOURIST-FREE DESPITE ITS STORYBOOK SETTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The coffers of Zug were not always brimming with gold. For most of its 
700-year history, Zug (pronounced Zoog) was a poor little lakeside town 19 
miles due south of Zurich, notable only for its catastrophes. On three 
occasions, in 1435, 1594 and 1887, large tracts of the town built along the 
curve of shoreline suddenly collapsed and slid into Lake Zug, each time 
devastating the community; the first and worst of these fatal events, late one 
March afternoon after an early thaw, wiped out a third of the population. 
</P>
<P>
 But shortly after the end of the Second World War, the fortunes of Zug -- 
capital of a tiny rural canton of the same name -- improved considerably. Tired 
of being poor and eking out a hardscrabble existence from the land, the 
citizens devised and voted to adopt a bold fiscal plan, startling in its 
simplicity. Zug would lure foreign corporations, operating mainly outside of 
Switzerland, to their canton with the golden carrot of low taxation. Gigantic, 
multinational corporations (and small, private firms as well) would pay their 
taxes -- a fraction of 1% of their registered capital -- to Zug; the citizens 
would benefit by significantly lowered taxes of their own, and the 
infrastructure of the town and its environs would remain virtually unchanged. 
Most of the 10,000 foreign firms that are today listed in Zug exist in boxes 
smaller than a case of Dom Perignon. 
</P>
<P>
 And so Zug, conjuring money out of thin air, prospered. The millions and 
millions of Swiss francs that flow in from companies registered with names such 
as Gnomes Securities Workshops Ltd., Savoir Vivre Ltd., and variations on the 
theme of Prudential-Bache Securities and Salomon Brothers, have changed the 
face of the once-shabby town. 
</P>
<P>
 The glittering nugget at the center of Zug is its handsomely and expensively 
restored Old Town at the edge of the lake. Period-perfect 15th- and 
16th-Century houses, gabled and timbered, line this self-contained village's 
two main streets, the Unteraltstadt and the Oberaltstadt (Lower Old Town and 
Upper Old Town), and surround the wide, cobbled passage known as Fischmarkt. 
</P>
<P>
 One particularly beautiful restoration is the early 16th-Century Rathaus, or 
Town Hall. Its Parliament Room features richly carved paneling in the 
late-Gothic style and a courtroom dominated by a massive 17th-Century ceramic 
stove, decorated with scenes from Greek mythology. At the harbor, near a 
turn-of-the-century aviary of parrots, a handful of lively cafes circles the 
broad, cobbled plaza. Known as Landsgemeindeplatz, it has been a gathering 
place since the 15th Century, when male citizens voted by raising their swords. 
</P>
<P>
 Quaint and pristine, the Old Town is as perfect as a movie set. Even the tall, 
beveled-in-stone letters identifying the imposing polizei station on the 
Kolinplatz gleam with fresh gilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Hovering high above Old Zug, and offering a quick, accessible escape from life 
in town, is the Zugerberg, a grassy, bucolic peak. The summit, 15 minutes 
straight up along the narrow Zugerbergstrasse, can also be reached by the 
little red funicular railway that makes frequent ascents throughout the day. 
Dominating the top of the Zugerberg is an exclusive private school, the 
Institut Montana, favored by the sons and daughters of foreign nationals 
working in the canton. Just a few yards away, on the other side of the 
funicular stop, is a simple, seasonal hotel and restaurant, the Hotel 
Zugerberg. Its terrace offers a panoramic view of Zug and the lake framed by 
mountains fading into the haze. Spreading out below the peak, like a lushly 
textured dirndl skirt, are broad, sloping acres of fertile farmland. Cherry 
orchards, high pasture and meadows full of wildflowers form a patchwork, laced 
through with well-marked walking paths from peak to base. 
</P>
<P>
 A popular refreshment stop for hikers, and a very pleasant spot for lunch or 
dinner when the weather is good, is the Blasenberg, a farm-restaurant with 
red-umbrella-topped tables on a stone patio outside and a rustic dining room 
within. Here, in a charming, terrace-roof farmhouse decked with flowers, chef 
Angelo Limacher prepares such honest country fare as platters of air-dried beef 
from the Grisons, salad plates of wurst and cheese in a mayonnaise dressing, 
wienerschnitzel and his specialty: free-range roast capons, prepared to order 
with a reservation 24 hours ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Dotting the shores of Lake Zug, called the Zuger See locally, are small, 
pretty villages and hamlets that have become bedroom communities for executives 
working in Zug. In Cham (pronounced Hahm with a guttural first h ), on the west 
side of the lake, is the villa where the Nestle Corporation was born. (The 
giant food conglomerate began life in the mid-1800s as a condensed-milk factory 
founded by an American, George Page.) Cham is also noted for its beautiful 
shoreline park, often the setting for outdoor festivals and sculpture 
exhibitions, and for La Villette, a villa-restaurant now owned and operated by 
the town that takes full advantage of its wonderful lakeside setting. The 
reasonably priced food won't be memorable, but the view across thick green 
lawns sweeping down to the water, where sailboats glide back and forth in front 
of an Alpine backdrop, will be. 
</P>
<P>
 The Zuger See landscape is rich with intriguing dwellings and old inns nestled 
under the tall firs. In Cham is the majestic St. Andreas castle, built in the 
early 14th Century. Further along the lake, in the hamlet of Buonas, is the 
Schlosshof Buonas, a castle built by the Knights of Buonas in the 11th Century. 
Also near Buonas is the spacious white house -- owned by an aristocratic 
Englishwoman -- where Margaret Thatcher frequently vacations. You may encounter 
the former prime minister if you stop in Buonas for a meal at the Gasthaus 
Wildenmann in the center of the hamlet. This atmospheric old tavern features 
grilled or roasted meats -- appropriate fare at a restaurant whose sign depicts 
a wild man poised to club his dinner into submission. 
</P>
<P>
 With its storybook Old Town, the pastoral high country of the Zugerberg and 
the placid prettiness of the deep lake fed by Alpine streams, Zug would seem to 
be the poster-perfect stuff of a tourist's dream. But as it happens, there are 
virtually no tourists in Zug. More than 90% of the visitors who pass through 
the city are here on business, and more than a few have very likely never seen 
the top of the Zugerberg, or even the oriel windows of the Old Town. 
</P>
<P>
 Zug today, in addition to being a tax haven to thousands of foreign 
firms-in-a-box, is the thriving base of hundreds of dynamic, on-site 
corporations, both domestic and international, all drawn by the variety of 
factors that make Zug a fiscal lure: the lowest taxes in Switzerland, a central 
location in Europe, proximity to Zurich and its international airport, the 
stability of the Swiss economy, the confidence inspired by Swiss banks and a 
very pleasant lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 The third smallest of Switzerland's 26 cantons, Zug has the highest per capita 
income -- about $58,000 -- in the confederation. Among American corporations 
with sales offices or subsidiaries here in the canton of Zug are Nutrasweet, 
3M, Johnson & Johnson, Eastman Chemical and Hoover U.K. 
</P>
<P>
 Big business and foreign money have sparked the somewhat chaotic development 
of New Zug, a totally different, and significantly less charming, entity from 
Old Zug on the lake. Sprouting from the hills above the town, and rising from 
the sidewalks of the streets leading away from the railroad station, are 
clusters of mid-rise office buildings, apartment houses and shopping centers. 
</P>
<P>
 For the pioneer tourist to Zug, the town offers a good couple of days' worth 
of quiet pleasure, away from the tour buses, the loudspeakers and the 
camera-slung hordes rampant in Switzerland's more breathtaking destinations. 
With its travel trade geared to businessmen and women, however, the choice of 
hotels is less than exciting. 
</P>
<P>
 The best option is the City-Hotel Ochsen on the Kolinplatz in the Old Town. 
It's a historic hostelry built in 1480 with a guest list that had included 
19th-Century German poet Johann von Goethe; King Louis-Philippe, who abdicated 
his French throne in 1848, and Cardinal Borromeo, who visited Zug in 1570. The 
renovated lobby is a contemporary mix of copper, granite and terra cotta, while 
most of the 46 rooms are cloaked in a monastic palette of gray, brown and 
white. One recent guest described the decor as "luxury clinic," but the rooms 
are not quite so antiseptic. The best room is No. 305, a large double with a 
little round breakfast alcove set within one of the building's two oriel 
windows. 
</P>
<P>
 An alternative to the Ochsen is the Parkhotel, not far from the railroad 
station and the Metalli Center shopping arcade in the contemporary part of 
town. Sleek, bustling with business people, the Parkhotelhas a Hilton-esque, 
you-could-be-anywhere ambience designed to diminish culture shock in a foreign 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 For dining, there are several good restaurants in Zug and its environs with 
Old World atmospheres or memorable views. "Fish from the lake" are on almost 
every menu: They include felchen , a kind of whitefish; egli , or perch, and 
the Lake Zug specialty, ro tel , a trout. The most acclaimed kitchens in town 
belong to the Rathauskeller (closed for renovation until August), the Aklin, 
the Hecht and the dining room of the Ochsen, all in the Old Town, and the 
Rosenberg, a hotel-restaurant high above town on the Zugerberg, with a terrace 
overlooking the lake. 
</P>
<P>
 For a light lunch or dinner there is the Fischmarkt, a popular little bistro 
run by the owners of the Aklin. You can get a generous ham-and-cheese sandwich 
on a baguette, pasta and salads, or daily specials of veal, chicken or lake 
fish. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one meal in Zug should end with the region's most ubiquitous dessert 
-- the famous Zuger kirschtorte , a heady, moist, cake-and-cream confection 
that makes ample use of the cherry eau-de-vie called kirschwasser distilled in 
town from the local cherries. (Many aficionados believe that the kirsch of Zug, 
powerful, pure and intensely fragrant, is the best in the world.) At 
Christmastime the Zug post office is kept busy sending out the 35,000 
kirschtorte that have been mail-ordered from around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 Visiting the shops and sights of the Old Town will take up the better part of 
a day. The Museum in Der Burg -- with its collection of local art, history and 
culture -- is a large and impressively restored 12th-Century castle usually 
empty of people but full of well-displayed prehistoric relics, religious art of 
the 15th and 16th centuries, traditional handicrafts, furniture, clocks, 
costumes, armor and weapons. Nearby is the handsome Kunsthaus Museum where six 
to eight temporary exhibitions a year feature 20th-Century art. 
</P>
<P>
 You can take a private peek at the inner workings of the Zytturm, the 
15th-Century clock tower rising from the ancient town wall, by requesting the 
key at the police station. On one landing of the tower are two small wooden 
cages once used, in a less humanitarian age, as jails; on another landing are 
the exposed movements of the astronomical clock. 
</P>
<P>
 Down at the harbor, a short walk from the Landsgemeindeplatz, three excursion 
boats -- the MS Zug, the MS Schwyz and the MS Reje -- depart mornings and 
afternoons for cruises that crisscross the lake, making two brief stops at each 
coastal village. On a warm, sunny day the trip is a nice way to improve your 
tan, but the three-hour ride begins to drag after the first 80 minutes or so. 
Rather than staying on the boat the whole time, disembark at the little port of 
Immensee, have a dessert or a coffee or a tall, cool drink on the terrace of 
one of the harbor-side restaurants, and pick up the boat again as it circles 
back about an hour later. 
</P>
<P>
 Zug by day is percolating with activity and deals; Zug by night is not. After 
dark, this is a very quiet town. Most Zugers prefer to spend evenings at home 
with friends or family, going out only when there's a particularly intriguing 
performance at the lakeside Theatre Casino, a colonnaded pink-and-white edifice 
built in 1909. In season, between September and June, a wide variety of 
cultural offerings light up the hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The eclectic, worldly roster of performances, which also include opera and 
symphony orchestras, appeals to a sophisticated audience largely comprised of 
what local residents call "yoopies." This ever-growing segment of the 
population is generously augmented by young executives and their families from 
other European countries and the United States. Zug, old as it is and 
provincial as it was, is now a cosmopolitan "yoopie" town full of youth, 
optimism and a distinct sense of well-being. The money, so many dollars, yen, 
pounds, pesos, marks, francs, riyals and dinars melted into one pot, helps. 
</P>
<P>
 The spirit of Zug, and the Zugers, has grown open and friendly, unafraid of 
the new, the foreign, the different. In a country noted for its insularity and 
its cool reserve, Zug is a deep pocket of warmth. GUIDEBOOK: Discovering Zug

DESTINATION: ITALY; TROTTING THROUGH TUSCANY; A RIDER FROM THE BIG CITY 
DISCOVERS THE RUSTIC PLEASURES OF THE CHIANTI REGION, EXPLORED AT THE SPEED OF 
ONE HORSEPOWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE FRATKIN, Fratkin is a free-lance photographer and writer based in New 
York City. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The brochure promised breathtaking scenery, exquisite home-cooked meals and 
willing, courageous horses -- but nobody warned me about saddle sores. 
</P>
<P>
 When my friend Diane Cooper suggested I come along with her on a horseback 
ride through Italy's Tuscan countryside for one week last October, her 
enthusiasm was so catching that the inevitable consequence of such a long stint 
in the saddle was the furthest thing from my mind. So I called Equitour, a 
Wyoming-based riding company that was organizing her trip, only to be told 
participants needed at least one year of English-style riding experience. 
Living in a big city, I don't get many opportunities to ride a horse, but I 
swiftly swept aside their concerns that I might not be qualified, regaling them 
with tales of learning to ride during summer camp as a kid. Suitably convinced, 
they added me on, and I spent the next couple of weeks in a frenzy of 
preparation, gathering up all the gear I thought I would need for the challenge 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 After arriving in Florence and touring the city for three days, Diane and I 
headed to the Florence train station, where we had arranged to meet Jenny 
Bawtree, founder of Rendola Riding and host of our upcoming adventure. Our 
fears that we wouldn't spot her in the busy station crowd quickly proved 
unfounded when we saw a woman standing alone, waving a horseshoe 
enthusiastically in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 We introduced ourselves, handed over our bags and boarded the train for 
Montevarchi, a town about 20 miles south of Florence. Along the way, Jenny, who 
is originally from England, told us how she came to this part of Italy for a 
visit more than 20 years ago -- and never left. She impressed me at once as 
both serious and passionate about her horses, and it was plain to see that they 
were her primary concern, with the riders coming in a distant second, at best. 
Clearly, I would be expected to hold my own. Pushing all thoughts of cowardice 
and injury aside, I silently vowed that I would not let her down. 
</P>
<P>
 As our train pulled into the Montevarchi station, we could see Pietro Pinti -- 
driver, cook and guardian angel for our journey -- quietly waiting alongside 
the cherry-red company van that would take us to our new home. Twenty minutes 
over winding, narrow roads, through the tiny village of Rendola, population 49, 
brought us to Jenny's beautiful 17th-Century farmhouse and stables. We were 
given our rooms -- nicely furnished in a country style and with a private bath 
-- and left alone to wash up, unpack our things and meet with the other riders 
as they drifted in. 
</P>
<P>
 The dinner bell rang, and all nine of us sat down to a typical Tuscan spread: 
fettuccine in a fresh tomato and cream sauce, a delicious veal dish cooked with 
wild mushrooms picked earlier that day from the surrounding woods, fresh green 
salad, crusty bread and as much of the local Chianti wine as we could handle. 
It was a fabulous feast, and as I reached for yet another helping of 
everything, I wondered whether by the end of this week I would be trimmer from 
all the exercise or as wide as my horse from all the good food. 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning we gathered at the stables, eager to embark on our first 
ride. After much initial checking on Jenny's part to ensure the safety of both 
horse and rider, we set off. The first day we rode near Rendola so everyone 
could get used to the horses and, I suspect, allow Jenny to make sure we all 
knew what we were doing. We worked our way through the olive groves, tangled 
vineyards and lush, green woodlands of the Arno valley. Although it was all 
quite beautiful, I must confess that the bulk of my attention was dedicated to 
staying on top of my horse. As my muscles made hundreds of tiny adjustments in 
an attempt to find peace with all this new pain, I wondered if my illustrious 
summer-camp riding experience was ever going to kick in and help get me through 
the long week ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 After nearly five hours of riding, we returned to Rendola for hot showers and 
clean clothes. Feeling pretty good about myself for having survived such a long 
day in the saddle, dignity intact, I was soon brought down a few notches when 
Jenny pointed out over dinner that much longer, tougher days lay ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Turning my attention to the other riders, I asked what had led each of them to 
sign up for this trip. I was most intrigued by Stanley Craddock, a slight, 
gray-haired Englishman with a deceptively non-athletic style who, at 72, was 
the oldest member of our group. He seemed kind of shy at first, but when I 
asked him why he came on this trip he turned to me with a grin like the 
Cheshire Cat and said, "I always wanted to be a singing cowboy when I grew up." 
</P>
<P>
 The others were all from the United States, which I'm told is unusual; 
typically the tour groups are a mix of Americans, English and Europeans. 
Despite bouts of jet lag and the weariness of our first long ride, the dinner 
conversation became a whole lot livelier as the Chianti continued to flow. It 
was the perfect opportunity to get to know more about my ad-hoc family, 
including Stanley, a retired schoolteacher and skilled horseman who has taken 
numerous other pack trips internationally. He would serve as our unofficial 
guide during the trip -- offering advice about our horses and background on 
places we visited. 
</P>
<P>
 After that first day, we set off on the route that would wind through three 
provinces and eight villages in the Chianti Classico wine region -- a distance 
of roughly 100 miles traveling on dirt paths, on an occasional paved road and 
cross-country through fields and forest. Any traveler passing through would be 
hard-pressed not to see the commitment and passion the Tuscan people have for 
their wines. It was harvest time, and everywhere we went we saw people working 
their vineyards and presses, and when we stopped, they offered us samples of 
their wines with great pride. 
</P>
<P>
 Each day became another breathtaking variation of the last, as we steadily 
worked our way through vineyards and olive groves, up the forested slopes of 
Monte San Michele, the highest point in the Chianti Mountains, and back down 
through the wooded hills and ancient villages visited so long ago by Dante, 
Boccaccio, Machiavelli and da Vinci. We passed so many medieval castles, 
churches and abbeys that I soon began to feel almost hypnotized, as if the 
scenery was swirling all around me and I was standing perfectly still. 
</P>
<P>
 Every now and then we would take short breaks to enjoy the views and learn a 
little of the history and traditions of Tuscany. We stopped at the ancient 
village of Volpaia, with its castle, medieval hostel and famous wine shop. The 
horses took a break while we stretched our legs and counted the cats that 
seemed to be posted at virtually every window and doorway. 
</P>
<P>
 One night our horses were put up in the stables of a long-abandoned medieval 
villa called Torricella, where the renowned astronomer, Galileo was welcomed in 
his exile by the Baron Ricasoli, descendant of a famous powerful family who 
owned all the surrounding land. I looked up at the million or two tiny stars, 
imagining what he might have seen from the same spot. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day we rode on, passing endless rows of grapevines. All around us 
were the remnants of an era long gone -- ruins of homes, farmhouses and castles 
built when Florence and Siena were bitter feuding city-states that played out 
their battles on Chianti soil and where horses carried well-armed soldiers, not 
camera-wielding tourists. We encircled the 800-year-old Castle Brolio, home of 
the Ricasoli family, whose ancestor Baron Bettino Ricasoli invented the method 
for producing Chianti wine in the early 19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 The woods of Tuscany are thick with wild boar, the evidence of which we saw 
not only in cloven-hoof tracks but also in the unending stream of hunters, 
rifles at their sides, who closely followed them. Jenny had effectively quelled 
our fears about trekking through this area during hunting season by instructing 
us to sing loudly as we passed through the more popular hunting grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Because it had rained a few weeks earlier and the roads were muddy, our pace 
was slowed, preventing the frequent canters promised by Equitour's brochure. 
Indeed, Jenny's usual route had to be altered on a couple of occasions to 
circumvent washed-out bridges and knee-deep mud. Luckily, most of the rain had 
passed through by the time our trip began, and the one afternoon that found us 
riding straight through an unavoidable cluster of rain clouds also brought with 
it some of the most breathtaking landscapes we had witnessed all week. 
</P>
<P>
 Our usual routine was to ride for three or four hours in the morning, by which 
time we would be quite hungry -- and sorely (literally) in need of a rest. Just 
when I thought I couldn't possibly go another step, we would spot white-haired 
Pietro standing proudly beside yet another grilled lunch or picnic spread, 
red-checkered tablecloth laid out, Chianti uncorked and espresso pot steaming. 
One day when the temperature had dropped fairly suddenly, leaving us unprepared 
and shivering around the fire, Pietro rummaged through the van and pulled out a 
big bag of woolen sweaters, which he silently, almost paternally, distributed 
all around. 
</P>
<P>
 Evenings found us at various inns along the way. We stayed for two nights near 
the town of Radda at Podere Terreno, an Italian-style bed and breakfast built 
around a magnificent 400-year-old farmhouse. Our hosts, Roberto Melosi and 
Sylvie Haniez, excelled at both cooking and conversation. Meals were served 
family-style at one long table in front of a gigantic fireplace, surrounded by 
paintings, antiques and the many different types of wine made on their farm. 
</P>
<P>
 Riding on, we spent the next two nights on the outskirts of Siena at Il 
Poderaccio, a private villa with apartments offering spectacular views of that 
ancient medieval city. One morning had been set aside for strolling, horseless, 
through the walled confines of Siena. Although I had been looking forward to 
the change in our routine, I found myself growing impatient with all the other 
tourists and missing the pace that only riding along fields and trails on 
horseback can deliver. 
</P>
<P>
 On our last night back at Rendola I felt a mixture of melancholy and relief: 
The former because the trip seemed to end too quickly, the latter, saddle sores 
aside, because I had lived to tell the tale. We spent a busy evening swapping 
anecdotes and addresses with the other riders and writing last-minute 
postcards. 
</P>
<P>
 Back home, where friends check their date books before committing to a cup of 
coffee, it's easy to lose sight of how the rest of the world lives. In Tuscany, 
with its more relaxed pace, there was time to get to know the the local people, 
eat at their tables, drink their wines and weave our way, at one-horsepower 
speed, in and around their turf. GUIDEBOOK: Tuscany on Horseback

HIKING: SAN DIEGO: MISSION POSSIBLE AT MISSION BAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fun comes in many forms at Mission Bay, San Diego's mega-marine playground: 
swimming, sailing, water-skiing and cycling. 
</P>
<P>
 The walking is good, too. One option leads through marshland preserves -- an 
ideal opportunity to watch waterfowl. Southern California beach culture -- to 
the max -- can be observed from Bayside Walk on Mission Bay's west side. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Bay City Park is said to be the largest aquatic park in the world. 
About 25% of the 4,600-acre park, including the famed Sea World, is commercial. 
The balance, including more than 20 miles of beaches, is for public use. 
</P>
<P>
 My favorite Mission Bay walk begins at the Kendall-Frost Marsh Preserve, an 
environment of cordgrass and pickleweed that hints at how the whole bay may 
have appeared 100 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Directions to trail head: From Interstate 5 in San Diego, exit on Clairemont 
Drive. The Visitor Information Center is just west of the freeway. Follow East 
Mission Bay Drive, then Mission Bay Drive north to Grand Avenue, bearing left 
(west). Turn left onto Lamont Street and drive to the bay shore at Crown Point 
Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Your walk begins at the far (east) end of the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 The hike: Enter the fenced Kendall-Frost Marsh Reserve, sanctuary for the 
California least tern. Head southwest along the shell-strewn beach, passing 
water-ski takeoff and landing areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Your beach path passes below the Ingraham Street overpass leading to Vacation 
Island, and rounds Crown Point. On the far side of the point, stop to inspect 
the low eroded cliffs and the old (200,000 years by some estimates) sand 
dollars poking out of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Continue around horseshoe-shaped Sail Bay. The Bay Walk begins at Riviera 
Shores and offers a paved, parallel alternative to beach walking. 
</P>
<P>
 At Mission Bay Drive, visit the long-defunct Belmont Amusement Park, where a 
huge wooden roller-coaster, the Giant Dipper, still stands. 
</P>
<P>
 A good place to relax or unpack your picnic is atop the grassy hillside of 
Bonita Cove Park. 
</P>
<P>
 To extend your walk, continue a mile along Bayside Walk to the entrance 
channel to Mission Bay. Mission Bay Trail 
</P>
<P>
 WHERE: Mission Bay City Park. 
</P>
<P>
 DISTANCE: 2.8 miles round trip. 
</P>
<P>
 TERRAIN: Developed, undeveloped bay shore. 
</P>
<P>
 HIGHLIGHTS: World's largest aquatic park; good bird- and people-watching. 
</P>
<P>
 DEGREE OF DIFFICULTY: Easy. 
</P>
<P>
 PRECAUTIONS: On warm summer weekends, Mission Beach-area traffic can be 
horrendous. 
</P>
<P>

Park, 2688 Mission Bay Drive, San Diego, (619) 276-8200.

CRUISE VIEWS: COURSES IN HISTORY FOR STUDENTS OF LUXURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHIRLEY SLATER and HARRY BASCH, Slater and Basch travel as guests of the 
cruise lines. Cruise Views appears the first and third week of every month. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The stylish and luxurious little 80-passenger Aurora II, and its sister ship 
Aurora I, are two of the best-kept secrets in the cruise world. They sail to 
some of the most exotic spots on the globe, with naturalists and historians on 
hand to tell passengers everything they might wish to know about Cambodia's 
Angkor Wat or Ireland's Dingle Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 The ships carry a clutch of Zodiac inflatable landing craft to cruise past 
blue-footed boobies nesting on rocky cliffs in Mexico's Sea of Cortez, or to 
study the endangered Pacific Ridley sea turtle in Costa Rica. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a gala captain's party, open single seating in the dining room and a 
sophisticated singer-pianist for after-dinner dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 The only problem with falling in love with the Auroras is that they make it 
tough to plan your next trip. While most cruise lines provide travel agents and 
potential passengers with a brochure covering all sailings for the next year or 
two, the Auroras' parent company, Classical Cruises, sends out information one 
cruise at a time as it comes available, usually six to nine months before 
sailing. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason: Classical Cruises is the retail arm of New York-based Travel 
Dynamics, a leading cruise-charter company for museum and alumni group travel. 
Group charters take priority (they are usually arranged well in advance). Then 
Classical Cruises takes over the marketing on any given sailing with space 
remaining, or on any unchartered date. At that point, they send out brochures 
to travel agents and former passengers. All a prospective Aurora passenger has 
to do is get on the mailing list. Your travel agent should be able to help. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also possible to join an affinity group such as the Smithsonian 
Institution or the American Museum of Natural History to go on one of these 
lecture-intensive educational voyages, or join up with fellow alumni from your 
college or university. 
</P>
<P>
 A third way to book is through Tauck Tours in Westport, Conn. (tel. 
800-468-2825). The company has chartered the Aurora II this summer for sailings 
to Scotland, the Baltic, the Mediterranean and the Aegean. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aurora II has long, sleek, yacht-like lines, a trim dark-blue hull and big 
windows in all cabins except the lowest passenger deck, which has portholes. 
There's one owner's suite with two separate rooms and two marble baths that can 
sleep three adults or a young family. The suite costs about $525 a day per 
person, double occupancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are 16 large A-category cabins (about $350-$450 a day per person, 
double occupancy, depending on itinerary), with twin beds that can be 
electronically cranked up or down by remote control for reading or TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Each cabin has its own TV with built-in VCR, and the library has a full stock 
of feature films on video. A desk/dresser combination, mini-refrigerator, 
corner table with lamp, reading lamps over the beds, two overstuffed armchairs, 
two low chests, two large closets with folding doors and an especially spacious 
bathroom with marble counter, tile walls and tub with overhead shower make 
these comfortable quarters for two people. 
</P>
<P>
 Nineteen B, C and D category cabins are very similar, with lower prices 
because they are located slightly fore or aft. (Amidships offers the most 
stable ride.) Two considerably smaller E-category double cabins on the lowest 
deck provide showers instead of tubs and portholes instead of windows, and are 
listed at about $269-$367 a day per person, double, depending on the cruise. 
</P>
<P>
 Six single cabins round out the picture at $375 a day. Air/sea packages are 
offered for all sailings, with a group escort on hand every step of the way to 
handle any questions. 
</P>
<P>
 While we found both the food and service to be better than average, we were 
disappointed to find only very large tables in the dining room for six, eight 
or 10 people with open, single-seating, with no options for a couple who may 
wish occasionally to dine alone. 
</P>
<P>
 At most dinners the Austrian chef offered three main dish choices -- a meat, 
fish and vegetarian specialty -- along with a choice of appetizers, soups, 
salads and desserts. The wine list is fairly priced, with some choices for 
under $20 a bottle. 
</P>
<P>
 Breakfast is served in the cabins, the dining room and on the deck, the latter 
a quicker service of many of the same dishes. The stewards and stewardesses 
ladle out food from the buffet and carry plates to the table for the 
passengers, so there is little real self-service. They serve the increasingly 
rare midmorning bouillon, homemade cookies turn up every afternoon at teatime, 
and a pizza-and-Bloody-Mary pre-lunch party and full-scale barbecue dinner on 
the outdoor deck are scheduled during every cruise. 
</P>
<P>
 Lunches are usually served in the dining room or on deck when the weather is 
nice. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming up for the Aurora II later this spring: a 13-day land/sea itinerary 
departing Naples May 12 for Lisbon, calling in Tunis, Malaga and Casablanca and 
overnighting in Marrakech. A 14-day land/sea program from Lisbon to Glasgow 
follows on May 24.

DESTINATION: ENGLISH CHANNEL; CHUNNEL VISION; ENGLAND-FRANCE RAIL LINK IS SET 
TO OPEN MAY 6, BUT FARES AND SERVICE AREN'T YET ON TRACK 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For years now, the opening of the tunnel beneath the English Channel, 
connecting England to the Continent, has loomed as the most convenient 
development for visitors to Europe since the the jumbo jet and affordable 
trans-Atlantic air fares. Now the year of the $16 billion Chunnel has arrived 
-- but American travelers shouldn't count on seeing the inside of it this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 With the official opening date of May 6 drawing near, authorities concede that 
the Chunnel will be an unreliable resource during the peak summer travel 
months. They cite indefinite delays in opening service to the public, limited 
service in early weeks and pent-up demand for berths on the first trains. Tour 
operators won't be able to roll their buses on to Eurotunnel trains until 
January, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 And when travelers do board the trains, they may find Chunnel prices 
considerably higher than current ferry prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chunnel concept, which dates back at least as far as Napoleon, remains 
alluring: a 31-mile-long rail tunnel between Folkestone, England, and Calais, 
France, offering smooth subterranean rail passage in 35 minutes. Ferry rides 
across the channel take more than twice as long and occasionally require 
Dramamine. If the Chunnel promoters' timetables pencil out, travelers will for 
the first time soon be able to make a three-hour train connection between 
London and Paris. The Chunnel's promoters also insist that the tunnel will be 
so tightly policed that terrorists and stray rodents alike will find it 
impenetrable. (The British, whose island is rabies-free, have expressed great 
concern.) 
</P>
<P>
 But work is behind schedule. "The service at first is going to be very 
limited. It's going to be difficult," concedes a Eurotunnel spokeswoman. Major 
tour operators such as Trafalgar Tours say they're not even sure they'll start 
using tunnel trains in January, because no one can tell them what the price 
will be. 
</P>
<P>
 Many travel agents in the United States, recognizing those difficulties, are 
steering their summer customers toward time-tested routes of passage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, I wouldn't really recommend (the Chunnel) until there's a little 
more movement," says travel agent Juana Arenas of Horizon Travel in Glendale. 
"Maybe it would be something to check in on once you're there." (Arenas notes 
that the Chunnel is a low-profile issue in her office: "We haven't really had 
anybody request it -- and we have a lot of people going to Europe.") 
</P>
<P>
 For travelers, the most obvious difficulty is dealing with the repeated delays 
announced by Chunnel authorities: Though the official opening ceremony is still 
set for May 6, no passenger service is expected for at least a few weeks after 
that, and different services will almost certainly begin on different dates. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if opening dates weren't up in the air, there is also confusion over 
the two very different types of passenger trains that will zip through the 
tunnel. One type will carry travelers in their cars; another will carry 
travelers without cars. It doesn't simplify matters any that the latter of 
those two operations is a joint effort of British and European rail companies 
which, despite their partnership, snipe at each other like rival siblings. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a breakdown of who does what, when, and for how much: 
</P>
<P>
 * Le Shuttle will carry passengers who drive up in cars and buses (and on 
motorcycles), much as a ferry would. It is the service that was scheduled to 
begin operation first. But its trains will be more convenient for 
European-based tourists traveling in their cars than it will be for Americans, 
who will have to swap rental cars as they pass from country to country. (Most 
European rental car operations forbid or discourage travelers from driving cars 
of Continental origin, with steering wheels on the left, in England; or driving 
cars of English origin, with steering wheels on the right, in France.) 
</P>
<P>
 Le Shuttle's channel-crossings are expected to take about 35 minutes, with 
about 15 minutes added for loading. (Passengers are free to leave their cars 
and stretch their legs in the train cabins during the crossing, but passengers 
without cars will not be accepted. Hertz plans an adjacent office where 
travelers can swap rental cars; Avis has a similar program.) 
</P>
<P>
 Le Shuttle's leaders had planned to start carrying vehicles on May 8, two days 
after the tunnel's official opening date, but in March announced an indefinite 
delay. Le Shuttle plans to eventually run four trains hourly, around the clock, 
every day. But to begin with, representatives say, the service will probably 
offer one or two departing trains per hour. 
</P>
<P>
 The service, which will neither require nor accept reservations, has announced 
most rates. During May -- in the unlikely event that the service gets under way 
before the month ends -- round-trip fares for automobiles will run about $420 
every day. The price presumes an exchange rate of $1.50 per British pound, and 
is good for an unlimited number of riders per car. During the peak months of 
July and August, the figure rises to about $465 for departures on Fridays, 
Saturdays and bank holidays, about $420 on Sundays through Thursdays. In 
September and October the car fare falls to about $390; in November and 
December, $330. Further discounts are available September-December for 
travelers who will complete round-trip passage within five days. Motorcycle 
fares will be substantially lower than car fares. Bus fares, not yet announced, 
are expected to be substantially higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Special fares start as low as $187.50 round-trip for a heavily restricted 
introductory offer (departures Sunday through Thursday, June 5-July 21, returns 
within 48 hours). Though the service will accept no reservations, Le Shuttle 
representatives are compiling a list of travelers interested in buying 
vouchers. For more information, call (215) 741-5153. 
</P>
<P>
 * Eurostar is the company handling train service from London to Paris (312 
miles in three hours) and London to Brussels (about the same distance in three 
hours and 15 minutes). The firm, which unites BritRail and Rail Europe in an 
often-awkward partnership, has pledged to start service in July, probably 
beginning with four trains daily, increasing through the summer. Eventually, 
Eurostar plans to offer hourly departures on each route in each direction, and 
has forecast traffic of 14 million passengers -- 500,000 of them from North 
America -- in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Le Shuttle, Eurostar will take reservations. In fact, Eurostar 
representatives say they have already taken names of more than 12,000 travelers 
who want places on the train. (Eurostar has also been at work with Air France 
on a deal to allow travelers to pay a single price to fly one way and take the 
Chunnel the other.) 
</P>
<P>
 Eurostar remains mum on prices except for a vague promise they will be 
"competitive" with air fares and will fluctuate according to supply and demand. 
(Restricted round-trip fares between London and Paris begin around $175 this 
month.) More information is available from Eurostar partners BritRail (tel. 
800-677-8585) and Rail Europe (tel. 800-942-4866). 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, while Chunnel questions remain unanswered, a summer visitor can 
cross the channel at least half a dozen other ways. 
</P>
<P>
 The most obvious is to fly over it: London-Paris flights last just an hour, 
and are offered by a host of airlines. For those who want to see more 
countryside, there are various land-and-sea alternatives. The sampling listed 
below can be booked through BritRail's New York office (tel. 800-677-8585, 
often busy), which usually adds a $4 surcharge to the fare. All fares are per 
person for travelers without cars. (To transport a car across the channel by 
ship, catamaran or Hovercraft, fares vary by day, passengers and season. Call 
for details.) Travel agents may be able to suggest other alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 London-Folkestone-Boulogne-Paris via train and catamaran: Hoverspeed and 
BritRail offer rail travel to Folkestone, then catamaran passage to Boulogne, 
then a train to Paris, with a total travel time of approximately six hours. Two 
departures daily. Standard one-way fare: $138. Discount round-trip fare for 
travelers returning within five days: $140. Reservations are required. (The 
Hoverspeed company's catamarans are also known as SeaCats.) 
</P>
<P>
 London-New Haven-Dieppe-Paris via train and ship: Stena SeaLink and BritRail 
offer rail travel to New Haven, ship passage to Dieppe, then a train to Paris. 
Total travel time: about 10 hours. Two departures daily. Standard one-way fare: 
$88, excluding $7.50-$15 cost of space on a shipboard rest chair, which must be 
reserved upon boarding. Discount round-trip fare for travelers returning within 
five days: $125. 
</P>
<P>
 London-Dover-Calais-Paris via train and ship: BritRail service to Dover, a 
ship to Calais, a train to Paris. Travel time: about 8 1/2 hours. One departure 
daily. Standard one-way fare: $127. Discount round-trip fare for travelers 
returning within five days: $130. 
</P>
<P>
 New Haven-Dieppe via ship: Stena SeaLink ships cross the channel in about four 
hours. Two departures daily. Standard one-way fare: $45.

VIDEOS: THUMBS UP ON AUSTRALIA, DOWN ON BORA BORA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 EXPLORING TROPICAL AUSTRALIA (Rand McNally Video Expeditions Collection, 58 
minutes, 1993).  
</P>
<P>
 For those who have never been to Australia, the typical picture of this island 
nation is of arid deserts and acres of sheep, with a few high hills in the 
background. That's why Queensland's northeast coastal region can be such a 
surprise. It's a tropical land of rain forests with a wondrous variety of 
plants and animals, some found nowhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 This beautifully filmed video follows a tour group as it explores the rugged 
terrain of Daintree River, Lakefield and Eungella national parks, and the Great 
Barrier Reef Marine Park. A tour guide gives the history and geology of this 
unspoiled area. 
</P>
<P>
 Viewers travel along the Daintree River and see unusual fish and crocodiles, a 
black mangrove forest and an Aboriginal dance group. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1,200-mile-long Great Barrier Reef, one of the most diverse, complex 
ecosystems on earth, is a paradise for snorkelers and scuba divers. Viewers see 
gorgeous underwater scenes of some of the 1,500 fish species on the reef, 
including the graceful moray eels, clown fish, sea turtles and sharks. 
</P>
<P>
 Tapes are available from International Video Network, 2246 Camino Ramon, San 
Ramon, Calif. 94583; tel. (800) 669-4486. Price: $24.95 (plus tax and postage). 
</P>
<P>
 BORA BORA (Pacific Productions, 60 minutes, 1993).  
</P>
<P>
 Any film on Bora Bora, considered by many to be one of the most beautiful 
islands in the world, would probably earn space on a travel video library 
shelf. Unfortunately, the quality of this video relegates it to a bottom shelf. 
</P>
<P>
 The underwater sequences are relatively clear and lovely, but above sea level, 
the film quality is so dark in many places that details are lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Viewers first see this French Polynesian island from the air -- lush greenery 
surrounded by a reef, which encloses a brilliant turquoise- and 
amethyst-colored lagoon dotted with small motus (islets). The many 
water-oriented activities at the lagoon include scuba diving, fishing and 
sailing. 
</P>
<P>
 Viewers participate in a traditional tamaaraa (much like a Hawaiian luau) on 
the beach, with lots of food and dance. Other scenes show adventurous tourists 
feeding "friendly sharks" and walking atop a coral reef. Underwater film 
footage shows coral and plant life, colorful butterfly fish, turtles, moray 
eels, giant mussels, barracuda and playful dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
 Tapes are available from the Bennett Video Group, 730 Washington St., Marina 
del Rey 90292; tel. (800) 733-8862. Price: $29.95 (plus tax and postage). 
</P>
<P>
 SYMPHONY OF WONDERS (Reader's Digest Videos, 52 minutes, 1993).  
</P>
<P>
 This video transports viewers on a musical journey to some of "the most 
magnificent places on Earth." 
</P>
<P>
 The score harmoniously captures the mood of each destination by incorporating 
live sounds of man and nature. The opening scenes of Mt. Rushmore and the 
closing scenes of the Statue of Liberty are, appropriately enough, accompanied 
by the music of "America, the Beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 Using both aerial and ground photography, the camera films various sites in 
the ever-changing light of day and against dramatic sunsets. 
</P>
<P>
 Viewers see not only primary destinations, but are offered glimpses of the 
people of the area and surrounding scenery. 
</P>
<P>
 Architectural highlights include the Borobudur Buddhist shrine on the island 
of Java; St. Peter's Basilica during a Papal Mass in Vatican City; the Taj 
Mahal; Stonehenge, and the Great Pyramids. 
</P>
<P>
 Natural wonders include the vast sand dunes of the Sahara Desert; the roaring 
Iguacu Falls of South America; the native people and animal life along the 
Amazon River; Aboriginal dancers at Ayers Rock in Australia, and summer and 
winter scenes of the Grand Canyon in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 Tapes are available from International Video Network, 2242 Camino Ramon, San 
Ramon, Calif. 94583; tel. (800) 669-4486. Price: $29.95 (plus tax and postage).

MORE ON VISAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your charts on obtaining visas (News, Tips and Bargains, March 20 and 27 and 
April 3) were noted with interest since the San Francisco company credited with 
the information didn't bother to point out that consulates in Los Angeles may 
have slightly different rules or prices. This often happens among consulates 
for the same country in different cities. There is also frequently a legal 
jurisdictional situation that makes it necessary to secure visas in Los Angeles 
if you are a resident of Southern California.

GOLD COUNTRY

<P>
 Odd that writer Eric Malnic didn't mention the historic Fallon Theatre in his 
article on Gold Rush towns ("Mining Gold Country," March 27). 
</P>
<P>
 When the state bought Columbia, it reinforced the aged brick walls and tower 
of the theater, made other refurbishments and leased it to College of the 
Pacific (now University of the Pacific) for summer theater activity. COP 
students got an opportunity to act in three plays in six weeks, providing a 
stock experience not available anywhere in Northern California.

RESTAURANT RAVE

<TEXT>
<P>
 You missed the greatest restaurant in the Tucson area, bar none ("No Glitz 
Grub," April 3).La Roque, in Nogales, Mexico, beats all in Tucson. (I've eaten 
in all!) It's about 60 miles south of Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
 Big, big menu. A few Mexican dishes. Last time, two weeks ago, I had Gulf 
shrimp in light garlic. Others at my table had marvelous steak. Choices were 
about $10 each. Outstanding margaritas. 
</P>
<P>
 Park on U.S. side, 50 yards from border, for $4. Walk through border house, 
turn left, walk about 150 yards to restaurant at foot of cliff.

 This is both a thank you (the section is wonderful, I love it) and a 
correction. The letter from Anatol Charey on the bazaars in Istanbul (March 27) 
refers to a merchant's son who speaks many languages. The first language 
mentioned is not Latino, but Ladino (an archaic blend of Hebrew and Spanish).

MY BEST SHOT

<P>
 A family reunion drew Carolyn Frank of Mission Viejo back to Hawaii last 
fall.The Hawaii-born Frank was with her parents in Lahaina, Maui -- a spot they 
hadn't visited in a while -- and they were taking an early morning stroll. "I 
peeked in the door of a little seaside shop and was immediately struck by what 
I call the 'Cavalcade of Hats,' " says Frank, a schoolteacher and avid amateur 
photographer. "It was one of those quirk shots. You might take 50 or a hundred 
pictures and one turns out to be great."

RESTAURANTS; THE WINE LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dan Berger 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The best thing about the wine list at Russell's is the beer. 
</P>
<P>
 Wine is fine for many things, but some festive occasions call for arcane beer, 
and Russell's offers an array, from the sublime (Pilsner Urquell, the original 
pilsner, $5) to the absurd (Leifman's Franbozen, raspberry beer, $9, a 
must-try). 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five beers grace this list, from aperitif (Pink Triangle Select Light 
from Iowa, $4) to dessert (Rogue Shakespeare Stout, a bitter, chocolate-scented 
monster, $8). 
</P>
<P>
 There is also an odd wine list with some older vintages of great wines, some 
overpriced, some bargains (1984 Chappellet Cabernet Sauvignon, $28). For those 
who'd rather do upscale soda, there are four flavors of Sioux City, a boutique 
producer.  
</P>
<P>
 But beer seems the focus here, and the nice touch is that each beer has a 
comment about it, describing the expected tastes. The note on Buffalo Bill's 
Alimony Ale says: "The bitterest beer in America, just don't tell your spouse."

RESTAURANTS; THE GREATEST OF EASE; RUSSELL JACKSON'S ADVENTUROUS COOKING: A 
HIGH- WIRE ACT THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS NEED A NET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S. Irene Virbila 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whenever a touted independent film comes to town, I feel I should rush out and 
see it, doing my part to make sure it gets a good showing the first weeks it's 
in the theaters. I feel the same way about Russell's. The economic climate is 
such that few new restaurants venture from the predictable path. But behind the 
stoves at Russell's is a young chef who is daring more -- and daring it on a 
shoestring. Not everything works all of the time, but I'd much rather eat at a 
restaurant where the chef has lots of ideas and a real love of cooking than at 
a place where the kitchen sleepwalks through the same tired menu. 
</P>
<P>
 Russell Jackson is just 30, but he's already put in at least 15 years in 
professional kitchens, starting out at McDonald's and pizza joints and moving 
on to cook everything from regional Mexican and classical French, nouvelle 
cuisine, new American cooking and even Japanese. His career includes stints at 
the original Border Grill, Rebecca's and the Hard Rock Cafe, among others. At 
Russell's, just north of the Beverly Center, he's drawn on all this experience 
to create a very personal, eclectic menu. 
</P>
<P>
 For the moment, the only sign on the restaurant is a white banner with the 
initial R written large. The place is quite minimalist: two narrow storefronts 
furnished with white-clothed tables, simple black chairs, geometric sconces and 
a single tree in the window. The silverware is aligned at a precise, eccentric 
angle. First, a waiter in an ikat-dyed vest presents three large broadsheets: 
the wine list, the beer list and the soda-pop selection. When the dinner menu 
comes, it reads "night" and groups dishes under openers, greens, soup, middles, 
meat, poultry, fish and desserts -- even that is somewhat different. The 
service, however, is uneven. One night our waiter was warm and attentive; on 
the next occasion a different waiter seemed to forget all about us. 
</P>
<P>
 I loved the appetizer of tender goat cheese and a flavorful caponata of 
Mediterranean vegetables cooked down almost to a jam and layered with fragile 
pastry leaves to make a savory Napoleon. Fiery Fresno chiles stuffed with dusky 
mushrooms, dipped in pastry flour and fried, were terrific with a sauce laced 
with hazelnuts. House-cured salmon gravlax is paired with a sweet yam cake 
instead of the usual corn cake. Panzotti, stuffed half-moons of pasta came in a 
dark chile sauce so intricately spiced it was difficult to taste the duck 
filling. The galantine of Chilean sea bass was a pretty dish: rounds of snowy 
white fish in a slick of green basil oil with a fuchsia cabbage salad in the 
middle. The taste of the fish was so delicate it was virtually nonexistent, and 
the bizarre idea of putting vanilla rice at the heart of each slice of 
galantine took this promising dish over the top.  
</P>
<P>
 Jackson's salads are lovely, never overdressed, usually interesting variations 
on a theme. I especially liked the grilled portobello mushroom and artichoke 
salad drizzled with a light hazelnut vinaigrette. That, and the risotto of 
fresh corn and asparagus, is about as straightforward and simple as Jackson's 
cooking gets. He likes to pile on the techniques and revels in complex 
preparations, such as the lamb. For that, he makes a thick paste of annato 
seed, roasted garlic, tequila, lime -- some 15 ingredients altogether -- and 
marinates the lamb for up to seven days. He then roasts it just enough for the 
paste to adhere, chars the chops on the grill and serves them with a kind of 
raised masa -dough biscuit that tastes deliciously of sweet corn. 
</P>
<P>
 I enjoyed the duck in a Jack Daniels and whole-seed mustard sauce with a heap 
of earthy sauteed mushrooms and a molded orange-scented risotto, too. The 
smoked coletto steak, served sliced, with a pile of fluffy mashed potatoes and 
sauteed spinach, makes a fine supper. Next to all this, the pork chop in Port 
sauce seemed ordinary. But the salmon, in a shaggy jacket of what appeared to 
be potato filings, pleasantly surprised me with its lining of chiles.  
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to sweets, I get the feeling each of the few desserts is there 
because Jackson is genuinely enthusiastic about it. The wedge of brownie pie is 
satisfyingly fudgy and not too sweet; even better is his chocolate "marriage," 
a very dark chocolate bread pudding topped with white chocolate and set off 
with a vanilla-flecked creme anglaise. Order creme brulee , and you may have to 
call for help to finish the two cupfuls, one ginger, one plain. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson is attempting a high-wire act seven days a week. He doesn't always 
pull it off, but he's got enough good ideas to make him a chef to watch. So 
many of his friends and fans, in fact, have followed him here that some nights 
it can feel like a private celebration where party crashers are welcome. At 
some point in the evening, the cook will come out and introduce himself. And 
when he asks how your dinner was, you get the feeling he really wants to know. 
</P>
<P>
 Russell's Restaurant, 361 N. La Cienega Blvd., Los Angeles; (310) 659-3996.

ON THE RECORD: ENIGMATIC, UNSETTLING VOICE OF NIELSEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS, Herbert Glass is a regular contributor to Calendar. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Carl Nielsen (1865-1931) is one of those composers with a "following," which 
is to say that his case has always needed special pleading beyond the borders 
of his native Denmark and a relatively narrow circle of fans elsewhere, 
including some famous and otherwise hugely influential conductors. 
</P>
<P>
 The "otherwise" qualification refers in particular to Leonard Bernstein. If 
even he couldn't do much permanently to boost the composer's stock, perhaps 
Nielsen is doomed, if that's the word, to elude acceptance by a wide public. 
</P>
<P>
 Which isn't surprising, for if ever music was enigmatic and unsettling, 
Nielsen's -- above all in the orchestral works dating from the last decade of 
his life -- is. These symphonies and concertos are full of strange humors, 
quirky rhythms, odd modulations, lightning mood swings and a predilection for 
the menacingly macabre. Nielsen is not a composer you'd care to meet in a dark 
alley. 
</P>
<P>
 These thoughts are inspired by another of those periodic spates of recorded 
activity on the Nielsen front, spearheaded by a new set of his six symphonies, 
of which the last three are the most interesting to these ears, from conductor 
Neeme Jarvi and the Gothenburg Symphony (Deutsche Grammophon 437 507, 3 CDs). 
</P>
<P>
 These performances are radical in their simplicity: brisk, light in weight, 
texturally clarifying. It is rather as if the conductor and his responsive 
Swedish orchestra were out to divorce Nielsen altogether from the heavyweight 
late-19th-Century symphonic tradition, from which Nielsen, his equivocal 
attitude toward tonality notwithstanding -- he never leaves it altogether, but 
flirts with some distant borders -- didn't care to free himself. 
</P>
<P>
 With Jarvi, the timpani duel in the finale of the Fourth Symphony 
("Inextinguishable"), the composer's most frequently encountered, is not so 
much reduced in volume as in scale by means of an uncommonly airy background to 
all the foreground bashing and banging. 
</P>
<P>
 The spectacular Fifth Symphony, which pits a manic snare drum against the 
entire orchestral apparatus, with frequent interjections from a howling 
clarinet, is much more quickly -- and, again light-fingeredly -- dispatched 
than is the norm. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sixth Symphony, an enigma among the enigmas, with its slyly nasty humor, 
outer-space twitterings and primordial bubblings, takes particularly well to 
Jarvi's chamber-like approach without effacing memories of the darker, more 
threateningly edgy interpretation on Sony by Esa-Pekka Salonen and the Swedish 
Radio Symphony (a live presentation of the Sixth by Salonen and the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic is overdue). 
</P>
<P>
 Jarvi is up against formidable competition in the Fourth Symphony from a new 
release in which Gennady Rozhdestvensky leads the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic 
(Chandos 9260): deep, dark, ponderous yet with an unshakable rhythmic solidity. 
It's coupled with the pleasant, rather Brahmsian -- perhaps even Brucknerian -- 
First Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 And speaking of competition, it doesn't come any tougher for Jarvi and all 
other comers than that provided in the Fifth Symphony from Leonard Bernstein 
and the New York Philharmonic, whose harrowing interpretation of the early 
1960s returns in a pairing with the more friendly Third Symphony ("Espansiva"), 
and at mid-price, to boot (Sony 47598). 
</P>
<P>
 The dips, gurglings and twists that make the Sixth Symphony such a stimulating 
experience are reflected as well in the Clarinet Concerto, newly recorded by 
some superbly equipped, sympathetic Belgian artists: soloist Walter Boeykens 
and an orchestra called the Beethoven Academie conducted by Jan Caeyers, who 
seem as intent on projecting the score's usually overlooked lyric elegance as 
its wry, spooky humor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Concerto is part of an attractive Nielsen-overview program (Harmonia Mundi 
901489) for small orchestra that also includes the mid-period "Pan and Syrinx," 
the late "Love and the Poet" Overture and the early Little Suite for Strings, 
the last-named with no readily detectable foreshadowings of the original 
composer-to-be, but rather a delicious aftertaste of Grieg. 
</P>
<P>
 In each instance, Caeyers and his ensemble acquit themselves with highest 
distinction.

 The "Friends" listed in the billing are various sax or trumpet soloists 
sitting in with the MJQ -- John Lewis, piano; Milt Jackson, vibes; Percy Heath, 
bass; newcomer Mickey Roker, drums (replacing longtime drummer Connie Kay, who 
retired for health reasons a few years ago). Additionally, there are two cuts 
with singer Bobby McFerrin, including one on which he is joined by the a 
cappella vocal sextet Take 6. 
</P>
<P>
 It is agreeable, if less than startling, to hear the quartet surrounded by so 
many jazz eminences. The overall mood is low-key, with a couple of exceptions, 
including the upbeat passages of John Lewis' "Django," which is one of two 
powerful appearances by altoist Phil Woods (the other is "All the Things You 
Are"). 
</P>
<P>
 The tenor sax ballads are well-suited to Illinois Jacquet ("Memories of You"), 
Branford Marsalis ("Easy Living") and Nino Tempo -- "Darn That Dream," taped 
live at the Montreux Jazz Festival. Among the trumpets, Wynton Marsalis' muted 
contributions to "Cherokee" and "Willow Weep for Me" come off best; Freddie 
Hubbard and Harry "Sweets" Edison have little of import to say. 
</P>
<P>
 The MJQ itself, though a little stiff occasionally as a group, has its moments 
with Lewis' less-is-more piano, and Jackson reminding us that Bags' groove is 
as solid as ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three stars 
(good, recommended), four stars (excellent). LEONARD FEATHER

POP MUSIC CHARTS: FOR WHOM 'BELL' TOLLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

 Pink Floyd, performing in town this weekend, has the best-selling album, "The 
Division Bell," in the nation and in Southern California -- topping the Times' 
pop chart. Since album sales are traditionally strong for weeks after one of 
these extravaganzas leaves town, this album could be the chart leader for the 
next few weeks. As you'd expect, in the wake of Kurt Cobain's death, Nirvana's 
albums are selling big again. "In Utero" returns to both the pop Top 20 (No. 
19) and the hard-rock Top 10 (No. 4). "Nevermind" jumped back on the hard-rock 
chart at No. 8. TOP 10 ALBUMS 03,04,43,11 Title, Artist (National Rank) Last

 ** Phish, "Hoist," Elektra. As the underappreciated '60s band Spirit once did, 
this Vermont quartet incorporates a Hebrew prayer into the rock of its third 
major-label album.And like Spirit, Phish offers an idiosyncratic blend of chops 
and cleverness. Unlike Spirit, there's little depth of imagination or emotion 
to make it more than a set of quirky (and not very memorable) musical and 
lyrical twists.

 ** Yes, "Talk," Victory Music/PLG. Flowery melody is the hallmark of this 
comeback by the pop-oriented version of Yes.Most of the lilies are gilded with 
pompous arrangements, and the lyrics are a cosmic slop of portents and hazy New 
Age affirmations. Still, parts of the album are quite attractive and rendered 
with enough care and conviction to balance Yes' negatives.

 *** Casual, "Fear Itself," Jive. A dazzling debut by a 17-year-old rapper 
who's part of the famed East Oakland crew Hieroglyphics, which includes Domino 
and Del tha Funky Homosapien -- who both produced tracks here.Casual's zippy, 
improvisational style is backed by nifty, jazzed-up funk beats. Though 
admirable when flashing a social conscience, Casual truly shines as a strutting 
merrymaker -- indulging in spirited, old-school chest-thumping.

 ** 1/2 That Dog, "That Dog," Geffen. The singers in this L.A. quartet (which 
plays on Tuesday at the Hong Kong Cafe) use their incredible voices to lilt 
like the Andrew Sisters on downers, scream like spoiled kids and deadpan like 
affected punk-rockers.The blend of silly lyrics, dirge-like noise, pristine 
vocal harmonies and violin may be original, but that doesn't mean it's 
appealing.

collect dark, menacing and/or raw mood pieces for the movie (the revenge 
fantasy during whose filming Brandon Lee was accidentally killed) then this is 
a rousing success.New tracks by Nine Inch Nails, Rage Against the Machine, 
Rollins Band, Helmet and Pantera all fit the bill immaculately, with an 
ethereal elegy from Jane Siberry providing a nice closing cap.

THE WRONG LEAGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am writing in reference to your article in the April 3 edition titled "From 
the Halls of Ivy . . . to a Table at the Ivy," Robert Strauss' story about how 
Ivy League comedy writers have permeated the television sitcom market. I 
specifically mention the date since there seems to be an article on this small 
but apparently influential group every few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 In this particular article you quote from an episode of "The Simpsons" that 
pokes fun at these very same Ivy League writers. In referring to these quotes, 
one producer says "Conan (O'Brien) wrote that." As people may or may not know, 
many writers have a hand in a script, but this particular episode was written 
by yours truly. 
</P>
<P>
 It is rare for a television writer to have a credit to his name that can 
equally impress producers, agents and the odd relative back home. In my case 
this episode of "The Simpsons" is my pride and joy. So when I received phone 
calls asking if it wasn't I and not the handsome late-night talk show host who 
penned this episode, I felt compelled to correct this misleading statement in 
print. 
</P>
<P>
 I know my Ivy League colleagues will forgive me for taking issue with this 
credit, though I doubt they'll forgive me for not attending one of their 
institutions of higher learning -- though I wouldn't consider New York 
University chopped liver!

</P>
<P>
 What a bunch of BS! Your article on Ivy League grads and their 
all-encompassing knowledge of comedic television writing was, in itself, 
laughable. To imply that a Harvard grad has a better grasp of what's funny than 
a graduate of UCLA, Radford University (my alma mater) or any community college 
is as absurd and ridiculous as 90% of the crap on TV today. 
</P>
<P>
 The comment was made in the article that Ivy Leaguers excel at comedy writing 
"because we are overachievers." Excuse me? I put myself through college. I 
didn't have a rich Mommy and Daddy financing my college experience. 
</P>
<P>
 What's so disturbing about the Ivy League connection is that it creates yet 
another clique that people who are trying to break into the business, like 
myself, can't penetrate. It's too bad the industry of comedy/TV writing isn't 
an equal opportunity employer -- because there really is plenty of room for 
anyone with talent. 
</P>
<P>
 JEFF SABINI, Reseda

</P>
<P>
 Great. I've spent the last six years trying to establish some relationships in 
the industry in order to get work as a sitcom writer. 
</P>
<P>
 Just when I was making progress (my neighbor's brother's wife knows someone 
who knows someone who does hair on "Roseanne"), I now find out you have to be 
from an Ivy League school to get work. Hey, it's a long shot, but maybe the 
next trend in hiring TV writers will be really funny, talented people who don't 
know anyone in the business and didn't go to Yale or Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
 If so, give me a call.

<P>
 Your article on Ivy League comedy writers was enlightening. After watching 
"The Critic," "The Good Life," and "Conan O'Brien," I feel it's unfair to 
contend that these Harvard alumni lack sufficient life experience to write good 
comedy. They simply lack sufficient talent to write good comedy. 
</P>

 Astonishing! Sitcom TV comedy writers from the Ivy League! I wrote or co-wrote 
564 episodes since 1952 -- "Mr. Peepers," "The Real McCoys," "The Andy Griffith 
Show" and "MASH," as well as six comedy features.

IS IT REALLY ART? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding "In Cyberspace, Can Anyone Really Appreciate Art?" by Suzanne 
Muchnic (April 3): 
</P>
<P>
 Putting art on CD-ROM may be a good tool for scholarship and study -- I 
imagine how valuable it would be to call up all of Gauguin's paintings of a 
five-year period and compare them with his works of the next five years to see 
what type of discoveries he was making about space; I could access his 
writings, contemporary criticism; identify the location of the works; read 
excerpts from monographs, and I could do this with a multitude of artists -- 
what a tool! 
</P>
<P>
 Still, I am saddened by the article. First, it was so obviously concerned with 
money, from the capitalist making money off images of his collection to the 
talk of licenses and copyrights. Nothing was said of the limitations of the 
digitalized image. 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, here is the problem. I fear there is a great confusion when the sensual 
reality of a work of art becomes subservient to its worth as a commodity: How 
can a CD-ROM image show us the difference between the etched line, the engraved 
line, the graphite line, the sumi ink line, the line that is the fingerprint of 
the artists? The sensual methodology of an artwork is as important as the 
content. 
</P>
<P>
 I would suggest (despite current contemporary emphasis on social and political 
content) that it is the content. The experience of art is a transcendental 
sensual experience of human discovery. This best takes place in the presence of 
the work with all the subtleties of scale, color and touch, present as the 
artist intended, not digitized into a shadow of itself. 
</P>
<P>
 I do not think the mass marketing of electronic reproductions will "expand 
museum's audiences" in a meaningful way. I am afraid it will encourage the 
all-too-common behavior already readily seen in museums. The "famous" paintings 
get a quick glance of recognition before the visitor makes his way to the 
museum store for his reproduction fix. Only now he has more choices: a poster, 
a lousy video, a Van Gogh coffee cup or an art disc. 
</P>
<P>
 The only "appreciation" I can see is in the callous use of art for someone's 
profits to appreciate. Sounds like America.

 Before Bill Gates and his art museum leeches digitize and compress our very 
imaginations, there's a few technical and creative issues we should consider 
before buying one of their nobly produced fine art CD-ROMs. 
</P>
<P>
 As a multimedia professional waist-high in interactive entertainment (and 
loving it, really), allow me to clarify some of the claims they're feeding 
future consumers: 
</P>
<P>
 * Unless scanned images are high-resolution (more than 72 pixels per inch and 
in millions of colors), enlarged details will look jagged, similar to a faxed 
document. So much for nuance. 
</P>
<P>
 * The vast majority of computers cannot display more than 256 colors at a 
time. Even if the images are provided hi-res, only a fraction of existing 
computers will have the system and video memory to properly display them. 
</P>
<P>
 * No monitor displays colors perfectly, most not even close. Monitors can be 
calibrated, but the service or tool is expensive and the effect is temporary. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pirating will be a breeze. Unless the screen displays a giant X over the 
image, a pirate merely has to perform a screen "capture" to illegally copy an 
image. Any Macintosh or Windows system can already do this with a simple 
keystroke, no hacking required. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, not even my professional $10,000 computer system would do justice 
to these fine works. A typical $1,500 consumer model would fare much worse. 
</P>
<P>
 But from a creative -- dare I suggest spiritual -- perspective, let me just 
point out your same-day Page 1 story on the rebirth of good old-fashioned, 
pen-in-hand letter writing. This growing rejection of word processing should be 
a red flag to CD-ROM publishers who think consumers will embrace every new 
gimmick that sucks them closer to their computer. 
</P>
<P>
 At the risk of pulling out the rug from under my feet, I'm looking forward to 
a 6.8 interactivity shakedown.

TED & JANE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jane Hall's interview with Ted Turner ("We're Listening, Ted," April 3) 
contains the following remarkable, unsubstantiated political statement that 
cannot be left unchallenged, "The Vietnamese were innocent. We're the ones that 
started the war."It seems that Ted has succumbed to Jane's constant harangues 
and revisionist rewriting of history. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the United States' entry into the conflict in Southeast Asia in the 
early 1960s, the Vietnamese were far from "innocent," having, since the waning 
days of World War II, been subject to internal warfare. After U.S. troops were 
withdrawn in 1975, the peaceful Vietnamese, respecting borders, became 
embroiled in numerous excursions and conflicts with their neighbors China, 
Cambodia and Laos. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner's brilliance in business has been demonstrated; however, his political 
outbursts, mirroring Jane's ignorance, are a pathetic attempt at appearing 
politically correct while practicing censorship of the airwaves. 
</P>

 Regarding your interview with Ted Turner, I'd like to know if Jane Fonda was 
present, and if so, did anyone notice her hand move?

HOT PROPERTY: MAN OF STEEL LANDS IN HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 CHRISTOPHER REEVE, who played Superman in four movies between 1978 and 1987, 
has leased a Hollywood Hills home while in Los Angeles filming "The Rhinehart 
Theory." 
</P>
<P>
 In the movie, Reeve plays a detective who double-crosses his wife and brother, 
who are having an affair, and murders them in a case solved by another 
detective, Rhinehart, played by Joe Mantegna. 
</P>
<P>
 An avid sailor who grew up in Manhattan and raced boats down the Jersey shore, 
Reeve portrayed a 19th-Century literary critic who goes to sea in TNT's "The 
Sea Wolf" (1993). Last year, he also played the American millionaire in "The 
Remains of the Day" and starred as an ex-con who answers an ad for a husband in 
"Morning Glory." 
</P>
<P>
 Reeve, 41, is married with three children, two from a previous relationship. 
He lives most of the time in a 19th-Century farmhouse in Bedford, N.Y., and in 
a Massachusetts country estate. 
</P>
<P>
 A stage actor since he was a teen-ager, with an English literature degree from 
Cornell University and drama school credentials from Juilliard, Reeve regularly 
does summer stints at the Williamstown Theatre Festival in Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hollywood Hills home, which he leased furnished for at least a couple of 
months at $9,000 a month, has four bedrooms in about 4,000 square feet. 
Described as "an entertainer's dream," the Mediterranean-style home has a 
billiard room, bar, patio, pool, gourmet kitchen, sunken living room and city 
views. 
</P>
<P>
 Reeve was represented in the lease by Michael H. Barton of Nourmand & 
Associates, Beverly Hills. Rene of Paris, a Van Nuys wig maker to such stars as 
Dolly Parton and Cher, owns the house. The lessor was represented by Susan Del 
Prete of Coldwell Banker, Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 LISA STRAWBERRY, former wife of controversial Dodgers player Darryl 
Strawberry, has listed the Encino home, which they had purchased in 1989, for 
sale at just under $1 million and for lease at $4,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 The super-slugger, who signed a five-year, $20.3-million contract with the 
Dodgers before the 1991 season, was put on his team's disabled list this month 
after he admitted having a substance-abuse problem. 
</P>
<P>
 His ex-wife has indicated that she decided to sell the Encino house, which 
they purchased a month before she filed for divorce, because her privacy has 
been invaded by fans and the media. The 32-year-old outfielder was remarried 
last December. 
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1989 and recently refurbished, the Encino house is in a gated 
community and has five bedrooms in about 4,000 square feet. Dee Crawford, wife 
of former Dodgers outfielder Willie Crawford, has the listing at Fred Sands' 
Brentwood office. 
</P>
<P>
 Actress FAYE DUNAWAY has leased out her Beverly Hills home to some victims of 
the Northridge earthquake and is renting a smaller place on the Westside. She 
is being discussed as a possible successor to Glenn Close in the role of Norma 
Desmond in the L.A. production of "Sunset Boulevard." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunaway had put her home of three years on the market in December at $2.2 
million, saying that she wanted to become more bicoastal. Instead of selling 
the four-bedroom house and guest cottage, she leased it out at close to $10,000 
a month, and she rented more low-key quarters at about $2,000 a month, a source 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 TOM SULLIVAN, the blind singer and songwriter who became a motivational 
speaker with the publication of his 1975 best-selling autobiography "If You 
Could See What I Hear" (which was made into a movie), has sold his house in 
Palos Verdes Estates for $1.37 million, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan's most recent book, "The Leading Lady," is about a seeing-eye dog he 
gave to actress and animal activist Betty White, who co-wrote the book. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan and his wife, Patty, moved to a small town just outside of Denver so 
that he wouldn't need to travel as far when he has East Coast speaking 
engagements. 
</P>
<P>
 Their five-bedroom, 4,600-square-foot Palos Verdes home, which they had built 
almost six years ago, was sold to a Japanese-based computer company for use by 
its executives, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sullivans, who had lived on the Palos Verdes Peninsula for about 20 years 
-- raising their two children there, also own a couple of acres just outside of 
Winterpark, Colo., where they plan to build a ski getaway. 
</P>
<P>
 "He skis and plays golf. About the only thing he doesn't do is drive a car," 
said listing agent Sue Goodale of Coldwell Banker Real Estate, Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
 JIM SLOYAN, "the voice of Lexus," and his wife, DEIRDRE, have completed a 
$200,000 renovation of their Sherman Oaks home. 
</P>
<P>
 Sloyan, who has earned a seven-figure annual salary doing the automobile 
commercials since 1989, is a veteran actor who has appeared in numerous TV 
movies and was the voice of the interrogator in the 1993 TV series "Crime & 
Punishment." He will play Robert Vesco in a movie about the fugitive swindler 
to be filmed this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sloyans, who have two teen-agers, bought their four-bedroom, Sherman Oaks 
home in 1991 for nearly $700,000. The 4,000-square-foot house was built in 
1955.

ARCHITECTS TO HONOR PARK AT CONVENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Architect Ki Suh Park has been named recipient of the American Institute of 
Architects' 1994 Whitney M. Young Jr.Citation, which recognizes architects' 
contributions to society. 
</P>
<P>
 The award, named for the late Civil Rights leader who in 1968 challenged 
America's architects to assume professional responsibility toward social 
issues, will be presented May 13 at the AIA's national convention in Los 
Angeles, where Park serves as chairman of the host city's AIA convention 
committee. 
</P>
<P>

RENT WATCH: WHAT TO DO IF ROOMMATE CHANGES LOCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Special to The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: My roommate abuses drugs and alcohol. I've found another apartment 
and need to move my belongings, but she has changed the locks and won't let me 
enter the apartment. What can I do? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: If your name is on the rental agreement as a tenant, you have access 
rights to the apartment. You can either ask the landlord to let you enter, or 
you can request a local law enforcement agency to do a "civil stand by" while 
you collect your property. In this case, you may have to provide proof 
residency, such as a telephone or utility bill in your name. Remember that 
until your tenancy is formally terminated with a written 30-day notice, you 
still are responsible for your portion of the rent. Your landlord may require 
you to retrieve your portion of the security deposit from your roommate and, if 
this cannot be arranged, or mediated through a dispute resolution service, you 
will have to prepare to sue your roommate in Small Claims Court for such 
reimbursement. Who Keeps Curtains the Tenant Bought? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: When I moved into my apartment two years ago, I hated the curtains that 
were on the windows. I received my landlady's permission to replace her 
curtains with ones that I would purchase and then gave my landlady her curtains 
for safekeeping. Now that I've given notice to move, my landlady has informed 
me that she expects me to leave my curtains. Can she force me to leave my 
curtains, and if so, shouldn't she reimburse me for my expense? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Your landlady is probably operating under the assumption that your curtains 
have become fixtures and therefore have become her property. If you merely 
replaced her curtains with yours and did not change the location of the rods, 
you should be able to take your curtains with you when you leave. But, if she 
has to relocate the rods and spackle and paint the walls in order to rehang her 
original curtains, her assumption may be correct. If the curtains have become 
fixtures, even though they may be an improvement, you have no right to 
reimbursement, although you may still try to negotiate a solution with her. 
Wheelchair Ramp Denied to Renter 
</P>
<P>
 Q: My 4-year-old daughter has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair. Now that 
she is bigger and heavier, I must stop lifting and carrying her from our 
apartment to the car, so I asked the manager if I could have a wheelchair ramp 
installed for easier access. After consulting with the owner, the manager 
denied our request because the owner thinks ramps are ugly and might be 
inconvenient for other tenants. What can I do now? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The 1988 Fair Housing Amendments Act does indeed guarantee your daughter's 
right to access. The manager/owner must allow the construction of the ramp, 
although, unless you live in some form of government subsidized housing, you 
will be responsible for the cost of labor and materials. Call your local fair 
housing agency or the regional office of the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development for information and assistance on accessibility issues. These 
agencies can help provide the necessary information so that your landlord 
complies with the law. Wheelchair ramps need not be unsightly and may in fact 
be useful to other residents, whether or not they are disabled. Last Month's 
Rent in Lease Change 
</P>
<P>
 Q: My lease expires this month. Although I plan to continue on a 
month-to-month basis, my landlord and I can't agree whether the last month's 
rent I paid in advance should be applied to the last month of my lease or if my 
landlord can keep it until my month-to-month tenancy ends. Who is correct? 
</P>
<P>
 A: A definite beginning and ending date are specified in a fixed-term lease. 
Therefore, the last month is generally the month during which the lease ends. 
Thus, your landlord should be willing to apply your prepaid last month's rent 
to this month. With a month-to-month agreement, there is no predetermined 
ending date, therefore the last month can only be determined when one of the 
parties gives notice to terminate the tenancy and the last month's rent can be 
held until that time. Rather than bickering over the intricacies of the law, 
the two of you should discuss your rental payment history, the present 
condition of your unit and the sums of any deposits the landlord may be 
holding. You can use this information to assure him that you will continue to 
be a good tenant, even without his retention of a last month's rent. If 
instead, you opt to pay this month's rent and to continue on as a 
month-to-month tenant, be sure that it is specified in writing that your 
prepaid last month of rent will be used in the future when either you or the 
landlord give a 30-day notice to terminate the tenancy.

YOUR MORTGAGE; FIGURING OUT WHICH ARM LOAN IS BEST FOR YOU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIAN HYMER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Hymer is the author of Buying & Selling a 
Home in California (Chronicle Books: $14.95, 220 pp.) 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How do I select an adjustable rate mortgage? 
</P>
<P>
 An adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) is a home loan with an interest rate that 
fluctuates during the term of the loan. ARMs usually start with an interest 
rate that's about 2% to 2.5% below fixed-rate loans. 
</P>
<P>
 ARMs are tied to an index that is a measure of the lender's cost of borrowing 
money. The index is used as a basis for calculating the interest rate on an 
ARM. As the index rises and falls, so will the interest rate on the ARM. 
</P>
<P>
 The longer the term of the index, the more the borrower is protected from 
short-term erratic interest rate fluctuations. For example an ARM with a 
6-month T-Bill index will be more volatile than one with a 1-year index. 
</P>
<P>
 Many ARM lenders offer initial interest rates, called "teaser" or discounted 
rates, which are below the real or "fully indexed" rate. The "fully indexed" 
rate would apply after any discount or teaser rate ends. The "fully indexed" 
rate is calculated by adding a margin, which is the lender's profit, to the 
index. Margins vary with ARM programs, but they are usually in the 2% to 3% 
range. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether or not a teaser rate is a good deal depends on the other terms of the 
loan. Find out how long the teaser rate will be in effect and what the interest 
rate will be after the first adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, check the amount of the loan origination fees charged -- called 
"points." (One point is equal to 1% of the loan amount). The number of points 
vary with the lender who may charge higher points to offset a low teaser rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Some ARMs permit only one interest rate adjustment a year, others allow 
biannual or monthly adjustments. Some ARMs have an annual rate adjustment 
limit, called a "cap," of no more than 2% a year. Maximum life-time interest 
rate caps vary, but expect about 6%. 
</P>
<P>
 First-Time Tip: Determining which ARM is right for you will depend in part on 
how long you plan to stay in the house. A low initial interest rate and upfront 
fees will save you money if you plan to move again soon. The margin and 
lifetime cap will be less important because you won't be living with the loan 
for very long. 
</P>
<P>
 If you plan to be in the home indefinitely, a lower margin is usually better 
than a lower starting interest rate. That's because the margin remains constant 
during the 15- or 30-year loan term and the initial discounted rate is 
temporary. A lower lifetime cap will be important because if interest rates 
were to rise and you were in your home long enough, this would hold down the 
long-term cost of owning your house. 
</P>
<P>
 An ARM that adjusts only once a year but has a higher initial rate may cost 
you less than one that adjusts twice a year but has a lower start rate. ARMs 
that adjust only once a year also have the benefit of enabling you to prepare 
for monthly payment adjustments. Six month adjustments can be harder to handle. 
</P>
<P>
 The Closing: Some ARMs have prepayment penalties if you pay the loan off 
early. A prepayment penalty could wipe out any benefit you derived from a lower 
start rate or no points. Whether or not you'll want to consider a loan that has 
an early payoff penalty will depend on how long you plan to stay in the house. 
If your move is permanent, a loan with a prepayment penalty that expires after 
three or so years may be a reasonable gamble.

 What do you think of low-ball offers? 
</P>
<P>
 A low-ball offer is a term used to describe an offer on a house that is 
substantially less than the asking price.The term often scares real estate 
agents as well as sellers because such offers question whether the home is 
priced properly. 
</P>
<P>
 Some experts contend that while any offer can be presented to the seller, a 
low-ball offer can sour a prospective sale by discouraging the seller from 
negotiating at all. Moreover, unless the house is way overpriced, the offer 
will probably be rejected. Some persistent buyers overcome these odds by making 
a raft of low-ball offers until they succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, "a seller's advertised price should be treated as only a rough 
estimate of what (the seller) would like to receive," write Ralph Warner, Ira 
Serkes and George Devine in their book "How to Buy a House in California" (Nolo 
Press, Berkeley, 1993). Most real estate experts encourage buyers to learn 
about the seller's motivation so that they can get the best deal possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, learn what comparable homes have sold for in the area so that you can 
determine whether the home is priced right.

Tenants") by Robert J. Bruss is disturbing because Bruss relates his own poor 
experience with one tenant and also states that "the housing authority . . . 
often demands unreasonable repairs." 
</P>
<P>
 This leads me to conclude that his property was found to need repairs because 
it's condition was "unreasonable" as to qualify (or disqualify) for this 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 I am very familiar with the Section 8 program and I know that the clients are 
thoroughly researched and the housing inspected to ensure that it meets normal 
code requirements. If properties do not meet local and state codes, repairs are 
requested. 
</P>
<P>
 I strongly doubt that the repairs asked of Bruss were "unreasonable," except 
that his property required exceptional work in order to be considered as 
habitable. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, as to Bruss' "bad tenant" experience, perhaps he was a "bad 
landlord." It's worth considering.

PROGRAM TERMED 'TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE'

<P>
 Re: "Controversial Programs Avoid Foreclosure, Tax," April 3. 
</P>
<P>
 If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. The tax issues aside, I 
would like to point out that under California law, when a trust deed securing a 
borrower's loan is foreclosed, the party named in the Notice of Default is the 
borrower and not the current holder of title to the property.Furthermore, the 
credit reporting agencies report the foreclosure on the borrower's credit 
report. To lead your readers to believe that they will not suffer the 
consequences of the foreclosure is disservice.

 Kenneth R. Harney's article represents an idea that sounds too good to be 
true. It is! 
</P>
<P>
 The Boston Harbor program Harney discusses may or may not preserve the selling 
homeowner's credit, but it certainly is not the silver bullet to avoid tax 
liability that the article suggests. Boston Harbor can purchase a home facing 
foreclosure, but the homeowner's tax problems will not just go "poof." 
</P>
<P>
 If you own a $100,000 primary personal residence with a $150,000 purchase 
money non-recourse mortgage and you have an $80,000 tax basis, you will have 
$70,000 gain on the foreclosure of the mortgage ($150,000 mortgage -- $80,000 
tax basis). You can escape tax on this gain only if you reinvest in another 
primary personal residence with a cost of $150,000 or greater within two years. 
</P>
<P>
 You will face precisely the same tax rule if you sell your property to Boston 
Harbor or anyone else prior to a foreclosure.

LEAD POISONING: A REAL OR HYPED-UP DANGER? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I take offense at the March 20 childhood lead-poisoning article ("Old Paint 
Young Victims" by Stephanie O'Neill). Occupying 80% of the page is an inflated 
article complete with a picture of mom and daughter, stricken by lead 
poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
 Your article is an example of good/bad reporting. Your mission is to educate 
your readers to the dangers of lead poisoning but it is done out of proportion 
to its danger, especially in California. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, your headline says "An estimated 3 million children in the U.S. 
suffer from lead contamination." Yet later in your article you report 700 cases 
of childhood lead poisoning statewide in 1993, and only 12% of those cases were 
considered "medical emergencies." That's 84 out of a total statewide population 
of over 28 million people! 
</P>
<P>
 Using specific heartfelt cases of individuals suffering the contamination is 
common journalistic practice, but it can also result in a prejudiced 
communication. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until I read the smaller companion article ("Should You Test Your 
Child?") that a reality check was done. Three doctors point out resources are 
better spent elsewhere than by testing for elevated blood levels. 
</P>
<P>
 It would have been more responsible journalism to incorporate these doctors' 
observations within the lead article in the interest of balance.

 In her article, O'Neill writes ". . . there are no government loan programs or 
other financial assistance aimed specifically at private lead abatement work." 
</P>
<P>
 True for now. However, there is a campaign sponsored by the Alliance to End 
Childhood Lead Poisoning and the Environmental Defense Fund to push House 
Resolution 2479, which would impose a "polluter pays" excise tax on the lead 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 This legislation would provide an additional $1 billion dollars to local 
governments to help improve the health and well being of local communities, 
creating tens of thousands of high-skilled jobs without raiding other federal 
programs, or raising the deficit.

 I would like to thank The Times for addressing such an important issue as 
childhood lead poisoning caused by lead-based paint. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a disease that affects one in six children, resulting in slower 
cognitive development, lower IQ scores, deafness and in some cases mental 
retardation. 
</P>
<P>
 Lead poisoning is considered to be the No. 1 environmental health hazard to 
children, while at the same time, it is the most preventable. Yet, and this is 
extremely disturbing, there is no existing government financial aid targeted at 
lead abatement programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Our children are our future, and the moral obligation to deal with problems 
affecting children rests with us. 
</P>
<P>
 Please call 1-800-LEAD-FYI to learn more about childhood lead poisoning.

BROKER TAKES EXCEPTION TO REALTY ADVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I take exception to two items by attorney Robert Bruss in the March 27 Real 
Estate Q&A article. In one entitled "How to Avoid Selling Home for Too Little" 
he suggests that the seller, who doesn't want to spend $375 for an appraisal, 
entice three realtors to give them free market analyses. 
</P>
<P>
 This is fine when the seller is legitimate. But in this case the seller has 
already stated the listing will go to his/her daughter, who is a part-time 
agent. Is it fair to the other realtors who will spend their valuable time and 
expertise trying to assist a seller who is more than likely not going to use 
their services anyway? 
</P>
<P>
 In my opinion, using a part-time realtor makes as much sense as using a 
part-time attorney. Realtors today are being held to a much higher standard of 
professionalism, one that part-time agents usually don't measure up to. 
</P>
<P>
 In the item headlined "Why It Doesn't Pay to Cut Realty Commission" Bruss 
suggests the seller, who wants a full-service broker at non-full-service 
prices, should ask the realtor to cut their commission if an offer is produced 
that is substantially lower than the price recommended. 
</P>
<P>
 That is absolutely ludicrous. If sellers would list their homes at prices 
their qualified agents recommended, then substantially lower offers would not 
be forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
 Buyers today still control the market place and are much more sophisticated 
than ever. Sellers need to be aware of that. Because of the abundance of 
inventory on the market, a seller who does not keep current with the market may 
very well end up being overpriced if it sits unsold too long.

PRECAUTIONS TO TAKE IN SEISMIC RETROFITTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your feature article on foundation anchoring and seismic retrofitting of the 
under floor space in homes ("Bracing for the Next One," March 13) was excellent 
in that the repair cost is very nominal and retrofitting is extremely 
beneficial. All houses should be properly anchored to reduce seismic 
damage.Arbitrary rules on percentages of perimeter wall length to be sheathed 
are hard to justify and should be based upon the type of house, the house 
configuration, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 The article indicates it is not necessary to brace interior walls. In my 
opinion, this is very unwise recommendation, because in many houses, the 
interior walls may have twice the seismic force of an exterior wall. All houses 
should be reviewed by an experienced engineer who can direct the contractor to 
do an appropriate job. Home videos are great but seismic retrofitting is an 
investment in one's home that should be reserved for the professionals.

ROOFING GIANT DRAWS MOST READER RESPONSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRSTEN LAGATREE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "For a hole in your roof -- or a whole new roof. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 That catchy slogan, delivered by the friendly voice of Woody Smith, is heard 
by millions of Southland radio listeners weekly. It has made Champion the 
800-pound gorilla of Southern California roofing. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said the company spends more than $250,000 a year on radio ads alone. 
Company president Mark Freiborg wouldn't disclose the overall advertising 
budget. But Smith said Champion's direct mail targets "every wood-shingle 
house" in the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who is a salesman in Champion's Brentwood-Beverly Hills territory as 
well as the company's radio spokesman, figures that between 20 and 30 work 
crews a day fan out into the five-county Southern California area tearing off 
and replacing "more roofs than any single company." 
</P>
<P>
 But how good a job do they do? 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 110 letters that The Times received in response to our call for 
readers' roofing experiences, 14 concerned Champion, more letters than about 
any other roofing company. Two of the letters were complimentary, 12 were 
complaints about the company. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaints had a common thread: the quality of the work, keeping 
appointments and treatment by office personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Janice Baxter of Northridge -- in a complaint filed with the Contractors State 
Licensing Board and in a letter to The Times -- detailed a grueling experience 
with Champion that included multiple leaks in a new roof, several missed 
appointments to correct the problem and a conversation with a company official 
where she was told, "You are taking up too much of my time. I'm going to give 
you 60 seconds to finish." Baxter wrote: "To this day, whenever anyone mentions 
'roofs' (especially Champion Roofing), my blood pressure goes up." 
</P>
<P>
 Baxter was not alone. A number of readers' complaints were bitter and phrases 
like "utter frustration" were not unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 Freiborg, who took over the 40-year-old family business from his father in 
1986, at first expressed shock about the number and vehemence of complaints. "I 
thought most people were happy with Champion," he said. "It's kind of human 
nature for people who are unhappy to scream the loudest, when they're happy 
they don't say anything." 
</P>
<P>
 But Smith more readily acknowledged a basis for complaints. He associated 
customer problems with Champion's "growing pains" resulting from the aggressive 
advertising campaign Freiborg waged after taking over the business. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as Mark sent out brochures, business doubled or tripled, it just 
started getting big. We're the leviathan of the roofing industry. It was 
difficult to control problems in a workmanlike manner." 
</P>
<P>
 Difficulty in controlling problems is also evident from the number of 
complaints against Champion filed with the Contractor's State Licensing Board. 
Under state law, once complaints have been resolved through the formal process, 
they are not public record, but two officials with the Department of Consumer 
Affairs, who asked that their names not be used, expressed dismay over 
Champion's record. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the biggest companies have records that are nowhere near this," said 
one. Another characterized Champion's complaint record as "abominable." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the officials' remarks, Freiborg said he's been making a special 
effort to deal with customer complaints for the past six months. "Any problems 
that existed before don't exist now," he said, "because we've done so many 
things to correct them." 
</P>
<P>
 Freiborg said he "got rid of about three different people for different 
things, rudeness to customers being one of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Champion radio spokesman Smith believes the nature of the job is part of the 
problem. "People aren't ready for the trauma of tearing off a roof, scratching 
(rain) gutters, dropping shingles, breaking a limb off a plant . . . ," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of this, Smith believes, Champion's office staff has a tricky job. 
</P>
<P>
 "The girls at the desk who deal with the problems practically need 
psychological training to deal with the people who call. . . . The greater 
majority (of Champion customers) get a good job -- they may not know it, but 
it's a good job." 
</P>
<P>
 Uwe Nissen of Glendale did not think he got a good job. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way the roof was done, it literally fell apart," said Nissen, who won a 
$4,000 judgment against Champion in small claims court. 
</P>
<P>
 When his Champion-installed roof developed serious leaks after 11 years (it 
had a 25-year warranty), Nissen tried to contact the company. "For two months 
they never returned my phone calls," he said. "They never even answered a 
certified letter I sent telling them about the leaks." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Nissen said he's pleased about his court victory, his voice still 
shakes with anger when he talks about Champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Freiborg said some of the company's customer complaints stem from California's 
freakish weather pattern over the past several years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Remember when we were having all that drought? If there was ever a problem 
(with the roofing jobs), there was no way to know it," he said. "All of a 
sudden we got these record-breaking rains and all these complaints flushed out 
at the same time. That made it difficult for Champion to respond as we wanted 
to." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Freiborg and Smith expressed confidence that the vast majority of 
Champion's customers are satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Sperber of Woodland Hills wrote The Times about his experience with 
Champion, which he said ended satisfactorily. Although Sperber said that 
Champion missed several appointments and its office personnel gave him a "major 
run-around," Sperber concluded that the finished job looked good. 
</P>
<P>
 "After all was said and done," he wrote, "I would use Champion again." Sperber 
said he has recommended Champion to several friends, who have also been 
pleased. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Freiborg emphasized that efforts to improve are vigorously under 
way. He said he has instituted a system where all calls are logged in so that 
the company's response can be tracked. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I can say is, when a customer buys a roof and hires a reputable company, 
they deserve to have it taken care of," he said. "I'm trying so hard now to do 
the best I can. If there is a complaint, I'm involved everyday."

ROOFING TERMS TO KNOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just like any other trade or profession, roofing has a language all its own. 
Here are some terms you'll want to be familiar with so that you and your 
contractor are speaking the same language. 
</P>
<P>
 1 -- Deck/sheathing. This is the base surface to which other roofing materials 
are applied. 
</P>
<P>
 2 -- Drip edge. An L-shaped strip installed along the edges of the roof. It 
keeps water from running back under your deck and eves. 
</P>
<P>
 3 -- Felt/underlayment. Also called tar paper. It is used as a secondary layer 
of protection on top of the deck and beneath roofing material. 
</P>
<P>
 4 -- Flashing. Pieces of metal used to prevent the seepage of water around any 
intersection or projection in a roof. These include chimneys, vents and 
valleys. Many roof leaks occur at flashing points. 
</P>
<P>
 5 -- Rafters. The supporting framing to which the roof deck is attached. 
</P>
<P>
 6 -- Rake. The inclined edge of a roof over a wall. 
</P>
<P>
 7 -- Ridge. The top edge of two intersecting sloping roof surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
 8 -- Slope. Measured by rise in inches for each 12 inches of horizontal run. 
For example, a roof with what contractors call a "4:12 slope" rises 4 inches 
for every foot. 
</P>
<P>
 9 -- Square. The common measurement for roof area -- 100 square feet (10 feet 
by 10 feet) is one square. 
</P>
<P>
 10 -- Valley. The angle formed at the intersection of two sloping roof 
surfaces.

<P>
 Once you have identified three or more roofer candidates, the place to begin 
checking them out is the Contractors State License Board. 
</P>
<P>
 If you have a touch-tone phone, you can call (800) 321-2752 at any hour and 
get information on: 
</P>
<P>
 1 -- Status of contractors license. 
</P>
<P>
 2 -- Bond information. 
</P>
<P>
 3 -- Whether a license suspension is pending against the contractor due to 
outstanding judgments against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, you can talk to someone directly by calling one of the board's regional 
offices: 
</P>
<P>
 Central Region (Central Valley south to Los Angeles International Airport): 
(818) 543-4731. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Region (LAX area south to San Diego): (714) 994-7430. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant deputy for the Central Region, Laurence Chafe, recommends calling to 
talk to someone in person. 
</P>
<P>
 "Be as aggressive as possible talking to a deputy," he advised. "Don't be 
satisfied just finding out the license is current and active." 
</P>
<P>
 Make sure, for example, that the contractor's business name is exactly the 
same as the one listed by the license board. "It's not uncommon (for one 
contractor) to use the license of another," Chafe said. "If there's any 
difference in name, it should raise a red flag." 
</P>
<P>
 And, whatever you do, if a problem does develop with your contractor, don't 
wait to file a complaint until after you've torn all your hair out and bored 
all your friends with your tales of roofing woe. Chafe urges that you file a 
complaint right away if you don't get a satisfactory response from your 
contractor within a reasonable amount of time. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are two helpful publications you can send away for: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "What You Should Know Before You Hire a Contractor." This 32-page booklet 
is free. It is published by the Contractors State License Board and covers all 
types of contractors, not just roofers. But it provides a comprehensive 
discussion of how to hire and deal with a contractor. You can order it by 
calling the board at (800) 321-2752. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Buying a New Roof -- And Getting Your Money's Worth." This handy (and 
free) pamphlet is put out by the National Roofing Contractors Assn., O'Hare 
International Center, 10255 W. Higgins Road, Suite 600, Rosemont, Ill. 
60018-5607, (708) 299-9070.

IN OVER YOUR HEAD?; HOW TO PICK A ROOFER

 Pete McKenney's experience was ghastly -- but not all that unusual. He hired a 
roofer he thought he could trust. The man arrived in "a new car" and "was neat, 
clean and professional looking." He gave McKenney a good bid and three 
references. 
</P>
<P>
 "Trusting the contractor, I left for work," McKenney recalled. "The neighbors 
tell me the workers arrived in the worst-looking dump truck with the sides 
falling out, bald tires, smoking tailpipe and the four guys looked like 
refugees from hell." 
</P>
<P>
 The efforts of the work crew "from hell" give McKenney a perfect score in the 
"project from hell" category. 
</P>

 Debris from the job rained down on attic, yard, ceiling fixtures and even his 
kitchen floor. McKenney wound up with a fire hazard in the attic, damaged 
insulation, a broken kitchen vent, a heat pump filled with dirt and rocks and 
several other messy and costly aggravations. 
</P>
<P>
 But that wasn't the worst part. In the very next storm, rain poured into 
McKenney's Manhattan Beach home. 
</P>
<P>
 The following summer he had his "new" roof replaced. And still suffered leaks 
because of improper installation. 
</P>
<P>
 Next time? McKenney said he would be on site all day and know what to insist 
on for every detail of the job. "I'll be the homeowner from hell!" he vowed. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't have to be the homeowner from hell to get a roofing job done 
properly. But it wouldn't hurt to know a thing or two about hiring a roofing 
contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also useful to know something about the nature of the roofing business. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's typically an industry that's based on price," said Mark Vanderslice, 
president of Roofing Forensics of Yorba Linda, an independent consulting firm. 
"You have contractors who don't make much money, the way they get jobs in a 
competitive environment, so they're always thinking how to get the price lower. 
And what that does is bring everything to a low level of quality." 
</P>
<P>
 And since roofing isn't an improvement most people can get excited about, 
homeowners often play their own part in this low-budget, low-quality game. 
"They'll pay more for the tile man, for a couch with a different fabric or even 
a good paint job," said Richard Silverman of Silverman Roofing in Santa Monica. 
"But for roofing they think everyone does the same thing and they can get it 
for less," he said, adding: "They get what they pay for." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is not to say that you should simply hire the most expensive roofer you 
can find. But the caution about choosing the low-ball bid was echoed by nearly 
everyone interviewed for this story. From roofers to homeowners to consumer 
agencies, the most frequently offered piece of wisdom is this: Cheapest is not 
always a good idea. In the long run, it's not even always cheapest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Homeowners often don't want to work with most top-notch roofers because they 
think they are too expensive." said Richard Boon, deputy director of the 
Roofing Industry Education Institute in Englewood, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 John Carter of West Covina was one such homeowner. "We shopped price," he said 
ruefully. The people sent by the roofing company were sloppy workers. In 
attaching the plywood sheathing to the roof, they missed rafters with many of 
their nails. His garden and attic are still littered with debris from the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadder but wiser, Carter admits he made another critical error. He never 
checked up on the roofer's credentials. "I assumed he had a license, but I 
didn't really know what that meant." 
</P>
<P>
 It means a lot. A license doesn't guarantee that the roofer is good at his 
job. But it does guarantee that you have some recourse in case there are 
problems. Also, if you hire an unlicensed contractor, you could be liable for 
injuries or damage that occur on your property. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Tam Lipson of Long Beach used a licensed contractor, she had leverage 
in dealing with her roofer when her roof started leaking and the roofer failed 
to showed up. 
</P>
<P>
 "He gave me a personal grief story," Lipson said. "He told me there were a lot 
of things worse to live with than a leaky roof! I suggested losing his license 
would be a lot more difficult to live with than repairing my leaky roof!" And 
she promptly filed a complaint with the state Office of Consumer Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon afterward, she received a copy of the warning letter sent to the roofer 
by the Contractors' State License Board. Three days later, the roofer appeared 
and patched the leaks. "So far, so good," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Everett Lawson, assistant licensing deputy at the licensing 
board, Lipson's experience is typical. "The largest majority of contractors, 
when they find out a complaint has been filed, will fix the problem -- 
regardless of fault," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawson said his office receives about 30,000 complaints annually on various 
types of contractors. Roofers are among the most frequently complained about. 
They generate 14% of all complaints, although they make up only 5% of all 
contractors licensed by the state. 
</P>
<P>
 How can you find a roofer you won't wind up complaining about? 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't as easy as "letting your fingers do the walking." But neither is it 
complicated. It takes time, common sense -- and a little detective work. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting with a referral is your best bet. If you followed last week's advice 
and visited a roofing supply showroom, you're off to a good start. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides having some idea of the material you'd like to use for the job, you'll 
also have the names of some roofers recommended by the material supplier. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't forget that friends and neighbors who have recently had roof jobs done 
can also be a good source for referrals. "If you see a good roofing job in your 
area," said Laurance Chafe, assistant regional deputy for the contractors 
licensing board, "don't be afraid to go up to a neighbor and ask about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, no recommendation -- no matter how hearty, whether it be from the 
material supplier or your brother-in-law -- is a substitute for doing some 
basic checking. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, here's what you need to find out. 
</P>
<P>
 1 -- Is the roofer a licensed roofing contractor in California? 
</P>
<P>
 In California, any job that costs $300 or more must be done by a licensed 
contractor. Ask to see a pocket license and another form of identification. 
When you call to see if the license is current, be sure the contractor's 
business name matches the name that goes with the license number. 
</P>
<P>
 Millie Gordon of Westlake Village learned the hard way about doing a license 
check. "He really seemed like such a nice, honest, guy," she said recalling an 
ordeal with a leaking roof that stretched over three years. When she finally 
got curious and called the licensing board, she found out that the license 
number her roofer had given her actually belonged to someone else -- and had 
expired in 1987. Without a valid license number, Gordon is at a loss for filing 
a complaint on her roofer when and if she locates him. 
</P>
<P>
 2 -- Is the roofer bonded? 
</P>
<P>
 Bonding is a legal requirement in California. 
</P>
<P>
 If your contractor goes bankrupt or disappears before the job is done, you can 
be compensated up to the amount of the bond. Note that bonds are often for 
$5,000 -- less that the cost of many roof jobs. Still, it's a start. And it's 
also one more indicator about the reliability of your contractor -- if the 
roofer's cutting corners on legal requirements for business, is this who you 
want installing your roof? 
</P>
<P>
 3 -- Are there any outstanding judgments (unsatisfied complaints) against the 
roofer? 
</P>
<P>
 The licensing board will tell you if there are current complaints against a 
roofer. It will not tell you if there have been several dozen complaints in the 
past, as long as these complaints have been dealt with. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither does the board keep a list of contractors who draw the most complains. 
Know what the board can and cannot do for you. It can be helpful, but a "clean 
bill of health" from the board is not a substitute for getting several 
references and really checking them. 
</P>
<P>
 4 -- Does the roofer have worker's compensation insurance in case employees 
are injured on your job? 
</P>
<P>
 State law requires that the roofer carry it. Worker's comp costs roofing 
contractors about 44 cents for every payroll dollar they spend. It's one big 
reason why you'll pay more for a better roofer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Competition is stiff among roofers," said Rick Bravo of Commercial Roofing & 
Waterproofing in Artesia. "The unlicensed types don't have to get insurance, 
don't pay taxes, they blow us right out of the water, we can't compete." 
</P>
<P>
 5 -- Does the roofer have general liability insurance? 
</P>
<P>
 State law does not compel your roofer to carry it. But if the roofer beans the 
mail carrier with falling tiles or backs a truck into your patio wall, you'll 
be glad he does. 
</P>
<P>
 The way to check both insurance questions is to ask your contractor to have 
certificates of insurance mailed directly to you by the insurance carrier. 
Don't be shy -- a good roofer will be used to doing this for clients. 
</P>
<P>
 6 -- How long has the roofer been in business? 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Vanderslice of Roofing Forensics advises looking for a contractor with 
several years' experience. "I'd say less than five years is risky," he said. 
"In this day and market, the longer the better." 
</P>
<P>
 7 -- Can the roofer give you at least three references? 
</P>
<P>
 Check them and question them closely about how the job went. 
</P>
<P>
 "The true tale of a good roofing contractor," said James Fohrman, president of 
Fairway Roofing Inc. in Mission Viejo, "is not how good or easy his job went, 
but how he handled any problems that occurred." 
</P>
<P>
 Get bids on your job from at least three roofers you have checked on and are 
satisfied with. And make sure that you're comparing "apples and apples." The 
roofing material should be the same as should all details about what is to be 
installed, replaced or repaired (drip edges, flashings, gutters, etc.). 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, all of the above is based on the assumption that you'll have a 
handful of roofers to choose from. Depending on what month we're in, that may 
or may not be the case. Just before the rainy season is roofers' busiest time. 
"Anticipation of winter and as soon as we have the first rain, people start 
calling," said Richard Silverman of Silverman Roofing in Santa Monica. "When we 
have a big rain, it will be a nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowner Frank Lucido in Studio City can vouch for that. Lucido said he spent 
a long time doing preliminary research on roofers and found he was able to talk 
to many roofing companies during the summer. "By the time the rainy season 
started, I couldn't get anyone to return my calls." 
</P>
<P>
 If you do wind up with a roof job in process during the rainy season, watch 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Thibault of El Segundo can relate chilling tales of wrestling heavy 
plastic sheeting onto his exposed roof during a wind and rainstorm. His roofer, 
stretched thin with other jobs, barely arrived in time to help. It was only 
their combined "panic-driven energy" that averted major damage. 
</P>
<P>
 As it was, Thibault's ceilings bore the marks of considerable leaking. "Until 
they were repaired," he recalled, "the ceilings above my bed caused me to think 
about this adventure every night as I slept." 
</P>
<P>
 He sums up his roofing wisdom this way: 
</P>
<P>
 "My only advice is to put on a new roof last summer." Tips for Dealing With 
Your Roofer 
</P>
<P>
 Here are a few tips that will make your life easier as the job progresses -- 
and possibly save you money and headaches when it's finished. 
</P>
<P>
 Keep a job file. Set up a Manila folder where you'll stash all related 
paperwork. Of course, you'll have the contract in here -- plus any written 
changes, but don't forget also to keep a copy of the material manufacturer's 
instructions for application and warranty. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspect the work as it progresses. That copy of the manufacturer's 
instructions and warranty will come in handy here. If the manufacturer calls 
for six nails per shingle and your contractor is only using three, you'll want 
to point that out. And, of course, closely inspect the work before you write 
that final check. 
</P>
<P>
 Be sure your contractor gets the required permit from your city. Do not let 
him talk you into doing it. The person who pulls the permits on a job becomes 
the "Owner/Builder." The person designated by this term is responsible for the 
overall job, which may include such things as code compliance and other legal 
liabilities. You definitely want your roofing contractor to be the 
"Owner/Builder." 
</P>
<P>
 Plan for the disruption. Know that even under the best circumstances, the work 
you're having done will be noisy and messy and will cause some inconvenience to 
you and your family. Ask your roofing contractor to tell you what to expect. 
Then prepare your family and make your plans accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Be reachable. If you will be away from home while the work is being done, be 
sure to give your contractor a phone number where you can be reached in case he 
needs to consult with you about the work. 
</P>
<P>
 Get a handle on liens and lien waivers. What are they and why should you care? 
Say you've paid your contractor the full amount you owe him for labor and 
material. But, let's say your roofer's had a little cash flow problem and 
hasn't paid his workers or the material supplier. Unless you have a signed 
"lien waiver," you could be forced to pay that amount all over again to keep 
from losing your home. The way to protect yourself is to specify that your 
contractor is responsible for obtaining and providing you with lien releases 
from any subcontractors and material suppliers involved in your job. Call the 
material supplier directly to verify that all material has been paid for. 
</P>
<P>
 Never let your payments get ahead of the work completed. Your payment schedule 
should be contingent upon the contractor's completed work. You should also 
provide for a retention of at least 10% of the amount owed until the job is 
fully complete -- to your satisfaction.

IN THE GARDEN: GARDENING; CLEMATIS LOVE TO CLIMB, DO WELL IN SOUTHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SMAUS, TIMES GARDEN EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's one of those plants we can't grow here, or so some say. Others are 
discovering that clematis do just fine, thank you. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This showy vine, beloved back east and in the British Isles, may not cover a 
cottage, as they sometimes do in England, but perhaps that's just as well. 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California, clematis are well-mannered vines, that produce more 
than their fair share of spectacular, usually flat-faced flowers, up to nine 
inches across, colored from pink and purple to a respectable blue. 
</P>
<P>
 Ann Gilboyne began growing them because "I didn't know any better. I grew them 
in Wisconsin, and after I moved, I grew them here," she said, not knowing that 
few gardeners did, at least as successfully as she now does. 
</P>
<P>
 So successfully, in fact, that she is growing them for the upcoming Baldwin 
Bonanza plant sale at the Los Angeles County Arboretum. This year the 
volunteers are putting it on, and get to pick the plants. Gilboyne chose her 
favorite, the clematis, and she will bring 100 plants to the sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they look small, she says they're "guaranteed to bloom this year." 
She's only growing kinds that have been successful for several years in her own 
garden. 
</P>
<P>
 She has grown the variety 'Nelly Moser' for 12 years in her Glendale garden, 
and her mother has grown it for almost as long in her coastal Laguna Niguel 
garden. It's not one of those eastern plants that grows inland where winters 
get chilly but not on the milder coast. 
</P>
<P>
 This particular variety is a favorite, with flowers about 8 inches across and 
each light pink petal having a darker stripe down the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 Not house gobblers, clematis are deciduous vines of a manageable size. The 
English author Christopher Lloyd writes of them as "an extra, the gilt on the 
gingerbread," in his recent book, "The Well-Chosen Garden." 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact to remember about them," he wrote, "is that they don't need a 
special place to themselves. And so, to find a place for a clematis requires no 
more effort than to find an established shrub on which a clematis is not 
growing. . . . You merely need to match the vigor of your shrub with the vigor 
of the clematis that is to run through and over it." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is exactly how, and where, to grow them in California -- twining up 
something else. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Gilboyne garden, they climb bougainvilleas and climbing roses, 
honeysuckles and Costa Rican nightshade Solanum wendlandii . One scrambles up a 
copper beech, another grows on the mailbox. 
</P>
<P>
 You do not need to tack them to a wall, or train them on a trellis. Since they 
definitely have their off-season when dormant, growing clematis with something 
else also hides this shortcoming. 
</P>
<P>
 They grow unusually well with roses. Lloyd again: "A clematis with a rose is a 
particularly happy match because both plants are greedy and enjoy the good 
things in life." 
</P>
<P>
 Most clematis get to about six feet tall, though Gilboyne has a few that 
clamber up to 12 feet, one right to the top of the chimney. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, Gilboyne grows some 25 different kinds, but especially likes the 
bluest of the clematis, one named 'General Sikorski,' and one she calls the 
"bloomiest," because it flowers from April into December in her garden. Most 
don't bloom this long, becoming brown by November and going completely dormant 
until March. 
</P>
<P>
 When clematis go dormant, the leaves don't fall off of their own, and must be 
cut off (pulling is liable to break the vine), or you might try blasting them 
off with a spray of water, which is what Gilboyne does. 
</P>
<P>
 The Baldwin Bonanza sale is nicely timed for planting because this is the best 
season to do so. They promise to save a third of the plants for the public day, 
May 1, 9 a.m.-4 p.m., so members don't buy them all the day before (you could 
always join and get in a day early). But, should you arrive too late, clematis 
are increasingly available at nurseries and can be ordered from eastern 
catalogues such as Wayside Gardens (Hodges, S.C. 29695-0001).  
</P>
<P>
 Gilboyne says the secret to growing clematis is to pamper the roots. "Plant 
them deep, protect them, and shade them," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Few plants are as finicky this way, the root system and crown being very 
sensitive. When planting, carefully tap them out of the pot and plant a couple 
of inches deeper than they were in the container ("Like a tomato," says 
Gilboyne). 
</P>
<P>
 Don't try to untangle the roots, and handle them gently. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilboyne even suggests leaving them in the nursery container and cutting off 
the bottom with a serrated knife, planting pot and all so the lip of the 
container is flush with the soil surface. The pot helps protect the fragile 
crown from feet, hoes, digging animals and careless commercial gardeners. 
</P>
<P>
 She plants them in a rich, amended soil, the only kind she seems to have in 
her garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Protect and shade the roots with stones or broken concrete. The old admonition 
"keep their heads in the sun and their feet in the shade" is absolutely true. 
They need sun to flower, but the roots must be kept cool. Gilboyne puts a small 
boulder on the south side of most vines. 
</P>
<P>
 She fertilizes in early spring with blood meal, and in April pushes two Jobe's 
tomatoes stakes into the ground about 18 inches from either side of the plant. 
These slowly release nutrients through the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 They don't need as much water as some people think. Gilboyne successfully 
brought hers through the drought without going over her allowance. 
</P>
<P>
 She thinks they should never be pruned, though you can count on some dieback 
every summer. "I know I'll lose some entire stems in July," she said, "but I 
just cut those off and they bounce back. The plant has as many lives as a cat." 
</P>
<P>
 Be sure to pick some of the flowering stems for indoors. Gilboyne cuts several 
feet of flowering stems and lets them trail out of an arrangement, a very 
pretty picture. Gardener's Checklist 
</P>
<P>
 For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of 
Nurserymen on what to do in the garden this week:  
</P>
<P>
 * When planting flowering plants, select pleasing combinations -- yellow 
marguerites and blue felicias, white stock with pink snaps and dwarf phlox in 
the foreground, Oriental poppies with Shasta daisies, white campanula with blue 
lobelia. 
</P>
<P>
 * Feed established roses to increase the quantity and quality of bloom. 
</P>
<P>
 * For garden dry spots, plant some drought-resistant but attractive shrubs, 
such as crape myrtle, oleander, wild lilac and rosemary. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you have a container garden of flowers, be sure to watch their watering 
needs, as they tend to dry out faster than those in the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 * For those sunny, hot locations in your garden, consider geraniums which 
bloom in pink, rose, scarlet, white and more.

CUT YOUR UTILITY BILLS: HOME IMPROVEMENT; CERAMIC-FILLED PAINT OFFERS BUILT-IN 
INSULATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES DULLEY, A Cincinnati-based engineering consultant 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: I am considering painting my house with the same type of insulating 
paint used on the space shuttle. Can this type of paint really lower my utility 
bills? Can I roll it on like ordinary paint? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: You are referring to "ceramic-filled" paint and it is ideal for use on 
houses. It is available in many grades of exterior, interior wall and roof 
paints that can lower your heating and cooling costs. 
</P>
<P>
 This paint is not actually used on space shuttles, but it contains the same 
type of insulating ceramic particles in the shuttles' heat shield tiles. On 
your house exterior or interior walls, it looks just like ordinary paint. 
</P>
<P>
 Many ceramic-filled paints use durable water-based acrylic paint with fine 
ceramic particles (often borosilicate) mixed in it. These are tiny hollow 
ceramic spheres, several times smaller in diameter than a human hair. 
</P>
<P>
 Ceramic materials possess unique heat-resistant and insulation properties. 
They block heat radiation (loss or gain) and they dissipate heat rapidly. You 
can hold a cigarette lighter under a metal strip coated with ceramic- filled 
paint and touch the top of the metal strip without getting burned. 
</P>
<P>
 With ceramic paint on your indoor walls, heat that is normally lost through 
the wall is reflected back indoors. This not only reduces your heating bills, 
but it makes you feel warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer. This also 
allows you to set your thermostat back and save more energy. 
</P>
<P>
 In the summer, you get the greatest reduction in air-conditioning costs and 
improvement in comfort by painting the exterior of your house with 
ceramic-filled paint. Painting your existing roof with a light color is 
effective for lowering cooling costs and it can increase the life of your 
shingles. 
</P>
<P>
 You can roll, brush or spray on ceramic-filled paint. You apply it several 
times thicker than ordinary wall paint. The thicker layer of paint seals tiny 
cracks to block outdoor and indoor noise transmission. The ceramic particles 
themselves are a good sound insulator. 
</P>
<P>
 There are several new types of non-ceramic "easy clean" flat wall paints 
available. These can save energy because the walls remain bright for years. A 
clean bright wall reflects more light, so you need fewer lamps turned on. 
</P>
<P>
 One type of easy clean paint, called Ever-Clean, has a unique non-porous 
surface, although it looks like ordinary wall paint. Typical stains, such as 
crayons, coffee, grease, etc., wipe right off. Another paint, called Silken 
Touch, has fine Teflon particles in it to reject dirt and stains. 
</P>
<P>
 Write for Utility Bills Update No. 907 listing manufacturers of ceramic-filled 
and easy clean paints, prices, specifications, and application instructions. 
Please include $2 handling fee -- cash or check -- and allow three to four 
weeks for delivery. Send your requests to James Dulley, c/o Los Angeles Times, 
6906 Royalgreen Drive, Cincinnati, Ohio 45244. Why Fluorescent Lights Flicker 
at Night 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I replaced my incandescent bulbs in my garage/work area to reduce my 
electric bills. Sometimes, late at night, they tend to flicker. Why do they do 
this? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Your fluorescent lights probably are flickering because it is colder at 
night than during the day. They do not operate well at colder temperatures. The 
problem will probably disappear in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Fluorescent lights are much more efficient than your old lights. Because they 
are more efficient, they give off less heat into the room. This is a real 
advantage in a small garage in the summer. Installing several two-tube fixtures 
is best with pull-chain switches. This allows you to turn on only as many as 
you need.

WATER GARDEN CAN BE SIMPLE ENDEAVOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Water gardening is easy and fun. Usually when you mention water gardening, a 
mental picture comes to mind of a tropical oasis with a cascading waterfall 
surrounded by ferns and filled with the beauty of water lilies.Or you might 
imagine a serene Japanese garden setting highlighted by bamboo, stones, a small 
statue and schools of bright koi. 
</P>
<P>
 In reality though, anyone can have a water garden. Miniature tub gardens are 
the answer for those who want to enhance a balcony or patio. The tub should 
hold at least four gallons of water and be completely sealed. Ceramic pots, old 
crocks, wash tubs and galvanized horse troughs make excellent tub gardens. For 
how to plant and what to plant, see your local nurseryman.

WHEN BLOOD RED WAS NOT THE COLOR OF RWANDA'S SOIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Basil Davidson, Basil Davidson's most recent book on African history is The 
Search for Africa (Times Books). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Back in the year 1879, at about 4 o'clock on a tropical afternoon, a youthful 
Scottish botanist and adventurer reached the outskirts of a village in unknown 
East African country far from the coast, and "boldly marched in." He had little 
or no idea of what awaited him, but had just celebrated his 22nd birthday and 
was full of confidence. Young enough to shake off fears of peril, he was, at 
any rate, aware of his own ignorance, more than could be said of many such 
explorers. 
</P>
<P>
 James Thomson was prepared for surprises. He was given them. But they were not 
of a kind to match East Africa's tough and turbulent reputation. The infamous 
East Coast slave trade was scarcely ended, and what he could expect was misery 
and mayhem. But Thomson saw what could not be expected. "The scene that opened 
before me," he recalled a couple of years later, "I beheld with astonishment: 
It seemed a perfect Arcadia." Amid "a magnificent grove of bananas," he found 
handsome village huts arranged within the shade of immense sycamores, while 
everywhere about them "all seeds, garbage and things unsightly" had been 
carefully cleared away. The village people were resting after their day's work, 
enjoying a siesta and gossip before their evening meal, utterly naked as God 
had made them but "unconscious of any want, and apparently fearing no danger." 
They made him welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomson traveled far, but found no reason to unsay these opinions of a place 
and people a few hundred miles south of today's bedeviled Rwanda and Burundi, 
where tens of thousands are said to have been killed after the two countries' 
leaders died in an airplane crash. Were his opinions those of permissible but 
unreliable exaggeration? The odd thing is that in the East African interior of 
those times, beyond and outside the devilish reach of the slaving caravans from 
the coast, Thomson's opinions would not have sounded strange to other 
long-distance wanderers. Indeed, they would have gibed with their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Modern historians, looking back before the slave trade and the colonial 
dispossessions, have not found Arcadia. But nor have they found anything like 
the hell on Earth that erupts and burns across so much of Africa today. On the 
contrary, however little to be expected from current affairs, that old Africa 
had built a world of tolerance and compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 If this remains hard to believe, consider only the case of the kingdoms of 
Rwanda and Burundi lying not far north of Thomson's route. We have no 
worthwhile external descriptions before the 1890s, and few until the early 
1950s. But then came a notable harvest of hard-headed information on the nature 
of these kingdoms before the colonial dispossessions. Ethnographers 
well-respected in their time and place, older than Thomson and infinitely 
better prepared in their scholarship, described communities of stability and 
good sense, equipped with laws and customs such that the peoples of these 
kingdoms, the Tutsi and the Hutu, had been able to live peacefully together, 
and over a long period. 
</P>
<P>
 These ethnographers were working in the midst of a remarkable reassessment of 
historical Africa that got into its stride after World War II and the onset of 
decolonization. The task they so fruitfully undertook meant quarrying for dates 
and sequences, but, more important, they were concerned with the inward and 
innate process of this unresearched history. They wanted to understand Africa's 
cultures in their conceptual and aesthetic dimensions. 
</P>
<P>
 This has been an enterprise with many and large enlightenments to its credit, 
even if the world at large has still to come to terms with its insights. In 
projecting their findings, the historians have had one great difficulty: that 
of steering between the Scylla of being suspected of spinning fairy tales, and 
the Charybdis of writing with such difficulty -- admittedly on difficult 
matters -- as to be unreadable or, at any rate, unread. Admirably often, 
however, they have brought their cargoes of unfamiliar knowledge safely into 
port. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps healthily, skepticism on all this stays vividly alive. It seems to be 
hard even for sympathetic readers to accept that the influence of centuries of 
African pre-colonial development, political or social or aesthetic, must have a 
therapeutic value for the solving of present ills. Yet, the evidence goes in 
that sense. On the crucial issue of controls on the abuse of power, for 
example, or on the efficacy of systems of conciliation between neighboring 
peoples, the experience of the African past does indeed, and repeatedly, point 
to attitudes and concepts, and even to instrumentalities, that may usefully 
apply in the ferocious conflicts of today. 
</P>
<P>
 A frequently heard reply to this is that there were, in fact, no such concepts 
and principles outside the reach of heated imagination, or else, at best, those 
old modalities of reconciliation were no more than rustic folklore. And yet 
today, there are the examples of Rwanda and Burundi, as described by our 
ethnographers of long years ago. What they made perfectly clear is that the 
twin peoples of these now ravaged countries, the Hutu and the Tutsi, did in 
fact achieve, centuries before any European arrival, the development of an 
effective system of mutual rights and duties, and one that long stayed intact. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, after some 90 years of colonial dictatorship and post-colonial 
confusion, all that well-tried tolerance seems entirely swept away, its old 
structures unrecoverable and its old social and artistic amenities banished 
from the scene, while years may pass before current passions of hatred are 
assuaged. The certain fact is that it was not so in pre-colonial times. With no 
more than the frailties and abrasions of everyday experience, these two peoples 
lived together in cultures of a flexible amity such as can be barely imagined 
now. 
</P>
<P>
 In that past, however simple in its material capacities, the Tutsi and the 
Hutu shared life together, depended upon one another, intermarried with each 
other, and upheld beliefs in a valued co-existence. How and why they were able 
to do this, and by means of what ideas and beliefs, must surely compose a body 
of knowledge that may inspire new hope in the miseries of now.*

A REPUBLICAN COULD BEAT CLINTON IN '96 -- BUT WHO? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By William Schneider, William Schneider, a contributing editor to Opinion, is a 
political analyst for CNN. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Who says you can't beat somebody with nobody? 
</P>
<P>
 One recent poll asked Americans to choose between Bill Clin ton and "the 
Republican Party's candidate for President." Result? Clinton got 43% of the 
vote. The ghost Republican beat him with 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's 43% may sound familiar. It's exactly what he got in the 1992 
election. Clinton has kept his support. But he hasn't expanded it. And he can't 
win a two-way race unless he expands it. 
</P>
<P>
 You can win a three -way race with 43% of the vote, of course. That's what 
Clinton did in 1992. What happens today if you throw Ross Perot into the mix? 
Amazingly, Perot still gets about 20% -- the same vote he got in 1992. Perot 
may have disappeared from the news since the catastrophic debate over the North 
American Free Trade Agreement last November. But he has kept his support. 
</P>
<P>
 With Perot in the mix, Clinton edges out the unnamed Republican by three 
points. Just as he edged out George Bush by five points in 1992. Perot has not 
been too friendly to Clinton, and his followers aren't either. Take Perot off 
the ballot and his supporters go for the unnamed Republican 3 to 1 over 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Bottom line: Democrats had better hope Perot runs in 1996. They need him to 
split the anti-Clinton vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Notice something interesting about these poll results? Nothing much has 
changed since 1992. As bad as that is for the Democrats, it's even worse for 
the Republicans. They lost in 1992. And they have no "man to beat" for 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The "man to beat" is an important title in U.S. politics. Whoever holds that 
title is the leader of the opposition. Right now, the title is vacant. 
</P>
<P>
 This is surprising because, as the poll shows, the 1996 GOP nomination may be 
worth having. But the field is wide open. When Republicans were asked which of 
14 potential candidates they favored for the '96 presidential nomination, Sen. 
Bob Dole of Kansas topped the list -- at 20%. Next came two men who may not 
even be Republicans -- retired Gen. Colin L. Powell and Perot. The only other 
contender to earn double digits was former Vice President Dan Quayle (11%). 
</P>
<P>
 It's unusual for a party not to have a "man to beat" two years before a 
presidential election. How does someone get that title? For a party out of 
power, the title often goes to the most recent vice president. After the 1964 
Barry M. Goldwater debacle, former Vice President Richard M. Nixon was the 
Republicans' man to beat for 1968. After the Democrats got wiped out in 1980, 
Jimmy Carter's vice president, Walter F. Mondale, became the man to beat for 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
 So the title ought to go to Quayle. He is doing what he can to raise his 
stature. He did a potato-chip commercial. He's writing a book. He's building 
bridges to the religious right. But let's face it. It is rarely said of Quayle, 
as it was of Julius Caesar, that "he doth bestride the narrow world like a 
Colossus, and we petty men walk under his huge legs." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, the "man to beat" often went to losers -- candidates who were 
nominated before and lost. Thomas E. Dewey was nominated by the GOP in 1944 and 
lost to Franklin D. Roosevelt. After Roosevelt died in 1945, Dewey became the 
GOP front-runner for 1948. Adlai E. Stevenson lost to Dwight D. Eisenhower in 
1952. Then the Democrats nominated him again, in 1956, just to make sure. 
</P>
<P>
 The record holder in this category is William Jennings Bryan. The Democrats 
nominated Bryan in 1896. He lost to William McKinley. They nominated Bryan 
again in 1900. He lost to McKinley again. The Democrats figured out that maybe 
this wasn't such a good idea -- Bryan was kind of radical -- so they nominated 
Judge Alton Parker, a conservative, in 1904. He lost, too. In 1908, it was back 
to Bryan, who lost a third time. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon lost in 1960, then lost for California governor in 1962. In 1968, he was 
resurrected from the political dead and won the presidency -- twice. Then he 
went on to prove what the country should have learned the first time. Once a 
loser, always a loser. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time a loser became the "man to beat" was Edmund S. Muskie before the 
1972 election. Muskie had been the Democrats' vice presidential nominee in 
1968, and vice presidential candidates are rarely blamed for the party's loss. 
In fact, Muskie was such a formidable "man to beat" that the Nixon White House 
broke into the Democratic National Committee's offices at the Watergate looking 
for material on him. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, however, losers don't become the "man to beat." They become the 
man to forget. Like "what's his name?", the Massachusetts liberal the Democrats 
nominated in 1988. Or Bush. Has an incumbent President ever lost the White 
House and then gone on to win it back? Yes. Once. Grover Cleveland, a Democrat, 
in 1892. Bush is probably immersed in Cleveland's biography right now. But 
here's a clue: That was 100 years ago, and it ain't gonna happen again. 
</P>
<P>
 Another way to become the "man to beat" is to run for the nomination, lose to 
someone else and then watch your party go down to defeat. That gives you a 
powerful message: "I told you so." Ronald Reagan became the GOP's "man to beat" 
for 1980, after he lost the nomination to Gerald R. Ford in 1976. Gary Hart 
became the Democrats' "man to beat" for 1988, after he lost out to Mondale in 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Now let's see, who would be the GOP's Mr. "I told you so" in 1996? Answer: 
Patrick J. Buchanan. Never mind. 
</P>
<P>
 The "man to beat" is often a figure of stature in the party. That's what 
Robert Taft was for the Republicans in 1952 and Nelson A. Rockefeller was for 
the GOP in 1964. They both lost the nomination. On the Democratic side, Edward 
M. Kennedy was the "man to beat" for 1976 and Mario M. Cuomo was the "man to 
beat" for 1992. They both declined to run just before the campaign started. 
</P>
<P>
 Figures of stature have a big problem. They are usually Washington insiders or 
identified with the party Establishment -- like Taft, Rockefeller, Kennedy and 
Cuomo. That's death in this populist era. 
</P>
<P>
 Who is the GOP's current figure of stature? Why Dole, of course. Dole is Mr. 
Washington, the consummate insider and the quintessential Establishment figure. 
He's also a senior statesman (he'll be 73 in 1996). And he's been around the 
track a few times -- once for vice president (1976) and twice for President 
(1980 and 1988). Great credentials for a leader of the opposition. Not so great 
as the Republicans' hope for the future. 
</P>
<P>
 What about Jack Kemp and William J. Bennett and Dick Cheney and Lamar 
Alexander and Carroll A. Campbell Jr. and William Weld and Pete Wilson and 
James A. Baker III and Phil Gramm? All worthy souls and good, patriotic 
Americans. But none is the "man to beat."  
</P>
<P>
 Even the GOP factions have no leaders. Conservative Republicans do not have a 
champion; the first choice of self-described conservatives for the GOP 
nomination is Dole, at 20%. Moderate Republicans do not have a champion; the 
first choice of moderates for the GOP nomination is Dole, at 20%. Even the 
religious right has no champion, which is why Quayle keeps showing up at their 
forums. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, it looks like the Republicans face a wide-open brawl in 1996, just 
like the Democrats did in 1976 and 1988. But there's one big difference. The 
primary season used to be an epic drama. Now it's a miniseries. Two thirds of 
the delegates will be chosen in the first five weeks -- before the California 
primary on March 26. 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of foreshortened nominating season is tailor-made for a "man to 
beat." Only there isn't one. So a candidate is likely to emerge from the pack 
quickly (in New Hampshire, as usual) and then sew up the nomination in record 
time (in New York, as usual). 
</P>
<P>
 Then the party will have seven months to figure out who they've nominated.*

BEYOND VIETNAM: USING FORCE IN BOSNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Charles A. Kupchan, Charles A. Kupchan is senior fellow for Europe at the 
Council on Foreign Relations and a professor of international relations at 
Georgetown University. He was on the National Security Council staff for the 
first year of the Clinton Administration. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Bill Clinton, in step with his NATO colleagues, is feeling his way 
forward in Bosnia. Despite the successful use of a North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization ultimatum to bring Sarajevo back to life, the decision to attempt 
to relieve the siege of Gorazde by bombing Serb positions came reluctantly. 
Constraining Clinton was not just fear of Serb reprisals against U.N. forces in 
Bosnia and concern about Russia's reaction, but the still-powerful lessons of 
Vietnam -- lessons that have for two decades sternly cautioned successive U.S. 
Administrations against entanglement in regional wars. 
</P>
<P>
 By using military power to protect threatened towns in Bosnia, Clinton is not 
only stemming ethnic cleansing and prodding the parties toward a peace 
settlement; he is also challenging reigning paradigms about when and how the 
United States should use force. Moving beyond the obsolete and inappropriate 
lessons drawn from Vietnam is essential if the United States is to make the 
transition from Cold War superpower to leader and catalyst of collective action 
in an uncertain post-Cold War world. 
</P>
<P>
 Comparing Bosnia with Vietnam is wrongheaded for two reasons. First, America's 
war in Vietnam occurred during the height of the Cold War, whereas the conflict 
in Bosnia is a product of the Cold War's end. In Vietnam, U.S. forces faced an 
adversary backed by one of the world's two superpowers. North Vietnam had 
access to a sizable arsenal of sophisticated weaponry; shutting down its 
military machine was virtually impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, the Bosnian Serbs do not enjoy an unlimited supply of outside 
goodwill and resources. To be sure, Serbia provides military support. But 
sanctions continue to erode the Serbian economy. If NATO chose to attack oil 
depots and supply lines, it could seriously impair Serb military operations. 
Support from Russia has come only in the form of Boris N. Yeltsin's rancor over 
not being consulted before NATO bombed Serb positions around Gorazde. Unlike 
the North Vietnamese, the Serbs can be politically and militarily isolated. 
</P>
<P>
 That the war in Bosnia takes place outside the context of the Cold War also 
means the United States and its allies will find it easier to limit their 
involvement. What lured U.S. soldiers deep into the jungles of Southeast Asia 
was the global battle against communism. U.S. decision-makers sincerely 
believed that at stake in Vietnam was the credibility of the West's commitment 
to stem the spread of communism and defend democracy.  
</P>
<P>
 With East-West rivalry now a historical artifact, the war in Bosnia takes on 
far different dimensions. Clinton has justifiably argued that important U.S. 
interests are at stake: preventing the war from spreading, adapting NATO to new 
post-Cold War missions and stopping the humanitarian tragedy. These interests 
warrant limited U.S. engagement. But without the Cold War overlay, U.S. 
interests will not expand as they did in Southeast Asia -- the scope of U.S. 
engagement can be limited accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 In the post-Cold War era, the United States will engage gingerly in foreign 
conflicts precisely because it can afford to do so. Without the threat of 
Soviet aggression, most regional conflicts will not threaten vital U.S. 
interests. The principal risk -- as revealed in Bosnia -- is that of doing too 
little, not too much, of shrinking from international responsibilities and 
missing low-cost opportunities to contain conflicts before they spread, not of 
being drawn into quagmires. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vietnam analogy is misguided for a second reason: Specific military 
lessons are being misconstrued and applied inappropriately to Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. military commanders withdrew from Vietnam smarting from the political 
restrictions that limited their conduct of the war. Since then, the Pentagon 
has adopted an all-or-nothing attitude: When America goes to war, it will do so 
with overwhelming force. A massive assault on an Iraqi army exposed on a desert 
is fine; limited air attacks on Serb positions in the mountains of Bosnia are 
not. 
</P>
<P>
 This argument, however, fails to take into consideration the overall objective 
of using force. If the objective is complete defeat of the adversary, then 
overwhelming force makes sense. But if the objective is limited -- as in Bosnia 
-- then the means should be limited as well. The goal of NATO air strikes is to 
stop the Bosnian Serbs from besieging Muslim enclaves and to facilitate the 
peace process, not to destroy the Serb army. To attain these goals, limited 
force is appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of U.S. engagement in Bosnia misuse another lesson of Vietnam: that 
air power is not an effective military instrument. It is true that air power 
alone does not win wars. U.S. bombers pounded North Vietnam, as well as the 
supply lines running south, with little effect on North Vietnam's determination 
or its ability to resupply its troops. Similarly, repeated air attacks on Iraqi 
forces in Kuwait took their toll, but did not induce Iraq to withdraw; it took 
ground forces to do that. 
</P>
<P>
 But again, this argument ignores ends and therefore reaches misguided 
conclusions about means. Air power could not bring the Serbs to their knees, 
but it is not intended to. NATO is attacking Serb positions as a key element of 
coercive diplomacy; air strikes seek to make the costs of besieging Muslim 
towns outweigh the benefits. As such, air power is an effective tool. 
</P>
<P>
 In deciding whether to defend Gorazde and other towns with air power, the 
appropriate model is Sarajevo, not Vietnam. The residents of Sarajevo have 
emerged from their basements for one simple reason: The Serbs withdrew their 
guns from the surrounding hills when faced with the prospect of air attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of U.S. involvement in Bosnia misuse one other lesson from Vietnam. 
Vietnam, they argue, demonstrated that civil wars are quagmires. Especially in 
the Balkans, where ethnic hatreds run deep, the argument goes, the United 
States is poised to find itself in the middle of a protracted and futile 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
 The mistake in Vietnam was not that the United States got involved, but that 
U.S. involvement escalated to a level far beyond what interests at stake 
warranted. Accordingly, the challenge in Bosnia is not to avoid involvement, 
but to ensure that the level of U.S. engagement remains proportional to the 
interests at stake. 
</P>
<P>
 Determining what level of engagement corresponds to these interests is 
inherently subjective. Sensibly, the Clinton Administration has drawn the line 
at the use of air power and committed itself to send in ground troops only 
after the warring parties have reached a peace settlement. At least for now, 
the key questions will focus on whether NATO protection should be extended to 
all designated safe areas in Bosnia and whether bombing should intensify if the 
Serbs continue their strangulation of Muslim villages. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO should now focus on building momentum behind the peace process. Serbs 
must be told, unequivocally, that attacks on safe areas will not be tolerated. 
Efforts to besiege Muslim enclaves should be countered with explicit warnings 
about air strikes, followed by those strikes if Serb forces refuse to withdraw. 
If limited strikes do not succeed in moderating Serb behavior -- as appears to 
be the case in Gorazde -- the targets should be expanded to include 
communications facilities, command posts and logistical infrastructure. The 
more costly it is for the Serbs to continue fighting, the more attractive a 
settlement will become. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no guarantee that this effort to back up diplomacy with military 
force and coerce the Serbs to the negotiating table will work. But it is worth 
trying. If it succeeds, not only will peace return to the Balkans, but Bosnia 
will help U.S. decision-makers look past the obsolete lessons of Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 In an era when Europe's stability is likely to be threatened by small wars and 
ethnic strife, the preventive deployment of troops, peacekeeping operations and 
coercive diplomacy -- not all-out war -- will be the order of the day. 
Rethinking when and how the United States should use force is central to 
sustaining U.S. leadership and preparing the country for a new strategic 
landscape.*

THE NATION; PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE; COBAIN: GENERATION'S FAILED EFFORT TO 
REDEFINE SUCCESS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Kurt Cobain's death isn't exactly like Victor Hugo's -- when all France wept. 
His lyrics aren't prophetic, or poetic, or even as catchy as his music. But 
grief is present here for some, and rightly so -- Cobain, by the time he died, 
had fathered the alternative rock movement for the '90s; turned some of the 
most famous fashion houses toward thrift-shop flannel, and pulled a wave of 
young people to the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, media coverage has been hung out like a flag at half-staff in tribute 
to this generation's hard knocks and lack of direction. Explanations have taken 
the same kind of tenebrous tone as front-page stories about shockingly low 
employment rates for college graduates and the grim future they face. 
</P>
<P>
 But our happiness and "success" might be built with plainer stones. Cobain's 
suicide is an indication that money isn't everything to this generation. His 
end is our cold orientation in death -- but in his suicide note may be a clue 
to our identity. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to the deaths of Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Jim Morrison, 
Cobain's mother told reporters, "Now he's gone and joined that stupid club." 
And so have we -- my generation -- the twentysomethings, called "Generation X" 
for lack of a better name. Now we have an icon of mystery and allure and 
silence. 
</P>
<P>
 The suicide of a pop icon is not the usual initiation into generationhood -- 
it's not war, or an encompassing political or social movement; it's not a 
convergence on a certain philosophy of life -- but it seems major. Nirvana fans 
or not, as individuals we are a generation inextricably tied up with the news 
of his death. Cobain was one of the first to venture forth and succeed , by the 
common definition of that term. Though he still frequented 7-Elevens for meals, 
he had all the trappings of a partner at Goldman Sachs. The miserable end to 
his life is proof that the idea of "success" for us may have to be adjusted.

doubt), Cobain was taken from his alternative, anti-Establishment roots and 
placed among the wealthy by unexpected success. Suddenly, he had enough of a 
fortune to fill an empty volcano, but too little understanding of how to 
adjust, how to tailor such wealth and fame to his sensibility. Soon, there was 
too little happiness even in his music-making to keep him from turning his 
house into his grave -- like the shade Dante meets in the pathless wood of the 
suicides. We might be quick to blame the suicide on a psychological defect or 
drugs or the unique demons that come with stardom. These are rightly 
suspicioned but not wholly at fault. 
</P>
<P>
 In the patrician suburb of Seattle called Madrona, where Cobain bought a 
million-dollar home, they have had and will have strange visitors -- as they do 
at Pere-Lachaise Cemetery -- lurking to get a view of the gray, three-story 
house, where you can see Lake Washington from the front balcony. In an 
apartment above the garage, Cobain was found lying on his back with a shotgun 
across his chest. Not far from him was the note. 
</P>
<P>
 Out in that suburban topography, sprinklered lawns, gates and winding lanes, 
Cobain must have begun to feel lost, a cog in the wheel, a taxpayer, a father, 
a homeowner, with all his ideals slipped from his pocket. The reaction would be 
common for almost anyone not brought up in affluence -- especially a 
high-school dropout from a blue-collar logging town. 
</P>
<P>
 Immense wealth can be difficult to come to terms with. But for a generation 
that has had the ideal of equality impressed on it from an early age, we in 
Generation X cannot avoid having a particular sensitivity for issues of 
fairness. If this generation has a new social sensibility, then we must adjust 
our financial expectations to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Surely, the seeming subversion of these ideals played a role in Cobain's 
death. As he scrawled in his suicide note, "I have tried everything . . . to 
appreciate it and I do . . . . But it's not enough . . . . I still can't get 
out of the frustration, the guilt and the empathy I have for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 This has the distinct tenor of rock-star cliche, yet it is also full of a 
strange anxiety. Empathy? What else could he mean than that he couldn't help 
feeling culpable for having so much more than most anyone else he knew. Cobain 
often talked in interviews about his guilt over the wide disparity between star 
and fans. 
</P>
<P>
 At every stop on Nirvana's last tour through packed coliseums and domes, 
Cobain must have been reminded by the mosh pit below that he no longer shared 
the same hardships and concerns. At the same time, the more TV shows and 
newspapers and magazines that tagged him the leader of the new youth movement, 
the more he seemed to feel like a mountebank -- as he confessed in his suicide 
note: "The worst crime I can think of would be to put people off by faking it." 
 
</P>
<P>
 Onstage, Cobain was like a semaphore with voice and hands and lank hair. How 
he groaned or howled or squawked, and where he placed his fingers on the 
strings of the guitar sent the hands of an audience keeling like waves. In the 
din of feedback and throttled amps, he was known to charge into a pandemonium 
of kicks and thrashings or sing like a frozen bird. Now the past seems as 
readable and open as a chart. Cobain's interior and family life, his stage act, 
his manic musical and songwriting styles, even his suicide note, remind one of 
a seismograph, tracing hourglasses end on end. Thirty-seven seconds into 
"Lithium," the melody turns on a dime into a metal-raving litany of "Yeah, 
yeah, yeah's." 
</P>
<P>
 His suicide note is a similar creation, characteristically alternating, 
contradicting, bemusing. It reads like the mutterings of a man at a mad task: 
"I haven't felt excitement in listening to, as well as, creating music for too 
many years now. The fact is I can't fool any of you." But he did. Even after 
the champagne-and-painkiller-induced coma in Rome, we weren't expecting this. 
And a shotgun to the head is an exclamation point. The egg we have not yet 
pecked ourselves out of is now cracked.*

THE NATION; DILUTING INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS IS NO WAY TO FIGHT CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Joseph D. McNamara, Joseph D. McNamara, a research fellow at the Hoover 
Institution at Stanford University, is the former police chief of San Jose, 
Calif. He recently returned from advising the United Nations on election 
security in South Africa. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As part of his seemingly tireless efforts to outdo Republicans on 
law-and-order issues, President Bill Clinton recently asked Atty. Gen. Janet 
Reno to find ways to circumvent a federal judge's injunction forbidding random 
police searches of apartments in a federal housing development in Chicago. 
Clinton could have assured tenants that the federal government would do all it 
could do to provide whatever level of policing was needed to stop the violence 
at the complex. Instead, the President pandered to police and public impatience 
with rising crime: He urged the department responsible for prosecuting officers 
who violate people's constitutional rights to assist the police in evading the 
Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 The Taylor Homes in Chicago was the scene of so many gang shootings that some 
tenants, in desperation, asked police to sweep the complex and, without 
warrants, search apartments for firearms. The random searches, however, 
produced more resentment than illegal firearms. Judge Wayne Anderson blocked 
any more searches on the ground they violated the Fourth Amendment's protection 
against unreasonable search and seizure. 
</P>
<P>
 The government then did what it should have done in the first place: It 
increased the number of police in the community, and the shootings stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney representing the tenants conceded that the searches were the 
"wrong issue." Providing adequate security was -- and is -- the real answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the police could have been more effective in Chicago if they had 
acted legally. The courts have ruled that cops may frisk a person suspected of 
carrying a weapon. Accordingly, gang members who lived in the Chicago housing 
complex could have been frisked and arrested if they were found to illegally 
possess a weapon. Furthermore, if the Chicago police had been working closely 
with the community, the information necessary to secure search warrants may 
have been readily available. 
</P>
<P>
 What is especially troubling about the Administration's apparent desire to get 
around Fourth Amendment protections is that it plays into our country's history 
of mistreating non-whites. It was only in 1961, in Mapp vs. Ohio, that the U.S. 
Supreme Court put police on final notice that the courts would no longer turn a 
blind eye toward random searches. 
</P>
<P>
 Dollree Mapp was a black woman. The Cleveland police falsely claimed they had 
a search warrant when they pushed into her home over the objections of her 
lawyer. The officers searched her house, eventually finding some obscene 
photos. She was arrested. The Supreme Court, in Mapp, found this conduct 
shocking, observing that such misconduct had continued despite previous court 
rulings denouncing brutal police methods. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chicago experience, and the history it reawakens, once again underlines 
how much harder it is to make democracy work through good government and 
community commitments than to engage in anti-crime rhetoric. The omnibus crime 
bill now working its way through Congress is a good example of how rhetorical 
fever can overcome sound judgment and experience -- at the expense of 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill establishes federal death penalties for many crimes, among them the 
non-violent crime of drug trafficking. The federal courts are already inundated 
with non-violent drug cases. Burdening them with trying capital-punishment 
cases, which take years to adjudicate, will crash the system. If for no other 
reason than the courts would be paralyzed, the bill should be rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 But the legislation contains other equally bad provisions. Putting 100,000 
more cops on the street sounds good -- but when they are assigned across the 
country, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, they will not be visible enough to 
have much impact. Then, too, no one in Washington seems to want to discuss who 
will pay for these officers once the one-to-three-year federal funding expires. 
</P>
<P>
 The crime bill also continues the incremental federalizing of crimes that used 
to be a local responsibility -- such as car-jacking, low-level drug crimes, and 
gang activities and assault -- just because the victim is a federal employee. 
Despite such federal law-enforcement failures as the Drug Enforcement Agency's 
inability to control drug abuse, Congress keeps assuring the public that they 
will be safer because federal officers can now make arrests in local crimes. 
All these things are rapidly pushing us toward a national police force -- an 
idea once regarded as a threat to our freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration is fond of saying that there is a need for 
"smarter" work by agencies of criminal justice, but it seems to be promoting 
"dumber" expanded bureaucracies. There is no need for any dilution of 
individual rights that took centuries to achieve. The murderers striking the 
most terror in the hearts of people during this century have not been serial 
killers like Ted Bundy. They have been governments that have killed millions of 
their citizens in the name of social order. The authors of the Bill of Rights 
knew the danger and drafted a document for our protection. We should not let 
panic about crime erode it.*

THE WORLD; THE BEST PEOPLE TO JUDGE IF NORTH KOREA HAS THE BOMB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Igor Morozov, Igor Morozov is an independent Russian journalist specializing 
in the nuclear industry. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Because North Korea is a closed society, a visitor would have little or no 
chance of determining whether it possesses an atomic bomb. But there is another 
country that may know just how capable North Korea is of producing one -- 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the Soviet Union that played the decisive role in the development of 
North Korea's nuclear industry. Moscow provided and put into operation, in 
1965, North Korea's first 2-megawatt reactor; it trained more than 60 nuclear 
experts to service the reactor. When Pyongyang wanted to upgrade it, Russians 
assisted. 
</P>
<P>
 The Soviet Union also supplied Pyongyang with reactor fuel. Before the reactor 
was modernized in 1974, North Korea received a stock of 10%-enriched uranium; 
following modernization, the enrichment level rose to 80%. Russia shipped about 
4 1/2 pounds of uranium a year to Pyongyang, with the last shipment in 1991. 
Since then, Moscow has defied North Korean requests for additional shipments 
called for in a contract that officially remains in effect. 
</P>
<P>
 But the North Korean reactor, probably the government's only source of 
weapons-grade plutonium, is not likely to go out of business. During the two 
countries' period of nuclear cooperation, North Koreans stockpiled the Russian 
fuel, enough to keep the reactor going for some time. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Western experts estimate North Korea's plutonium reserves at just three 
pounds. (An efficient nuclear charge requires around 22 pounds of plutonium.) 
According to Nikolay Arkhangelsky, a staffer at the Russian nuclear energy 
ministry who monitored North Korean-Russian cooperation, even this figure 
appears slightly exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
 A skeptic might argue that North Korea may have chosen to manufacture a 
uranium bomb like the one used at Hiroshima. But do the North Koreans have the 
capacity to build such a bomb? Russian experts know that North Korea has 
uranium-ore reserves of 26 million tons, enough to produce 15,000 tons of 
uranium. The country has two uranium mines, in Pakchon and Pengasan, and two 
uranium-enrichment facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 But these two facilities are intended to extract uranium from uranium ore. 
Enriching extracted uranium with uranium-235 is quite a different matter. Only 
the five nuclear powers have weapons-grade uranium-enrichment technology, which 
is extremely expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 It was rumored that Pyongyang has brought a considerable amount of 
35%-enriched uranium from a third country. Even so, the weight of a charge made 
with this relatively low-grade uranium would be 600 tons (based on the fact 
that a nuclear charge makes up 60% to 70% of a warhead's weight). It would be 
difficult to budge such a warhead, let alone hurl it at an enemy. After all, 
the Saturn 5 rocket, the world's most powerful missile, can carry a payload of 
only 135 tons. 
</P>
<P>
 A bomb made with 80%-enriched uranium would weigh about 10 tons. But Pyongyang 
lacks a vehicle to carry such a warhead. Indeed, its prospects for developing 
such an missile are not good, due to a shortage of skilled personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 But the key to North Korea's nuclear capability is its development of a device 
that explodes the nuclear payload. "Even if the North Koreans have produced a 
ton of plutonium, they have gone only 30% of the way toward the creation of an 
efficient nuclear weapon," says Arkady Brish, Russia's chief designer of 
nuclear charges. "The key is the nuclear explosive device." 
</P>
<P>
 Russians have known the importance of this device for a long time. After 
Nikita S. Khrushchev passed along the secret of uranium enrichment to China, 
the Chinese soon requested the secret technology for building the explosive 
device. Khrushchev was inclined to give them what they wanted; the relevant 
documents were loaded onto a railroad car for delivery to China. But following 
a Politburo debate, China's request was turned down. The documents were 
torched. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, lacking a nuclear explosive device, North Korea probably lacks the bomb. 
How else to explain the absence of any test-site explosion in North Korea. What 
is more, there is no evidence that construction of a testing site is under way. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be absurd to claim that a country could build a nuclear explosive 
device of its own without staging at least one test explosion. But could the 
North Koreans conduct a secret, extremely low-power nuclear explosion that does 
not require the construction of a large testing site in the hope that foreign 
seismic stations might mistake it for a conventional explosion? Quite unlikely. 
The sophistication of seismic technology makes it possible to distinguish 
between a conventional and a nuclear -- even if very low power -- explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 True, the North Koreans could do without an explosive device and use their 
stock of plutonium as a radiological weapon, "the poor man's bomb." That is, 
they could put the plutonium inside a warhead and launch it on a missile. The 
fallout plutonium (it does not explode) could spread to cover a large area and 
do a lot of damage. But such a use of plutonium would be highly inefficient. 
</P>
<P>
 Truth be told, North Korea may be keeping inspectors out of its atomic 
facilities because once there, they could figure out that Pyongyang does not 
have the bomb. North Korea's bluff would be called, and everyone would realize 
that "the king has no clothes on."*

LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW; HARIS PASOVIC; ENSURING CULTURE SURVIVES AMID THE 
HORRORS OF SARAJEVO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Danica Kirka, Danica Kirka, a journalist now based in Zagreb, is a former 
articles editor on the Opinion section. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sarajevo's siege failed to strangle the resolve of producer and theatrical 
director Haris Pasovic. Like other Sarajevans who have refused to surrender to 
the pressure of daily mortar bombardments, Pasovic has doggedly insisted on 
using his work to express what many of his fellow countrymen feel. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasovic capitalized on the siege to expand his horizons. In a nondescript 
office building in the once cosmopolitan city's capital, the prematurely 
graying 32-year-old plots the outlines of his next production. Sitting in a 
chilly room decorated with film-festival posters, Pasovic describes his 
excitement in presenting theater to people starving for expression of their 
views and for the simple drama of live performance. He has taken productions to 
hospitals, refugee camps and other areas besieged by shelling, creating 
vibrancy in a city filled with destruction. Producing "Waiting for Godot," 
under the direction of American author Susan Sontag, may be among his most 
noted credits, but Pasovic seems equally proud of his work organizing a film 
festival last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Defiant citizens appeared for the screenings of "Dracula" and other popular 
films in their best clothes, jewelry and makeup -- though the 20,000 people who 
attended the 10-day festival had to dodge bullets on one of Sarajevo's more 
notorious sniper-infested streets to make it to the front door. 
</P>
<P>
 What puzzled Pasovic was not the audience's willingness to risk their lives to 
come. "Many people, many journalists asked, 'Why the film festival during the 
war?,' " he said. "I asked, 'Why the war during the film festival?' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Do you think the rest of the world has trouble understanding what 
you in Sarajevo are going through?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Sure. Sure. Now I've started to understand why it is so. Simply 
because this kind of experience goes beyond everything known. And it cannot be 
rationalized at the moment. Many people who have experienced Auschwitz or some 
very harsh wrong or the (marketplace) massacre, of course -- they can feel it. 
They can understand. 
</P>
<P>
 When I read something about World War II right now, I read it completely 
differently than before the war. Before the war, it was a strange account, the 
facts, a generality. Now it's very specific . . . . We are angry when we say 
the world doesn't care about this place and so on. But we shouldn't be angry so 
much, simply because there are things that are not understandable at all. 
</P>
<P>
 When there was the earthquake -- the last one in California -- when I saw 
people lining up for the water, with the containers, they were like my 
brothers. I understood what they felt at the time . . . . It was like a report 
from Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What does art mean in a time of great suffering? Does it have greater 
meaning than it would in a time of peace?  
</P>
<P>
 A: It's as if you asked me what food means in a time of suffering, or 
(anything) which is normal, human and life-producing . . . . The meaning of art 
in a time of suffering, a time of war, is much more intense. People are more 
focused . . . . You have to imagine that for more than two years there was no 
electricity in town, so most people haven't watched TV, they didn't listen to 
the radio, they didn't listen to music. We were completely cut off . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 You find yourself in your apartment, waiting to be killed, because your 
neighbor has been killed. And, of course, for one week, for two weeks, it's a 
kind of temporary crisis, and you can bear it somehow . . . . But after one 
month, two months, it's completely insulating. 
</P>
<P>
 I think it's even worse than a jail . . . . I've never been in jail, but as 
far as I know, you are cut off from the world. But most prisoners know they did 
something which was wrong and for that reason they are suffering the 
punishment. This time, first of all, you weren't in a prison. You were in your 
own apartment. Plus, you didn't do anything wrong . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 What to do? . . . . You find some kind of courage, and new pride. And then you 
see what is given to you -- excluding the war. And what was given to people 
was, in our case, theater, film, music, literature, architecture and visual 
arts . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 For yourself, it was, maybe, your last exhibition, your last concert. And that 
gave a specific intensity. You played productions, performances, knowing that 
maybe it was going to be the last production, the last performance. And the 
audience knew the same. And that basic feeling returned us to the basic 
simplicity of life. We lost our egomania. We lost our self-importance. And 
we've (become) simply normal people, endangered, but still free in our hearts 
and in our minds . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is it ironic that art flourished here in a time of such stress?  
</P>
<P>
 A: It was a very strong and active presence . . . . (But) you need normal life 
for the flourishing of art. I don't want to mystify the situation. I don't want 
people to have a hidden desire to be in a war in order to be creative in their 
arts. It's better to walk on the beach on the Pacific, (watch) a sunset and 
make poetry. It's a better inspiration than listening to grenades and being 
afraid to be killed or injured. But the point is, that even in such an extreme 
situation, the artist remains the artist; and for me, the major feature which 
defines the artist is his or her vision for freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you think, then, that people are seizing upon culture to remind them of 
what their lives were once like?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Culture is a part of basic human nature, of deep humanity. It is normal 
that people are responding, in a cultural way, to crisis. Life is not just 
food, it's something spiritual. People live also with feelings, not just with 
their stomachs. People have to have food for their souls. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to generalize. It's something to do with the rhythm of life. 
(Without art), it just makes us forget something that is more subtle, and more 
needed for our dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do people respond to art in troubled times?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I think the response is great. It's proved by 20,000 people who line up in 
Sarajevo for a film festival. We had packed houses for every production. People 
responded to the very fact we were working under those circumstances . . . . Q: 
But are you able to function under these circumstances?  
</P>
<P>
 A: These circumstances are wonderful, compared with the circumstances before 
the ultimatum . . . . For example, today, when we talk, there's not such a 
chance to die on the spot. In all other days before this ultimatum, it was. It 
wasn't a fictional point. It was a real chance to die at any place, at any time 
in the city. And it created a special kind of behavior, a special way of moving 
through the city. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember the days when we prepared our latest productions. It was in 
December of last year, and it was one of the most difficult periods in the war. 
They was shelling every single day. Every single day, five or six people were 
massacred in the center of the city. And dozens were injured. But nobody was 
late for rehearsal. It was very exciting for me to work with people who decided 
to live, and to work. And from that feeling came a special strength which 
overcame the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 But honestly speaking, everything is pure luck. To survive in this city means 
before all, that you are the lucky one. So far. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Tell me about your last production, "Silk Drums."  
</P>
<P>
 A: The latest one was based on Japanese classical theater . . . . We've 
already played 18 productions in different places in the city, mostly in 
hospitals, refugee centers. Because this time we wanted to approach people who 
are not able to come to the theater -- the theater building. It was a very 
exciting, very special experience for all of us.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: What was the audience reaction?  
</P>
<P>
 A: It was incredible, because the first part, "Birdcatcher in Hell" is comic, 
so it's expected to be well-received. But the second part is a very 
sophisticated and a very difficult play of "Agoron." It's about the angel who 
fell from Earth, it's a kind of fairy tale, but in a Japanese Buddhist way, 
with a lot of dance. Almost every time, the entire audience was completely 
silent during the second part. We went to some places like the refugee centers 
where there were people . . . whom I'm not sure had ever seen the theater 
before . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 (At Kosevo hospital), most of (the audience) were without legs, without arms 
and (the lead actor) was dancing all the time. And they were shelling at the 
same time. So, it's impossible to transfer an experience like this one. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: To what do you attribute your reception? Was it the message of the play?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We are not talking about war, death and love in the production. We are 
talking about life, and dreams and freedom. Surely, it is the most difficult 
audience you can imagine. Because the audience has such experience, life 
experience. You hardly can match that experience. You have to do something at 
least at the same level of their experience. And we have the same experience as 
them. So, before we go before them, we try to translate our experience. 
</P>
<P>
 During the film festival, we had more than 20,000 people in 10 days. It was a 
major film festival. We had three theaters, 10 screenings per day. And the main 
hall was at the corner of . . . "Sniper Alley." They were shooting all the 
time. And people were coming to the screening with good perfumes -- the clothes 
were just wonderful. They would run across the street to avoid the snipers. 
Then, they would come to the theater . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you think that says about cinema, about theater?  
</P>
<P>
 A: In my mind, it is a basic need for spiritual improvement, for spiritual 
development. This war defines many things, including the journalism and the 
culture. The journalism appeared to be less powerful than we thought before the 
war. Culture appeared to be more powerful than we thought before the war. It 
proves that culture does not only belong to the bourgeois class. It belongs to 
everybody. People were eager to participate in these cultural activities, 
professional theater, film, exhibitions and so on . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 This situation moved the basic social instinct to survive. I always believed 
that art is the basic creative force in human nature. This situation proved it 
for all the people, not just for the artists. It is a life force. And 
everything that is a life force is welcomed . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Many people, many journalists, asked me during the film festival, "Why the 
film festival during the war?" But I say, "Why the war during the film 
festival?" -- that is the question. It's normal to have a film festival in a 
big European city . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 (But) this is a completely different reality. So, my theater experience helped 
me a lot to keep going. I treat my former life as something which happened, 
which is over, like a theater performance . . . . It was a big, and for me, a 
very happy production. And now, it's over. And it cannot be again anymore. This 
is another reality, a second life. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: After the war, will you return to the previous performance?  
</P>
<P>
 A: No. It's impossible. It doesn't look like the original. Never. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What will you do?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We must find something else. Something new. And when I say we, I don't just 
mean us in Sarajevo, in Bosnia . . . . We must find a new vision of the world.* 
</P>
<P>
 I don't want people to desire to be in a war to be creative. It's better to 
walk on the beach, (watch) a sunset. It's a better inspiration than listening 
to grenades. Life is not just food, it's something spiritual. People live also 
with feelings, not just with their stomachs. People have to have food for their 
souls. Preparing our latest productions, it was one of the most difficult 
periods in the war. They were shelling every day. But nobody was late for 
rehearsal.

AFRICAN AMERICAN HUMOR: A SHARED IRONIC VISION; BY CONCEALING SOCIAL CRITICISM 
BEHIND A MASK OF SELF-SATIRE, AFRICAN AMERICAN HUMORISTS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HELP 
AMERICA HEAL THE WOUNDS OF RACISM. AN ADAPTATION OF THE NEW BOOK "ON THE REAL 
SIDE."

<P>
 Humor -- as a folksy Southern relative of mine was fond of saying -- is 
something like a rich man's wallet: It's a hard nut to crack. No one seems able 
clearly to define it or explain why we laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 African American laughter, in particular, has been something of a mystery, a 
dilemma, or, quite often, a source of irritation for mainstream Americans from 
the time blacks first arrived in the 17th Century. Misconstrued or ignored, it 
was either labeled as naive, Sambo-like Tom-foolery or silenced and relegated 
to society's most inconspicuous corners. By the '80s, displayed center stage 
and often in prime-time without distortion, its meaning had become obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 Since African Americans have been inescapably engaged with the absurdity of 
America's racial arrangements for centuries, survival and sanity dictated that 
they adopt a comic view of society. As the novelist Ralph Ellison put it, 
because of "knowing the reality of a society that had the power to treat you as 
though you were actually inferior, but knowing within yourself that you were 
not, you were thrown into a position in which you were either going to develop 
a sense of humor or . . . die of frustration, of a sense of the irrational." 
</P>
<P>
 Most African Americans, as Ellison and the historian W.E.B. Du Bois have 
noted, have been compelled to view themselves through the eyes of others -- to 
engage in intensive, critical self-observation. They have also scrutinized 
other Americans and examined the contradictions that erode their claims of 
superiority. Black American humor is based on those perceptions. It is the 
shared ironic vision of a people who, in seeking to establish their place as 
Americans, have skeptically viewed the gap between appearances and reality and 
have often found contradiction and absurdity. 
</P>
<P>
 Playwright Luigi Pirandello's metaphor of "body and shadow" looms as the most 
fitting and enlightening definition of African American humor. African 
Americans have been portrayed as outsiders attempting to duplicate the customs 
and behavior of European Americans and ridiculed for not succeeding. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, often non-blacks imitated blacks, then struggled to give the 
impression that the mimicry was reversed. In the early 19th Century, for 
instance, a minor actor based his skit "Me and My Shadow" on the dance and 
lyrics of a black stable groom. In a more sardonic vein, the surfacing of a 
joke in the 1970s based on the hero of the 1950s radio show, "The Shadow" ("Who 
knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men? The Shadow do!"), reflected 
America's continued fascination with casting African Americans in shadow 
imagery. 
</P>
<P>
 For most of America's past, the main body has been unmindful of its own 
comical disfigurement. But from the slaves' animal tales in the 18th Century to 
Bert Williams' comic pathos in the 1900s, from Stepin Fetchit's willful 
lethargy in the '20s and '30s to Flip Wilson's effervescence and Richard 
Pryor's genius in the '60s and '70s, black America's comic vision has 
consistently focused on the mainstream as well as on itself. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1970s, released from the inconspicuous corners where its imagery was 
hidden and obscured, black humor assumed a more prominent role in America's 
social satire. Today, with its newfound exposure, it is perhaps more bold and 
belligerent. But not surprising, it still thrives on irony.  
</P>
<P>
 African American humor, after all, still sardonically amplifies the '70s 
vernacular joke: "Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men?" 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, "the Shadow do' " . . . and has for some time.*

STATE SMOKING BAN INITIATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Thanks for your article, "Pitch to Put Smoking Ban on Ballot Is Deceptive, 
Critics Say," April 10. 
</P>
<P>
 I am outraged that I was duped. Like Dave Emerson, I was only too ready to 
oblige the request to sign a petition against smoking in public places. I 
received the petition the next day. I thought it a bit of overkill when I also 
received a follow-up phone call urging me to immediately sign and mail the 
petition. I quickly scanned the contents, remarked to my husband that it really 
didn't go far enough, but I signed it thinking that anything is better than 
nothing. Unlike Emerson, I didn't notice the small print on the return envelope 
(Philip Morris Inc. among the backers). You can be sure in the future I will 
never sign another petition without reading every single word. 
</P>

<P>
 * On exiting from our local discount store, I was approached by a canvasser 
and requested to sign a petition. He said its purpose was "to put a stop 
smoking" measure on the ballot. I insisted on first reading the petition. It 
was reluctantly handed to me. 
</P>
<P>
 Lo and behold! The petition I was requested to sign was for a measure that 
would in effect, not stop smoking, but instead would greatly emasculate our 
city's present ordinance! 
</P>

 * In the next few weeks state lawmakers must reauthorize the distribution of 
Proposition 99 tobacco tax revenues. Under the terms of the initiative, 20% of 
the money (around $87 million) is required to go to fund the anti-smoking 
education account. The Wilson Administration proposes cutting the funding to 
11.7%. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 99's anti-tobacco public education campaign has proven itself as 
the most successful prevention effort in the United States. The numbers say it 
all: 1 million fewer smokers in California, 1.1 billion fewer packs sold and 
$385 million in saved health care costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of its phenomenal success, the tobacco industry and its legislative 
allies are out to destroy the Proposition 99 tobacco education fund. Losing 
sales of 1.1 billion packs of cigarettes hurts even the profitable cigarette 
makers, and they want the education fund killed. 
</P>
<P>
 California's tobacco control program has become a model to the nation of how 
to reduce the single largest cause of preventable death and disease. For the 
Legislature to continue to divert funds from the health education account would 
be to hand the nicotine pushers a major political victory and to defy the clear 
mandate of the voters.

PEOPLE NEED MORE THAN MORE PEOPLE; WHY U.S. MUST TAKE A STRONG LINE AT THE 
CAIRO POPULATION SUMMIT LATER THIS YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, leaders from many nations met to 
develop joint strategies to save the world's threatened natural resources. That 
high-profile U.N. conference proved to be an international embarrassment to the 
U.S. delegation; then-President George Bush, one of the conference 
participants, refused to sign the biodiversity treaty agreed to by more than 
100 other nations. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States now has a chance to redeem itself in the eyes of the world 
community: at the U.N. conference on population and development that convenes 
in Cairo in September. 
</P>
<P>
 In preparation for that meeting, delegates from 170 nations this month are 
drafting a document that is expected to win final approval in Cairo. The accord 
will serve as a blueprint for international agencies and nations in designing 
and funding effective population programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The relentless growth in world population -- now at 5.7 billion, double that 
of the late 1950s -- increases pressure on remaining arable lands; the number 
of people may outstrip the planet's ability to feed them. Obviously, much rides 
on the strength of the draft being hammered out at U.N. headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. delegation now meeting with its counterparts at the United Nations 
understands the urgency. Led by State Department counselor Timothy Wirth, the 
American delegation, along with key allies, is promoting new approaches to 
family planning based on important insights from past successes and failures. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, broad support is growing for a move away from coercive programs 
to those that focus on expanding health services -- including contraceptives, 
prenatal care and sex education for girls and adolescents -- and, importantly, 
on changing the fertility rates of men as well as women. 
</P>
<P>
 In many countries, men often have second families, meaning that on average 
they have far more living children than do women; yet population programs 
historically have been targeted at women, almost to the exclusion of men. 
</P>
<P>
 It hardly needs stating that this new approach makes sense. But strong 
opposition, for example from Nicaragua, Honduras and some African nations, 
could result in a much weaker, less effective consensus document. It should 
not.

REMEMBERING THINGS THAT NEVER HAPPENED?; THE THERAPEUTIC COMMUNITY MUST POLICE 
ITSELF BETTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A jury in Napa has the unenviable task of doing what leaders of the 
psychotherapy professions have been unwilling or unable to: determine whether 
certain therapists have been planting false memories of childhood sexual abuse 
in patients. The jury is hearing a civil suit filed by Gary A. Ramona. The 
first of its kind, the suit charges that two therapists persuaded the winery 
executive's grown daughter that he raped and otherwise abused her for 13 years 
during childhood. As a result, he says, he lost his job, marriage and home and 
he is demanding $8 million from the therapists, one a psychiatrist and the 
other a marriage, family and child counselor. 
</P>
<P>
 Memory experts say horrible childhood experiences can indeed be buried and 
recovered later in therapy. However, evidence grows that some therapists driven 
by ideologues of the feminist fringe, others by the quest for money, find signs 
of incestuous sexual abuse in almost all patients. Mostly the patients are 
female, but male patients are involved too. 
</P>
<P>
 SATANIC DOINGS: The False Memory Syndrome Foundation in Philadelphia claims 
12,000 families have been affected by erroneous memory recall. In a San 
Francisco Examiner series last year, Stephanie Salter documented many 
questionable cases, such as one in which a college student sued her parents 
after an Orange County psychologist helped her "remember" that her parents had 
subjected her to sodomy, rape, torture and cannibalism in a satanic cult. All 
of this echoes the McMartin Pre-school case in Manhattan Beach, in which 
therapists elicited from children tales of molestation, satanic rituals and 
other horrors, none of which could be corroborated by physical evidence. The 
defendants were acquitted after years of trials in which Los Angeles County 
spent $15 million in taxpayer money. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly psychiatry and psychology for too long ignored the devastating 
effects of childhood sexual abuse on its victims. This deplorable history makes 
it difficult to ignore anyone making a claim of abuse, no matter how dated. The 
memory therapists have found support from some leading academic psychiatrists, 
notably Judith Lewis Herman of the Harvard Medical School, who calls the Ramona 
case part of the "social backlash" against women's advancement and argues that 
such suits are yet another example of what sexually exploitative men do to 
their daughters.  
</P>
<P>
 Recovered memory has found fertile ground in California, with its 75,000 
licensed therapists (about 20,000 of them marriage and family counselors), not 
to mention all manner of unlicensed therapists practicing unconventional 
methods like screaming and Rolfing. Those seeking lost memories, sometimes 
using unproven memory-enhancing techniques like hypnosis, have been encouraged 
by recent changes in law in California and other states extending the statute 
of limitations to up to six years from the time of recall rather than actual 
abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 JOB FOR SACRAMENTO: The vast majority of therapists are capable and ethical. 
By its nature psychotherapy is more difficult to standardize and monitor than, 
say, gall bladder surgery. Boards that oversee the counseling professions are 
notoriously lax, seldom acting except in cases of extreme misconduct, such as a 
therapist having sex with a patient. 
</P>
<P>
 The therapeutic community must police itself better. The professions should 
require the same kind of informed consent on risks and alternative treatments 
that patients normally give for surgery. Meanwhile, state lawmakers must make 
it easier for true victims of abuse to seek redress and harder for false ones. 
The rules of evidence in trials must be tightened: Recovered memory can be 
real, but should it be admitted as trial evidence without corroboration? Lives 
should not be ruined on the basis of the kind of spectral evidence used to burn 
witches in Salem.

SMOKE GETS IN YOUR EYES WITH THIS ONE; PURPORTED ANTI-SMOKING INITIATIVE IS A 
COVER FOR TOBACCO LOBBY'S FIGHT AGAINST LOCAL LAWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Let the public beware: Professional signature gatherers are trying to qualify 
an initiative for the November ballot that purports to favor a "single, tough, 
uniform statewide law" to regulate smoking in restaurants. Uniform the new law 
would be, but only those given to delusions would believe that a measure backed 
by a tobacco company -- Philip Morris Inc. -- could possibly be tough. The 
initiative would in fact wipe out the approximately 270 effective local 
ordinances that limit or ban smoking in the workplace and in restaurants. Those 
measures enjoy broad public support and have the endorsement of most major 
health organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 In their place would go a weaker rule that would significantly roll back much 
of the progress that has lately been made to protect the nonsmoking public from 
the disease-promoting and even cumulatively fatal effects of tobacco smoke. The 
initiative is a deception, plain and simple, a fraud upon the public. No one 
who is concerned about public health could possibly support it. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to complaints about the misleading claims made by the initiative's 
advocates, acting Secretary of State Tony Miller has warned that deliberate 
misrepresentation of a measure's contents in the course of gathering signatures 
is a crime that "will not be tolerated." That warning may have been responsible 
for halting an expensive phone-bank operation that sought backing for the 
initiative by claiming that it would impose strict regulations on smoking in 
public places. 
</P>
<P>
 It hardly needs demonstrating that tobacco companies are not in the business 
of promoting anti-smoking measures. They make their money by selling 
cigarettes. One unfortunate marketing problem they face is that their product 
keeps killing off their clientele; as successive U.S. surgeons general have 
reminded us, smoking contributes to close to 500,000 American deaths each year 
from various cancers, heart disease, stroke and emphysema. So the demand for 
cigarettes has to be constantly bolstered. That's harder to do, though, when 
smoking is actively discouraged by law, as it is with local bans or strict 
limits on smoking in restaurants and workplaces. That's why the tobacco 
industry wants to override community rules with a statewide law that has been 
drafted to its own specifications, to serve its own interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Smoking kills, and any weakening of anti-smoking laws, however it may be 
disguised, shamefully abets needless deaths. The purported anti-smoking 
initiative is a sham, to be scorned and rejected.

POLICE RESIDENCY AND SWAT TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I vowed to remain disinterested in the debate about police officer residency 
in Los Angeles because it is really no more than a marginal issue which 
politicians love to jump into to appear to be doing something to improve the 
LAPD. But the Op-Ed piece by a local ACLU official cannot go unchallenged 
(April 11). It was asserted that a good method to increase city residency would 
be to provide low- or no-interest home mortgages, and low-rent or rent-free 
apartments. Because the city cannot afford such largess, the federal government 
could be called upon as such programs are provided by the feds for free. 
</P>
<P>
 This comment would be amusing if it did not represent the attitude of a large 
segment of the American population. It is also a major factor behind the 
$4.4-trillion debt that our children are facing. Government programs are not 
free, they are paid for by the hard work of people who pay taxes. And in the 
end, they are really paid for by the profits of businesses that employ those 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 If any level of government has surplus funds, let's spend it helping L.A.'s 
street cops by adding to their ranks, providing competitive salaries and 
equipment, and effectively building a Police Department capable of handling the 
mounting problems it faces as it marches toward the 21st Century. Jumping on 
the bandwagon of every unproven theory about how to improve urban policing is 
simply the illusion of progress and reform. 
</P>

 * It was with a great deal of interest that I read the article regarding the 
first female police officer admitted to the LAPD SWAT team (April 7). I am a 
retired LAPD officer and was a member of SWAT when it was originated in the 
late 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 From the information in the article it appears that the only reason Officer 
Nina Damianakes was selected was because of her lawsuit. She tried and failed 
the standard test for admittance twice. I am not discrediting the officer for 
her service as a police officer but rather her attempt to integrate a unit 
whose standards for admittance are extremely difficult to achieve. There is a 
good reason for that, as pointed out in your article. If Officer Damianakes 
suffered stress simply applying for the position, who knows what would happen 
to her or those around her in a real field SWAT situation. 
</P>
<P>
 This to me is just another example of lowering the LAPD standards to meet the 
applicants instead of bringing the applicants up to meet the standards.

<P>
 * In response to "Lungren Declines to Seize Profits on Koon's Book," April 9: 
</P>
<P>
 If Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren arbitrarily chooses to enforce certain laws of 
California on a selective basis, how then can the people of the state expect 
him to competently discharge his responsibilities as the state attorney general 
in an impartial and objective fashion, which he has sworn to do?

<P>

<P>
 * As if former Los Angeles Police Department Sgt. Stacey Koon hasn't been 
vilified enough, now state Assemblyman Phillip Isenberg (D-Sacramento) would 
like us to believe that he should join the ranks of David Berkowitz and Charles 
Manson and be prevented from profiting from his so-called "crimes." 
</P>
<P>
 I certainly am not saying that the crimes that Manson and Berkowitz committed 
are not disgusting and evil. I am not saying that they should get a dime for 
telling their tales. But let's get some perspective. They are murderers. Koon 
is not. In fact, the "victim" of his crimes is very much alive and stands to be 
compensated handsomely, courtesy of the taxpayers of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Admittedly, I know little about the wording and enforcement of California's 
Son of Sam law. Perhaps someone can explain to me how a book that was written, 
published, and went on sale before Koon was convicted of anything can 
constitute "profiting from a crime"? 
</P>
<P>
 Though I'm sure it's hard for many people to understand, there are still some 
of us who believe that Stacey Koon and Laurence Powell got a raw deal. They 
have both been broken financially by two court trials. If I choose to buy 
Koon's book or contribute money to a fund to help him or Powell and their 
families, that is my right.

 * I agree that those of us in public education should investigate the apparent 
financial successes of Vaughn Street Elementary, a charter school (editorial, 
April 5). It should also be noted that several LEARN schools have achieved a 
surplus in their initial year of operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Your editorial spoke about improved attendance, future real estate purchases 
and operational cuts; however, I would like to know if the instructional 
program is better and if student outcomes have improved. The true measuring 
stick for a quality school is not found in a profit/loss monetary statement; it 
is most manifestly revealed in terms of student achievement. The LEARN schools 
have embarked on a systemic plan for improved student outcomes as part of a 
long-range investment. A quality educational program has nothing to do with a 
one-time financial windfall.

 * Hayden D. Hamilton's letter (April 10), in reference to the "wall" test for 
police candidates, also included a tongue-in-cheek comment about women 
firefighters.  
</P>
<P>
 As a battalion chief of the Los Angeles City Fire Department, and a supporter 
of the women firefighters, I take issue with his remarks.His comment, "We now 
have female firefighters who can't push a ladder up to a burning building," 
does not apply to the women of the L.A. City Fire Department. Those women all 
passed one of the severest tests of strength and willpower when they passed 
through the drill tower. They then were evaluated for 12 months by officers in 
the fire stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Women firefighters have worked diligently and with courage to gain the 
respected position of firefighter, and should not be castigated by lighthearted 
comments.

PERSPECTIVE ON U.S. AIR POWER; THE PERIL OF FORCE IN PENNY PACKETS; USING 
BOMBING AS A TOOL OF FOREIGN POLICY DEPENDS ON OUR WILLINGNESS TO DO, AND 
PERHAPS SUFFER, SOME SAVAGE DEEDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By ELIOT A. COHEN, Eliot A. Cohen is professor of strategic studies at the 
Nitze School of Advanced International Studies, Johns Hopkins University. This 
article is adapted in part from an essay in the January/February issue of 
Foreign Affairs. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Air power is an unusually seductive form of military strength, in part 
because, like modern courtship, it appears to offer gratification without 
commitment. Francis Bacon wrote of command of the sea that he who has it "is at 
great liberty, and may take as much and as little of the Warre as he will," and 
a similar belief accounts for air power's attractiveness to those who favor 
modest uses of force overseas. Statesmen may think that they can use air 
attacks to engage in hostilities by increments, something ground combat rarely 
permits. Or, as in the case of our recent operations in Bosnia, that they can 
communicate resolve, send diplomatic signals and nudge negotiations along, all 
with a few well-chosen 500-pound bombs. 
</P>
<P>
 This rise in air power's stock comes from its success in the Persian Gulf War, 
in which air power indeed made all the difference. American air operations 
crushed the Iraqi air-defense system, paralyzed the movement of Iraqi forces, 
deprived much of that country of electrical power and communications and 
inflicted losses amounting to perhaps two-fifths of the total number of tanks 
deployed to the theater. Although ground action necessarily consummated the 
final victory for coalition forces, air power had made the final assault as 
effortless as a wartime operation can be. 
</P>
<P>
 Reliance on air power has set the American way of war apart from all others 
for well over half a century. Other countries might field doughty infantry, 
canny submariners or scientific artillerists comparable in skill and numbers to 
America's. Only the United States, however, has engaged in a single-minded and 
successful quest for air superiority in every conflict it has fought since 
World War I. Air warfare remains distinctively American -- high tech, cheap in 
lives and (at least in theory) quick. To America's enemies -- past, current and 
potential -- it is the distinctively American form of military intimidation. 
Small wonder, then, that the U.N. commander in Bosnia called on American 
aircraft to drop a few symbolic bombs on the Bosnian Serbs. Small wonder too, 
given the astonishing successes of the Gulf War, how dismayed many observers 
were at the tragic shooting down of two American helicopters by two American 
fighters over northern Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 There are ill omens in both episodes. The tentative bombing of Bosnia 
demonstrates how easily statesmen can forget that air power has its greatest 
effect when used in quantity and in a compressed period of time. To use air 
power in penny packets is a mistake. The sprinkling of air strikes over an 
enemy will harden him without hurting him and deprive the United States of an 
invaluable, but intangible strategic asset -- the menace of concentrated aerial 
bombardment. The Bosnian Serbs, not shocked by the bombing (which in the most 
recent case consisted of an attempt to drop four bombs, one of which was never 
released, two of which were duds and only one of which may have hit its 
target), reacted to it with contempt. More important, they found a suitable 
countermeasure, the snatching of U.N. hostages (although no political leader 
will yet use the term) against more serious attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Iraqi episode probably hinges on mistakes made by fighter pilots or 
air-space controllers. But it is the kind of accident that was waiting to 
happen in an area where the United States has flown more sorties since the Gulf 
War than it did during it. These operations (like the supervision of a "no-fly 
zone" over Bosnia) involve sending men in high-speed aircraft, with live 
munitions, into harm's way. Sooner or later accidents, be they electronic 
glitches, bad weather or sheer misjudgment made by men accustomed to 
split-second decision-making, will happen. 
</P>
<P>
 The lesson of the Iraq episode is that if the United States wants to continue 
to use military power as a tool of foreign policy, it must steel itself for 
dreadful accidents of this kind. The lesson of Bosnia is, alas, the same lesson 
as that we should have learned from Somalia. To call the use of armed force 
"peacekeeping" or "humanitarian intervention" or "conflict resolution" is to 
avoid the simpler, uglier and more accurate term: war. Our intervention in 
Somalia led, ineluctably, to war with Gen. Mohammed Farah Aidid, a war that we 
lost although his casualties were, at a conservative estimate, 50 times ours. 
Our intervention in Bosnia looks to become war with the Bosnian Serbs, a 
low-level, nasty and perhaps cheap war -- although hardly so to the bereaved 
spouses, parents and children of service men or women who will pay the price. 
It is, of course, the President who is answerable to them, and not the 
secretary general of the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 In both cases, air power is an appropriate tool of our policy if indeed 
American policy-makers are convinced that the policies are important enough to 
mandate the use of force. But particularly in the Bosnian case, they should 
know that it is a tool of variable strength, depending greatly on the skill 
with which it is used. And that in turn means a willingness to do, and perhaps 
to suffer, some savage deeds. In particular, it is clear that the reaction of 
those exposed to U.S. air power is to seize hostages -- whether U.N. 
peacekeepers or simply unarmed civilians. Inevitably, a strategically effective 
use of air power will lead to the deaths of innocents. That grim warrior Gen. 
William Tecumseh Sherman understood that in modern conditions one could not 
wage warfare yet spare all but uniformed combatants. "You cannot qualify war in 
harsher terns than I will," he told the hapless leading citizens of Atlanta. 
"War is cruelty, and you cannot refine it." 
</P>
<P>
 American leaders at the end of this century have indeed been vouchsafed with a 
military instrument of a potency rarely known in the history of war. But they 
will serve the country best by putting the fabulous successes of the Gulf War 
in a larger context, one in which the gloomy wisdom of Sherman tempers the 
brisk enthusiasm of those who see air power as a shining sword, effortlessly 
wielded, that can create and preserve a just and peaceful world order. They owe 
it to those they lead, and to their fellow citizens, to own up to the risks 
they wish the armed forces to run, to admit the bluntness of the instrument 
they intend to employ, and to use force effectively, if they intend to use it 
all all.

COLUMN LEFT/ JOHN TIRMAN: 'FRIENDLY FIRE' ACCUSATIONS MISS THE MARK; WE SHOULD 
BE DEBATING HOW TO USE U.S. FORCES AND WHETHER THEY ARE PROPERLY TRAINED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

World Peace in Washington.

<TEXT>
<P>
 When the two U.S. Blackhawk helicopters were shot down by U.S. warplanes 
Thursday over Iraq, killing 26 people, it provided some insights into the 
emerging debate over America's military role in the post-Cold War era. 
</P>
<P>
 Within hours, Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), the next House minority leader, 
blamed President Clinton for cutting defense too deeply while spreading U.S. 
forces too broadly "across the planet." Gingrich's comments echo the 
Republicans' oft-repeated complaint that Clinton is creating a "hollow army" 
with too few resources to keep forces prepared to do battle. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days earlier, two GOP House members, Steven Buyer of Indiana and Henry 
Bonilla of Texas, appeared on the "MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour" to assess 
Clinton's policy in Bosnia, where U.S. warplanes under NATO command had just 
bombed Serbian artillery positions near Gorazde. Buyer and Bonilla both chimed 
the same tune: Multilateral peacekeeping is a loser because American forces 
should not be under foreign commanders. The forces are "less efficient," 
Bonilla said. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, then, are two legs of the Republican triad of American power: We should, 
they say, maintain an exceptionally well-heeled military, and we should eschew 
multilateralism in all its forms. The third leg, which underlies the "see no 
evil" approach to outrages like the dictatorship in Haiti, is that the United 
States should act militarily only to protect our "vital national interests." 
Those vital interests, however, are rarely if ever articulated. 
</P>
<P>
 The sad incident over Iraq is revealing because it demonstrates how empty and 
partisan this Republican triad is. Operation Provide Comfort was begun three 
years ago, following the Gulf War, because Republican President George Bush had 
encouraged Iraqi Kurds to rebel and then abandoned them to the bloody whims of 
Saddam Hussein. It was only after widespread humanitarian protests embarrassed 
Bush that relief efforts and a safe haven for Kurds were enabled by U.S. and 
allied forces. If there was overreach -- forces spread out too thinly across 
the planet -- it was done well before Clinton was inaugurated and with 
Republican support. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's "friendly fire" incident, far from exposing a "hollow" military, 
involved the most sophisticated equipment money can buy. And the aircraft were 
under U.S. command, transporting British, French and Turkish as well as 
American officers. The death toll was higher than the infamous firefight in 
Somalia last autumn that Republicans hold up as evidence for avoiding 
peacekeeping roles. There, too, U.S. forces were under U.S. command. 
</P>
<P>
 The vacuous critique by the Republicans, however, should not deter serious 
questions about U.S. military operations overseas. Indeed, there is a 
legitimate doubt about the advisability of Operation Provide Comfort. Is the 
United States, for example, to be the guarantor of Kurdish rights in northern 
Iraq indefinitely?  
</P>
<P>
 Puzzling, too, is our lack of attention to the mistreatment of Turkish Kurds 
just across the border. Turkey is being ripped apart by a civil war in which 
10,000 have died since 1984. Kurdish rights, so important in the Iraqi context, 
are ignored by the State Department just a few miles away. Washington's 
approach to the Turkish-Kurdish conflict is, almost exclusively, to supply 
weapons to the Turkish security forces; Turkey is now the third largest 
recipient of U.S. arms exports. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, the questions in Turkey and Iraq are complex. But it is 
increasingly clear that the United States cannot solve these complexities with 
military force. Like Bosnia, the Iraqi situation may be beyond satisfying 
solutions, with or without applications of armed might. That conclusion, like 
it or not, may apply to many conflicts around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 So the Republican critique misses the mark on at least two counts. The size 
and ability of U.S. armed forces are not in doubt; the question is how and when 
to use them, and whether they are trained properly for peacekeeping -- in 
contrast to Cold War -- missions. The matter of U.S. troops under foreign 
commanders is a red herring, thrown into the debate to stir up chauvinistic 
passions. 
</P>
<P>
 We should debate what our vital national interests are, however, and military 
intervention must always be based on clear and compelling purposes. In Iraq, it 
is that part of the Republican triad that should give us pause.

COLUMN RIGHT / THOMAS J. DUESTERBERG: BST IS NOT THE 'ANDROMEDA STRAIN'; FEAR 
OF BIOTECHNOLOGY, NOT SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE, IS BEHIND THE OPPOSITION TO BOVINE 
HORMONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS J. DUESTERBERG, Thomas J. Duesterberg directs the Competitiveness 
Center at Hudson Institute. He was U.S. assistant secretary for international 
economic policy in the Department of Commerce from 1989 to 1993. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A new chapter has been opened in the debate between self-styled environmental 
advocates and proponents of high-yield American agriculture. Only this time, 
the debate is more than academic. The environmental lobby's actions pose a 
threat not only to American agriculture but also to one of our fastest-growing 
high-technology industries and to consumers. They also threaten the global 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
 The event signaling a new era in this decades-old debate was the decision by 
several of the nation's largest food retailers to restrict sales of milk 
produced with the help of bovine somatotropin (BST), a genetically engineered 
hormone given to cows to increase their production of milk by 20% or more. Many 
of the large supermarket chains indicated that the pressure brought by 
environmental activists was a key element in their decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists variously argue that BST poses a threat to human health, 
that it is an environmental hazard because it is genetically engineered and 
that it continues a pattern of overproduction of milk in the United States that 
hurts farmers and leads to environmental degradation. 
</P>
<P>
 One argument that can easily be disposed of is the central one of safety. The 
Food and Drug Administration has thoroughly investigated BST for more than 10 
years. It has approved the growth hormone with no reservations, and a review of 
all known studies about BST recently completed by the federal government found 
"there is no evidence that BST poses a health threat to humans or animals." 
</P>
<P>
 The opponents of BST see it as a test case for halting the broad use of 
genetically engineered products. With a vision inspired by movies like 
"Jurassic Park" and "The Andromeda Strain," scientific evidence and experience 
plays no part in their opposition to BST. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the fact that BST poses no health threat to man or animals, the 
eleventh-hour attempt to restrict its use would have severe consequences for 
industry, consumers, the environment and the standard of living of billions of 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 The assault on one of the premier products of the modern biotechnology 
revolution has economic consequences for both consumers and producers. First, 
increasing milk production would lower prices in the United States, while 
allowing increased exports to dynamic new markets like Mexico. Countries such 
as India, which is increasing milk consumption at the rate of 2 million tons 
per year in order to increase protein intake, could also use the new technology 
or import products from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 A more narrow concern is that the biotechnology industry is one of the most 
dynamic, successful and rapidly growing high-technology industries in the 
United States. We routinely create new products in health care and food 
technology that are exported around the world. Because of the debate over 
health-care reform, that industry is currently under siege. Entrepreneurs and 
investors are no longer sure that they will get their products approved and be 
able to make a profit sufficient to justify investment risks. In 1993, the 
biotechnology industry saw its market value fall by 40% and the value of new 
capital flowing to the industry fall by two-thirds. 
</P>
<P>
 BST has the promise to be one of the stars of the biotechnology industry. If 
the restrictions on BST by the supermarkets hold, then this product could just 
be another nail in the coffin of one of America's most promising industries. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there is a consequence of the assault on BST and other 
high-technology products to enhance food production that should trouble any 
true friend of the environment. By increasing the efficiency of production, we 
can produce more food on less land. The promise of BST, genetically engineered 
plants like the new high-yielding rice strains or the longer-lasting tomato, is 
to produce more high quality food on less land in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 If all the world's farmers switched to the organic methods favored by the 
enviro-Luddites, to feed the current population would require bringing forest 
and virgin lands the size of all of South America into production and suffering 
a degradation in the qualities of freshness and appearance in food that most 
American consumers have come to expect. Furthermore, only the United States, 
Argentina, Brazil and a few other countries could hope to be self-sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
 Deploying BST and other innovative biotechnology products is a major part of 
the answer to this dilemma. That is all the more reason to have a rational 
debate on its merits, one that is based on solid fact instead of destructive 
nostalgia.

THE STATE; RIORDAN'S POWER FACES THE CRUCIAL TEST: CAN IT OVERCOME AUTHORITY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Xandra Kayden, Xandra Kayden is a visiting scholar at the Center for 
Politics and Economics at Claremont Graduate School and author of Surviving 
Power (Free Press). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard J. Riordan will face his first big constitutional challenge as mayor 
this Wednesday when he carries out one of three powers granted to him by the 
City Charter: present a budget to the City Council. In the annals of power, it 
is certainly a far cry from the authority he enjoyed after the Northridge 
earthquake, when the Charter gave him emergency powers. But it will be his 
success -- or failure -- in this sort of day-to-day business that will 
determine what kind of mark he leaves on city government. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Riordan has been a surprise to both his supporters and opponents. But 
in the absence of legal authority, being a surprise is almost as good as 
enumerated powers. By keeping others off guard, it gives him control of the 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Who would have imagined, for example, that a Republican businessman would 
begin his tenure in office by taking on the airlines -- his constituency? Or 
who would have thought that a campaigner who vowed to raise money by 
privatizing city services would opt for city workers to clean up the debris 
created by the quake? 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not ideological," Riordan explained when asked about his decision not to 
let contracts. Although some speculate he chose not to privatize the clean-up 
job because he was angry at council members who sought to steer the business 
toward their friends, it certainly shocked his friends who bid on the 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 William R. McCarley, the mayor's chief of staff, says his boss' power flows 
from "a kind of disarming charm. . . . He seems to be able to get people to do 
things that they otherwise wouldn't, because they are either charmed, 
befuddled, nonplussed or whatever." 
</P>
<P>
 Many credit Riordan with being the most critical player in getting the Santa 
Monica Freeway on the move again. It was federal money that paid for the 
reconstruction. And the money did flow through state channels. But the 
expectation -- indeed, demand -- that the freeway be rebuilt quickly came from 
Riordan. If power, like beauty, is something that exists in the eye of the 
beholder, Riordan may need to make sure he gets more of the credit. 
</P>
<P>
 Any new mayor, to be sure, would have come into office with energy, ideas and 
new people. Change was inevitable after a 20-year incumbency. But how able 
Riordan is in putting his ideas into practice will depend on the perception 
that he has power. Since his authority is so circumscribed by the Charter, his 
power will rest on more ephemeral things -- such as his unpredictability and 
his popularity, as well as his political skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "The candor -- and also being willing to say, well, gee, maybe I fouled that 
one up, or I should have talked to you, I didn't mean to offend you -- is a 
practiced art," claims McCarley. "Maybe not always practiced," he added, "but 
he is very goal-directed." 
</P>
<P>
 Therein lies the uncertainty about the mayor. How much of what Riordan does is 
inner-directed and how much comes from being a person who is perhaps too 
responsive to those around him? How "enraged" was he really when the Police 
Protective League put up billboards depicting an unsafe Los Angeles? Did he 
break off negotiations as a ploy, which would be a conscious use of power, or 
because he is hot-headed? 
</P>
<P>
 The budget will reflect the mayor's priorities, and the police department is 
likely to be at the top of the list. It will not do a lot for the poor, nor 
will it allay the distrust and anger in the city. Maybe that will come later. 
He is seeking structural changes in important agencies like the Community 
Redevelopment Agency and the Department of Public Works, which is both 
unprecedented and bold. And he might succeed because he really does have more 
power to get his budget through than either the President or the governor has 
with theirs: If the council rewrites it, and he vetoes it, he only needs six 
votes to prevent an override, in which case his budget goes into effect. Score 
one for the institutional power of the mayor, a power Bradley rarely exercised, 
perhaps with cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, since the Council enjoys greater authority under the Charter, the mayor 
will have to learn how to work with its members; he certainly cannot afford to 
alienate them. If he wins this round, the next challenge is likely to come when 
the task force headed by Daniel P. Garcia discloses its recommendations on how 
to streamline planning decision-making. They will call for taking power out of 
the hands of the Council -- and the members are likely to unite against that. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's penchant for unpredictability, whether by design or temperament -- 
and his current popularity -- have given him more power than the rules would 
otherwise suggest. But as Garcia, an experienced hand in city politics, notes, 
the mayor has "as much power as the council will let him have." The time may 
soon come when authority matters more than power.*

STAGE WATCH: VA-VA-VOOM FOR SHAKESPEARE TROUPE'S NEW LOCALE

 Shakespeare Festival/L.A., the company that has staged free, professional 
Shakespeare for the past six summers at John Anson Ford Amphitheatre, is moving 
to a Japanese garden on the grounds of the Veterans Administration in West Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The new site already has a new name: Stratford on VAvon. VA -- get it? 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, the group's artistic director, Ben Donenberg, pulled out of the 
county-owned John Anson Ford in Hollywood, after a scheduling dispute with the 
county. Even then, Donenberg mentioned the possibility of the Veterans 
Administration site, which he discovered while playing basketball in the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he has worked out a deal to use the VA space for free in exchange for 
restoring the site and maintaining it with the help of some of the veterans who 
are enrolled in the VA's compensated work therapy program. 
</P>
<P>
 He plans to seat 800 nightly on bleachers, folding chairs and blankets. Three 
weeks of "Twelfth Night," featuring David Ogden Stiers as Malvolio, will open 
July 2, with Renaissance Fair-style attractions surrounding the alfresco 
theater. The stage will be part of a vehicle dubbed "Will's Wheels" that will 
enable the festival to move it to other sites later in the summer for 
performances of "Comedy of Errors" by the group's young company. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the "Twelfth Night" company, the "Comedy of Errors" troupe will 
probably be non-union. Last year's young company performed with six union 
contracts, and Donenberg hasn't completely abandoned hope of identifying the 
additional $40,000 he says is necessary to use a few union actors. He expects, 
though, that the expense of converting to the new operation is likely to 
require this temporary backtrack on the organization's road to full Equity 
status. 
</P>
<P>
 Equity, which awarded Donenberg $500 last year for his determination to stick 
with union contracts, is reluctantly approving Donenberg's backtrack, although 
official approval is still required from the union's headquarters in New York. 
"We're very unhappy about it," said the union's Western regional director, 
George Ives. "We've told him it's for one year only. But we recognize his 
problems this year." 
</P>
<P>
 The union insisted that the two companies be clearly differentiated in their 
names. Donenberg plans to call the second troupe the "Young Professional 
Company." 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of the new "Will's Wheels," the young company will probably 
visit more sites than ever. However, it won't be back at South Coast Botanic 
Garden, which it has visited for the past two summers. Donenberg and the 
garden's foundation recently parted company over the terms of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Another site in the South Bay area will be found, pledged Donenberg, and then 
"Comedy of Errors" also will travel to Citicorp Plaza in downtown Los Angeles 
(opening Aug. 11 for one or two weekends), and, for the first time, to Descanso 
Gardens in La Canada Flintridge (Aug. 24-28). An additional downtown venue may 
be added if the show becomes part of the opening festivities of Grand Hope 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 DOIN' THE DOOLITTLE: When the next Ahmanson-at-the-Doolittle series was 
announced recently, producing director Gordon Davidson said "A Celebration of 
the Songs of Leiber and Stoller," booked into the Doolittle for a Nov. 10-Jan. 
22 run, would get a better name. Davidson suggested "Hound Dog" as an example. 
</P>
<P>
 How about "D. W. Washburn's All-Dancin,' All-Singin,' Black & White, Jive Ass 
Rock 'n' Roll Revue"? 
</P>
<P>
 That's the working title, said the show's creator-director-choreographer Otis 
Sallid, who is currently preparing it for its summer bow at Royal George 
Theater Center in Chicago. Might that title be difficult to fit on a marquee? 
</P>
<P>
 "Make a bigger marquee," replied Sallid. 
</P>
<P>
 SPEAKING OF DAVIDSON: Actor J.D. Daniels, while accepting a Los Angeles Drama 
Critics Circle award last Sunday for his performance in the Doolittle's 
"Conversations With My Father," noted that "before I was even born," Davidson 
had "recognized great talent." 
</P>
<P>
 Daniels is all of 13 years old.

POP EYE: GEFFEN RECORDS CONCEDES NIRVANA NUGGETS NOT LIKELY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steve Hochman 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nirvana fans may be hoping to eventually console themselves over the loss of 
Kurt Cobain with future albums of previously unreleased material. 
</P>
<P>
 But the vaults are virtually empty, according to sources at Geffen Records. 
</P>
<P>
 The exception: Nirvana's acclaimed appearance last year on MTV's "Unplugged." 
That performance, featuring such band favorites as "Smells Like Teen Spirit" 
and "All Apologies," will likely be made available in both album and video 
form, though it's too early to think about a date. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the idea of an "Unplugged" album, including some songs not featured 
in the MTV telecast, had been in the talking stage before Cobain's suicide 
earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the songs that were on the telecast but had not been previously recorded 
by Nirvana are the traditional gospel number "Jesus Wants You for a Sunbeam" 
(which was played before the private memorial service for Cobain last Sunday in 
Seattle) and an old Meat Puppets song featuring a guest appearance by that 
band. 
</P>
<P>
 Several songs from that taping were originally to have been included on an EP 
that was intended for a release tied to the band's planned headlining slot on 
the "Lollapalooza '94" tour this summer. But when Nirvana pulled out from 
"Lollapalooza" last month, the EP plans were scrapped. 
</P>
<P>
 Other live recordings of the band do exist, the sources say, but it is 
unlikely that they will be turned into an album. And virtually every B-side or 
alternative take has already been released, either on Nirvana's own 1992 
"Incesticide" collection or, in the case of the sarcastic "I Hate Myself and I 
Want to Die," on last year's "Beavis and Butt-head Experience" compilation. 
</P>
<P>
 Geffen Records is being cautious about doing anything that could be perceived 
as capitalizing on Cobain's death. No promotional activity will be undertaken 
for existing Nirvana recordings, and the company even put a moratorium on 
promotion for the new album by Hole, the band fronted by Cobain's widow 
Courtney Love, which was released last week. 
</P>
<P>
 But that will do nothing to stem an inevitable tide of unofficial Nirvana 
material. The bootleg record market is certain to be flooded with CDs made from 
illegal tapes of Nirvana concerts. And St. Martin's Press announced just days 
after Cobain's death that it is preparing what will undoubtedly be the first of 
many "quickie" books about the tragic life and death of the singer. 
</P>
<P>
 STREET FIGHT: Have you heard that version of Bruce Springsteen's "Streets of 
Philadelphia" from the Oscar telecast that some radio stations are playing? The 
one with the sound bites of Springsteen's and Tom Hanks' Academy Awards 
acceptance speeches mixed in? 
</P>
<P>
 Want to hear it again? 
</P>
<P>
 Then you'd better tape it the next time it's on the air, because it may be 
your last chance. 
</P>
<P>
 The version of the song, which won the Oscar as best original song for its 
role in the AIDS drama "Philadelphia," was made by Columbia Records from a tape 
of the Oscar telecast and distributed by the company to radio stations around 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences says that such usage is a 
violation of the organization's copyright, and academy lawyers are telling 
radio programmers, including Los Angeles station KIIS-FM (102.7) that they must 
stop -- or face legal action. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything off the show is owned by the academy," says academy spokesman Bob 
Werden. News programs, he says, are allowed to air excerpts of up to one minute 
in length during the six days following the telecast. After that, even shorter 
segments must be cleared in writing. The use of a whole song, with or without 
added sound bites, is completely against the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Bert Baumgartner, senior vice president of Columbia Records, acknowledges that 
this was done without the consent of the academy, though Springsteen's 
representatives approved of the remix -- which they say the singer has not 
heard. The version was put together by Columbia after several deejays around 
the country made their own mixes of the live performance and speech excerpts. 
</P>
<P>
 KIIS program director Jeff Wyatt says that he'd been airing the original 
version of the song about twice a day, but his listeners found it "depressing." 
The new version, though, with Springsteen's low-key remarks about the power of 
art to touch the public and Hanks' emotional speech about tolerance and love 
for AIDS sufferers, earned a dramatic response. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we're playing it about four times a day," Wyatt says. "It grabs you in a 
different way. It's a pretty touching piece." 
</P>
<P>
 Baumgartner says there's no question that the special version helped get the 
song played more on stations that had resisted it -- the song has become 
Springsteen's first Top 10 single since "Tunnel of Love" more than six years 
ago. But he also defends the unauthorized release on grounds that it helps 
spread a message. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't imagine anyone wanting to stop it," he says. "It's still an 
important message as far as AIDS (awareness) is concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 BREAK UP, MAKE UP: One of the great romances of pop music looked as if it was 
on the rocks recently, but the two parties have patched things up and are once 
again a happy couple. 
</P>
<P>
 That's right, KROQ and Morrissey -- the L.A. radio station and one of its 
longtime favorite artists -- are back on good terms after a few scheduling 
gaffes caused KROQ deejays and fans to pour out a stream of rage against the 
singer recently. 
</P>
<P>
 The KROQers were miffed that Morrissey had postponed on short notice his 
scheduled April 8 concert at the Olympic Auditorium, for which the station had 
given away a lot of tickets. And just days before, the station had helped 
organize a large gathering of Morrissey fanatics at LAX to greet the arriving 
star, only to have him whisked away through another part of the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 KROQ music director Darcy Sanders says that the blow-up is over and forgotten 
now and that Morrissey's new "Vauxhall and I" album continues to be one of the 
most popular releases at the station. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold Stiefel, Morrissey's manager, says that he's sorry that the fans and 
station were put out and promises to make it up with a special appearance by 
Morrissey around the time of the rescheduled Olympic date in August. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was unfortunate that they who were so nurturing and behind Morrissey felt 
the brunt of the postponement and other comedy of errors," he says. Steve 
Hochman

 Coming off the success of his independently released single "The Most 
Beautiful Girl in the World," Prince has tabbed Ice Cube to direct the video 
for a new song, "Love Sign," which is apparently part of an upcoming album he's 
working on for Warner Bros. Records. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Martha Wash, who had a major falling out with C+C Music Factory's over the 
singing credit for the 1990 hit "Gonna Make You Sweat" (her part was performed 
by a lip-syncing model in the video of the song), is working with the group 
again. C+C leaders David Cole and Robert Robert Clivilles have produced four 
tracks for Wash's upcoming album, while she in turn sings on three tracks for 
the next C+C album. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Rhino Records is planning the first-ever CD release of the entire Monkees 
catalogue, with nine CDs slated to come at a rate of three per month starting 
in September. Each will contain unreleased or rare "bonus" tracks. Rhino will 
also be putting out videos of the Monkees' entire 58-episode TV series, as well 
as the band's movie "Head" and its TV special "33 1/3 Revolutions Per Monkee." 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 While plans are being finalized for the Woodstock 25th anniversary show, some 
of the leading lights from San Francisco's late-'60s scene will gather April 30 
at the Maritime Hall there for a concert to raise money for medical costs 
incurred by Chet Helms, founder of the '60s concert promotion firm Family Dog. 
Among those scheduled to appear are former members of Moby Grape, Big Brother, 
Country Joe & the Fish and a special teaming of Steve Miller with former 
Creedence Clearwater Revival members Stu Cook and Doug Clifford. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Steve Wynn, whose new, acoustic-flavored "Fluorescent" album was just released 
by Mute, is already planning his next album, a sharp stylistic contrast to be 
recorded with hard-edged Boston band Come. Incidentally, the Dream Syndicate 
founder -- a lifetime Angeleno -- is packing up and moving to New York. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 No record label has been found yet to release the final album by Harry 
Nilsson, which was nearly completed at the time of the singer's death from a 
heart attack in January. His manager, David Spiro, says the collection needs a 
little work before it's ready for release. Veteran musician-producer Al Kooper 
is working on a Nilsson tribute album, with Marshall Crenshaw and Aimee Mann 
having recorded tracks so far. A two-CD anthology of Nilsson's RCA years is now 
scheduled for July. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Tommy Shannon and Chris Layton, formerly the rhythm section of the late Stevie 
Ray Vaughan's Double Trouble and for the Arc Angels, are joining Austin 
vocalist Malford Milligan in the new band Storyville. The pair guests on 
Milligan's new album, also titled "Storyville." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Garth Brooks returns the favor for Victoria Shaw -- who wrote his hit "The 
River" -- by doing a guest vocal turn on her debut album, due in July. Shaw has 
also written hits for Doug Stone ("Too Busy Being in Love") and John Michael 
Montgomery ("I Love the Way You Love Me").

 COUNTRY COOKIN': Robert Shuster wanted to expose his young daughter to the 
world of country music, but found that most of the places around L.A. where 
it's played didn't really offer the proper environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think taking her (to bars) was appropriate," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 So he decided to create the "right" kind of place, and on May 3, ground will 
be broken at Universal City's CityWalk for Country Star, a country music-themed 
"family" restaurant in the mode of the Hard Rock Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
 Billy Ray Cyrus, Tanya Tucker, Diamond Rio, Carl Perkins and Charley Pride are 
among the artists scheduled to be on hand for the ceremonies, boosting 
Shuster's hopes that the site will be a center of the L.A. country community, 
with private industry showcase concerts and parties as well as public events 
celebrating the music. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant -- featuring a three-story, computer-driven Wurlitzer jukebox 
facade, a "Boot Walk of Fame," 62 large-screen TV monitors, a gift shop, a 
showcase stage and "interactive" kiosks where visitors can watch videos and get 
information on their favorite artists -- is slated to open by the end of the 
summer. Plans are also being made for a Las Vegas Country Star to open next 
year. Bruce Haring

RESTAURANT NEWS: FRENCH CONSUL FRIES L.A., STEAMS AT FIGARO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Figaro Madame writer Valerie Hanotel came to Los Angeles asking French 
expatriates how they felt about their adopted city, she got an earful. And many 
of the more outspoken critics were local chefs and restaurateurs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no family life, no social graces. They don't know how to live," said 
Sophie Healy of Champagne Bis. "The problem with the California man is that he 
fell straight from the tree into his Cadillac." She also doesn't like her 
customers' habit of bringing their own wine to her restaurant. "I charge them 
$30 corkage fee to discourage them." 
</P>
<P>
 Gerard Ferry of L'Orangerie complained that he had to train his customers not 
to pour ketchup on his food when the restaurant first opened. "I had to nicely 
tell them . . . and they relented," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Los Angeles had to train him about sexism. 
</P>
<P>
 "We gave ladies menus without prices on them," he told the writer for the 
magazine supplement of the conservative French newspaper Le Figaro. "A TV crew 
showed up at the restaurant one day to denounce this shocking habit. We gave 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 The most shocking comment comes from French Consul Gen. Jean-Maurice Ripert, 
who says that the city is brain dead. "Los Angeles' EEG registers flat," he 
supposedly told Hanotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Ripert, who is paid to promote good relations between France and Southern 
California, denies the quote. "I never said these sentences . . . (and) I think 
the contrary. I reported back to my ministry and asked them to make a formal 
protest against the quotations. It was not an interview and there were not 
supposed to be any quotations of any kind," says Ripert. "I received (Hanotel) 
in my office for a half hour to have an informative talk. She came to me for 
information on the city and the French community." 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, he said those things," says Hanotel, from her office in Paris. "He 
knew it was an interview. I spent an hour in his office. We even took a picture 
of him." 
</P>
<P>
 Champagne Bis' Healy, who was also pictured in the article surrounded by eight 
smiling L.A.-based French chefs, had no complaints with the French magazine. 
But, she told Calendar, she only charges a $15 corkage fee, not $30. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked if her comments about family life and California men were accurate, 
Healy, who once owned the highly regarded Champagne restaurant with her former 
husband, chef Patrick Healy, says that she wasn't talking about California men 
in general . "I only meant Patrick and his family." 
</P>
<P>
 GRAND OPENINGS: Instead of simply renting searchlights or billboards, 
Desperados Hollywood Cantina & Cafe owners Jeff Carlis and Ted Fox have taken 
desperate steps to hype their new restaurant. They've hired a group of young 
women they've named the Desperado girls. The scantily dressed, boot-clad blond 
ambassadors mosey up and down Melrose Avenue, passing out boot-shaped key 
chains, poker chips and menus. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to have a gimmick and these guys are pulling out all stops," says a 
spokesman for the restaurant, located above the Gap in the former California 
Beach space. "In New York and the Far East and Europe, people are used to a 
restaurant being located above the street, but in L.A. no one looks up. So 
these girls are there pointing . . . 'It's up there, go up there , look up 
there .' It's a dual purpose kind of thing." Of course, calling women "girls" 
is an uncool kind of thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Desperados, done up to resemble a Rosarita Beach-style cantina, will feature 
the Dirty Harry salad (mixed greens, black beans, tomatoes, salsa and avocado 
in a tostada shell), Hell's Angels chicken wings, grilled mahi-mahi San Felipe 
and drinks with names like Mexican mudslide, Patron margarita and One & Only, a 
jar of fruit-infused tequila and orange liquor. 
</P>
<P>
 ROLE MODEL?: Wearing a chef's apron and holding a wire whisk as if it were a 
wand, Ivana Trump was recently honored by Hiram Walker for her "dedication to 
furthering the role of women in the workplace and the home." In honor of the 
occasion, the liquor company also awarded a cooking scholarship in Trump's 
name. At the cocktail party/awards ceremony held in Mar-A-Lago, Fla., food was 
provided by members of the recently founded International Assn. of Women Chefs 
and Restaurateurs, including Mary Sue Milliken of Border Grill in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ivana Trump exemplifies women in the '90s," Donald Coe, president of Hiram 
Walker, said when he presented the award to the 
ex-model/author/decorator/clothing designer. "She balances her home life and 
career, and still finds time to help others." 
</P>
<P>
 RUNNING A RESTAURANT: Some of the best runners in last weekend's Jimmy Stewart 
Relay Marathon were from the restaurant division, which included teams from 
Planet Hollywood, Jimmy's, Jack in the Box, Cicada, Xiomara, Schatzi on Main, 
Chaya Express, Spago and Gladstone's. The annual event at Griffith Park raises 
money for the Child Study Center at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica. Each 
team member runs 5.2 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Planet Hollywood placed first in the men's restaurant category, ahead of 
Jimmy's and Gilbert's El Indio. In the women's category, only two teams 
entered, and Jimmy's came in ahead of the Galley in Santa Monica. In the mixed 
category, Pasadena's Xiomara placed first, ahead of Cicada, Chaya Express, 
Gladstone's and Schatzi on Main. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess (Arnold Schwarzenegger) doesn't hire his employees for their athletic 
prowess," says marathon volunteer Debbi Saunders. 
</P>
<P>
 In the celebrity relay, where each runner is required to only run a mile and, 
maybe, smile for the cameras, the restaurant team led by Spago's Wolfgang Puck 
and Jimmy's Jimmy Murphy finished 10th, ahead of the Rams Cheerleaders and KCBS 
News.

NUMBER OF WOMEN IN TOP SCHOOL POSTS RISES; EDUCATION: FEMALES MAKE UP THE 
MAJORITY OF THE COUNTY'S ELEMENTARY PRINCIPALS. AT SOME LEVELS, CHANGE STILL 
COMES SLOWLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As an assistant principal at Royal High School in Simi Valley six years ago, 
Marjorie Blackburn applied to become principal at a local junior high school. 
She lost out to a man. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the seventh time that Blackburn had sought a promotion in the Simi 
Valley Unified School District and the seventh time she had been passed over in 
favor of a male applicant. 
</P>
<P>
 This time she sued the district for sex discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Blackburn never got that principal's job. Ultimately, she left education and 
settled out of court with the district, which never admitted to any 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 But her lawsuit left its mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1990, when Blackburn began her legal fight, the Simi Valley district has 
dramatically increased the number of women school administrators in its ranks, 
including naming its first female high school principal in 1992 and its first 
woman superintendent last year. 
</P>
<P>
 And Simi Valley isn't alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Ventura County school districts have in recent years significantly 
boosted the number of females in management posts. The county has gone from not 
having any female school superintendents 10 years ago to having five today. 
Women now make up the majority of the county's elementary school principals and 
they hold half the top posts at junior high and middle schools. 
</P>
<P>
 But at some levels of administration, change is coming slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 Only six of the county's 24 high schools and continuation schools have female 
principals. Although that's six more than in 1984, it still means women account 
for only one-quarter of high school principals in the county, a far smaller 
representation than at middle and elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for the dearth of female high school principals may be, educators 
said, the persistent belief that only men are tough enough and strong enough to 
stop fights and handle discipline problems among high school students. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a general feeling that if you're a male high school principal, you'd 
command more respect and have more authority," said Joseph Spirito, 
superintendent of the Ventura Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, women's traditional role of nurturing young children allows them 
to be accepted more easily as elementary school principals. "Women do take care 
of small children," said Blackburn, the former administrator in Simi Valley. 
"That's accepted." 
</P>
<P>
 Blackburn, who has since remarried and changed her last name, was 60 years old 
with a Ph.D. in education administration and 21 years of experience in Simi 
Valley schools when she applied and was rejected for the job of Sinaloa Junior 
High School principal in 1988. She had previously been passed over for six 
other administrative positions, including principal at Valley View Junior High 
School and Royal High. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, Simi Valley had never had a women principal at either of its two 
high schools or its continuation school. And nearly all the principals at the 
district's four junior high schools had been men. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than a year after Blackburn sued the district, she resigned from her job 
as assistant principal at Royal. She says now she was suffering from stress 
brought on by her deep frustration and anger at not being promoted. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she later settled with the school district for enough money to cover 
her legal costs and retraining for a new career. 
</P>
<P>
 Now working as a financial planner and licensed stockbroker in Camarillo, 
Blackburn said she believes women in education face the same hurdles as women 
in the private sector when they try to advance into positions traditionally 
held by men. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're pushing that invisible ceiling," she said. "And that club up there 
wants to remain private." 
</P>
<P>
 If there was a club among top level school administrators in Simi Valley, it 
has become considerably less private since Blackburn filed her suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Six of the 11 highest-ranking officials in the district now are women, 
including the superintendent. Two of Simi Valley's four junior high schools 
have female principals and Kathryn Scroggin became the district's first female 
high school principal when she took over the top post at Simi Valley High 
School in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar changes are evident across Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the 1983-84 school year, the number of women in the top posts at the 
county's elementary schools has increased from 25% to 56%. And there are now 
women principals at 10, or 42%, of the county's 25 junior high and middle 
schools, compared to only 3, or 12%, 10 years ago. In five of the county's 21 
school districts -- Simi Valley, Pleasant Valley, Oak Park, Santa Clara and 
Briggs -- women are superintendents. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Thompson, an English teacher at Camarillo High School, said she has seen 
opportunities for advancement gradually open up to women during her 16 years in 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's coming," said Thompson, who is working toward her credential to 
become an administrator. But, she added, "I think it's very slow." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Thompson said, the career path for women teachers who wanted to 
advance often ended at the school counseling office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Society was less accepting" of women in high-level administrative jobs, 
Thompson said. "They could accept women in a teaching position; they could 
accept women in a counselor's position," she said, but not in the principal's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, fewer women tried for the positions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think they were looking to be principals," said Leean Nemeroff, 
assistant superintendent in the Conejo Valley Unified School District. And, she 
said, "part of it might have been they didn't think they'd get the job so they 
didn't try out for it." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the longer hours worked by principals may have had little appeal 
to women teachers who were rearing young children. 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, for example, elementary school principals are scheduled to 
work 210 days per year, nearly six weeks longer than the 182 days worked by 
teachers. The contrast is even greater at junior highs, where principals work 
216 days per year. 
</P>
<P>
 And at high schools, principals not only have to put in 226 days per year, 
nearly nine weeks longer than teachers, but they work many evenings, putting in 
appearances at athletic events, school dances and other high school events. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a job that requires a lot of extra time," said Joanne Black, 
principal of Hueneme High School in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Black, who became Hueneme's principal last fall, said she never even 
considered advancing beyond teaching while her children were small. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the increased time commitments of principal's jobs, an increasing 
number of women are applying for such positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Studt, superintendent of the Oxnard Union High School District, said he 
has noticed a significant increase in the number of women seeking principal's 
jobs over the past five years. The district now has female principals at two of 
its six high schools and five female assistant principals. 
</P>
<P>
 And an increasing number of female teachers in the district are taking the 
necessary college courses at night and during the summers to get their 
administrative credentials, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I started in education 25 years ago, a lot of women who were in it were 
in it for the second income," said Fillmore High School Principal Lynn Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today," Johnson said, "there are (women) saying, 'Yeah, I want an 
administrative position, I'm capable of an administrative position."

THE SHOE MAN; VENTURA SHOP IS HOME TO A DYING BREED OF COBBLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Julio Nolasco no longer notices the sweet aroma of old leather and fresh shoe 
polish that fills the air at his tiny shoe-repair shop in downtown Ventura. 
After a lifetime as a cobbler, he has become immune to such things. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 His fingertips are tough from the pricks of the thick sewing machine needles 
used to stitch together tattered and torn boots worn way past their prime. Yet 
his hands are soft, soothed for years by rich leather cream and wax. 
</P>
<P>
 Nolasco's dingy Main Street shop, with its cracked ceiling and beige painted 
walls, has become an institution in Ventura, where the business opened in 1924. 
And Nolasco, 66, is among a dying breed of cobblers, carrying on a trade passed 
down for four generations. 
</P>
<P>
 Someday soon, Nolasco says, he'll close down the shop -- called simply Julio's 
Shoe Repair -- and head off with his girlfriend for vacations in Alaska or at 
the Grand Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 But for now Nolasco is content just spending most of his time repairing the 
footwear of his loyal customers, who have been bringing the same shoes to him 
for more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the recession started, his business has been booming, with more people 
paying to repair their loafers than buying new ones. Some weeks he is so busy 
he turns away customers. Some weeks he works until his back aches. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father, my grandfather, my great-grandfather all worked in this kind of 
business," said Nolasco, who moved to the United States from Mexico in 1962. 
"I've done this all my life. In Mexico, I made shoes. So for me it's easy to 
fix shoes, since I know them from the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 He notes the change of seasons simply by the types of shoes dropped off for 
repair. These days he is fixing his share of sandals, some so tattered he 
wonders why people bother to keep them. 
</P>
<P>
 He chalks it up to the economy, or perhaps breaking in new shoes is just too 
painful. Nolasco stays busy fixing more than 50 pairs a week, including some 
shoes he nearly rebuilds from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent morning at his shop, several of his longtime customers stopped by 
with their footwear. 
</P>
<P>
 "Julio, how are you-lio?" asks Brigitte Best, who came in to pick up a pair of 
shoes she had him stretch. Nolasco responds with a wide grin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been coming here for years," Best said. "We don't always go out and buy 
new shoes. You see we are loyal to the ones we've got. I appreciate Julio's 
craftsmanship." 
</P>
<P>
 Sally Richards and her husband, John, walked in with their motorcycle boots. 
</P>
<P>
 "These boots have been to Panama and the Yucatan," Sally Richards said, 
slapping the black leather stompers down on the counter. "We want to get them 
fixed up for a trip to Australia." 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Diaz strode in carrying a bag filled with his wife's shoes and wearing 
loafers Nolasco has patched and polished a dozen times over the past 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "They would probably cost me $350 to replace," Diaz said, looking down at the 
shiny shoes. "But Julio has kept them together for me over the years. He knows 
his craft." 
</P>
<P>
 Nolasco began making and selling shoes at age 15 while living in Uruapan, 
Mexico. Years later, after his wife died during childbirth, he moved to the 
United States to start a new life. After a year working in a shoe-repair shop 
in Los Angeles, he heard about an opening in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1963, Nolasco went to work at a shop at Main Street and Pacific Avenue. 
During his vacation he would work for his friend Juan Macis at his downtown 
Ventura shop. In 1982, Macis offered to sell the shop -- situated in the 300 
block of Main Street -- to Nolasco for about $24,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Nolasco, anxious to be his own boss, accepted. He is only the third owner of 
the tiny shop -- founded when city residents still rode down Main Street on 
horses. 
</P>
<P>
 He works there with the help of his girlfriend, Manuela Rubio, who answers the 
phone and greets customers. Although Nolasco used to keep the shop open most 
days, he now closes it on Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays. And his hours are 
sometimes irregular. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I come late, sometimes I come early," he said. "It all depends on 
how I feel." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most area repair shops, Nolasco no longer dyes shoes, giving him more 
time to do the more challenging leather work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never like to say "No,' " Nolasco said. "I always say, 'Let me try.' "

TEST PROVES SOME DOGS HAVE OBEDIENCE LICKED; TRAINING: ONLY THREE OF 28 FAIL 
PROGRAM THAT INCLUDES BIGGEST CHALLENGE: SITTING QUIETLY ON A HILL.

 After winning a certificate recognizing him as a well-behaved dog, Luke, a 
3-year-old Labrador-beagle mix, smiled broadly, his pink tongue dangling out 
the side of his panting mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 For Luke, a veteran of obedience school, Saturday's second annual Canine Good 
Citizenship Test was old hat -- practically. 
</P>
<P>
 "You never know what he'll do next," said Luke's owner, Cindy Campbell of 
Ojai, shaking her head at the short, blond dog who was sitting peacefully on 
the lawn at Camino Real Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't stay very well," Campbell said. "He eats the cat food. He's very 
good at chasing the chickens. . . . (But) he really has added another dimension 
in our family. He's really one of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Luke was one of 28 dogs who, aside from the occasional slip into bad-dog 
behavior, demonstrated remarkably good comportment while being led through a 
series of obedience tests at the daylong event sponsored by the Ventura County 
Dog Fanciers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Only three dogs failed the test by barking or not listening to their owners' 
commands. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a unique program that helps owners make good citizens out of their 
dogs," said Betty Burnell, an organizer of the event who has taught dog 
obedience classes through the Ventura Parks and Recreation department for 12 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Burnell defined a canine good citizen as a dog that "makes its owner happy 
without making anyone else unhappy." 
</P>
<P>
 The good-citizenship test was developed by the American Kennel Club in 1989 to 
recognize good behavior in both purebreds and mutts, Burnell said. Dogs are 
judged by how well they can obey commands, such as walking on a leash, sitting 
and staying. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a formal obedience training, but just to show that a dog can 
behave," explained Simi Valley resident Rosalie Anderson, president of the 
Ventura County Dog Fanciers Assn. and an American Kennel Club judge. In order 
to receive a good-citizenship certificate, dogs have to welcome being groomed 
and handled by a stranger, walk on a loose lead around a course of orange 
traffic cones and, in what appeared to be the most difficult test for some of 
Saturday's competitors, be left alone on a grassy hill while not barking, 
whining or pacing. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten-year-old Candice Schlunegger of Ojai was worried her fluffy gray Tibetan 
terrier mix, Waggner, would fail this part of the exam. 
</P>
<P>
 "He always barks at home," she said. But Waggner passed, and proudly chomped 
on his red leash after he and Candice accepted their certificate, ribbon and 
collar medallion. 
</P>
<P>
 Candice was one of eight youngsters from the Loma Vista and Miramonte 4-H 
clubs who escorted their pooches through the test. They were joined by 20 
adults, a mixed bag of serious and casual dog owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're here for fun and doggie socialization," said Wendy Schustack of 
Ventura, who brought two dogs to be tested, a purebred German shepherd named 
Von Rollo and a Rhodesian ridgeback-pit bull mix called Guy. 
</P>
<P>
 Schustack and her Ventura-based dog trainer, Sheila Foutch, hoped to expose 
Guy to a low-key obedience test that wasn't restricted only to purebreds. "We 
wanted to come here and see what needed to be done," Foutch said of Guy's 
training. Both women said dog owners need to take the time to train their pets. 
</P>
<P>
 "All dogs should go through obedience training," Schustack said. "They're 
animals and they're unpredictable."  
</P>
<P>
 Longtime dog-show judges Dolly and Robert Ward brought their purebred Samoyed, 
Varmi, to the event so she could brush up on her obedience training. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, if she doesn't pass I'll be a laughingstock," 74-year-old Dolly 
Ward said. Because the Hidden Hills couple travel frequently to judge dog shows 
around the world, they make an effort to take Varmi to public events whenever 
possible. "She likes to do things and I don't want her to be alone." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura resident Mary Thue and her sheltie, Topaz, are novices at obedience 
competitions. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is his first good citizen and we did well," Thue said. "I want to train 
him to be in competition." 
</P>
<P>
 Thue said she intends to frame Topaz's certificate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why not?" she asked, petting Topaz on the head. "It's proof that he's a good 
dog."

GALLEGLY FAILS TO WARM TO HUFFINGTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) regards former Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino 
(R-Ventura) as a mentor and close friend. The two shared representation of 
Ventura County, served on the Interior and Foreign Affairs committees together 
and were political confidantes. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, Gallegly was distraught when Michael Huffington ran a sharp-edged, 
$3.4-million campaign against Lagomarsino in a Republican primary in 1992 to 
unceremoniously end the lawmaker's long congressional career. Reelected 
himself, Gallegly professed suffering "survivor's guilt." 
</P>
<P>
 In the nearly two years since, Gallegly has not warmed to Huffington, the 
multimillionaire fiscal conservative and social moderate who is seeking the 
Republican Senate nomination this year, sources say. Gallegly's public comments 
about his congressional neighbor and GOP colleague to the north are tempered -- 
but pointed nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have not tried to be openly hostile toward Michael because of my strong 
feeling of respect for Bob Lagomarsino and the way the campaign was handled," 
Gallegly said Friday. "I try to separate the two things in terms of what we're 
dealing with on Congress." 
</P>
<P>
 But then he added: "He's not the first guy I go running to, to establish an 
alliance on every bill I work on." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Gallegly, who has not made an endorsement in the Senate primary, said 
of Huffington: "I don't know anybody who knows him well. He's not a 
high-profile guy. . . . I haven't seen an awful lot of Michael Huffington." 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, Gallegly and Huffington have fewer overlapping geographic 
interests than Gallegly and Lagomarsino had. Following the redrawing of 
district lines in 1992, Gallegly represents Carpinteria and all of Ventura 
County except most of Thousand Oaks. Huffington represents all of Santa Barbara 
County except Carpinteria and all of San Luis Obispo County. And they are not 
assigned to the same committees, where much of Congress' work is done. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Huffington said in interview that his association with Gallegly 
has come a long way after a rocky start. His assessment so contrasts with 
Gallegly's that it is difficult to believe they are describing the same 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our relationship is excellent," insisted Huffington, who suggested Gallegly 
would agree. "He and I have a great working relationship and we are friends. He 
also happens to be friends with Bob Lagomarsino. But that's a separate issue." 
</P>
<P>
 To bolster his assertion, Huffington said he has signed on as a co-sponsor of 
six of Gallegly's bills -- more than those of any other member. Half of them 
concern steps to crack down on illegal immigration. "Making a tempest out of a 
teapot doesn't fit here," Huffington said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that in general he has worked mostly closely with his fellow GOP 
freshmen. A leading first-term Republican who speaks well of Huffington 
nonetheless said, "He hasn't really developed as many friendships as others." 
</P>
<P>
 For Gallegly, who still talks often to Lagomarsino about politics and other 
concerns, separating the personal and the professional when it comes to 
Huffington is clearly not easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "My deep feelings about the way that campaign was run are obvious," Gallegly 
said. "It's not the kind of thing that you quickly forget -- something that you 
feel very strongly about." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's campaign attacks on Lagomarsino portrayed the 19-year House 
veteran as a tired career politician who had supported the sale of 
state-of-the-art equipment used to spy on Chinese dissidents during the 1989 
Tian An Men Square massacre. Lagomarsino responded by calling the issue of the 
surveillance cameras "ridiculous and counterproductive." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Lagomarsino remains bitter about the scion of a Texas oil and gas 
fortune who decided to run for the Senate seat held by Dianne Feinstein, a San 
Francisco Democrat, less than a year after winning the 22nd District 
congressional seat. 
</P>
<P>
 The ex-legislator provided no assistance to Huffington during the 
post-election transition and has taken numerous shots at the freshman in a 
monthly political newsletter that Lagomarsino and his wife, Norma, have 
published since September. And last week, the Ojai resident endorsed former 
Orange County Rep. William E. Dannemeyer in the Senate primary race. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lagomarsino's most eyebrow-raising gesture was to turn over boxes of 
Huffington press releases, videotapes, scripts and other materials to 
Feinstein's campaign in October. He said he did it "because I thought it would 
help the other Republicans in the primary, to the extent that anybody got (the 
information) out." 
</P>
<P>
 A day after endorsing Dannemeyer at two Santa Barbara County news conferences, 
Lagomarsino said, "I don't want to be completely negative (about Huffington), 
but I am." On Friday, he launched this riposte: "I feel so strongly that he is 
not a proper person to be a U.S. senator, let alone what his real ambition is, 
which is to be President." 
</P>
<P>
 He asserts that Huffington has failed to represent the district well or 
fulfill his campaign promise to reform Congress. Huffington has countered by 
citing a range of actions, including helping 600 constituents solve problems 
with the government; joining with other freshmen to enact several congressional 
reforms; co-chairing the campaign to pass a "Three Strikes, You're Out" ballot 
initiative in California this year, and contributing his $133,644 annual salary 
to children's charities in his district. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came here to serve," Huffington said. "In my own way, I've made a 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Lagomarsino passing ammunition to Feinstein, Huffington said, "He 
certainly has the right to do whatever he wants. However, as a prior elected 
official for 34 years and a lifelong Republican, I've heard people in our 
district calling him 'the Benedict Arnold of Republican politics.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington and Lagomarsino agree on one thing: that Lagomarsino rebuffed 
Huffington's overtures to bury the hatchet after the 1992 primary. Huffington 
said that even the district office typewriters had been tampered with so they 
were inoperable when his staff took over from Lagomarsino's. "That wasn't very 
helpful," Huffington said. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's first approach to Gallegly after the election did not go much 
better. 
</P>
<P>
 In an emotional outburst, Gallegly had referred to Huffington as "an idiot" 
during a cable television interview on election night. Some time later, at a 
posh Republican fund-raiser at Lake Sherwood, Huffington approached Gallegly, 
who was seated near former President Ronald Reagan. Gallegly's recalled the 
exchange this way: 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the 'idiot,' " Huffington said, extending his palm for a handshake. 
</P>
<P>
 The two engaged in innocuous small talk until the congressman-elect mentioned 
Lagomarsino. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've really tried to build bridges with Bob and it's just too bad that he is 
such a poor loser," Huffington said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That pushed a real bad button with me," Gallegly recalled. "I said, 'I've 
always measured people on their ability to be a good winner rather than a bad 
loser.' I certainly thought that was the wrong characterization of Bob 
Lagomarsino at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't yell at him. I'm sure there was a slight octave change in my voice. 
. . . I let him know there really wasn't a lot of purpose in continuing the 
conversation that evening." 
</P>
<P>
 This week, Huffington recollected going over to introduce himself to Gallegly 
at the event but maintained "that was so long ago I don't recall the exact 
exchange." 
</P>
<P>
 After he was sworn to office, Huffington said he told Gallegly: "Let's make 
this the first day of the beginning of the rest of our relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly and Lagomarsino worked particularly closely together on securing land 
for the Channel Islands National Park, which Lagomarsino helped create. 
Huffington said that he has not played a role in this area because he does not 
sit on the Interior Committee, which has jurisdiction over the park, and "no 
one has asked me to get involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, one of the earliest initiatives that Gallegly brought to 
Huffington was his resolution to name the visitors center after Lagomarsino. 
Initially, Huffington was the only one of 22 California Republicans who did not 
co-sponsor the measure. After this was noted in a newspaper story, he added his 
name to the list. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a conflict of interest," Huffington said Friday. "Here we are in 
Congress naming buildings after ourselves. I think we have a lot of heroes in 
athletics, the armed forces and (among) schoolteachers. If we're going to name 
any buildings, we should do it after them." He said he later became a 
co-sponsor because he didn't want to appear to be anti-Lagomarsino. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Huffington's spokeswoman initially said she wasn't sure that the 
new congressman had seen the bill. A week later, his chief aide said that a 
legislative assistant had erred in turning down Gallegly's request. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill has passed the House and is now before the Senate. The prime sponsor 
is Dianne Feinstein.

CONSERVING OPEN SPACE IS THE GOAL 
</P>

<P>
 Joe Dillman was scarcely out of breath when he reached the top of a wide 
gravel path in the middle of the Los Robles trail system in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just a few minutes on the bike and I've gone from the city to the 
wilderness," the 70-year-old cyclist said. "Isn't it fantastic?"  
</P>
<P>
 Dillman and the 50 other volunteer rangers who routinely patrol the trails 
that cut through the chaparral around Thousand Oaks credit a tiny city agency 
and the powerful forces behind it for preserving the land that brings them so 
much pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
 Since its inception in 1977, the Conejo Open Space Conservation Agency (COSCA) 
has helped the city amass 14,000 acres of untarnished land in vast pockets 
around Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in addition to its ongoing effort to preserve that space, COSCA is 
constantly hunting for new land. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week the agency added another acre to its holdings when Los Angeles 
builder Patriot Homes, Inc., came before the Planning Commission seeking 
approval to construct 45 townhomes north of Hillcrest Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the development bordered the Westlake North Ranch open space, and city 
planner Mark Towne notified the developer of COSCA's interest in acquiring some 
of the land. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually the land we go after is undevelopable," Towne said. "So developers 
see the benefit of giving it to us." 
</P>
<P>
 If developers donate the land to COSCA, he explained, they no longer have to 
pay taxes on it or pay for its upkeep. 
</P>
<P>
 And Patriot Homes used the donation of the land as a selling point for its 
project. When the project's architect, Francisco Behr, came before the Planning 
Commission last Monday night, he urged commissioners to "take into 
consideration what we have been willing to do" when they made their decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "Deals are constantly coming and going," said Towne, who is the only planner 
devoted full time to the acquisition of open space. "There are hundreds of 
properties that we hope someday to get ahold of." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, he said, the goal of COSCA is to own a contiguous ring of land 
around the Conejo Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The concept of creating a ring of open space dates to the early days of 
planning in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very ambitious plan, right from the beginning," recalled Tex Ward, 
then and now the general manager of the Conejo Recreation and Park District. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city spent a year on a General Plan which included this recreation 
element that envisioned the ring of open space," Ward said. "We didn't want it 
to be patchwork; we wanted linkages so that habitat could use the land and so 
that trails could be developed." 
</P>
<P>
 The first step toward that goal was to deny construction on steep sloping 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the open space grew, the park district -- with only a handful of 
employees and one park -- could not manage all of the land. 
</P>
<P>
 "It became apparent we needed to do a study to get a handle on what it would 
take to manage this open space," Ward said. "The study pointed out to us that 
since the city was not in the business of managing open space and the park 
district was not in the business of planning, we needed to create a new 
agency." 
</P>
<P>
 And so, COSCA was born. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency is a conglomeration of the city planning staff and park district 
staff, taking half its $488,000 budget from each agency. The staff of six -- 
five full-time park rangers and planner Towne -- report to a board of four city 
and park officials and a citizen member who set the agency's policy. 
</P>
<P>
 But volunteers are the real force behind COSCA, said Rorie Skei, the citizen 
member of the COSCA board. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an incredible amount of involvement on the part of volunteers," Skei 
said. "We have hundreds of people come out to help repair trails and we have 
people doing patrols on horseback and on bikes. There is a real sense of 
community ownership of this land." 
</P>
<P>
 For the volunteer patrols, set up by an arm of COSCA called the Conejo Open 
Space Trails Advisory Committee, setting out on the weekends is a way to repay 
the city for providing the space. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of organizations who I'm sure would cringe at the idea of 
having to find dozens of volunteers to come out here," said Paul DeNubilo, who 
organizes the patrols. 
</P>
<P>
 "But that's not the case here. There are a lot of people who are really 
looking for a way to give back to the trails and just need some guidance," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Each weekend DeNubilo has volunteers on foot, horseback and bicycle traversing 
the Wildwood Park and Los Robles trail systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the time, the volunteers do nothing more than pass out maps, give 
directions or scold someone for letting a dog off the leash. Occasionally, 
though, the patrols happen upon more serious situations. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months ago, horseback rider Jody Martin found an overturned car leaking 
gasoline and reported it to one of the full-time rangers. They later learned 
that the truck had been stolen. And during the Green Meadow fire last fall, the 
volunteers helped evacuate more than 1,000 horses from stables threatened by 
the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to patrols, residents help COSCA maintain the trails. A few times 
a year, hundreds of trail users come out to help mend old trails and build new 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent group of residents to join COSCA's effort have been those 
involved in Conejo Open Space Education Days, a program designed to teach 
elementary-aged students the value of the preserved land. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got such a tremendous resource here, we want to get people at a young 
age to appreciate it," said Elayne Haggan, the program's director. 
</P>
<P>
 During the third annual Education Days, which ran from April 4 to 14, a team 
of naturalists, rangers and city officials visited 650 students at nine schools 
to talk to them about the open space. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturalist Tom Maxwell caused a room full of fifth-graders to cringe when he 
explained the value of animal "scat." The droppings, he told them, are used to 
trace the variety of animals, including coyotes, foxes and a small number of 
mountain lions that are living in the Conejo open space. 
</P>
<P>
 When ranger Bruce Pace asked the Walnut School class how many of them had been 
on the trails, nearly all the children raised their hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way people use the trails today is really incredible," said Ward, the 
parks director. "We've clearly seen a transformation in attitude in the past 15 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 It is this widespread interest and concern for open space that COSCA is trying 
to promote. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 20 years we're going to have 14,000 acres or more of open space in the 
prime spot in Southern California," Ward said. "The pressure on that land (from 
developers) is going to be incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, even if a ring of open space is complete, the need to protect the 
land will keep COSCA in business. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't afford to let it slide," Ward said, "because as soon as we do, 
Thousand Oaks will become the Hollywood Hills." Ring Around the Oaks 
</P>
<P>
 The Conejo Open Space Conservation Agency is a public agency that buys land 
and accepts donations as part of its effort to create a "ring of open space" 
around Thousand Oaks. It presently owns 14,000 acres, which it maintains by 
creating trails and patrolling with park rangers. This map shows current open 
space committed to the agency and the land that it hopes to acquire.

KIDS AS STARS; CHILDREN'S PARADE KICKS OFF CONEJO FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For 7-year-old Casey Sullivan, Saturday was the only day of the year he could 
call his mom a cow and get away with it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Shari Sullivan held nothing back for the annual children's parade in Thousand 
Oaks, donning a full-body cow costume so her two children -- dressed as cowboy 
and cowgirl -- had something to throw their ropes around. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll let them get away with this today," Sullivan said cheerfully as she 
straightened her udder. "This is really a kids' day." 
</P>
<P>
 The children were the stars as they marched down a half-mile parade route 
along Auto Mall Drive for the annual Conejo Valley Days children's parade 
Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 About 300 children, aged 14 and under, came from Thousand Oaks and surrounding 
areas for the festive affair, which was the first major event of the two-week 
Conejo Valley Days festival that runs through the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 Conejo Valley Days officials praised the children and their parents for such a 
strong turnout, and for bringing along a host of elaborate floats and ornate 
costumes. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most unusual of the 30 entries were two children who scampered down 
the parade route tucked into giant cardboard cowboy boots, a mother who wrapped 
her baby and carriage in a large paper tepee, and a cart with three girls in 
glittery western wear being pulled by a miniature horse. 
</P>
<P>
 "People really went all out," said JoAnn Malter, who organized the parade for 
Conejo Valley Days. "It shows us just how strong the spirit is out here that 
these people would go through all this effort for an event like this." 
</P>
<P>
 The three men judging the various entries sat at the end of the route smiling 
almost continuously as all of the participants filed by their table. Even the 
simple entries, such as a young boy dressed as a cowboy who walked the route 
alone, earned the applause of the spectators. 
</P>
<P>
 The judges said they had a difficult time picking out the best entries because 
of the great variety and creativity displayed by all of the entries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look for the kids who are the most enthusiastic and show the most 
personality," explained judge George Conahey, a volunteer from the local 
Optimist Club. "This is the second year I've done this, and it's always tough 
to pick some over others. I've seen a lot of great kids out here." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the 300 children in the parade, more than 100 spectators sat 
curbside cheering on their relatives and scanning the scene with video cameras. 
The crowd was joined by street vendors selling balloons and a clown who held 
the attention of of the youngest spectators during various lulls in the parade. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one young couple came to watch the parade even though they had no 
children participating. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry and Teresa Garner watched with considerable interest as the children 
streamed by in front of them because Teresa is pregnant with their first child. 
</P>
<P>
 "We love coming out to parades, but we were especially compelled to come out 
now," Larry Garner said. "We've got kids on the brain right now." 
</P>
<P>
 The Garners watched as the Conejo Cowpokes, a spinoff of last year's Conejo 
Cowgirls, marched down the parade route chanting the Conejo Valley Days theme 
of "Boots, buckles and bandannas." 
</P>
<P>
 Another group, sixth-graders from Weathersfield School in Thousand Oaks, were 
dressed in green and carried large plastic globes as they marched with the 
message, "Earth day, earth day, what do you say. Make every day earth day, 
starting today." 
</P>
<P>
 The inclusion of so many children's groups, Malter said, showed that Conejo 
Valley Days officials were succeeding in making the festival more appealing to 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 The teacher who brought the 16 sixth-graders from Weathersfield School said 
she thought the organizers would accomplish the goal of appealing more to 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is really important that they have incorporated activities for the 
kids into Conejo Valley Days," teacher Sherrill Hyink said. "Conejo Valley Days 
shouldn't be just for the adults." 
</P>
<P>
 Festival organizer Jennifer Cummings said she believes the rest of the events 
will follow the example of Saturday's parade. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what this shows is that Conejo Valley Days is really a family 
oriented festival," Cummings said.  
</P>
<P>
 The major Conejo Valley Days event is the five-day carnival scheduled from 
April 27 to May 1 at Conejo Creek Park, at the Moorpark Freeway and Janss Road.

ENVIRONMENT: NOTES ABOUT YOUR SURROUNDINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rare Bird Sightings--Spring migration is well underway, one of the most 
exciting times of year for many bird-watchers. Thousands of species are making 
the flight north from their tropical winter homes, stopping in local parks and 
back yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the expected songbird migrants will arrive between now and early May, 
according to officials from the Sea & Sage chapter of the National Audubon 
Society. 
</P>
<P>
 And, despite the lull common during the late winter months in bird-watching, 
there were some sightings of note, chapter officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 While several of the most exceptional discoveries in the winter 
season--including the brown-crested flycatcher, yellow-bellied sapsucker, 
LeConte's sparrow and chestnut-sided warbler--did not stick around, others 
remained for a longer period of time. 
</P>
<P>
 These included a zone-tailed hawk in San Juan Capistrano, a field sparrow at 
Huntington Central Park, a least Bell's vireo at William R. Mason Regional Park 
in Irvine, a summer tanager and rose-breasted grosbeak at UC Irvine and a 
black-chinned hummingbird at the Fullerton Arboretum. 
</P>
<P>
 Other noteworthy birds spotted were a Eurasian wigeon that joined American 
wigeons at Craig Regional Park in Fullerton and a Eurasian green-winged teal at 
the San Joaquin Wildlife Sanctuary in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 A Swainson's hawk seen in Irvine was especially rare; it was either a very 
early spring migrant or it had been spending the whole winter there, which is 
unusual because most such hawks spend the winter in South America. 
</P>
<P>
 Another bird that may have been an early spring migrant was a sage thrasher 
spotted at UC Irvine.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: OXNARD; FOOD AND WINE TASTE FESTIVAL TO CONTINUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The spicy fragrance of barbecued chicken, Greek gyros and Indian dahl wafted 
through crowds of people attending the Taste of Ventura County food and wine 
festival, which continues today at Channel Islands Harbor in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Mixing with the aroma from the 18 Ventura County restaurants that have booths 
at the festival were the sounds of jazz, blues and swing bands, set up at one 
end of the event. The event has already drawn close to 10,000 since Friday, and 
organizers are hoping for at least another 8,000 today, the last day of the 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything about (the festival) is better than last year's, except the 
weather and we're hoping that will change soon," said Ray Herbert, who produced 
the festival for Channel Islands Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean-Claude Guerin, dressed in a chef's jacket, was serving creme carmel and 
bruscettas -- hard-crusted bread topped with a tangy tomato and basil blend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like to brag, but we do have the best food," Guerin said with a heavy 
French accent. "I think our food is a bit fancier than what many people are 
used to," he said. "This is a great way to inexpensively expose people to a lot 
of different types of food." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the food stands, there were also activities for children, such as 
face-painting and temporary tattoos. 
</P>
<P>
 Lafe Isaacson, 6, and his sister, Callie, 9, looked through the display for 
just the right temporary tattoo. Their mother, Geri, said Callie was set on 
what she wanted, while Lafe could not make up his mind. "Callie wants the 
flower because it's big and bright," she said. "(Lafe) wants something scary." 
</P>
<P>
 While artist Troy Overman dabbed an orange and red marker to color the flower 
petals he was drawing on Callie's leg, Lafe pondered the possibilities of going 
for a Harley Davidson tattoo or something a bit more sinister. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a big deal for him," she said as Lafe seemed to waiver between a 
colorful tattoo of a skull and crossbones or one of a ninja. His mother kept 
pointing out nice drawings of rainbow-colored stars and moons. In the end, his 
mother's wisdom won out and Lafe went for a unicorn rearing up on its hind 
legs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks good," his mother said. 
</P>
<P>
 Special attractions featured on Sunday include an ice sculptor demonstration 
and a "Big Band Brunch." The festival opens at 11 a.m. and closes at 8 p.m. on 
the waterfront promenade next to Vintage Marina at 2950 S. Harbor Blvd. SCOTT

<P>
 A Simi Valley man died from multiple injuries after being struck by a 
suspected drunk driver about 10:30 p.m. Friday evening on Whitcomb Avenue in 
Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Raphael Lachmiller, 54, was struck and killed while walking from his car to 
his family's house, said Sgt. Ron Lompart of the Simi Valley Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Rodriguez, 39, of Simi Valley was stopped several blocks from the 
scene and arrested on suspicion of vehicular manslaughter, felony hit-and-run, 
drunk driving and evading arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Rodriguez collided with a parked car on Brandon Avenue without 
stopping. A witness followed the car and saw the suspect hit another parked 
car, before rounding the corner onto Whitcomb Avenue and hitting Lachmiller.  
</P>
<P>
 The suspect continued without stopping, hitting another vehicle before jumping 
from his car and trying to flee from police, Lompart said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez is being held in lieu of $50,000 bail at the Ventura County Jail.

RODEO GRANDMAS SPURRED TO ACTION BY TV AD; SPORTS: QUARTET DEBUTED IN A BANK 
COMMERCIAL AND NOW SAY THEY'LL BE RIDING AND ROPING STEERS TO THE END. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AVIVA L. BRANDT, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It began as a television commercial for a bank, but the Rodeo Grandmas say no 
one's going to lasso them anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
 The four women, ranging in age from 52 to 82, still ride and rope. They say 
they'll be buckaroos until they die. 
</P>
<P>
 The women -- Lorraine Plass, 82; Peggy Hunt, 66; Janis Anderson, 57, and Judy 
Golladay, 52 -- love the attention they've gotten since filming the commercial 
for Washington Mutual bank's "That's Different" ad campaign in December. The 
spots airing in Washington state and Oregon since the middle of January show 
the women doing what they do best -- riding and roping steer. 
</P>
<P>
 Now wherever they go, people recognize them. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they recognize us, they just start grinning and grinning and grinning," 
Golladay said. "Pretty soon they're chuckling. They just really enjoyed 
watching us on that commercial." 
</P>
<P>
 Golladay doesn't just rope and ride in the rodeo ring. She rides for one of 
the oldest cattle ranches in the state, the Bar Balloon, and is a member of the 
Sage Scrappers, women who spend several weeks a year rounding up cattle in the 
eastern Washington mountains. Rounding up cattle isn't a man's job, Golladay 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are places where men are stronger and you need them," she said. "But 
when (ranchers) have had us, they'd rather have us do a lot of the work, 
whether it's that we're women and we're more worried about the baby calf, more 
worried about the mama cow, or that we're not out there trying to rope the heel 
or do the macho stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Plass, the eldest of the Rodeo Grandmas, still rides cattle each summer with 
her daughter and son-in-law. Although she can't saddle her own horse anymore, 
there's little else that she can't do. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like what they say when you ride a bicycle, you never forget. Well I 
never could ride a bicycle, but I'll ride any darn horse you bring up here," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Plass misses the days when she was more active on the ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel kind of left out, because I've done all this and I'm just coasting 
along. Now these gals gotta do all of it, and I just sit and watch," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the other women immediately chimed in about how valuable her experience 
and advice is to them, Plass got embarrassed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to need a new hat, my head is getting so big," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The women got into the advertising business when Washington Mutual went 
looking for the next installment in a series of off-beat commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were looking for a group activity, and somebody at the agency said 
'Wouldn't it be interesting to see some grandmothers doing something?' I think 
someone had in the back in their minds that there might be those folks over at 
Ellensburg," said Deanna Oppenheimer, executive vice president of corporate 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellensburg in central Washington is famous for its annual four-day rodeo over 
Labor Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Golladay said a friend gave her name to the advertising agency, and about 20 
women auditioned. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted us to look like grandmas," she said. "They didn't say they had to 
have gray hair, but gray hair, glasses, the typical grandma image there." 
</P>
<P>
 The gray hair requirement wasn't a problem for Golladay, who has 
salt-and-pepper locks, nor for Plass, whose hair is white. But Hunt and 
Anderson, both of whom have medium-brown gray, had to have their hair dyed gray 
for the commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them you don't have to be gray to be a grandma, but they (the 
advertising people) wouldn't listen," Hunt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the women and the bank are pleased with the commercial's popularity. The 
women have been featured on several television newscasts, and been invited to 
parades and events. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it's great," Oppenheimer said. "I think it's one of those examples 
of a great win-win situation. It seems like they're having a fun time, and the 
concept worked for us in the commercials." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're having a ball," Golladay said. "We're really having a blast with this." 
</P>
<P>
 The women will be special guests at the Cattlemen's Assn. convention in Pasco 
next Sunday and are booked for the Coulee City Rodeo Assn. parade and rodeo on 
Memorial Day weekend.

 When the ground began shaking in California, the phones at the U.S. Geological 
Survey's National Earthquake Information Center started ringing. And they 
didn't stop for eight straight hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The NEIC is the nerve center of a computerized nationwide network of 
seismological sensors that record even the faintest seismic activity -- 
including trucks rumbling over rough roads and small mine blasts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We locate all the significant earthquakes around the world and distribute 
information about them as quickly as we can to people who have the ability to 
prevent a disaster and save lives," said Waverly Person, the center's 
operations manager and the jovial, graying man who routinely appears on network 
television when big quakes hit. 
</P>
<P>
 When the 6.8-magnitude Northridge earthquake struck on Jan. 17, Person was 
awakened by his pager shortly after 5:30 a.m. Information relayed to his pager 
indicated a major tremor that had caused extensive damage. Before he could 
leave his house, "Good Morning America" called and asked what he knew. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not unusual," Persons said. "People often call us and ask for 
information before the shock waves (which travel at the speed of sound) reach 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 Person arrived at the center about 6 a.m. and spent the next seven hours in 
the control room, giving interview after interview and update after update. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started the day at 6:10 a.m. and went home at 2 o'clock the next morning," 
he said. "And I was back by 5 a.m. because they wanted me to go live on the 
'Today' show." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the big 5.3 aftershock in California in late March, Person said, 
"People were very, very excited and it frightened a lot of people. It did cause 
some significant damage, but I think the main effect was it scared people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many scientists expected that an aftershock of that magnitude could occur. 
But many of the people in California felt that since they had gone so long 
without getting an aftershock, it wasn't going to happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 Person, 60, says he is no celebrity, but he does consider himself a pioneer 
and role model. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm more or less a pioneer as an African-American in this field," he said. 
"There may have been one or two before me, but I'm the first I know to come 
this far. I get more requests for interviews than I can handle, most from 
predominantly black magazines who are looking for role models." 
</P>
<P>
 The National Earthquake Information Center was founded by the U.S. Department 
of Commerce in 1966 and was based in Rockville, Md. The center moved to the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration facility in Boulder, Colo., in 
1972. After the center was moved to the U.S. Department of the Interior, it 
relocated to the Colorado School of Mines campus in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 Gathering earthquake information in those early years was difficult because 
there were few seismic sensors to provide data. Technological advances have 
made the task simpler. 
</P>
<P>
 A bank of computers in the center's basement constantly monitors a network of 
130 seismic sensors across the country, automatically issuing a detailed report 
on every seismological incident that might be interpreted as an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The report includes information on the earthquake's date, time and location; 
its magnitude, epicenter and proximity to key population centers, and a list of 
local emergency preparedness officials to contact and their phone numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 The system also automatically rings up pagers worn by every center employee 
and by certain local officials -- such as railroad routing centers and dam 
maintenance and monitoring officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1992 we located 19,540 earthquakes worldwide, between 1 and 8 on the 
Richter scale," Person said. "In 1993, we're going to have more -- about 
20,000. That's not because our technology is getting better at detecting them." 
Last year, there were just more earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. 
Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. Thus, a 
reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 6.5. 
</P>
<P>
 When an earthquake hits, the center's 22-person staff swings into action, 
alerting the proper authorities, verifying and updating computer reports and 
using every means possible -- including television and radio interviews, 
telephone calls, fax machines and telegrams -- to get the word out. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually within minutes after a major earthquake is reported, Denver-area 
television news crews are in the center's control room, lined with rotating 
drums that display seismic activity from sensors across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 That is when Waverly Person takes center stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Waverly may be the most important person we have here in terms of getting out 
information that people can understand," said John Filson, the center's branch 
manager. "I've got a Ph.D. and I just can't seem to get the point across with 
the cameras rolling. I'm really happy we've got Waverly here." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides disseminating information about earthquakes that have just occurred, 
the center also compiles and publishes information about earthquakes and 
seismic activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our historical database is second to none from 1900 to the present. And it's 
updated every week," Person said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the center's database is tapped often by builders who want to know an 
area's seismological history. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all the data available, Person said it still is not possible to 
predict earthquakes or to identify trends. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't predict earthquakes. Period," he said. "We have psychics call in 
all the time who tell us, 'There's going to be an earthquake in California.' 
But that's not really a prediction. You have to know magnitude and location, 
and so far that hasn't been done."

CROSSES MARK TRAGIC END OF STROLL; OREGON: COMMUNITY TRIES TO COPE WITH DEATHS 
OF THREE CHILDREN AND A MOTHER RUN DOWN ALONG A HIGHWAY BY AN ALLEGEDLY DRUNK 
DRIVER. 
</P>

<P>
 The weather was sunny and warm, a glorious spring Sunday perfect for a walk 
into town. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramona Golding and her neighbor, Linda Sue Meyer, took their three young 
children by the hand on March 27 and headed toward Oregon Highway 224, where 
one by one they carefully made their way down a dry ditch several feet off the 
roadway. 
</P>
<P>
 A short distance up the highway, William Michael Patton was at the wheel of a 
car, heading down from the mountains after a night of partying with friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Patton, who had no driver's license, allegedly had been drinking. 
</P>
<P>
 The car veered off the roadway, went into the ditch and mowed down the line of 
pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
 All but Meyer died instantly. The children -- ages 3, 5 and 6 -- were hit so 
hard the impact knocked them out of their shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 The stunned residents of this timber and tourist town of 2,000 about 25 miles 
southeast of Portland are trying to cope with the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 They held a candlelight vigil, staged a student march against drunk driving 
and held a carwash and hot dog sale to help pay for the funerals. Memorial 
funds were established at a local bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone erected three small white crosses and one large one at the spot where 
the four died. Later, an even larger cross was added. Flowers lined one side of 
the ditch. 
</P>
<P>
 The rain that came in the days after the crash didn't wash away the police 
chalk that showed the path of the car, where the shoes were found, where the 
bodies landed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of a slaughter," said Sandi Peloquin, one of the organizers of 
the memorial events. "It was really senseless, having someone drunk that early 
in the day and not have any skid marks." 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Pulcinello had married and divorced Golding, but had lived with her again 
for several years. They planned to remarry in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Pulcinello was working on his truck and had waved to his family as they began 
their 1 1/2-mile walk to town to return some videos and do some shopping. 
</P>
<P>
 He heard the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard the sirens and I'm thinking, 'There's an accident and the girls are 
probably all down around there watching it,' " Pulcinello said. "So I jumped on 
my 10-speed and rolled down there. As I went around the corner, there's my wife 
in the middle of the road and my daughter and the neighbor's two boys down in 
the ditch." 
</P>
<P>
 Patton had been in trouble before, but nothing like this. His license was 
suspended two years ago because he had no insurance. He was on probation for 
stealing a car in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities won't say what Patton's blood-alcohol level was at the time of the 
crash, but witnesses said he appeared quite drunk. 
</P>
<P>
 He was indicted for driving under the influence of intoxicants, as well as 
four counts of manslaughter and two counts of assault. Patton pleaded innocent 
and remains in jail in lieu of $400,000 bond. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys' mother couldn't go to their funeral March 31. She remained 
hospitalized with a facial fracture, head injury, broken leg and broken ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 Pulcinello, whose former wife and daughter were buried the following day, 
exchanged a long hug with the boys' father outside the church. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he doesn't want revenge, confident Patton will be brought to justice.  
</P>
<P>
 Under Oregon sentencing guidelines, Patton could face 70 months in prison for 
each manslaughter count.

FISHERMEN STAGE BLOCKADE TO PROTEST BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Shortly before dawn Saturday, about 15 commercial fishing boats staged a brief 
blockade at the entrance of Ventura Harbor to protest a ban on gill-net fishing 
in coastal waters and other perceived hardships. 
</P>
<P>
 At 5:10 a.m., the Ventura-based fishermen assembled more than a dozen 30- to 
65-foot boats at the harbor entrance, blocking sailboats and sportfishing 
vessels heading out to sea, Senior Deputy Harbor Master Dave Glaser said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fishermen would not respond to the harbor master's radio calls, forcing a 
patrol crewman to take a boat out to the blockade and ask the protesters to 
move along. 
</P>
<P>
 "We warned them that they would be arrested if they didn't disperse quickly," 
Glaser said. The fishermen complied and left the entrance just before 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of them went back to their slips," Glaser said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Sutton, a commercial fisherman, said the protesters staged the blockade 
to express their frustration and anger over increased government regulations 
that they say have hurt their livelihood. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the commercial fishermen assembled before dawn to stop sportfishing 
boats from taking anglers to the waters where they are struggling to make a 
living. 
</P>
<P>
 "We accomplished what we wanted to accomplish," Sutton said. "If I can't go 
fishing, you shouldn't be able to go fishing." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, California voters passed Proposition 132 banning the use of gill 
nets, which are anchored to the ocean floor and stretched for miles to trap 
fish. Supporters of the ban said the nets posed a threat to marine mammals such 
as dolphins and sea lions. 
</P>
<P>
 A San Diego Superior Court judge last month dismissed a lawsuit challenging 
the proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Former gill-netter Hank Hubble said he joined the protest Saturday "just to 
let the state of California know they put me out of business. I was protesting 
that I have lost my complete livelihood. My bills go on and I can't work 
anymore."

OBITUARIES; * STEVEN D. SMITH; VETERAN LOCAL BLUES GUITARIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Steven Douglas (Buddy) Smith, a veteran blues guitar player and long a 
mainstay on the local music scene, was found dead Saturday morning after 
collapsing near his car in a K mart parking lot in Ventura. He was 46. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County coroner's office has not yet determined a cause of death, 
but foul play is not suspected. A coroner's spokesman said the office will very 
likely make an announcement today. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who has played in numerous bands over his 30-year career, had recently 
been playing in the Ventura-Santa Barbara area with his own group, the Buddy 
Smith Band. On his off nights, Smith would often sit in with other local groups 
such as Patrick Landreville's Blues Deluxe. 
</P>
<P>
 "He could've been the next guitar god," Landreville said in a recent 
interview. "I've known him since the '60s, and I think he's better than Stevie 
Ray Vaughan." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith began his professional music career in 1962 when he didn't get what he 
wanted for Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started playing guitar in 1960 after my dad died," Smith once said. "I 
wanted a telescope for Christmas, but I got a guitar instead. By 1962, I was 
playing surf music and by 1963, I had my own band, the Corvairs, an eight-piece 
surf band. . . . I used to ditch school and go hang out with the deejays at 
KACY like Bob Eubanks. That's the way it was growing up in Oxnard." 
</P>
<P>
 During the mid-60s, many popular rock bands played in Oxnard, and Smith at 
that time was managed by the concert promoter, Jim Salzer, playing at the 
Starlight Ballroom in Oxnard. "We opened for Captain Beefheart, the Hollies, 
Them, the Swingin' Medallions, the Leaves -- all those '60s bands." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Smith played in a variety of other bands that he founded, 
opening for major acts playing in the area, including the Doors, Jimi Hendrix 
and the Grateful Dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith attributed his local success to his distinctive style. 
</P>
<P>
 "I play blues with rhythm instead of rhythm and blues that's danceable," Smith 
said. "I know what the dancers want to hear. I like to give away my music to 
people who don't play an instrument. I like to see people enjoy and feel what I 
feel in my songs." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith is survived by two children in their early 20s, Monica Smith of San 
Diego, Shad Smith of Santa Barbara and his longtime girlfriend, Maggie 
Sullivan.

SO LITTLE PROGRESS IN RACE RELATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Recently, a young, black high school student from the Bay Area was visiting 
my friend's family in Dana Point. While taking a stroll, he was stopped by 
police and questioned.He was told that because he was black, he stood out in 
predominantly white South Orange County. He was also questioned about his 
activities, told that he looked suspicious, and warned to "stay out of 
trouble." Had the youth not been carrying my friend's business card, he might 
very well have ended up at the police station. 
</P>
<P>
 Personally, I find this a chilling indictment of our democratic society when a 
person is questioned by police merely because of his skin color. The furor over 
the Rodney King incident brought to the fore police harassment of blacks, 
especially males. When a personal acquaintance experiences this firsthand, the 
problem ceases to be an abstract news item. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Orange County police deserve credit for performing a difficult job 
under frequently dangerous conditions, they might well take note of the Rodney 
King incident and the subsequent riots in Los Angeles. Police time should be 
spent apprehending lawbreakers and not detaining people because of their skin 
color. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1800s, blacks were required to be legally sponsored by their white 
slaveholders. Similarly, my friend's business card literally served as a "pass" 
for the black youth.  
</P>
<P>
 It's sad and frightening to note how slowly we have progressed in the area of 
race relations in the past 200 years.

IDEAS ON BATTLING BIGOTRY, RACISM 
</P>

 * Rusty Kennedy asks us to not simply condemn racism and bigotry but to take 
an introspective look at our own roles in either stopping or furthering hatred 
("Is It a Fanatic Few Who Are 'Anti,' or Our Society at Large?" April 10). 
</P>
<P>
 He encourages us to form relationships with others different from ourselves 
and develop respect and appreciation for one another. 
</P>

 His words and actions will inevitably lead to an increased sense of community 
in Orange County that will benefit all who live here.

 * I respect what Rusty Kennedy and the Orange County Human Relations 
Commission want to accomplish. I have attended a few of their meetings over the 
years, made a financial donation and have recently started to participate in 
"living room dialogues," where people can discuss issues of race and bigotry in 
an informal setting. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, however, I have heard and seen lots of conversation but too 
little action. There are too few ways for Orange County citizens to participate 
in activities to get at this insidious thing called "bigotry." It is too subtle 
and too ingrained to again list the terrible things that have happened and only 
spend one final paragraph on what should be done. 
</P>
<P>
 I challenge Mr. Kennedy to write Chapter 2 of his article and show our 
citizens the kind of things that can be done and ought to be attempted. Despite 
his statistics, my anecdotal experience teaches me this aspect of our world is 
getting worse, not better. Too many see others as biased but not themselves in 
that light. Somehow what they believe is "different" from those other terrible 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 Like that country and Western song says: "A little less talk and a lot more 
action" is what we need.

UCI EDUCATION DEPARTMENT IS NEEDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Very soon (I have been told that letters of comment were due by April 15), 
after minimal publicity and very little time or opportunity for public 
awareness or input, UC Irvine will make the decision whether to abolish its 
Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unfortunate that in response to budget cuts the university is 
considering cutting one of the few graduate departments that has contributed 
directly to the community. The UCI Department of Education has served Orange 
County both by training outstanding teachers and by sponsoring the UCI Writing 
Project, which has extensively and successfully retrained many English teachers 
throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Cal State system also has teaching credential programs, the 
service currently provided by UCI cannot be duplicated. First, UCI serves 
central Orange County; schools have a chance to train and evaluate student 
teachers and to choose the finest among them to join our local school 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, UCI is the university in our area that attracts our top graduates 
from high school. 
</P>
<P>
 While these students could certainly get acceptable training at a nearby Cal 
State program, the very best students, who may wish to continue their training 
at the prestigious university level, will have to leave the county and may be 
lost to our local districts altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 The UCI Writing Project, which has been responsible for research in the 
instruction of writing and the successful retraining of writing teachers, would 
also be lost to our area. As a college writing instructor and as a parent, I 
have witnessed the tremendous benefit to teachers and students of the UCI 
Writing Project. 
</P>
<P>
 Times are tough and cuts are necessary, but certainly university 
administrators can make choices that will not have such a major negative impact 
on the education of its own constituency, Orange County K-12 students. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Education may not be a moneymaking glamour field, but it is 
the department most responsible for educating the future students -- and the 
future supporters -- of the entire university. Cutting top students and 
teachers off from university training will ultimately result in erosion of 
public support for the remaining programs of the university.

CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES DESERVE BETTER

<TEXT>
<P>
 * I was at the Orange school board meeting where the board voted to lay off 
classified employees and cut their benefits, and I was shocked by the complete 
disregard for our district's hard-working employees exhibited by the board. I 
was at the meeting for another reason, and the confrontation came as a big 
surprise to me.An even bigger surprise was the board's lack of interest in 
compromising with the men and women who have devoted their lives to the 
education of our children. 
</P>
<P>
 One woman who has been working for the district since 1967 stood up and spoke. 
She had been working for the district for 27 years and was being treated like 
dirt by men and women elected to the board less than half a year ago. 
Appalling. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally appalling is the fact that The Times did not see fit to write an 
article about this meeting until nearly two weeks after the fact. I don't think 
it's unreasonable to expect your newspaper to provide citizens with timely 
local news.

RETAINING PUBLIC ACCESS TO SCENIC PARK; * LAGUNA NIGUEL HOMEOWNERS SHOULDN'T 
TURN PARKING AREA INTO PRIVATE PRESERVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The debate over public safety versus public access has been much in the news 
as coastal cities have sought to retain the option of enforcing curfews on 
beaches. But in Laguna Niguel, the conflict has a different cast. The Orange 
County Environmental Management Agency is seeking to preserve access to a 
scenic park that is accessible only by a private road where wealthy homeowners 
have painted curbs red and put up no-parking signs. 
</P>
<P>
 Who's right? This is one of those prevailing cases where tilting on the side 
of access seems most appropriate, especially in view of the history of the 
private development. The homeowners say that the signs are a way of preserving 
access to emergency vehicles, and they argue that people really don't have to 
walk very far anyway from the north entrance of the street to the entrance of 
the park. The county says that reasonable access to the scenic park, Badlands 
Park, can be made only through the road and that putting up the prohibitions 
effectively bars the public's access to the park. 
</P>
<P>
 The courts now will have to sort out the debate in a lawsuit filed by the 
county. Orange County officials have sought a permanent injunction against the 
Monarch Point Homeowners Assn. No settlement appears imminent, although parties 
are to meet again soon. The case may well go to court. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the public can walk to the park, it's hard to argue with the 
merits of the county's case, as it is grounded in the very spirit of the 
California Coastal Act. The developer of the site recognized this basic 
condition when the homes were built in 1988 and agreed to remove signs and the 
paint from the curb to receive a coastal development permit. In 1992, county 
officials discovered that the paint and no-parking signs had reappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 To preserve access, homeowners next to a public waterfront park should not be 
able to make a private preserve of nearby parking areas.

LEAGUE OF CITIES AN EFFECTIVE, FAIR ENTITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * As a member of the League of California Cities Board of Directors 
representing Orange County, I would like to clear up some misconceptions 
conveyed by Garden Grove Councilman Bruce A. Broadwater's letter (April 3). 
</P>
<P>
 First, as dreadful as it sounds, the more than $700 million in revenue taken 
from cities by the state in recent years could have been much worse. For 
example, the state removed $2.5 billion from counties and $619 million from 
special districts. The hit on cities was reduced considerably because cities 
have a former mayor and past president of the League of California Cities in 
the governor's mansion and the league mounted an effective, grass-roots 
lobbying strategy aimed at legislators on their home district turf. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, votes in this nation haven't depended upon financial position since 
folks paid tribute to the Crown prior to 1776. Dues to the league's Orange 
County division are based upon a flat rate and a population escalator to 
reflect the relative impact of cities on division staff resources. The state 
league dues are based on population only to calculate the relative impact of 
larger cities on state league resources. 
</P>
<P>
 Third, there are matters upon which cities vote that are structured to give 
more weight to larger cities. For example, the election of a city 
representative to the South Coast Air Quality Management District board of 
directors requires a vote of two-thirds of the cities in Orange County (21) 
that also represent two-thirds of the county's incorporated population. 
Ironically, the decision of who to appoint to the South Coast AQMD board was 
one of the toughest we've faced in Orange County for a long time. It appears 
that regardless of the rhetoric, Garden Grove's departure from the League of 
California Cities was fueled by a tough decision not going their way. We hope 
they will decide to return so we have the benefit of their perspective on 
difficult public policy decisions.

CITIES WISE TO SEEK YOUTHFUL PERSPECTIVE; * FRESH IDEAS BRING VITALITY TO A 
WORLD OF ADULT ORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The future belongs to the young, and two Orange County cities are showing how 
it is wise not to defer participation in planning for those who can be included 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 Through city committees, Irvine and Tustin are touching base with young people 
before making some decisions affecting youth. These are tough budgetary times 
for many, but where possible, it's worth the effort to consult with young 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine, for example, is a city whose youthful energy breathes vitality into a 
world of adult order and predictability. The youngsters living in the 
cul-de-sacs and subdivisions are in many ways the raison d'etre for a planned 
residential community. They are the ones, after all the jockeying over housing 
values and talk of being locked into mortgage payments, around whom many 
community decisions are made. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine's Youth Action Team is made up of students from four high schools who 
advise the City Council on issues of importance to young residents, for 
example, conflicts between them and police. According to Luke Fenchel, a team 
member, "Teens in Irvine sometimes don't feel like they're heard." In 
neighboring Tustin, high school and middle school students give policy advice 
to the city's leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 This sense of not feeling part of the process, described by Fenchel, can be a 
common experience for youngsters. Suburban communities would ignore the counsel 
of these young folks at their own peril. It is good to see that these 
communities shrewdly recognize high school students as an important 
constituency, and are bringing them into the process of decision-making. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a way of turning some of the anomie that's out there into something 
positive. Regular readers of "OC HIGH, Student News & Views," which appears on 
Thursdays in The Times Orange County Edition, will recognize some of these 
sentiments, as youngsters endeavor to come to terms with their sense of 
personal identity and to find meaning in an unpredictable and increasingly 
dangerous world. 
</P>
<P>
 A Feb. 17 article on students Mazen Faysal and Ruba Kharuf, sophomores at 
Santa Margarita High School, described students' interest in going beyond 
themselves to help victims of civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The youngsters 
helped their world history teacher gather more than 400 hospital bedsheets and 
gowns, which were packaged with hundreds of letters, and sent through the 
humanitarian organization Operation Second Chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Faysal's advice to his fellow students also was instructive for communities 
seeking to mobilize the support and help of young people: "Try to get involved 
with something; as long as you're involved, it matters. You don't have to be 
powerful or have a lot of money to make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
 It is terrific to see that kind of idealism in young people. So why not 
harness it for the good of local communities? Moreover, as David Mars, 
professor emeritus of public administration at USC, observes, participating in 
local government gives young adults "a taste of what local governments face. 
Even if they don't go into politics, it would make them better-informed 
citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 Some cities in the county, such as Garden Grove and Anaheim, had such student 
commissions as of a few years ago, but they were lost in budget cuts. Others, 
such as Fountain Valley, had considered them but have been awaiting more money. 
Irvine pays its youngsters on the commission $5.98 an hour. Can't others 
somehow find some money for this important work? It seems a small price to pay 
as an investment in the community's future.

CLARIFYING INTENT OF VENDOR LEGISLATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I am writing to clarify the issue regarding street vendor legislation 
introduced by state Sen. Rob Hurtt (R-Garden Grove) which appeared in Focus 
(Feb. 23). The legislation, SB 458, would restore local authority regarding 
street vending in residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurtt introduced this legislation at Anaheim's request after city officials 
received numerous citizen complaints regarding vendor trucks being disruptive 
to the residential community. The complaints centered around street congestion, 
excessive noise, trash or debris from packaging, blight in neighborhoods, and 
jeopardizing the public's health and safety.  
</P>
<P>
 In many communities throughout Orange County and Southern California, vending 
from vehicles is no longer typified by the traditional roving ice cream or 
bakery trucks. In many instances, large vans or trucks are parked on 
residential streets for prolonged periods of time -- primarily for the purpose 
of vending a wide variety of products. Many of the food products are not 
inspected by the health department and pose a potential safety hazard to 
children and adults. 
</P>
<P>
 These trucks constitute nothing less than markets or stores on wheels, a 
majority of which do not obtain a business license or pay sales or use tax, 
which is unfair to those businesses that abide by the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Under existing law, local government can impose very limited standards to 
regulate street vendors. Local government, in essence, has no authority to 
resolve this issue without the enactment of state legislation. Hurtt's 
legislation is designed to permit, not mandate, the prohibition of street 
vendors in residential areas.

CONFRONTING THE ISSUES THAT FACE LAGUNA BEACH RESIDENTS, OFFICIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I would like to thank Councilman Bob Gentry for his levelheaded and 
thoughtful handling of the Explorer Scout agenda item. 
</P>
<P>
 I appreciate him having brought this situation to the city's attention, and I 
appreciate his position. It is a confusing message to our youth to have a city 
law against discrimination for any reason, including sexual orientation, at the 
same time the city signs a contract agreeing to the Boys Scouts of America's 
policy of discrimination against gays. It is confusing to us adults too. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Gentry did not want to see a program beneficial to our youth 
terminated, he compromised. Compromise has always been Gentry's long suit. In 
this case, he once again demonstrated why he has been an elected official for 
11 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, (Councilman) Wayne Peterson is apparently not even aware of the 
word compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 The perfect example was the agenda item that called for an independent 
analysis of the city's water system operations and requirements necessary to 
ensure public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson cast the only no vote. He cast a no vote because he would rather see 
the city at risk than to agree that the water district cooperate with the city 
in getting expert analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been Wayne Peterson's position all along that the water district knows 
best even though Orange County Fire Chief (Lawrence J.) Holms criticized them 
for failing to provide sufficient electrical backup generators in order to pump 
enough water during our Oct. 27 (fire) emergency. Peterson voted no knowing 
that the state has mandated local agencies to cooperate in preparing emergency 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Peterson talks "public health and safety," but it's action that counts. 
</P>
<P>

 Laguna Beach 
</P>
<P>
 * I have a saying which comes in handy on occasion: "Blessed are those who 
expect nothing, for they are rarely disappointed." It works particularly well 
in Laguna, particularly if you don't come down on the side of the Village 
Laguna agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 So, when I attended the City Council meeting April 5, just to see if our 
Village Laguna (now they call themselves Protect Laguna) majority was actually 
going to vote to delay construction of the reservoir once more. They did in 
fact delay it again, just as I expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Can you believe it? The Protect Laguna majority is going to protect us by 
delaying construction of the reservoir while they have a consultant review all 
the information they already have, so that the consultant can come back and 
help them make this very complex decision of whether or not an extra 3 million 
gallons of water would help if we should have another disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 When confronted with the fact that a study has already been completed, which 
the city won't release, (City Manager) Ken Frank, stammered ". . . that was a 
verbal report." Could it be that this report didn't support Protect Laguna / 
Village Laguna's position? 
</P>
<P>
 Then, we find out that the city paid $3,000 for this "verbal report" that they 
apparently didn't like, and that they apparently didn't like the in-depth 
"Firestorm '93 Report" prepared by the Orange County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 How could anyone in their right mind deny the need to proceed with 
construction of the reservoir? But, there they were -- Lida Lenney, Ann 
Christoph, Bob Gentry, (Gene Felder, Johanna Felder, Protect Laguna / Village 
Laguna), calling for another study, and of course another delay. And, get this, 
they authorized a whole $850 to have an expert pull everything together that's 
been collected to date. 
</P>
<P>
 I wonder who is going to interpret the "verbal report" for this expert? 
</P>
<P>
 Just hope this ongoing smoke screen doesn't find us consumed by another 
disaster when the Santa Ana winds heat up again next fall, while these masters 
of deception continue compiling their reports. Call your councilpersons and 
demand that they start construction of the reservoir at once. 
</P>

<P>
 * The Urban Laguna groups preach health and safety, but didn't bother to 
attend a workshop to improve the health and safety in our city. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, they are not interested in making policy, just criticizing it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission has scheduled extra meetings, the first and third 
Wednesday of each month from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m. to review and rewrite the City's 
Seismic and Public Safety Element of the General Plan. They have reached out, 
encouraging suggestions and input from individuals and groups. On April 6, the 
meeting covered hazardous materials; there was a good representation from many 
of the neighborhood associations around town. I represented Village Laguna. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was there representing the Taxpayers Assn. No one was there 
representing United Laguna. No one was there representing the Laguna Coalition. 
Doing nothing makes it easier to criticize, and if you notice, they habitually 
criticize. Could it be just to score political points? 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, we need to work together to improve our community. I hope these 
groups and others will attend the next meeting which will be at the Council 
Chambers on Wednesday. The important topic will be Emergency Planning and 
Response.

'SAVE OUR STATE' FROM HAROLD EZELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I hope we can "save our state" from the overzealous enthusiasm of Harold 
Ezell (Orange County Platform, April 7) who would defend us from the 
nonexistent danger of hordes of illegal immigrants in our voting booths. 
</P>
<P>
 The right to vote is fundamental to freedom and democracy.Ease of registration 
is the key to exercising that right. The value of our right to vote is not 
enhanced by registration procedures so restrictive that they shut eligible 
citizens out of the voting process. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course it is possible for non-citizens like the alleged assassin of Mexican 
presidential candidate Colosio to fill out a registration form because they 
misunderstand the citizenship requirement or they are bold enough to risk the 
penalty for lying under oath. But most illegal immigrants want to keep a very 
low profile and avoid unnecessary contact with governmental agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Our problem in California, and the rest of the nation as well, is not that a 
few who are not eligible do vote, but that almost half of those who are 
eligible citizens do not.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES; COMMENTARY ON INSURANCE; THE LITIGATION EPIDEMIC IS 
KILLING OFF AFFORDABLE HOUSING; BOGUS OR UNWARRANTED CONSTRUCTION-DEFECT SUITS 
HAVE FORCED BUILDERS TO DROP PROJECTS. HERE IS A CONSTRUCTIVE ALTERNATIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWIGHT HANSEN, Dwight Hansen is legislative advocate for the California 
Building Industry Assn. and staffs its Homeowner Dispute Resolution Task Force. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When you and I buy auto insurance, we can obtain lower rates if we have no 
moving violations, because we're a better risk. Unfortunately for Orange County 
builders, liability insurance companies can no longer afford to differentiate 
between builders with perfect records and those with a history of problems -- 
either one is likely to be sued. 
</P>
<P>
 We know several builders with as many as 20 lawsuits pending against them -- 
reputable, large builders who have been in business for years. They're being 
sued by homeowners associations for alleged defects in construction and design 
that either don't exist, or that could be fixed for a fraction of the cost of 
going to court. 
</P>
<P>
 This epidemic of construction-defect lawsuits is killing off the supply of 
affordable housing in Orange County and is spreading throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
 As you would suspect, insurance companies often settle claims, whether or not 
any proof of a defect exists, because it is cheaper than litigating. Then the 
insurer drops the builder client. Since they can't get insurance to do 
multifamily, condominium or planned-unit developments, many builders are 
changing their business plans and won't build these projects anymore, 
particularly those involving homeowners associations. 
</P>
<P>
 Not a single state-admitted insurance carrier is covering liability for condo 
or multifamily construction right now, even for developers with decades-long 
records of defect-free building. The only liability insurance available is from 
higher-risk, higher-premium carriers located out of state. 
</P>
<P>
 Even architects and engineers who design primarily single-family homes find 
themselves unable to get liability coverage if they do even a small portion of 
work on multifamily or condo units -- so they, like many builders, are either 
dropping out of that market or are dangerously working without coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, all of this is happening at a time when condos are the most 
affordable for-sale housing in the Orange County area. The Tax Reform Act of 
1986, which eliminated many of the tax incentives for the creation of 
multifamily housing, and the recession have combined to all but shut down the 
building of rental and for-sale multifamily housing. 
</P>
<P>
 From a peak of 15,101 units in 1986, production in Orange County dropped to 
2,980 in 1991, 2,361 in 1992, and 1,826 in 1993.  
</P>
<P>
 To address this growing crisis, the California Building Industry Assn. is 
sponsoring legislation that would create an alternative way to resolve disputes 
about construction defects -- anything from face-to-face meetings between the 
parties to arbitration to mediation -- without going to court. The legislation, 
SB 2073, introduced by state Sen. Charles M. Calderon (D-Whittier) is scheduled 
for its first hearing May 3. 
</P>
<P>
 We recognize there are legitimate construction defects and that a homeowner 
and the homeowners association have the right to get them fixed. 
</P>
<P>
 We also recognize that it is likely for disputes to occur between people. But 
we do not believe these disagreements must be settled in court. Homeowners 
associations and builders risk spending hundreds of thousands of dollars in 
legal fees and hundreds of hours in depositions trying to create a legal 
solution to what may well be a technical or communication problem. 
</P>
<P>
 In many cases, homeowners associations file lawsuits without even notifying 
the builder that a problem exists. In others, no problem exists: There is, 
rather, an aggressive plaintiff's attorney who manages to convince the 
association to do "destructive testing," such as knocking down plasterboard or 
punching holes in the roof, to see if a defect which has yet to manifest itself 
in any form might be lurking inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Some attorneys even threaten to sue association board members unless the board 
pursues litigation. A more common and subtle approach is for a law firm to 
offer the association board members a "free" seminar on construction defects 
and an inspection to see if the project is sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, these lawsuits are filed with only the vaguest description of an 
alleged defect.  
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys working on a contingency-fee basis aren't always interested in 
getting a builder to fix the problem -- that won't get them a percentage of any 
cash settlement. Often by the time the attorney takes his or her 30% or 40% 
fee, there may not be enough money to repair the defect, if there was one. But 
no one is required to explain that to the homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 A cash settlement in a roofing problem, for example, might never be spent to 
repair what amounts to an undamaged roof. The cash becomes what amounts to 
fraudulent enrichment of attorneys and homeowners associations, perhaps to the 
detriment of the homeowner. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Calderon's legislation requires the homeowners association to notify the 
builder in writing of the existence of specific defects of problems that are 
being alleged. 
</P>
<P>
 The builder may then submit in writing an offer to settle by either doing the 
remedial work, paying the association a cash settlement, or some combination 
thereof. After the evaluation is completed, a majority of association board 
members must meet and confer with the developer to discuss any outstanding 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 SB 2073 also calls for the informed consent of a majority of the individual 
homeowners before the association can bring a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The information should tell homeowners what is wrong with the property, what 
the developer is or is not willing to do to correct the problem, an estimate of 
what the lawsuit will cost to prosecute, whether enough money is likely to 
result from the suit after costs to repair the defect, and what the arrangement 
with legal counsel will be. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners should know that refinancing opportunities and home sales can be 
blocked until litigation is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 If at any time the builder does not fulfill his or her obligation to respond, 
evaluate, communicate and meet with the homeowners association, the group is 
free to pursue the lawsuit. But the association must give the developer the 
opportunity to cure the problem before the suit can be filed. 
</P>
<P>
 During the whole process of trying to work things out, the clock that's 
ticking away toward the end of the 10-year statute of limitations is stopped. 
The association won't lose its right to go to court in the event the builder 
does not satisfactorily address the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Litigation should be a way to resolve disputes that can't be resolved 
otherwise. But effective dispute resolution is not possible without detailed, 
good-faith communication between the parties. 
</P>
<P>
 SB 2073 is intended to encourage this communication and resolve at least some 
of these disputes without further clogging the judicial system and jeopardizing 
the construction of affordable housing in Orange County and the state of 
California.

BEACH SAFETY, HISTORY MATTER LITTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Irony. As a teacher who believes that structures from the past must be saved 
for those in the future, I was dismayed and eventually disgusted in the 1980s 
with the destruction of historic or old downtown homes and buildings. I 
volunteered and was appointed to the city-sponsored Historical Board. We who 
served were to find that the board was a front to relieve the consciences of 
those in charge of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 As we earnestly tried to keep buildings preserved, the city was putting 
permits on the desk at 5:30 p.m. and demolishing the structures by 6 p.m. When 
questioned, city council members and planners continually told us they were 
making way for a "family-safe" redevelopment area. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, we find the "safe" streets a haven for bars, carousing crowds and often, 
out-of-control behavior. Many downtown residents stay away from Main Street at 
night. Now, the area has experienced the ultimate of assaults on a community -- 
murder. For those of us who saw an ill-placed mentality for destruction of 
buildings and homes dominate in the name of "safety," we can now mourn the 
destruction of the city's greatest asset -- its people. Irony.

<P>
 * As a resident of Huntington Beach, I've had enough of the current council 
majority and their lack of concern for our public safety. The writing was on 
the wall that public safety was going to take a back seat when the council cut 
marine safety below the necessary staffing level. I find it amazing that with 
the beaches closing at 10 p.m. (you'd expect to at least have a marine safety 
officer until that time), all our officers go home at 6 p.m. It's nice to know 
the council is willing to allow a four-hour time period when there is no 
protection on the beach for our families. 
</P>
<P>
 Haven't (recent) incidents been enough of a wake-up call for the council 
majority? Don't they think that two murders, an armed robbery and a stabbing in 
a two-week period is enough? 
</P>
<P>
 I have had enough of this nonsense and lack of concern by this council. I want 
results, not discussion. We've had enough talk; it's time for action. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach was one of only two cities in Orange County that had 
increases in crime. What with Huntington Beach having only 1.1 officers per 
1,000 residents, and the statewide average being 2.0, it's obvious that we are 
surrendering in this battle against crime as long as the current council, led 
by Mayor Linda Moulton-Patterson, believes that parking spaces and trees are 
more important than public safety.

FIRE SURVIVOR RAPS REBUILDING DELAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * As a survivor of the October '93 Laguna Beach Fire, I must take issue with 
your editorial ("Patience Will Pay Off in the Long Run," April 3). You state 
that experts have indicated that the hillsides must be stabilized, and yet in 
the next sentence you state that further study needs to be made as to whether 
an ancient landslide even exists. 
</P>
<P>
 If the fire had not occurred, we homeowners in the Mystic Hills would still be 
living there without one word forthcoming from the city or geologists about a 
potential slide. As a matter of fact, a number of homes have been built in the 
Mystic Hills area over the past 10 years, with soils reports approved by the 
city and with knowledge of the existence of a possible landslide of at least 
10,000 to 100,000 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire Laguna Beach hillside area is beset with probable ancient 
landslides, as designated in these numerous soils reports by licensed 
geologists. No previous stoppage of permits by the city occurred. The same 
logic would prevent any homes being built in Southern California because of 
houses built on or near earthquake faults. 
</P>
<P>
 After surviving a firestorm and losing everything but having hope of returning 
to an almost normal life, to delay rebuilding for an indefinite period of time 
is unbearable.

BATTLE LINES DRAWN OVER THE FUTURE OF VENICE BOARDWALK; LANDMARK: HEATED DEBATE 
ON RENOVATION PLANS AND VENDING RULES IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE WHEN OFFICIALS 
TAKE UP THE ISSUE AGAIN THIS WEEK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Debates over the look of the Venice Boardwalk and what to do about illegal 
vending there will resume this week as Los Angeles recreation commissioners 
consider a $10-million renovation as well as ways to restrict sales on the 
walkway. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Recreation and Park Commissioners will meet in Venice on 
Wednesday to decide the next step in planning the renovation, the subject of a 
raucous public meeting two weeks ago. Two groups have proposed ways to use the 
funds, which were designated for Venice Beach improvement by county voters in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The board, which will meet at the Penmar Recreation Center at 4:30 p.m., is 
expected to approve a rough plan for allocating the money. But it will probably 
put off controversial matters, such as repaving the boardwalk with brick, until 
concluding a series of workshops aimed at mediating the fierce disagreements. 
</P>
<P>
 To be aired for the first time is a plan to close loopholes in the city's law 
restricting the sales of goods by political groups, charities and individuals 
who set up tables on the west edge of the boardwalk, which is city park land. 
</P>
<P>
 Past efforts to restrict vending have prompted outcries from artists and 
performers, who say the limits violate their constitutional freedoms and dampen 
the boardwalk's street fair spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission will consider testing a summertime program -- proposed by the 
Venice Boardwalk Assn. -- to crack down on illegal vending. It would limit the 
table size used by groups to six-feet-long and seek a change in city law to 
require that anything sold must bear the group's precise political or religious 
message. 
</P>
<P>
 Private boardwalk merchants complain that they are losing business to vendors 
who hawk everything from T-shirts to incense. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal also asks for a change in the municipal law to allow city park 
rangers to enforce the vending law along with police. 
</P>
<P>
 A city task force is still studying additional proposals, such as requiring 
permits for artists and nonprofit organizations to sell their wares. Performers 
would not be affected. 
</P>
<P>
 A public meeting April 5 drew more than 200 people, many of them critical of 
the price of some renovations envisioned in a plan proposed by the boardwalk 
association and the Venice Action Committee, a group of neighborhood merchants 
and residents. Audience members interrupted rival speakers with hoots and calls 
to shut up. 
</P>
<P>
 Planners have recommended spending about $3 million to fix the closed Venice 
Pier, planning for which is already under way, and about $7 million for the 
boardwalk renovation. 
</P>
<P>
 They also suggest that the commission hire a Venice architectural firm -- the 
same one that developed the association's proposal -- to oversee workshops 
aimed at giving residents a chance to hash out details of the refurbishment. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommended architects, Diana Pollard and Michael King, drew up the 
association's plan last year, free of charge. A leading foe of the plan, 
boardwalk activist Jerry Rubin, says it is unfair for the city to hire them to 
lead workshops and sketch a final design because of their ties to the 
association plan. King said the two would be unbiased in their work.

BRIDGE CONSTRUCTION IS ON THE WRONG TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Freeway bridges can be constructed to survive quakes, and we can learn from 
the railroads how to construct them. 
</P>
<P>
 No railroad bridges were damaged in the Jan. 17 earthquake, and passenger 
trains and freight trains hauling tons and tons of freight crossed them without 
interruption.Some railroad bridges are more than 100 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 Railroad bridges are built with wood and some with steel. Some with both. 
These materials are somewhat flexible and after vibration they go back to their 
original position. 
</P>
<P>
 Reinforced concrete used for freeway bridges cracks and crumbles. Just notice 
all the cracks in concrete driveways and sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
 If they were in a vertical position instead of lying on a surface, they would 
be down like freeway bridges.

CSUN IS TOO VITAL TO DELAY ITS REBUILDING; FEMA'S PAST TREATMENT OF 
UNIVERSITIES CAUSES CONCERN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rebuilding the campus of Cal State Northridge in a timely and thorough fashion 
is a matter of vital importance to the San Fernando Valley and to Los Angeles 
as a whole. That's why it is important to recall the history of some California 
colleges and universities that have sustained massive earthquake damage. The 
record, thus far, is a troubling one. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though more than four years have passed since the 1989 Loma Prieta 
earthquake, for example, repairs have still not begun on wrecked and closed 
buildings on the campuses of Stanford and San Francisco State universities. 
Some Stanford classes are still being held in portable structures. Some 
dormitories at San Francisco State are still off limits. After the 1987 
Whittier Narrows quake, it took five years to finally complete the repair work 
on Cal State Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 All three of those rebuilding efforts involved the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency (FEMA) and, in some cases, disputes that are still ongoing 
over the costs and kind of repair work needed, and over the quality of some of 
the work that has been done. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our frustration came as we could never rely on any agreement with FEMA as 
things came together and fell apart," said Valerie Veronin, Stanford's acting 
director of facilities project management. And it is FEMA, by the strength of a 
Clinton Administration decree, that has promised to pay for 90% of the damage 
to public facilities like CSUN from the Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, this is the "New and Improved" FEMA, according to the Clinton 
Administration, and CSUN officials have high praise for the agency's efforts on 
its behalf so far. But ours is a cautionary concern. Simply put, CSUN has yet 
to broach "the nuts and bolts and dollars and cents of our claim," to federal 
officials, according to President Blenda Wilson. This means that there is much 
to do. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Wilson and Cal State officials have to come up with the definitive 
assessment of the quake damage, and soon. So far, the low-ball estimate is 
comparable to that of other campuses after previous quakes. But the worst-case 
CSUN numbers (about $350 million) would amount to the costliest disaster ever 
for an American university. 
</P>
<P>
 Once those numbers are obtained, it is incumbent upon every local member of 
Congress, and on every state and local elected official from our region, to 
closely follow the efforts to rebuild the campus that instructs 26,000 
students, employs 2,000 others and holds the San Fernando Valley's largest 
library. 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of vigilance from our elected representatives will be important 
because no one knows how long the new and generous FEMA policy (and the Clinton 
Administration, for that matter) will last. And the nation's interest and 
attention to the Northridge quake and its effects may wane considerably when 
the next hurricane devastates the East Coast, or when the next line of 
tornadoes rips through the Midwest, or when the Mississippi floods again and 
buries a few million more acres of farm land under mountains of silt.

BURBANK AIRPORT STORIES ARE FOLLOWING A PATTERN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The Times Valley Edition allows itself to be used as a pawn to spread the 
propaganda of the Burbank Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time the Burbank Airport faced a possible adverse decision, The Times 
ran an article titled "The Freeways Above Us," which, in part, attempted to 
explain why flights from Burbank Airport had to depart to the southwest (of 
course, the article could not and did not explain how the airport was able to 
have all flights depart to the east when the north-south runway was closed). 
</P>
<P>
 Now, after the airport received another adverse judicial decision, The Times 
ran "Burbank Airport Expansion Plans Taking Off" (Feb. 27). 
</P>
<P>
 The article failed to note that both the state trial court and appellate court 
have blocked the airport's expansion because the airport has not complied with 
state law. In other words, the expansion is not "taking off" at all. (And, 
given the fact that, as reported by The Times, landings and takeoffs have 
decreased, it appears that the airport need not expand). 
</P>
<P>
 One would think that The Times would at least tell about relevant rulings made 
by estate courts when reporting on this story.

SYMPATHY WAS MISPLACED IN STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I must take exception to your story "Suspect Viewed as Psychotic After 
Girl's Death" (April 6). I was shocked by the sympathetic tone of this article 
about Hooman Panah, who has been charged with murdering 8-year-old Nicole 
Parker last November. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the reasons our society has become so sick is because our system 
sympathizes with the perpetrators of crimes more than with the victims. Child 
molesters in particular are continually allowed to prey on our children because 
we are afraid of causing a panic or unjustly accusing the innocent. How much 
longer and how many more children will suffer or die before the media take some 
responsibility for their part in this charade? 
</P>
<P>
 Panah does not deserve our pity for being mentally ill. In fact, according to 
your article, he is not a U.S. citizen. Six months after he came to America, he 
was hospitalized for mental problems. This would have made him ineligible for 
citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days after Nicole's murder, her mother, Lori Parker, granted you an 
exclusive interview. She deserves better treatment from you than you have given 
to her in the writing of this most recent article. I suppose that it is obvious 
that your paper has no loyalty and if you feel you can get more readership with 
a sympathetic view of a killer then you have no problem playing 
"switch-hitter."  
</P>
<P>
 The only ones who deserve your sympathy in this situation are Nicole's parents 
and brothers and all of her friends who miss her terribly. Cancel my 
subscription.

CALABASAS NEEDS TO FOLLOW THE BLUEPRINT; CITY IS WASTING TIME, MONEY BY 
APPROVING PROJECTS BEFORE DEVELOPING A GENERAL PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1990, when Calabasas residents were struggling to form an independent city 
unencumbered by Los Angeles County, some local developers were so fearful of a 
crackdown on new construction that they asked to be excluded from the new city 
limits. In fact, Calabasas cityhood backers often complained about county 
officials who were "highly permissive" in allowing too many large development 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it was the new Calabasas City Council that approved 250 luxury homes for a 
gated community on 938 acres in the Micor project in 1992, in its first major 
land-use decision. The site was a secluded canyon in the Las Virgenes Valley . 
. . and Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Robert H. O'Brien crushed the project 
last year. It seems that Calabasas officials had failed to adopt a land-use 
plan. Without one, the judge ruled, the county plan held sway. Ironically, that 
county plan would have allowed just 81 homes on the site. In January, a state 
appeals court backed O'Brien's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Calabasas city officials took neither the hint nor the advice 
of the court. Instead of putting all of their efforts into creating their own 
General Plan, those officials patched together an "urgency" ordinance giving 
the city of 27,000 the authority to approve construction of more homes in Las 
Virgenes Valley than anticipated by the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrong again. On April 8, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Diane Wayne 
overturned the "urgency" ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue here is not the value of the project, which has been supported by 
the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy for its setting aside of 700 acres for 
park space. Nor is it a case, as the mayor of Calabasas puts it, of a local 
government not being allowed to govern. The blueprint here is clear. Develop a 
General Plan, and then approve your development projects, not before . . . 
unless you like wasting public money in court.

A QUIZ FOR THE BURBANK SCHOOL BOARD; QUESTIONS ABOUT KEIKO HENTELL'S DISMISSAL 
STILL LINGER, AND THEY CENTER ON RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The matter of Keiko Hentell's removal as principal of Burbank High School is 
naggingly incomplete. Charges of racism hang in the air, and major questions 
have not been answered. 
</P>
<P>
 Demoted in February, Hentell is now writing grant proposals in the district's 
central office. She says the reasons for her removal have not been explained to 
her. The school board has refused to discuss them publicly, saying it is a 
personnel matter. But this case is about more than one job. 
</P>
<P>
 When Hentell moved to the Burbank job from L.A. schools in 1991, she joined a 
district whose white enrollment had dropped from 85% to just over 50% in 20 
years. She launched a year of innovations designed to embrace the new 
diversity, having decided that the school had shortchanged its minority 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 Hentell held off-campus meetings with these students and their parents. She 
supported highly visible activities, including clubs for Latino and African 
American students. 
</P>
<P>
 Hentell and her supporters believe this and similar work caused her removal. 
The Japanese American Citizens League, for instance, rushed to Hentell's 
defense: "At best the school board can be seen as having a lack of sensitivity 
to ethnic community concerns and at worst can be accused of prejudice and 
racism." 
</P>
<P>
 We are left with questions and concerns: 
</P>
<P>
 * Did Hentell's efforts for minority pupils lead to strained relations with 
her bosses, and is that behind the chief complaints in her formal evaluations? 
</P>
<P>
 * The bosses warned her quite early that she was making waves. But copies of 
the evaluations of her work, obtained by The Times, do not specify problems in 
detail or warn her to solve them or face demotion. 
</P>
<P>
 After one year, Supt. Arthur Pierce complimented her for reaching out to 
minority students. But he said some teachers, board members and Burbank 
citizens were "concerned that the traditional population served by Burbank High 
School is being overlooked." The language is vague. 
</P>
<P>
 Most importantly, the school board is annoyingly vague on what ought to be 
happening at Burbank High School. Grant that it cannot talk about Hentell; it 
can and should talk about the larger issues, and soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank, like all of Southern California, has changed and continues to change. 
How should schools cope? Does equal opportunity require special efforts with 
minority students? Are in-school ethnic groups to be supported? Is the board 
out of touch with its city? Is it trying to "save" Burbank High for a dwindling 
number of white pupils? 
</P>
<P>
 Making Hentell disappear will not make these questions disappear. They will 
chafe till they are aired.

VALLEY COMMENTARY; VENTURA BLVD. PLAN IS WORTH IT; REVIEW PANEL'S REVISIONS 
WILL GO TO THE CITY COUNCIL. GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE SECTOR SHOULD SPLIT COSTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF BRAIN, Jeff Brain of Sherman Oaks is chairman of the Ventura Boulevard 
Specific Plan Review Board. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The panel charged with implementing the city's plan to revitalize Ventura 
Boulevard has issued a report recommending significant changes to the Ventura 
Boulevard Specific Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan was adopted in 1991 to control growth and fund boulevard 
improvements, but problems with the plan raise doubts about its outlook for 
success. The report of the Specific Plan Review Board culminates a two-year 
review with input from homeowners, businesses and commercial property owners. 
The recommendations now go to the City Council for consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendations seek to: 
</P>
<P>
 * Clarify the vision desired for Ventura Boulevard, tailoring the public 
improvements to match this vision. 
</P>
<P>
 * Provide an equitable and reliable funding structure. 
</P>
<P>
 * Simplify the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ensure the future viability of the boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 * Provide incentives for businesses that comply with the plan and strict 
enforcement with penalties for those that don't. 
</P>
<P>
 * Create flexibility so the plan can automatically mitigate the level of 
growth incurred should it differ from the growth projected. Existing density 
restrictions were left intact. 
</P>
<P>
 Community groups prefer the boulevard as a commercially oriented corridor 
serving a balance of community and regional commercial needs -- not to be 
reconfigured as a freeway alternate as the plan now dictates. Representatives 
from each of the five boulevard communities have been meeting with architects 
to create street-scape designs that celebrate each community's unique qualities 
and heritage. Streetscape improvements include pedestrian lighting, brick 
crosswalks, landscaping, trees, park benches, coordinated signage and a village 
or town center in each community, similar to State Street in Santa Barbara, Old 
Pasadena and Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They want design guidelines so buildings enhance a community. They want more 
public parking facilities, now in short supply. They want improved traffic flow 
but favor neighborhood shuttles and other traffic-reducing solutions over 
widening parts of the boulevard, a program of questionable feasibility and 
merit to increase automobile capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 Time after time as automobile capacity is increased it is filled like a vacuum 
as traffic shifts from the freeway and other streets to the path of least 
congestion. The boulevard's communities do not want more regional traffic on 
the boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The question is how to fund this vision. The initial plan budget called for 
$222 million in improvements, of which $197 million (88%) was to be funded by 
boulevard property owners. This is an extraordinary figure, far more than 
owners should be asked to pay. The board first pared the budget down to a 
preliminary figure of $107 million while still providing public parking, 
streetscape improvements, utility undergrounding and shuttles for each 
community, plus all feasible widening. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The board then recommends a structure to split the costs 50-50 over a 20-year 
period between government and the private sector. Despite tight public money, 
officials should support this long-term joint concept. They've presumed the 
private sector, facing the same fiscal conditions, is somehow in better shape 
to afford this financial responsibility, and we're only talking about returning 
a small fraction of the tax base derived from a healthy Ventura Boulevard 
spread over 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The private sector's share would be $51 million (down from $197 million) 
raised through a combination of corridor improvement fees and an assessment 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 The existing "trip fees" would be changed to simplified and reduced "corridor 
improvement fees." The fee would be charged on a per-square-foot basis and vary 
depending on the property's broad use category, i.e. retail, office, 
restaurant. Except for major changes of use, this fee would only apply to new 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 The assessment district would raise $39 million over 15 to 20 years (down from 
$97 million). This assessment would be spread over all properties with amounts 
linked to the benefit derived by each. 
</P>
<P>
 Property owners battered by the recession and the Northridge earthquake, might 
well object to an assessment district at any level. We sympathize and believe 
the assessments could be phased in over a period of years. Other areas have 
successfully used districts to fund public improvements and become more 
desirable, with the assessment often offset by increased property values and 
rents. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most boulevard properties are older, with substandard parking and other 
conditions. Yet boulevard businesses must compete with areas such as Universal 
CityWalk, the 3rd Street Promenade, Old Pasadena, regional malls and other 
parts of the Valley for business. We hope property owners and community groups 
along the boulevard will recognize the need to upgrade Ventura Boulevard. We 
need their support to implement these recommendations and ensure that the 
boulevard remains viable as one of the Valley's premier commercial corridors.

LEGISLATURE TO BLAME FOR BUSINESS EXODUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I hope your two Sunday commentaries "A Difficult Decision for a Booster of 
Los Angeles" and "Blaming the Victims" (April 3), wakes up the voting public, 
or at the very least, our incompetent and inept politicians in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 I have spent many years both in law enforcement and business.I can assure you, 
the rapid departure of the tax-paying base to other states is the direct result 
of the state Legislature's wooing the citizen looking for a "free ride" and the 
votes of the criminal's families. Not to mention lining the pockets with a 
multitude of perks and pensions for each elected position. (I only get one 
pension.) 
</P>
<P>
 Profit is not a dirty word. Businesses create tax-paying jobs and are able to 
expand with profit. Stop punishing achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 My small business netted $5,000 last year, but my state tax alone was $6,700. 
This state has become a joke. Vote the bums out.

EDITORS CROSS THE LINE TO COMMUNITY BASHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your editorial "The Name Game Has Crossed the Line" (April 3) has crossed my 
line. I am astonished by the limited perception of Valley realities exhibited 
by your limp and rather thoughtless editorial. The Valley is no longer in the 
1950s. We are well into the 1990s, pointing positively toward the 2000s. 
</P>
<P>
 Demographic changes are transforming many neighborhoods from clusters of 
nameless and voiceless ticky-tacky boxes into richly diverse and aspiring 
communities with new energy coming together in common pursuits, What started as 
Neighborhood Watch community meetings in Canoga Park have become community 
activist missions in South Winnetka. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times misses the point that "community" in the traditional American as 
well as sociological sense is abiding and emerging in the Valley. 
Unfortunately, your editors also cross the line from community advocacy to 
community bashing. 
</P>
<P>
 What's in a name? Is West Hills any bigger or grander sans Canoga Park? 
Absolutely not. What does Winnetka lose if its southern residents lay claim to 
Woodland Hills and Pierce College roots? 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, West Hills might have more vitality if it were, like Gaul, divided 
into parts including North West Hills, South West Hills, East West Hills and, 
of course, West West Hills. Just imagine the earlobe-to-earlobe smiles of the 
newly dubbed West West Hills hillside huggers. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of leading Valleyites to brighter vistas, you are locked in the grip 
of a sad and reactionary historical perspective. Owensmouth is gone, Canoga 
Park is dying, the Picos and Sepulvedas are also gone. What happened to Canoga 
Park Rotary, the granddad and mother of all West Valley Rotary clubs, should 
also happen in a broader sense to older communities begetting newer and richer 
communities. Why not? That is what history teaches. 
</P>
<P>
 People are going to reach out and assert their need for identity and value in 
this loveless and punishing Los Angeles sociopolitically-correct and sometimes 
corrupted climate of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 I would appreciate The Times better if it dropped the role of Malvolio, keeper 
of the Duke's estate in Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night." It would be more 
appropriate for The Times to trust the good sense, goodwill and good humor of 
well-meaning and community-serving folks in our Valley who remain inextricably 
wound into the values fabric of traditional American culture.

CROSS A LANDMARK OF A RICH L.A. HERITAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The cross at Cahuenga Pass, criticized in a March 27 letter to The Times, 
was erected at the site of the Pilgrimage Theater (now called the John Anson 
Ford Theater) some 60 years ago. The Pilgrimage was the site for Passion Play 
presentations. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 60 years that have passed since the cross first appeared, it has passed 
from being a symbol of Los Angeles' turn of-the-century dominant Midwestern 
Protestant ethos and has become a cultural landmark, a link to our past -- one 
of the few still remaining to us who respect the historical Los Angeles where 
it still hangs on. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles was indeed founded and settled and repopulated throughout its 
history by a rich ethnic mix of peoples: Gabrieleno Indians, Spanish, Mexican, 
Chinese, Yankee, Japanese, Southern Black, Armenian, Korean . . . the list goes 
on. Many of those peoples left their mark. 
</P>
<P>
 It discomforts me to read that signposts left behind by all these different 
peoples, including white Anglo-Saxon Protestants, are subject to a potentially 
destructive, and certainly phobic, political correctness. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles does indeed have a history. Let's not seek to vilify and then 
obliterate it through an attempt to create villains where none exist.

VALLEY COMMENTARY; THOSE WHO WOULD RECALL ROBERTI MUST HAVE SHORT MEMORIES; 
HISTORY SHOWS THAT SUCH BALLOTS ARE RARELY SUCCESSFUL. THE EPISODE MAY HAVE 
EVEN ADDED YEARS TO HIS CAREER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL CLARKE, Paul Clarke of Northridge, a corporate political consultant, 
managed the successful campaign to recall Howard Miller from the Los Angeles 
Board of Education in 1979. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Charles Dudley Warner, a 19th-Century American writer, is little remembered 
but for a couple of quotations, including "Politics makes strange bedfellows." 
It's as true as it ever was, 125 years after it was written. 
</P>
<P>
 When the National Organization for Women and the National Rifle Assn. team up 
on the same side in an election -- and lose -- it's news. So it's little wonder 
that national news media carried stories about our local recall election 
against state Sen. David Roberti. 
</P>
<P>
 The turnout on Tuesday was low, 21%. That was expected. Both sides made 
extensive use of the absentee-ballot option. The prevailing wisdom used to be 
that a heavy absentee count favored the conservative side of an issue. That no 
longer holds true, and the recall proves it. When the ballots were counted, 
Roberti had defeated the recall by a 3-2 margin. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the San Fernando Valley and Los Angeles, the media portrayed the 
election as Roberti wanted -- a battle of good against the evil of the "gun 
nuts." Inside the Valley the issues broadened, but guns still led the 
discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 Those pushing the election should have looked first at the recall's history. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1903, Los Angeles became the first city to allow a recall election. Eight 
years later California became the second state to allow one. Teddy Roosevelt 
and the Bull Moose Party had a national recall in their platform in 1912. It 
has been almost entirely downhill for the recall ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Of Hiram Johnson's three noted California political reforms -- initiative, 
referendum and recall -- the last is the least used and the least successful. 
Although recalls are often threatened, they rarely make the ballot. When they 
do, voters rarely turn out rascals or anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, recalls work in small towns. However, they've only worked twice 
in the past 55 years in Los Angeles. Los Angeles voters recalled Howard Miller 
from the school board in 1979. The heart of that vote came from the Valley in 
reaction to Miller's flip-flop on forced busing and his leadership in the fight 
against Proposition 13. Miller tried to claim that the recall was an abuse of 
the process and spent half the campaign in court trying legal ploys to save his 
seat. He was resoundingly thrown out by the voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's was the first successful recall in the city since scandal-plagued 
Mayor Frank Shaw was recalled in 1938. There have been no successful recalls 
since. East Side voters tried several times to recall former City Councilman 
Art Snyder. One effort made it on the ballot only to lose by a razor-thin 
margin. 
</P>
<P>
 The attempt to recall Roberti was the first time in 80 years that a state 
official has faced a recall. Given the outcome, it may be another 80 before it 
happens again. 
</P>
<P>
 History alone does not tell the story of this recall's failure to take hold 
with politicians and public alike. The story is told, in part, by the stature 
of the person proponents sought to throw out. Arguably one of the most powerful 
politicians in the state, Roberti has picked up a lot of chits during his 28 
years in public office. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people may disagree with his positions on given issues -- NOW and the NRA 
prove the diversity of that group. But an even greater number among the 
political cognoscenti saw him as someone who still had to be dealt with. They 
wisely decided not to turn on him. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gun-control advocates Jim and Sarah Brady are otherwise Reagan Republicans. 
They came to town to help Roberti. The leadership of the state Republican Party 
took a walk on the election. Many local Republican leaders either supported 
Roberti or opposed the recall. Even the hard core that makes up the Republican 
Central Committee's delegates could only pass a resolution favoring the recall. 
They couldn't muster the money or manpower necessary to back up their bluster. 
</P>
<P>
 So Roberti gets to spend the final eight months of his Senate career as a hero 
who walked through fire and survived. That should help him in his June primary 
race for treasurer and, probably, in the November general election. 
</P>
<P>
 If elected treasurer, he should be safe from recall. So the recall supporters 
have probably guaranteed another eight years of David Roberti in Sacramento, 
perhaps with more power than before. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1920 Winston Churchill opined: "Politics are almost as exciting as war, and 
quite as dangerous. In war you can only be killed once, but in politics many 
times." Roberti and others who have survived recalls and tough electoral 
challenges can turn that around to read: "In life you can be born only once, 
but in politics many times."

VALLEY COMMENTARY; ILLEGALS VS. LEGALS: CLOSED DOORS, OPEN ARMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reps. Anthony Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) and Howard Berman (D-Panorama 
City), whose congressional districts include most of the San Fernando Valley, 
discussed illegal immigration on March 30 at a luncheon meeting sponsored by 
the Valley Industry and Commerce Assn. What follows is adapted from their 
remarks. BEILENSON We are a very liberal and generous country when it comes to 
legal immigration. We are currently allowing almost a million people legally 
into this country each year, more people than all of the rest of the countries 
of the world combined. 
</P>
<P>
 I continue to believe very strongly in legal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to illegal immigration, the question at the outset is: Do we 
believe in our immigration laws or not? If we do, we should allow the 850,000 
to 1 million people in legally each year but not the others who are coming 
illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 There are lots of reasons to be worried about illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 I have predicted for years that if we did not get control over illegal 
immigration there would be a backlash against legal immigration, and I think 
unfortunately that's occurring. I think it's also obvious to any thinking man 
or woman that there's a limit to the number of people whom we can take in and 
provide for. But there is no end to the number of people who want to come to 
the United States and other industrialized nations. 
</P>
<P>
 The populations of Central America and Mexico have virtually quadrupled in the 
last 40 years. Mexico had 26 million people at the end of World War II. Now 
there are 92 million. There will be close to a quarter of a billion Mexicans 
sometime late next century. These folks obviously don't have enough jobs down 
there, and many of them come here, looking for a better life. 
</P>
<P>
 In 24 hours there will be 260,000 net new people in the world, more than 95% 
of them in developing countries that cannot provide adequate jobs, services, 
health care or education for their people. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I believe that many of our services -- our social services, our educational 
services, our health care services, our welfare services -- are being 
overwhelmed. I spend virtually all of my time when I'm home going around 
talking to teachers, welfare workers, nurses who dispense these services. Their 
plea to me always is, Congressman, please try to do something about illegal 
immigration. We don't have the physical or the human resources to take care of 
the citizens whom we're supposed to take care of. 
</P>
<P>
 The net costs of illegal immigration are rising quickly. Some of these costs: 
</P>
<P>
 * At least $2 billion a year in California to educate children who are here 
illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 * At least $400 million a year in California to incarcerate prisoners here 
illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 * At least $300 million a year to provide emergency health services to people 
who are here illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 * At least $250 million in Los Angeles County alone for Aid to Families With 
Dependent Children for children of illegals. I think 25% of all the kids on 
AFDC in Los Angeles County are children of illegals. The county says that by 
the end of the decade it's going to cost $1 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're serious about this and you're a politician, you've got to propose 
solutions. I think there are only three serious ones, and a fourth that is more 
long-range and has to do with helping slow population growth around the world 
by making contraceptive services available to people if they want them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One, you've got to control the border better, and the very least we can do, 
and it will have an effect, is put a good many more human beings and equipment 
down at the Border Patrol. It's always been the stepchild of our law 
enforcement system. 
</P>
<P>
 Two, the single most important thing we should do is to have a 
counterfeit-resistant and tamper-proof Social Security card that has to be 
presented before you get employed in this country. There is no other way of 
enforcing our existing law, which makes it illegal to knowingly hire someone 
who is here illegally, or of ending discrimination against people who aren't 
here illegally but have darker skins and don't speak perfect English. 
</P>
<P>
 Three, and I know it offends some people, I do believe that we have to change 
the Constitution. We have to change the 14th Amendment and no longer give 
automatic citizenship to children of people who knowingly violated our laws and 
came across our borders, often not to get jobs but to have their babies here. 
More and more people are coming to have their babies here. There are 30,000 
babies illegally born in Los Angeles County each year who automatically are 
U.S. citizens. We're giving a benefit, an incentive to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a specific reason for that provision of the 14th Amendment. It was 
ratified three years after the end of the Civil War for the specific purpose of 
trying to ensure that the newly freed black slaves would have all of the 
privileges and benefits of citizenship. That was the sole reason for it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We had no immigration law at the time. Nobody ever thought about it. And if we 
had had the problem then, nobody would have put that in the Constitution. To 
automatically grant citizenship to anybody born here, even children of 
travelers who happen to have a baby while they're traveling around the United 
States -- that's nonsense. Only three or four other countries in the world do 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 We will not be a less-free, less-democratic, less-wonderful, less-generous 
country if we repeal that particular part of the Constitution. We still have 
the Bill of Rights, free speech, everything else. There is nothing special 
about automatic citizenship because you happen to be born in this country. 
BERMAN 
</P>
<P>
 I agree with Tony on his first and second solutions. If we do them, his third 
isn't necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 By amending the Constitution we would create a clouded citizenship status for 
thousands of people and raise a thousand specific questions that I haven't seen 
anyone address: When a mother shows up at the maternity ward, are we going to 
have an INS official there? What documentation would we demand? If we develop 
an effective border strategy and effective national identification, citizenship 
at birth will no longer be a serious issue. 
</P>
<P>
 I want to put some of this in the context of what is going on in society 
today. There are some very serious problems in this country. At such times we 
tend to look for scapegoats. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigration is a tremendously tempting scapegoat because it is true that we 
have lost control of our borders. We have every right to try to control those 
borders, and I do not accept the premise that it is impossible to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 I think the most serious problem in this country today is the existence of a 
growing underclass in our society. This is not just an immigrant underclass. 
It's an underclass of people who essentially have very little in common with 
the mainstream of American society, who do not accept the values and the 
fundamental responsibilities of citizenship in this country. This underclass is 
not caused by immigration. It's the result of many complicated social problems, 
including a well-intentioned welfare system that created a cycle of dependency, 
that have resulted in a breakdown of the family and a loss of individual 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We have a terrible problem with crime. And contrary to the current political 
rhetoric, this is not a problem that's primarily a result of immigration. I'd 
suggest that the crime rate in Los Angeles is more a product of the fact that 
we have by far the most understaffed Police Department of any major urban area 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 We have a serious economic problem in Southern California, caused by many 
factors, ranging from defense cuts to a depressed real estate industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Added to this, we have suffered a number of natural disasters that have 
contributed to the decline in living standards in our community. 
</P>
<P>
 But I don't want to take away from the fact that illegal immigration is wrong. 
It's unfair. It has consequences that we cannot anticipate and which produce 
burdens on our institutions, and we have to try to stop it. 
</P>
<P>
 I think we can do this with the focus on the border-crossing problem and a 
national, effective, forge-proof identification system which includes tough 
laws to make sure that the privacy of individuals is not invaded. 
</P>
<P>
 We cannot institute an identification system that is required to walk the 
streets or to pursue any of the privileges of participation in our society. It 
must be very carefully limited and circumscribed to cover everyone's 
eligibility for employment and certain public programs. But we can do it. Once 
this is implemented, we'll have an instrument with which immigration laws can 
be enforced. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 I would also like to know why with all the great attention on illegal 
immigration, no one has taken a systematic look at the several industries in 
our state that live on their efforts to recruit, transport and exploit workers 
from across the border. Agriculture in this state survives on a large pool of 
undocumented immigrants' displacing the earlier generation of undocumented 
workers who have legalized and who are, therefore, asking for more money and 
better conditions and are moving into urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
 A great strength of Southern California is its legal immigrant population. 
Look at the vibrant industries in our area, industries that are growing, small 
and middle-sized entrepreneurs. Many of them are immigrant owned and staffed. 
Many of them bring skills and technologies and a work ethic unparalleled in our 
own society. They're going to add to the strength of America.

$50 GUIDE: CONTENDERS, PRETENDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, Robert Hilburn is The Times' pop music critic. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's a good chance that the album of the year is included in this edition 
of the guide -- a way to keep up on what's noteworthy in pop on a budget of $50 
a month. But will it be Hole, Nine Inch Nails or Pavement that will hold up 
best eight months from now? March 
</P>
<P>
 Beck, "Mellow Gold" (DGC). Most of our truly valuable artists tell you enough 
about themselves in their music to let you immediately identify with their 
feelings or at least define their objectives. One of the most inviting things 
about young Beck Hansen (who headlines the Hong Kong Cafe on Tuesday) is how he 
remains such a mystery as he teases you with so many different influences (from 
Delta blues and Dylan to hip-hop) that you feel constantly disoriented. Nothing 
quite makes sense in Beck's world, which is the point. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine Inch Nails, "The Downward Spiral" (Nothing/ TVT/Interscope). About three 
levels more intense than Beck, Trent Reznor explores the emptiness of the 
modern spirit with the raw instrumental force of Ministry and the seductive 
songwriting craft that Kurt Cobain brought to Nirvana. Stands with Nirvana's 
"Nevermind" as one of the twin towers of '90s American rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Pavement, "Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain" (Matador). There aren't many bands that 
remind you equally of Neil Young and the Replacements, but this quintet (which 
appears at the Palace on Thursday) can move from sweet country daydreams to wry 
social observation faster than you can say "Zuma" or "Tim." April 
</P>
<P>
 Iris DeMent, "My Life" (Warner Bros.). As a singer and writer, DeMent combines 
the angelic soulfulness of Emmylou Harris with the self-affirming independence 
of Jimmie Dale Gilmore. The songs speak of love and family ties with a 
traditional purity that is at once cleansing and inspiring. 
</P>
<P>
 Hole, "Live Through This" (DGC). It might sound sexist to compare Courtney 
Love to earlier female rockers, so I won't dwell on how this major-label debut 
ranks with the best of Patti Smith and Chrissie Hynde. Instead, I'll just say 
"Live" is a superb rock album, one that examines personal demons and desires 
with a vision that is both fearless and fragile. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonnie Raitt, "Longing in Their Hearts" (Capitol). It may have taken Raitt a 
long time to hit her commercial and creative stride, but she shows no signs of 
easing up. While this album has many of the classy musical strains of "Nick of 
Time" and "Luck of the Draw," Raitt exhibits growth both in her authority as a 
singer and in her intimacy as a writer.

POP FACES: ANGELIQUE KIDJO; THIS PARISIAN SINGER'S AFRICAN ROOTS RUN DEEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SNOWDEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angelique Kidjo, the fiery singer from Benin, is fed up with critics who 
charge that using funk and other Western pop elements makes her music less 
African. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of these people never get out of the country to see what's happening in 
my continent," says Kidjo, who performs at LunaPark on Saturday. "Nobody can 
even tell me what is the type of music that is played in my country. . . . I 
think it's the nostalgia of colonization. Music doesn't belong to anybody -- 
any African artist knows that even in our traditional music, there is nothing 
pure." 
</P>
<P>
 Kidjo's 1991 album "Logozo" yielded a pair of East Coast dance-club hits that 
spread her popularity beyond the usual African pop audience. Her new "Aye" 
album again finds Kidjo's politically pointed lyrics (sung in the Fon, Yoruba 
and Mina languages) accompanied by an African-funk-dance hybrid produced by 
David Z (ex-Prince) and Will Mowat of Soul II Soul. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more I can meet different cultures and different people, the more I am 
happy, because it's when I realize how strong my roots are," Kidjo explains. 
"They always come out entire, in any kind of music that would surround it." 
</P>
<P>
 Kidjo released her first album in Africa in 1980 and moved to Paris later that 
year. She recorded five albums and toured Europe extensively with a 
jazz/African fusion band -- work she continued after forming her own group in 
1987. Her "Parakou" album for a small French label in 1989 caught the ear of 
Island Records President Chris Blackwell, and she signed with the company in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Kidjo lives in Paris with her husband and year-old daughter, but her love for 
Africa remains. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not an African European -- I'm a deep African woman," she says. "Every 
year I go back. It's like I reach a point where I need oxygen. I feel like I'm 
gasping for breath. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you are born in Africa and live in Europe, nothing can change that, 
ever. When you are raised in that rich culture, that rich tradition, it doesn't 
matter how many things you give me here. Nothing is going to replace that." DON 
SNOWDEN

 Last Sunday's cover story on Courtney Love drew some angry letters and 
calls.Most accused Calendar of insensitivity for publishing the story two days 
after the news broke that Love's husband, Kurt Cobain of the rock group 
Nirvana, had committed suicide at the couple's Seattle home. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday Calendar is printed Thursday and early Friday, along with some other 
sections of the Sunday paper. As a result, last week's section was printed and 
on its way to distributors when news reached us of Cobain's tragic death.

 NO KEEPERS: If you like to fish in any of the city lakes in Huntington Beach, 
it had better not be because you're hungry. The city is considering a change to 
a "catch and release" policy: You can reel in all the fish you want, but you'll 
have to throw them back. . . . City officials, who will vote on the issue 
Monday, say they can no longer afford to stock their lakes, and don't want the 
supply to dwindle faster than the fish can "self-perpetuate."

 A FAN'S FAREWELL: Gus Contreras, owner of Costa Mesa's Vendetta clothing 
store, is among those mourning Nirvana lead singer Kurt Cobain, who took his 
own life last week. Contreras met Cobain last year and got him to sign a 
poster. The witty Cobain, who'd never seen Vendetta's, wrote: "Dig the store. 
Best of luck in the future and beyond." . . . Recalls Contreras: "He was very 
cordial, almost shy." After Cobain's death, the poster was placed in the 
display window.

 SHARI LIVE: If you have small children, you're not alone if you plop them in 
front of public TV and let puppeteer Shari Lewis baby-sit them while you fix 
breakfast or get ready for work. Some youngsters will see Lewis and her Lamb 
Chop in person Monday when PacifiCare Health Systems in Cypress opens its new 
day-care center for employees' children. Lewis will cut the ribbon and put on a 
show. . . . "She's perfect for obvious reasons," says a spokeswoman. It's only 
the second corporate-sponsored day care to open in Orange County.

 CENTURY CELEBRATING: It was 1894 when Dr. George Crook Clark built a house in 
downtown Fullerton for his new bride, Edith Johnson. It's since been restored 
as the "Heritage House," and moved to the Cal State Fullerton Arboretum. . . . 
Officials have big "re-enactment" plans to celebrate its century mark: A garden 
party in June, a tea/bridal shower in September and a Victorian wedding in 
December -- plus a masked ball early next year. You can take a guided tour of 
the house Sundays 2 to 4 p.m.

MINORITY PROGRAMS MOSTLY AID WHITE AREAS; CONTRACTS: ONLY 22% OF FUNDS FOR 
SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION'S 'SET-ASIDE' PROGRAM GOES TO COMPANIES IN TARGET 
AREAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM BOVEE, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The government's flagship program for minority entrepreneurs awarded $19 
billion in contracts over the last six years, with the lion's share going to 
firms whose headquarters were located in primarily white, well-to-do 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 An Associated Press computer analysis of "minority set-aside" contracts 
handled by the Small Business Administration found that just 22% of the project 
dollars went to companies located in minority areas. 
</P>
<P>
 And those companies that qualified for the program while remaining in minority 
areas on average got fewer contracts and dollars than those in white areas, the 
analysis showed. 
</P>
<P>
 The SBA's 8(a) program directs federal contracts to minority-owned companies 
for work ranging from computer processing to construction or custodial 
services. SBA has told Congress that one effect of these contracts has been to 
boost job opportunities in less prosperous city neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet to be more competitive, some business owners said they moved out of 
minority communities to get closer to their federal customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was (located) so far away from government installations, the SBA was 
reluctant to give me jobs," said Samuel Hayes, who moved his construction 
company out of Benton Harbor, a city in southwestern Michigan where nine people 
in 10 are black. 
</P>
<P>
 Now his company, Rah Development, does business from Northville, Mich., in an 
area of the Detroit suburbs where half the households make more than $167,374 
and nine people in 10 are white. 
</P>
<P>
 The program's supporters say its goal is to foster minority businesses, not 
community development. And like any business, they say, minority companies need 
to locate near their customers. In the 1990s, that often means the suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a business decision, not a social decision as to the location," said 
Cassandra Pulley, SBA deputy administrator. "It is not a program that is 
designed for economic development in black inner-city neighborhoods." 
</P>
<P>
 The analysis of 8(a) contracts showed the average minority-contracting company 
is located in an area where 68% of the residents are white, half the households 
earn $37,415 or more, and only one person in seven is poor. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, most black Americans live in neighborhoods where minority 
residents are the majority and where half the households earn less than 
$24,550. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of truly small minority businesses which really would be the backbone 
of the minority community cannot get a quarter from the SBA," said attorney H. 
T. Smith, organizer of a recently ended black tourism boycott in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to investing in minority communities, Smith believes, "as far as 
the government and the business community are concerned, that's just throwing 
money away." 
</P>
<P>
 There is no requirement that participants stay in minority neighborhoods or 
that they be poor. In fact, entrepreneurs can qualify with a net worth up to 
$250,000, excluding their home and business assets. 
</P>
<P>
 When SBA goes to Congress for funding, it presents the program as a business 
incubator that benefits impoverished minority communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "8(a) firms provided employment for over 102,000 men and women during fiscal 
1992," the agency said in its most recent report to Congress. "Many of these 
jobs are in the inner city and in areas of high unemployment." 
</P>
<P>
 The AP analysis, however, suggests otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 The study analyzed the contractors' location by the ZIP code of their 
headquarters, using racial, ethnic and income information from the 1990 Census. 
AP reviewed almost 25,000 contracts covering $17.5 billion of the $19 billion 
awarded under the program from 1988 to 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 About $1.5 billion was not analyzed because there was no matching census 
information for the companies' ZIP codes. 
</P>
<P>
 Contracts spanned the country, ranging in value from 12 cents to $96.2 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not possible to determine from the database where the companies did the 
contract work, and the SBA said it did not track the background of employees 
who worked on the 8(a) contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies owned by blacks or Hispanics make up three-quarters of the program's 
participants. However, the review found: 
</P>
<P>
 Only 9% of the 8(a) contract dollars went to businesses in black-majority 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 * 4% went to Hispanic-majority neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 * 9% went to neighborhoods with majority Asian, American Indian or 
mixed-minority populations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 7% of contract dollars went to neighborhoods with minority populations from 
40% to 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest bloc of 8(a) dollars -- 37% -- went to companies in neighborhoods 
with fewer than 20% minorities. And three-fourths went to neighborhoods where 
the typical household income was more than $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Some contractors who remained in poor minority communities say they did so out 
of a sense of responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 During the time she was in the SBA program, Florence Hicks Alexander kept the 
headquarters of her management consulting company in a mostly black 
neighborhood in Washington and located most of her 350 offices in minority 
neighborhoods across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very proud of what we did and how we did it," she said. "I myself am a 
product of the ghetto. . . . I felt it was my responsibility to give back." 
</P>
<P>
 Such businesses, however, get fewer and smaller contracts, the AP review 
found. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses in primarily minority areas averaged seven contracts worth $589,594 
each, compared to nine contracts worth $748,661 each for those in white 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Some see the program, a product of the civil rights movement, as mirroring a 
growing divide in minority communities between rich and poor, skilled and 
unskilled. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have a two-tier system that's becoming more discernible in the black 
community itself," said Elijah Anderson, sociology professor at the University 
of Pennsylvania. "The people who have the skills and education are being 
siphoned off by the corporate world. Those people are not starting inner-city 
businesses." 
</P>
<P>
 Weldon Latham, of the National Assn. of Minority Business, defends the 8(a) 
program, saying critics wrongly view it as a "paternalistic" welfare initiative 
instead of a tool to help minorities break into the economic mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants say the decision on how many minorities they hire often depends 
on where the work is done. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I got a job in upper Appalachia, I'm going up there and hire me some white 
folks," said James L. Harrell, an Alabama construction company owner and 
president of the 4,500-member National Assn. of Minority Contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 Some say there are other ways their companies help minority communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Singobee Builders Inc. in Loretto, Minn., is located in a 99% white 
neighborhood and has only five minorities among its 25 workers, but it 
subcontracts much of its work with minority firms, according to its chief 
officer, Gae Veit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more successful minority businesses become, they automatically reach out 
to the minority business community," said Veit, who is an American Indian. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Rev. Michael Pfleger, a Roman Catholic priest on Chicago's largely 
black South Side, is skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at the community I live in here, no businesses are opening up. You 
can't get jobs. I've only seen a continual spiral downward," he said. 
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
 The Small Business Administration's minority contracting program was 
established in the late 1960s to assist entrepreneurs in racial and ethnic 
groups considered economically and socially disadvantaged by past prejudice. As 
individuals, however, most of the participants in the 8(a) program are anything 
but poor. The SBA says the 727 entrepreneurs who entered the program last year 
had an average personal net worth of $135,654, excluding their main residences 
and their stake in the business. The highest was $982,749. Almost half the 
participants in the program are black, about a fourth are Hispanic, one-fifth 
are Asian and 6% are Native American.

KOREA EASES WAY FOR FOREIGN ADOPTION, BUT END NEARS

<P>
 Many of the first Korean children adopted in the United States in the 1950s 
were the children of American soldiers who fought in the Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
 Stigmatized at home by illegitimacy and their mixed race, the children had no 
place in the family-oriented culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, rapid Westernization brought some modern problems to South Korea -- 
divorce, out-of-wedlock births and a weakening of the extended family, 
according to Susan Freivalds, executive director of Adoptive Families of 
America. 
</P>
<P>
 "It continues to be very much to the detriment of the child in Korea to not be 
born to a married couple," Freivalds said. "These are the children who need 
adoptive homes." 
</P>
<P>
 The South Korean government decided that adoption, even outside the country, 
was better for the children than orphanages or foster care, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The government established a single set of regulations governing all 
adoptions. Four Korean agencies are authorized to place children outside the 
country. Each works with no more than one agency in each American state. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is a system that allows Americans to adopt without traveling to 
Korea. It is also a predictable system with virtually no room for the 
corruption reported in other countries' adoption markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Families weren't getting frustrated trying to do it, and there was a 
counterpart agency in this country to help you do it," said Suzanne D'Aversa, a 
social worker at Parsons Child and Family Center in Albany. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of adoptions from Korea grew from a handful in the 1950s to 6,188 
in 1988. In that year, the Seoul Olympics brought international attention to 
everything Korean, including adoption. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the first time that the Korean people realized that there were more 
Korean kids being adopted than from all other countries combined," Freivalds 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The government began trying to place more children inside the country. Its 
announced goal is to end foreign adoptions this decade. In 1992 only 1,787 
Korean children were adopted by Americans, according to the U.S. Immigration 
and Naturalization Service.

DEVICE ENHANCES DETECTION OF BREAST CANCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE WILLIAMS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Radiologist Gordon Hixson was angry as well as sad when his family lost a 
friend to breast cancer four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 If there had been a better way to detect the disease, his daughter's 
kindergarten teacher might not have died in her early 40s, Hixson said. 
</P>
<P>
 After testing 75 prototypes, consulting mammography experts nationwide and 
investing $200,000 of his own money, Hixson created the MammoSpot. 
</P>
<P>
 The device is a diagnostic magnifier -- a plastic stand easily attached to a 
mammography machine that brings the breast being X-rayed closer to the camera, 
spreads the tissue thinner for better clarity and targets a specific area. 
</P>
<P>
 The results are more accurate diagnosis of cancers or the elimination of 
unnecessary biopsies. It's now being used by 400 medical and research centers 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Medical centers using Hixson's device include Emory in Atlanta, Johns Hopkins 
in Baltimore, the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota and Yale University-New Haven in 
Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
 "No woman should lose her life because cancer was not correctly diagnosed or 
detected," Hixson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But some doctors are quick to operate when abnormalities are found instead of 
doing follow-up testing," he said. "No woman should go to surgery for a breast 
biopsy with only the standard two mammogram pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only 25% of the time is cancer found when surgery is done. If good, quality 
work is done, the number of unnecessary surgeries could be reduced, and women 
who are diagnosed could benefit from better and earlier treatment." 
</P>
<P>
 The MammoSpot nearly doubles the size of a mammographic image, reduces the 
patient's radiation exposure by as much as a third and can detect cancer 
calcifications less than one-tenth of a millimeter in size, Hixson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Magnification image quality with MammoSpot is superior to that produced by 
magnification devices supplied with the mammographic units which we use," said 
Edward Sickles, a pioneer in the development of magnification mammography and 
chief of mammography at the University of California-San Francisco Hospital. 
"Our technologists find it extremely easy to use." 
</P>
<P>
 Hixson, who practices at East Ridge Hospital, said statistics show that 
although mammograms are the best available early detection tool, they are not 
good enough to find all the problems. Traditional mammograms miss about 10% of 
breast cancers. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of patients have blind faith in their doctors," Hixson said. "It's 
important to have a good doctor-patient relationship, but women should question 
their doctors if they don't think something isn't right. A lot of women find 
their own cancer through self-examination, and they shouldn't be afraid to ask 
for additional testing." 
</P>
<P>
 He said mammograms are not very profitable, and it takes additional time to do 
special imaging of a breast. That's why he made the MammoSpot easy for 
technicians to use. 
</P>
<P>
 Hixson patented his device and formed American Mammographics to manufacture 
and market the MammoSpot after mammogram machine manufacturers rejected his 
idea.

ELDERLY ABUSE LAW SEEN AS MODEL; DELAWARE: THE CRIMINAL STATUTE WAS ENACTED IN 
1986. IT IS BEING STUDIED BY THOSE PLANNING THE 1995 WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE ON 
AGING.

<P>
 A law that allows prosecution of an individual for emotionally or 
psychologically abusing an older person without evidence of bodily harm is 
under review by those planning the 1995 White House Conference on Aging. 
</P>
<P>
 Delaware put a criminal statute on elderly abuse into effect in 1986. Five 
years later, the Delaware Supreme Court upheld the conviction of a woman for 
emotionally abusing an elderly resident of a nursing home. More recently, a 
nurse's aide pleaded no contest to fondling and making sexual gestures and 
comments to a 70-year-old man with Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years ago, if the cases had been prosecuted at all, a civil action 
probably would have been filed, resulting in a reprimand or a firing. 
</P>
<P>
 Some experts consider the Delaware law a model for the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Blancato, executive director of the 1995 White House conference, said a 
recommendation to urge states to adopt similar laws will be among suggestions 
considered before the conference is held in 1995. The conference is charged 
with making recommendations for aging policy for the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendations were developed at the conference "Silent Suffering: Elder 
Abuse in America," held in early February in Long Beach, sponsored by the FHP 
Foundation and UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are abusing a person who is demented, that is an abuse of that person. 
In most states that is a nebulous thing because that person can't respond," 
said Mary Watson, academic administrator for the geriatric medicine program at 
UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Delaware it doesn't matter whether that person responds or not. It's the 
fact that you have been abusive. . . . We want to see states adopt what 
Delaware has," Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Carluccio, a deputy state attorney general who heads the Medicaid fraud 
unit that has been pursuing the elderly abuse cases, said most states have 
never considered emotional abuse to be a criminal act. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he said, several states have legislation pending based on the Delaware 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1990, Delaware has prosecuted about 80 cases of emotional, physical or 
financial abuse or neglect. Emotional abuse accounted for 18 of those cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Carluccio, who has three investigators, said most of the cases come from 
referrals in the state Division of Aging. In 1986, there were only four 
referrals, but investigators are now receiving up to 200 referrals a year about 
alleged abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Webb, administrator of state adult protective services, credited 
Carluccio's sensitivity to the issue of elder abuse for the prosecutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just because these cases haven't been prosecuted in the past doesn't mean 
these kinds of things haven't happened," Webb said. "Getting these successful 
prosecutions in Delaware is sending a message to the community that these kinds 
of things will not be tolerated." 
</P>
<P>
 "The states are beginning to wake up and actually understand that elder abuse 
is an issue in the community, especially during a time when resources are 
scattered," Watson said. "I don't think there is enough attention paid to it, 
but I think that is changing. . . . It's not so much this is a growing 
epidemic. It's coming out of the closet." 
</P>
<P>
 The first White House Conference on Aging was called by President John F. 
Kennedy in 1961; subsequent conferences were held in 1971 and 1981. The 1981 
conference was considered too politicized, and the Bush Administration declined 
to schedule one for 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Older Americans Act, which authorizes the conference, a 25-member 
policy committee selected by the president and Congress will plan the 
conference agenda and participants.

FIRM PUSHES IRRADIATION OF RED MEAT; FOOD: NEW JERSEY COMPANY PLANS TO ASK U.S. 
APPROVAL OF COBALT-60 TREATMENT TO KILL BACTERIA IN BEEF. AGRICULTURE SECRETARY 
SUPPORTS TEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A New Jersey company that uses gamma rays to sterilize everything from baby 
bottles to hip-joint replacements wants to use its cobalt-60 on germs that 
cause hamburgers to spoil and sicken people. 
</P>
<P>
 Isomedix Inc. of Whippany, N.J., plans to ask the Food and Drug Administration 
to approve irradiation as a way to kill bacteria and other microorganisms on 
beef. 
</P>
<P>
 If the petition is filed in the next few weeks, as expected, the agency could 
approve irradiation of red meat by the end of the year. But don't expect zapped 
patties to show up suddenly at the meat counter or hamburger drive-through. 
</P>
<P>
 The Agriculture Department would first have to issue guidelines, which would 
happen next spring at the earliest. Then someone in the meat industry has to 
gamble that the public will buy irradiated meat. 
</P>
<P>
 The poultry industry has rejected the process for chickens and turkeys, 
despite FDA approval in 1990. Only a plant in Florida irradiates birds for a 
limited market. 
</P>
<P>
 This time around, however, the red meat industry supports the process. A food 
poisoning outbreak last year traced to undercooked hamburgers renewed the 
interest. And Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy has given it enough lip service 
to encourage industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't until now detected the industry need the way we do now," said John 
Masefield, a founder of Isomedix, a 22-year-old publicly traded company that is 
this country's largest operator of industrial irradiators. 
</P>
<P>
 Safe-handling labels that will soon be required will let consumers "make an 
informed choice between the concepts of 'handle with care' or irradiated to 
ensure that the product is safer," Masefield noted in the company's 1993 annual 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 Isomedix has nine plants in this country and one in Canada, but the company 
will limit its food irradiation to trial runs and market testing. 
</P>
<P>
 Although irradiation has been touted for killing harmful bacteria, yeasts and 
molds, it also kills microorganisms that cause meat to spoil, which is another 
reason Isomedix has become involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Packing companies and labor-saving supermarkets can profit from having more 
retail cuts prepared at the plant rather than in the store. 
</P>
<P>
 The Isomedix effort comes at an interesting time in the debate about meat 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Espy was making enough pro-irradiation comments to make the 
industry believe he would give it a try. But the meat industry and the 
Agriculture Department can't be seen as too cozy without Espy's alienating 
consumer groups he has been trying to appease. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly everything Espy says about food safety generates a press release. But 
there was none when he sent a letter March 1 to Health and Human Services 
Secretary Donna Shalala asking her and her agency, the FDA, to act quickly on 
the red meat petition. 
</P>
<P>
 The department is giving research data in support of the petition, Espy noted, 
calling irradiation a "potentially useful tool" among others the department is 
encouraging to improve food safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "While I am not in a position to comment on the merits of the petition, I do 
ask that you support its prompt review," he said. "We can do no less to protect 
the health of the American public." 
</P>
<P>
 The semi-distancing helped Espy last week, when at a hunger forum in 
Burlington, Vt., he faced questions from opponents of irradiation. 
</P>
<P>
 Espy was able to answer that the department was just asking the FDA to take a 
look at the process, calling it "an option that should be explored," and 
stressing his concern with consumer acceptance and worker safety.

PAINSTAKING PUZZLES IDENTIFY MIA REMAINS; MILITARY: THERE HAVE BEEN 563 
INDIVIDUAL IDENTIFICATIONS AND 40 TO 50 CASES ARE PENDING SINCE THE 
LABORATORY'S INCEPTION IN 1973.

 A few skeletal remains. Some teeth. A Sears credit card, dog tags, a pistol 
and boots. 
</P>
<P>
 This was once a U.S. airman, shot down over Vietnam. Now these are the only 
clues to who he was, and the Army's Central Identification Laboratory must 
piece together the puzzle to verify his identity. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting as detectives, scientists and historians, the lab's workers try to 
humanize the remains of U.S. military personnel listed as killed, missing in 
action or unaccounted for from World War II, the Korean War or the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at my family, my wife and children, and putting them in the same 
situation, if I had not returned, I would want somebody doing what I'm doing," 
said Lt. Col. Johnie Webb Jr., a Vietnam veteran who served as the unit's 
commander for 11 years and has been with the unit since its inception in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal, he said, is "to try and provide a family with answers to let them 
know what happened and, if possible, to bring them (the remains) back so they 
would have a grave they could visit." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 2,200 servicemen are listed as unaccounted for from the Vietnam War, 
more than 8,000 from the Korean War and nearly 79,000 from World War II. There 
have been 563 individual identifications; 40 to 50 cases are pending. 
</P>
<P>
 The process of sorting out bone fragments and other possible clues is 
painstaking; despite recent advancements in computer and medical technology, 
cases can take years to resolve. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Army Sgt. Frank Morales, an infantryman killed in the Korean 
War in November, 1950, identification was made less than two months after the 
remains were repatriated by North Korea in December. Dental records were the 
key -- Morales had bridge work, and many front teeth but few back teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 For the unknown airman, there was no easy medical identification. 
</P>
<P>
 Parts of the downed plane were repatriated with the remains last year, and 
this allowed officials to trace the four-man crew. 
</P>
<P>
 Checking the records, a forensic dentist matched an overhang in a filling of a 
tooth that was among the remains with an X-ray taken when the work was done on 
one of the four crewmen. 
</P>
<P>
 This wasn't enough proof, so the lab had bone samples analyzed by scientists 
who extracted DNA and compared it with a DNA sample from a maternal relative of 
the airman. 
</P>
<P>
 A match was made and the case soon may be forwarded for the mandatory review 
process all cases must pass before identifications are approved. 
</P>
<P>
 The lab's staff of 152 is based at Hickam Air Force Base and is divided into 
three units: search and recovery, casualty data analysis and laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
 Three search and recovery teams, which also include personnel from other 
military branches, conduct excavations and collect evidence from battle areas 
and crash sites. Once the remains are sent home, they are divided as best as 
possible into separate individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 The casualty data analysis section studies records and military historical 
data to verify information provided by the country that repatriated the 
remains, or tries to match information from battles and crashes with 
information recovered from excavations. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a computer database, workers scan records to see how many of the people 
listed as unaccounted for were in that particular area on a mission, or on a 
particular flight if remains were recovered from a crash site. 
</P>
<P>
 Working independently, anthropologists and experts in dentistry try to 
identify the remains, looking for clues to help determine age, size and other 
characteristics that may aid in identification. 
</P>
<P>
 Using the database, they narrow the possible choices to those who fit the 
description, then begin to check individual medical and dental records of 
people the computer says may fit the profile. 
</P>
<P>
 When the results of that work still leave a handful of possible matches, bone 
samples are taken when possible and sent to labs for possible DNA matching. Not 
all bones yield DNA because of deterioration and other factors. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a recommendation is made for positive identification, it's sent for 
approval to the Armed Services Graves Registration Office, and the material is 
reviewed by an independent group of board-certified forensic consultants. 
</P>
<P>
 If the consultants agree with the recommendations, they are sent to the Armed 
Forces Identification Review Board for final approval. 
</P>
<P>
 A family can have the case reviewed at government expense by an independent 
expert of their choice, and can refuse to accept the remains. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to put them at ease," Webb said. "We often establish identity with a 
very small amount of remains of that individual, so it's very difficult for the 
families to accept that this is their loved one. 
</P>
<P>
 "These families have lived with the uncertainty for a long time. We can 
relieve a lot of that uncertainty."

 A band of gunmen assaulted a military roadblock near the Chiapas state capital 
of Tuxtla Gutierrez Friday and one soldier died in the hourlong shootout, 
Mexico's defense ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not known if the attackers, who fled into the surrounding hills, 
suffered any casualties, the ministry said in a statement. 
</P>

 A government official who asked not to be identified described the incident as 
"very minor and isolated" and said there was no indication that the Zapatista

STRESS BROUGHT ON BY JURY DUTY IN GUT-WRENCHING TRIALS GETS ATTENTION; COURTS: 
SOME ARE TRYING DEBRIEFING SESSIONS BY MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS TO HELP 
JURORS COPE WITH EMOTIONAL TOLL AND AVOID LATER DISTRESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For one elderly juror, it was the picture of the murder victim with her throat 
slashed and a large footprint on her chest. She dreamed about it long after the 
verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 For another juror, it was the videotape of police digging up a murder victim's 
head from a garden. For weeks, when she looked out her kitchen window at her 
own garden, her mind's eye saw that head. 
</P>
<P>
 And after the trial of a man who raped and murdered a young woman in her home, 
a 41-year-old female juror told researchers, "I'm paranoid. I can't shake it. I 
went to the Smoky Mountains and twice I ran into a fellow who looked like him. 
I flipped out. I got hysterical, shook and just ran. . . . I dreamed he broke 
into my apartment on several occasions. Same dream over and over. . . . I'd 
wake up in a cold sweat." 
</P>
<P>
 For some jury members, the experience of being thrust into gut-wrenching 
trials exacts a psychological toll, one that can persist long after a verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 A few courts have been experimenting with debriefing sessions by mental health 
professionals after verdicts are reached, to let jurors try to unload their 
emotions and perhaps ease or avoid later distress. 
</P>
<P>
 Court officials and mental health professionals say such sessions probably are 
not needed for routine cases, though some judges informally debrief juries on 
their own anyway. But debriefings by experts might help after trials with such 
warning signs as a long duration, grisly crimes, intense media coverage, 
graphic testimony and disturbing pictures, tense deliberations and a 
sequestered jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only are jurors in such trials exposed to stomach-churning details of 
crimes -- things they may never have encountered before -- but they are not 
allowed to discuss the experience before deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
 That's just the opposite of what mental health experts recommend for people 
exposed to trauma. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do a very cruel thing to jurors, psychologically, during trials," said 
Judge Dennis M. Sweeney of the circuit court for Howard County, Md. "We tell 
them they can't talk to anybody during the trial about the case. . . . That's 
not a natural thing for people." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, said psychiatry professor Roger Bell of the University of Louisville 
School of Medicine, "When we experience a traumatic event, the first thing we 
want to do is we want to talk about it, because the inside of us is just filled 
with feeling. . . . It might be with revulsion if you see a decapitated body, 
or see what a male might do to a child." 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors also may feel angered and frustrated by the legal process and concerned 
about community reaction to their decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 The result of all that can be sleeplessness, unwanted thoughts about the 
trial, startled reactions to reminders of the case, general anxiety and other 
symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
 The topic of juror stress has caught the attention of the courts and 
researchers only in the past few years, said Thomas Hafemeister of the 
Institute on Mental Disability and the Law, part of the National Center for 
State Courts in Williamsburg, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 One explanation is that evidence these days may be more graphic and upsetting, 
said Tom Munsterman, director of the Center for Jury Studies, which also is 
part of the national center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rather than having the chalk marks on the pavement as to where the body was," 
he said, "you've now got a videotape -- a color videotape." 
</P>
<P>
 One videotape led viewers through a series of rooms to discover a grisly crime 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're sitting there with the full knowledge that one of these rooms is going 
to be it. Otherwise, they wouldn't be there," Munsterman said. "It's almost 
Hitchcock." 
</P>
<P>
 A major goal of debriefings is to let jurors talk about their emotional 
reactions to a trial, "to go through the process of discharging the emotion 
that's related to it," said Bell, who has been involved in several such 
sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Hafemeister, a psychologist and lawyer who has debriefed members of two 
juries, said, "We let them know that they weren't alone, that other people were 
feeling the same thing they did." 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors also helped each other by declaring that they had worked hard to reach 
a verdict and that they need not have second thoughts, Hafemeister said. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of debriefings has raised some concerns, such as the possibility that 
jurors might reveal misconduct that occurred in their deliberations that could 
trigger attempts to overturn verdicts. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sweeney noted that jurors already are quoted by the news media. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have become converted to the idea that the risk of having some jury verdict 
overturned (is outweighed) by the need to be more humane toward jurors and to 
look out for their needs also," he said.

SECRECY LAW UNDER FIRE FOR HIDING BABY'S AIDS INFECTION FROM MOTHER; HEALTH: A 
NEW YORK LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL TO "UNBLIND" NEONATAL TESTS HAS BECOME THE 
SUBJECT OF A FIERCE FIGHT. THE DEBATE TRANSCENDS POLITICAL LINES AND EVEN 
DIVIDES DOCTORS WHO TREAT THE DISEASE.

<P>
 In four years of a troubled life, Andrew Von Graevenitz has undergone stomach 
surgery, had a brain-damaging seizure and -- by his foster mother's count -- 
suffered 23 bouts of pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
 What angers Carol Von Graevenitz is that some of Andrew's health problems 
could have been prevented if she had only known sooner about his disease. 
</P>
<P>
 She suspected Andy's early illnesses were caused by AIDS, but had to fight the 
bureaucracy to have him tested when he was 10 months old. 
</P>
<P>
 Andy had already been tested for the AIDS virus -- on the day he was born. 
</P>
<P>
 But state law kept those results secret from everyone, including his mother 
and his doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 A New York legislative proposal to "unblind" those tests has become the 
subject of a fierce fight in the state, which has 27% of the nation's pediatric 
AIDS cases. The debate has transcended traditional political lines and even 
divided doctors who treat the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 On one side is the state Health Department, AIDS activists and some doctors 
who argue that the bill would breach the strict law that guarantees AIDS tests 
be kept confidential. They say rapid advances in what is known about pediatric 
AIDS have already made the new proposal obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters say it is common sense that mothers want to know whether their 
children could develop AIDS. They say it doesn't make sense to withhold this 
information when there is a chance to prolong lives or make them more 
comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a parent, I'm very angry because my child was made to suffer because of 
confidentiality," Von Graevenitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Health officials wanted to better trace the progression of AIDS when they 
started the tests in 1987. The test is performed on all babies born in the 
state. Similar screening is conducted in 43 other states, although often on a 
much more limited basis, according to the state Health Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after birth, a baby's heel is pricked for a blood sample used to test 
for a variety of diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 After the tests are complete, the sample is stripped of all identifying 
information -- except for the hospital name and the mother's age and racial 
background -- and sent to the state's AIDS laboratory for an HIV test, said 
Health Department spokeswoman Frances Tarlton. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the end of 1992, the HIV test had been conducted on 1,446,680 New York 
newborns. There were 9,259 positive results, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A positive test does not mean a baby will develop AIDS. In fact, 75% of 
newborns testing positive do not develop the deadly disease. The HIV antibody, 
which is what the test measures, eventually washes out of the baby's 
bloodstream, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The test does prove, however, that the baby's mother is HIV-positive.

 Nettie Mayersohn, a Democratic state Assembly member from Queens who describes 
herself as a "flaming liberal," said she was astounded to discover the state 
conducts this survey but does nothing with the information when a baby has 
tested positive. 
</P>
<P>
 She proposed the bill that would require the state to track HIV-tested 
newborns and tell mothers when the tests are positive. 
</P>
<P>
 The chance to help babies justifies this intrusion on a mother's privacy, 
Mayersohn said. This stance has made the legislator, once honored by the 
National Organization for Women as the top New York legislator, a target of 
groups she usually considers friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, I am outraged that the opposition dares to present itself as 
defending the interests of women," Mayersohn said. "Nothing could be further 
from the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing that a baby is HIV-positive would change the way the child is treated 
almost from birth, said Dr. Louis Cooper, chief of pediatrics at St. 
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper said he would use drugs to ward off pneumonia, one of the most common 
sicknesses for babies with AIDS. A doctor might ask to see an HIV-positive baby 
immediately if the mother complains the baby has the sniffles, while for 
another child a simple aspirin would be recommended. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents also say it is possible for the virus to pass through a baby's 
system through the normal course of events and for the child be re-infected 
through nursing. 
</P>
<P>
 There's never a good time to tell a woman that she is HIV-positive, but 
telling her at the same time her baby is sick is about the worst, Cooper 
acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper supports Mayersohn's legislation, but that puts him at odds with many 
of his colleagues. Even Judith Figuera, who manages the Program for Children 
and Families at St. Luke's-Roosevelt and works for Cooper, has been outspoken 
in opposing the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "In regards to AIDS, some people are responding in a kind of a panic," said 
Sharon Fawley, president of the state's NOW chapter. 
</P>
<P>
 An expert panel appointed by state Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Chassin to 
wrestle with the question concluded that the newborn test should remain 
confidential. But it recommended that all pregnant women and new mothers be 
encouraged to take an HIV test and be counseled about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Another bill before the Legislature would require doctors to advise their 
pregnant patients to take an HIV test and would spend $8 million on counseling. 
The legislation, sponsored by Assembly Health Committee Chairman Richard 
Gottfried, is a signal that Mayersohn's bill has an uphill fight to make it 
into law. 
</P>
<P>
 Gottfried believes there would be more people driven away from the health care 
system by Mayersohn's bill than babies helped. 
</P>
<P>
 The opponents of Mayersohn's bill also note a National Institute of Health 
report in February saying the drug AZT, if given to pregnant women, can 
significantly reduce the risk of the virus being passed on to the baby. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes it clear that postpartum testing is about six months too late," 
Gottfried said.

SMALL BUSINESSMAN RIDES 'EMOTIONAL ROLLER COASTER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the day he opened up shop, John Wilson's frame of mind about his prospects 
as the owner of a small business could be likened to his experience as a 
die-hard Atlanta Braves fan -- high hopes and depressing reality. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had gotten everything all set up -- the letterheads, the forms, the 
business cards. I was ready," he said in the office of Wilson & Associates -- 
the office being an upstairs room in his suburban Atlanta townhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve hours and dozens of noes later, Wilson's mood had declined. 
</P>
<P>
 "You think you've got it all together, then you see it isn't going to come 
easy. You come from up here," he said, stretching his arms high, "then, right 
to the bottom." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson and Associates remanufactures worn-out computer laser printer 
cartridges so they can be used again. 
</P>
<P>
 That first evening, Wilson switched on a tiny TV on his work table and 
followed his baseball team while he worked on cartridges. The Braves lost and 
were a seemingly insurmountable nine games behind the first-place San Francisco 
Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started just when the Braves were starting their big comeback," said 
Wilson, grinning below a Braves pennant on his office wall. 
</P>
<P>
 The Braves went on to catch the Giants in a dramatic race. Wilson, meanwhile, 
built up his business. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're chugging along. I've learned to ride that emotional roller coaster," he 
said, six months later. "The economy's getting better. I'm not fearful about 
the future anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 At 27, Wilson is fulfilling one goal by owning his own business. He hasn't 
given up on another -- to be a millionaire by the time he's 30. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've made it through some rough times," said Wilson, who moved here from 
southern New Jersey after high school. He's "never not been working," but has 
often done odd jobs to get by, earning as little as $9,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 He's worked for $5 to $6 an hour off and on for years as a parking lot 
attendant. He's risen at 3 a.m. to load United Parcel Service delivery trucks. 
He's been in the vending machine business, a photocopier repairman and a copier 
salesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson learned a couple of years ago about remanufacturing the cartridges that 
enable computer users to print out files. He compares it to rebuilding an auto 
engine. 
</P>
<P>
 New cartridges can cost hundreds of dollars. He overhauls them and sells them 
back to their owners for half the cost of a new one. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he has larger competitors, Wilson sees the field, less than a decade 
old, as one suited to a small operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can't serve a client the way I can," he said. "I pick up and deliver 
myself, and I have a quick turnaround time." 
</P>
<P>
 The garrulous Wilson spent half a year preparing to open, investing $10,000 
from his savings and friends' loans. He also began lining up customers, some at 
the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 His clients include advertising agencies, law firms, accountants, brokerage 
firms and government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the name of his business, Wilson's only associate so far is his wife, 
Felicia, who keeps the books. 
</P>
<P>
 He rises about 7 a.m. each weekday, showers and dresses, then walks upstairs 
and shuts the door to his office, in which a packed shelf contains such books 
as "Getting Business to Come to You" and "The Small Business Survival Guide." 
</P>
<P>
 He then uses his car to make pickups and deliveries in the morning, and spends 
afternoons on the telephone in his office. He ranks callbacks to "turn the 
maybes into yeses," and even those filed as "cold" will hear back from him by 
letter. After an evening break, he works on cartridges. 
</P>
<P>
 All told, he puts in 60 to 70 hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson retools about 75 cartridges a month, which pays the bills and has made 
him feel encouraged about expanding. 
</P>
<P>
 He expects to run ahead of his two-year plan in terms of moving his office 
from his home and hiring an employee. He's soon going to expand his soliciting 
by mail and try newspaper advertising.

POPE WANTS ECUMENICAL PRAYER ATOP MT. SINAI IN YEAR 2000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pope John Paul II wants to usher in the new millenium with an unprecedented 
day of prayer with Muslims and Jews on Israel's Mt. Sinai, a Vatican letter 
published Friday said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The approach of the year 2000 forces us all to take steps towards ecumenism 
if we desire to be less torn by conflict than in the last millenium," said the 
letter, sent last month to all the world's Roman Catholic cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a perfect time to return to Mt. Sinai, where God struck his pact 
with the Jewish people, giving them the 10 Commandments and thus laying the 
foundations of all human morality." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pope has called a special meeting of the Roman Catholic Church's 141 
cardinals for May 8-9 to prepare church celebrations in the year 2000.

BAGPIPES DRIVING YOU NUTS? -- HE'S GOT A MUM IDEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A British technology teacher said Friday he has invented a gadget that could 
stop bagpipe-players from driving their neighbors mad. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Watchman-Atkinson of Gateshead in northeastern England said he got the 
idea while attending a Scottish wedding. Bagpipes have a distinctive sound that 
some people find annoying. 
</P>
<P>
 To use Atkinson's device, the player does not blow pipes but rather fingers a 
chanter -- the pipe on which the melody is played -- and the notes are 
recorded. They can then be played back later using headphones. 
</P>
<P>
 "The machine reacts as bagpipes would but only the person playing can hear it. 
It is better than driving everyone else mad -- very useful for practicing," 
Atkinson said.

GERMANY IS MAKING MAGLEV TRAIN A 262-M.P.H. REALITY; TRANSPORTATION: PERHAPS IN 
A DECADE, THE 180-MILE-LONG TRANSRAPID LINE WILL BE THE WORLD'S FIRST INTERCITY 
TRAIN SYSTEM OF ITS TYPE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY THORSON, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's not perfectly smooth, but is it fast? 
</P>
<P>
 A test ride on Germany's magnetic-levitation Transrapid, which may become the 
world's first intercity train of its type, moves along at 262.5 mph. 
</P>
<P>
 Its backers see "maglev" as the future, arriving perhaps in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a vision now. We have a real product here, a real train. This system 
is ready for real operation," said Joerg Metzner, deputy director of the 
Transrapid research site at Lathen near the Dutch border in northern Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters tout its advantages: It's almost twice as fast as high-speed 
conventional trains. It comes close to the speed of jet planes without 
white-knuckle takeoffs and landings. There are no moving parts, no wear and 
tear. It's not as noisy as other transport systems. It can't derail, and 
collisions are impossible. No seat belts are required. 
</P>
<P>
 The maglev hasn't been built yet because it's new and expensive -- a risky 
investment. Detractors say conventional trains can be speeded up for less money 
though they wouldn't go as fast, and the time that travelers would save isn't 
worth the capital expense anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics also expect cost overruns like those that have plagued the Channel 
Tunnel, and environmentalists dispute the claims of energy efficiency and low 
noise. 
</P>
<P>
 Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Cabinet, nonetheless, has decided to build a 
180-mile-long maglev line between Berlin and Hamburg and take world leadership 
in high-tech ground transport. If Parliament and private companies are 
persuaded to pay for it, the dreams of its developers will be realized in 2005. 
</P>
<P>
 The train looks like a fat snake swallowing a skinny snake, because the skirts 
of the Transrapid wrap around and under a monorail, embracing it. 
</P>
<P>
 One car is crammed with electronic gear to monitor technical functions. In the 
passenger car, seats the size of first-class airline seats fill up with people 
who reserved places for a test ride. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can be driven in the train, in the control center or by computer," Metzner 
said. "In real operation, the train will be driven automatically." 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the no-driver future, so driver Hans Thesing manipulates a 
joystick, and we're off with a light hum of electrical sound. 
</P>
<P>
 The train uses two magnetic systems. One levitates the 90-ton train six inches 
above the monorail guideway; the other pulls it forward. Most of the propulsion 
system is in the guideway, saving weight on the train. 
</P>
<P>
 Digital signs show the speed in kilometers per hour: 170 (106 m.p.h.) is 
reached quickly but acceleration is comfortable. Slow to 140 (87 m.p.h.) to 
pass a switch and onto the 19.5-mile main circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 At 270 (169 m.p.h.), wind noise is noticeable. A bird flashes by, apparently 
flying backward very fast, as the train accelerates toward 400 (250 m.p.h.). 
</P>
<P>
 "You feel some shaking, but that won't be present later in the development of 
the train," spokesman Peter Wiegelmann assured the passengers. Better 
suspension will be used in a commercial train than in the research vehicle, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby treetops are a blur. Sunny weather at one end of the test track quickly 
gives way to a snowstorm down the line. 
</P>
<P>
 The Transrapid eases up to 262.5 m.p.h., the maximum permitted for now if 
passengers are aboard. The train set a record of 281 m.p.h. last year and is 
expected to cruise at 312.5 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 A green wall beside the monorail at one point simulates going through a tunnel 
or meeting an oncoming train. It raises the noise level, but not alarmingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Germany has invested $1.06 billion in maglev research since 1966, and believes 
it has a product better than anything like it in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan is testing two maglev technologies, but the Germans say their system is 
more reliable and better suited to long intercity lines. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the Japanese systems uses super-conducting technology requiring liquid 
hydrogen. "The components for that are not yet fully developed," Metzner said. 
"We are using standard electromagnetic technology, and we will be able to lower 
costs for a real commercial system." 
</P>
<P>
 The Transrapid plan calls for investing $5.2 billion for the Berlin-Hamburg 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 The government would invest $3.3 billion in the track. Private industry is to 
invest $1.9 billion for trains to make the trip, with one stop, in less than an 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
 The current partners are three of Germany's biggest companies. Thyssen 
Henschel, in overall direction, makes the train cars and developed the magnetic 
concept. AEG, a subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, makes the electronic controls, and 
Siemens handles the electrical engineering. 
</P>
<P>
 If Parliament gives the go-ahead, the private companies will have to work out 
how to share the big investment. The mostly government-owned airline Lufthansa 
is part of the tentative package, along with Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest 
bank. 
</P>
<P>
 For Germany, the partially private financing is as innovative as the 
technology. "It is the first time for us to put risk capital into a tracked 
transport system," Siemens board member Wolfram O. Martinsen said in an 
interview in the weekly Die Zeit. 
</P>
<P>
 The aim is to have the Berlin-Hamburg line demonstrate the commercial 
viability of the system and then export it. The potential market is seen as 
anywhere that people get on planes to make a one-hour flight and where no 
high-speed trains run.

BHUTTO PROPOSES LEGAL REFORMS TO AID PAKISTANI WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY GANNON, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many women felt Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto ignored their problems in her 
first term and are pressing her this time to overhaul a legal system that 
openly discriminates against them. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bhutto Administration of 1988-90 did not pursue major reforms to help 
women, but she has proposed several such measures since returning to power last 
year.Most are linked to the police and courts. 
</P>
<P>
 She opened the first all-female police station not long ago, plans several 
more in major cities and has reserved 15% of all new police jobs for women. 
Bhutto also promises to appoint women to the Supreme Court and create special 
courts for crimes against women. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women have always been treated like criminals," the prime minister said at 
the new station in Rawalpindi. "A woman's police station is the first step 
toward equal access to justice." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Pakistan's women are poor and uneducated. It is still common for them 
to marry at puberty and to spend their entire lives at home. They seldom find 
justice when they take their cases to police, according to the independent 
Human Rights Commission of Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Violence against women . . . remained among the commonest of crimes and took 
some of the ugliest forms" in 1993, the commission said in its annual report. 
</P>
<P>
 The report said police seldom investigate the most serious crimes, such as 
acid attacks and rape, and that convictions are difficult to obtain. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Islamic law, a woman must produce four male witnesses to get a rape 
conviction. Because that is rare, the victim often is convicted of having 
consensual sex outside marriage, a serious crime in this Muslim nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Changing laws based on the Koran, the Muslim holy book, could be Bhutto's 
biggest challenge. So far, she has been reluctant to challenge religious 
leaders.

SPURNED SUITORS RESPOND WITH DISFIGURING ACID; PAKISTAN: ACTIVISTS SAY THERE 
HAVE BEEN HUNDREDS OF SUCH ATTACKS OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS IN A NATION WHERE 
WOMEN ARE OFTEN ASSAULTED BY MEN WHO ARE SELDOM PUNISHED. 
</P>

<P>
 Farzana Bhatti's story is not unusual: A spurned suitor, outraged that she was 
to marry someone else, sneaked into her family compound at night and splashed 
acid on her face as she slept. 
</P>
<P>
 It left her blind and badly disfigured. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt as if somebody threw fire on me," Bhatti said, gingerly lifting her 
veil to reveal the mass of scar tissue that is now her face. A photograph taken 
before the attack shows a striking young woman with flawless skin and dark 
brown eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Human rights activists say there have been hundreds of acid attacks on young 
women over the last few years in Pakistan, where women are frequently assaulted 
by men who are seldom punished. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and a few women activists have spoken out in 
general terms about the abuse of women, but their efforts have little impact in 
a conservative Muslim country where women have few rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The acid attacks have a pattern: A young man pursues an attractive young woman 
and often makes a marriage proposal to her or her family. When he is rejected, 
he stalks the woman, waiting for an opportunity to throw acid in her face. The 
acid sears the skin and often blinds the victim. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's common for the attacker to say something like, 'Let's see who will marry 
you now,' " said Dr. Abrar Khan, a plastic surgeon in Multan who has treated 
about 50 acid victims in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 When Bhatti visited another victim, Tahira Rasool, who is still bedridden, the 
women wept almost uncontrollably as they recounted their ordeals. 
</P>
<P>
 Bhatti, 21, was attacked on a hot summer night in 1992 as the family slept in 
their courtyard. Her engagement had been announced hours earlier, angering the 
rejected suitor. 
</P>
<P>
 She is a seamstress, from a poor family, and can no longer work. Her fiance 
disappeared. Her life is ruined, Bhatti said. "I sit, I sleep. I sit, I sleep. 
And I cry all day long." 
</P>
<P>
 In only one respect is her case unusual: The assailant, Mohammed Salim, was 
convicted and received an unprecedented prison sentence of 27 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The police didn't even want to register a case initially," said Fakhr-un-nisa 
Khokhar, an outspoken lawyer who served as special counsel to the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do nothing to protect women in this country," she said. "Crimes against 
women just aren't taken seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 Rasool was a top student at a women's college in Multan when she was attacked 
in February, 1993, by a man who had been verbally harassing her and her friends 
for weeks. She lost the vision in one eye. The skin of her face, chest and left 
arm still is badly blistered. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Pakistani women get little education. Few understand the court system and 
they seldom press charges when attacked. Even if they do, convictions are rare 
and the harshest sentences are usually just a few years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Acid attack cases appear especially common in and around Multan, a dusty, 
chaotic city of 2 million in central Pakistan, 250 miles south of Islamabad. 
</P>
<P>
 "The attacks are premeditated and often happen during the day, when an 
acquaintance just walks up and throws the acid," Khan said. "The damage is 
instant." 
</P>
<P>
 His treatment involves multiple operations, including painful skin grafts, and 
the result is still less than satisfactory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can make them presentable, but we can't make them normal," Khan said of 
the victims. "There are always psychological scars. Some want to commit 
suicide." 
</P>
<P>
 Rasool wrote a poem, called "The Weaker Sex," about the attack on her. In it, 
she invokes the name of the 7th-Century Muslim spiritual leader Hussain, urging 
him to seek justice for women: 
</P>
<P>
 O Hussain, my Imam,  
</P>
<P>
 Did you see the man  
</P>
<P>
 Who took away the face of your daughter?  
</P>
<P>
 Why don't you ask all your followers  
</P>
<P>
 To beat their chests not only for you,  
</P>
<P>
 But for your daughters too.

HEBREW PURISTS LAMENT LOSS OF LANGUAGE; LINGUISTICS: TRADITIONALISTS DEPLORE 
MIXTURE WITH ENGLISH, A SORT OF "HEBLISH," AS A DANGER TO ZIONISM. BUT OTHERS 
CONTEND THE HEBREW ALTERNATIVES, COINED BY A SPECIAL PANEL, OFTEN SOUND 
ARTIFICIAL.

<P>
 Moses would hardly recognize Hebrew these days: It's "cool" to be "een." No 
one wants to be a "loozehr." Even "shalom," the traditional greeting, is being 
replaced by "hi" and "bye." 
</P>
<P>
 As the world becomes smaller through cable television, movies and easy travel, 
modern Hebrew acquires more English words and adaptations. 
</P>
<P>
 Some linguists consider it inevitable, but nationalists and Hebrew purists see 
danger to Zionism's goal of a society in which Jews, after a 2,000-year 
diaspora, no longer need to assimilate the cultures of others. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionalists deplore the mixing of Hebrew and English into a sort of 
Heblish. For example, a new TV series is called "Straight Ve-la'inian" 
(Straight and to the Point). Some business names drop Hebrew altogether: Body 
Hobby exercise parlors, the Chicken Baguette snack stand, Anglo-Saxon Real 
Estate. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no doubt that this is one of the worst things to happen to us," said 
Shoshana Bahat, a Polish-born member of the Academy of Hebrew Language. 
</P>
<P>
 "It betrays a lack of culture tinged with snobbery. Why should I have to use 
English words like 'celebrity' or 'item' when there are perfectly acceptable 
Hebrew alternatives?" 
</P>
<P>
 One reason, argues Netiva Ben Yehuda, a linguistic gadfly, is that the Hebrew 
alternatives are often artificial-sounding creations of the "stuffy minds at 
the academy." She noted that the academy's very name in Hebrew includes the 
not-so-pure "academia." 
</P>
<P>
 Ben Yehuda became famous for compiling a dictionary of what was outrageous 
slang in the 1960s. Words that shocked then, such as "ziun," a non-clinical 
word for sex, are fairly standard now. 
</P>
<P>
 She said modern Hebrew borrows from English in the same way ancient Hebrew 
borrowed from the major languages of its day, such as Aramaic and Acadian. 
</P>
<P>
 Gabriel Birnbaum, senior scholar at the academy, said the organization has 
gradually become more liberal and now accepts that "in principle, every 
linguistic development must come from what might be seen as a mistake or a 
theft." 
</P>
<P>
 Modern Hebrew developed haphazardly during a century of Jewish immigration to 
Israel by Jews from more than 100 countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider curses. There were none in the synagogue-based Hebrew that survived 
the diaspora. Most of those now in use come from Arabic or Russian, reflecting 
the national origins of most Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking for his fellow scholars, Birnbaum said, "What makes our blood boil is 
gratuitous use of English, like in 'Dizengoff Center,' " a large Tel Aviv 
shopping mall. "Why use 'center' when the Hebrew 'merkaz' is perfectly fine and 
otherwise in use?" 
</P>
<P>
 Birnbaum, who was born in Hungary and teaches Hebrew at the Hebrew University 
of Jerusalem, said the language is especially vulnerable to foreign intrusions 
because it has no words for many aspects of the modern world. 
</P>
<P>
 Every two months, therefore, the 43 academy members meet in their tranquil 
Hebrew University campus building, struggling to devise new words that will 
keep the language pure. Their production is only several words a month, many of 
them based on existing ones. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, they debated whether to bless the growing inclination among 
Israelis to call a downtown area the "city." No final decision was reached, but 
the scholars lean toward making a new word, "Ma'ar," the Hebrew acronym for 
"central business district." 
</P>
<P>
 The academy and the Language Commission, which did the work before Israel 
existed, have invented about one-quarter of modern spoken Hebrew's 40,000 
words. In addition, tens of thousands of professional terms have been created 
or adopted from other languages. 
</P>
<P>
 Birnbaum acknowledged that few of the non-professional coinages catch on. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, academy members were irked by the growing use of "chips" for 
french-fried potatoes. So they came up with "tuganim," based on the proper 
Hebrew root for "fry." 
</P>
<P>
 Israelis, like the British, still say "chips." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor have attempts to replace distorted English-based words such as "egzoz" 
(car exhaust) or "hambrek" (hand brake) been "efecteevee" (effective). 
</P>
<P>
 When the "supermarket" became popular in the 1970s, the academy figured that 
somewhat cumbersome word could be replaced. It proposed "markol." But Israelis 
just shortened the foreign word to "super." 
</P>
<P>
 Rehavam Ze'evi, a conservative legislator, feels the academy has "a marketing 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 "People must be made to see that our language should be rooted in our culture 
and not somebody else's," he said.

SHOCK WAVE OF SCHOOL VIOLENCE REACHING OUT TO SUBURBS, RURAL AREAS; EDUCATION: 
SOME DISTRICTS USE METAL DETECTORS, DRUG-SNIFFING DOGS, ID CARDS AND VIDEO 
CAMERAS TO TRY TO KEEP THE PEACE. 
</P>

<P>
 At a guard shack outside Mount View High School, three teen-agers who had been 
unruly on a school bus stopped for inspection recently. 
</P>
<P>
 The guard wrote down their names and ran a hand-held metal detector over each 
youth. They turned on command and raised their arms over their heads. 
</P>
<P>
 "Check my hat," one teased. "Maybe I've got a gun in my hat." 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was just another day at Mount View High School, where students must 
enter through airport-like metal detectors and are monitored all day by more 
than 30 video cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortress Mount View isn't an inner-city school. Its 1,000 students attend 
class in a secluded building perched high on a hill overlooking an Appalachian 
town of fewer than 4,000 people, with the West Virginia coal fields beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Barbara Hairston calls the security a success. But some students say 
it hurts morale and doesn't work: In November, two students were suspended for 
having a gun at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Metal detectors, drug-sniffing dogs and locker searches are becoming more 
common in American schools as educators try to curb "an epidemic of violence," 
according to a National School Boards Assn. report issued in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighty-two percent of 729 school districts responding to an association survey 
said violence in schools has increased in the last five years. Fifteen percent 
said they use metal detectors to screen for weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 At Thomas Jefferson High School in Brooklyn, N.Y., starting times for 1,500 
students are staggered over 2 1/2 hours so they don't have to wait in line more 
than 15 minutes to be scanned through the metal detectors and X-ray machines, 
said Assistant Principal Frieda Homer. 
</P>
<P>
 The school began using the machines after three students were killed and a 
teacher injured in two separate shootings in 1991, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's winding up in a lot of schools and a lot of institutions around the 
country. You can't get into a courthouse anymore without going through a metal 
detector," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you listen to the news, no matter where you travel, and I travel around 
the country quite a bit, the first item on every news report is who was killed, 
who was robbed and how many guns were involved. Until that stops being the lead 
item on the news and in our lives, I don't think anyone should anticipate this 
going away," Homer said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mount View High School freshman Chastity Hamilton, 15, said her school is 
taking security to extremes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels like a prison here," she said. "The older kids don't care because 
they've gotten used to it. But the younger ones like me are coming from schools 
where you're still playing with blocks." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton said she sometimes skips classes and part of the reason is because 
she feels pressured by all the security devices. She said school officials 
ought to trust the students. 
</P>
<P>
 The tight security followed years of violence stemming from school rivalries 
dating back before consolidation into Mount View in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 17, 1992, a 17-year-old student pulled out a .25-caliber handgun and 
wounded Clayton Hightower, 18, during a special education class. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, outraged parents protested by keeping their children home from 
school. They demanded the resignation of McDowell County school officials if 
they didn't tighten security. 
</P>
<P>
 Within weeks, the school board provided two security guards, two walk-through 
metal detectors, a camera-surveillance system, a guard shelter outside and an 
identification card system for anyone entering the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Hairston, a warm, charismatic woman, started as principal in August. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came into this job hoping to make a difference," she said. "We're here for 
the kids, not in spite of the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Hairston downplayed the security measures and said students mostly ignore 
them. "It's a normal routine that's making a safe environment for learning," 
she said. "It's like any other rule, like no talking in class. When you come in 
the gate, you are scanned. It's just another fact of life." 
</P>
<P>
 The metal detectors are manned by four teachers, a security guard and the 
assistant principal, Hairston said. 
</P>
<P>
 All other entrances to the building are locked, she said, so students must go 
through the detectors. Backpacks, purses and packages also are examined, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 She refused to let a reporter and photographer watch students coming in 
through the detectors. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how the teen-agers smuggled the gun past the detectors in November, 
Hairston demurred. "No one has said they smuggled it in. We don't know that. 
There are a lot of entrances, and they could have come in at night," Hairston 
said before changing the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Butler, 16, said he believed one youth brought the gun, then asked the 
other to carry it. A third student alerted school officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler, a vocational student studying masonry, said he liked school better 
before the security measures. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was better when they didn't search you every day," Butler said. "And with 
all the video cameras, it feels like you're always being spied on." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob O'Brien, spokesman for the state chapter of the American Civil Liberties 
Union, called the issue "one of the more problematic matters to come up in 
recent years." 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want our schools to be armed fortresses and yet we want our children 
to be safe," O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien said he didn't consider the "aberrant behavior" of one youth 
justification for the security devices. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless there is substantial evidence of children doing things that would 
destroy the security of the school, it would seem to me this is going 
overboard," O'Brien said. "This is the wrong atmosphere for an educational 
institution." 
</P>
<P>
 But Ronald Stephens, executive director of the National School Safety Center 
in Westlake Village, Calif., said security helps students concentrate on 
academics. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids who aren't bringing the guns to school appreciate the additional 
measures being taken," Stephens said. 
</P>
<P>
 The center was established in 1984 by a mandate from President Ronald Reagan 
to analyze and help decrease violence in schools. It is a partnership of the 
U.S. Departments of Justice and Education and Pepperdine University. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mount View teen-ager who teased the security guard into checking his hat 
said the security measures don't work. The teen, who did not give his name, 
showed a photographer a can of Mace and said, "You can get anything past the 
guards."

S. AFRICANS' VOTES CARRY HOPE FOR NEW NATION; POLLING: ABOUT 30,000 EMIGRES IN 
THE STATE WILL BE ABLE TO CAST ABSENTEE BALLOTS IN THEIR HOMELAND'S HISTORIC 
ALL-RACE ELECTION. 
</P>

<P>
 Ronald Kunene of Encino will make history April 26. So will his roommate, 
Sydney Skosana, their friend, Lebo Morake, and Lauretta Ngakane, who works in 
Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 All four are black South Africans. Born in a country that excluded them, and 
forced into exile to pursue an education and their professions, they will vote 
for the first time 10 days from now in South Africa's historic all-race 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 Matured beyond their years by the hardships they have endured, these young 
adults speak eloquently of the joy they feel -- tempered with worry for their 
nation's future -- as they prepare to cast their absentee ballots along with 
100,000 other South Africans living in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela, the symbol of the long 
struggle by blacks as well as many whites against apartheid, is virtually 
certain to become South Africa's first black president. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, I am elated. A new nation is about to be born," said Kunene, a 
31-year-old UCLA graduate student. "It's going to be a rough birth and even 
after the election, there will still be problems, probably for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's nothing new," he said. "In any birth there is a lot of pain. But out 
of the pain the beauty comes, the baby." 
</P>
<P>
 But the specter of continued political violence in South Africa concerns 
Skosana, a 26-year-old studying computer science at Pierce College in Woodland 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Mandela is going to win the election, I am sure," Skosana said, "but he 
may not be able to fulfill the promises he has made to the people." Black 
opposition leaders "want their own land," he noted. "We won't know until after 
the election whether they will accept defeat. I wish they would unite and form 
one solid party." 
</P>
<P>
 For Morake, 29, the election is a watershed. "Obviously, I'm extremely excited 
about it. It's a new day in my country. I don't know if there is anything else 
to say beyond that." 
</P>
<P>
 Echoing that wonderment, Ngakane, who escaped from South Africa at age 10 with 
her family, added: "All these people are dying in South Africa and have died 
through history in South Africa. We all want to make sure the outcome of this 
election is positive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted very much to go back home to vote. But unfortunately, my relatives 
who are still there are nothing but strangers to me now. It's very sad." 
</P>
<P>
 The South Africans living in the United States are eligible to vote if they 
are at least 18 years old and can prove South African citizenship. They can 
cast ballots at 14 polling places around the country, including the South 
African Consulate in Beverly Hills and at Irvine City Hall in Orange County. As 
many as 30,000 emigres could vote in California; groups of about 10,000 
eligible voters each live in Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco. The 
polls will be open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 On the same day, South Africans in 73 other countries will also help choose 
their nation's leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Their secret ballots will be hand-carried in sealed containers to Johannesburg 
by South African government officials, then counted with ballots cast inside 
South Africa on April 26 through April 28. 
</P>
<P>
 To ensure that black South Africans in Los Angeles capitalize on the historic 
opportunity, nearly 30 voter registration advocates gathered in a West Los 
Angeles church Saturday to devise a strategy for getting out the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 In the parish hall of St. Mary's Anglican Church in Palms, members of the 
Coalition of South Africans in Los Angeles talked about the difficulties they 
have encountered while trying to register to vote at the South African 
Consulate. 
</P>
<P>
 Coalition members told of being required to produce birth certificates and 
other paperwork, long ago abandoned by South Africans exiles when they fled 
their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our documents are not up to date because we did not leave South Africa 
through the front door," said Pauline Manaka, 43, who has been active in voter 
registration efforts for black South Africans in Los Angeles. "We had to leave 
our birth certificates and our families. There should be an opportunity, for us 
especially, to be excused if we do not have everything we need to vote." 
</P>
<P>
 Voters will choose from more than 18 political parties on the ballot, not 
individuals. Although the ANC has a huge lead in the polls, as much as 17% of 
the electorate is believed to be undecided, The Times reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Those undecided voters are not likely to derail Mandela's expected landslide 
victory. But they could help determine how much power South African President 
Frederik W. de Klerk and blacks opposed to the ANC, including rival Inkatha 
Freedom Party supporters, will have in the new government. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent bloody clashes between ANC and Inkatha members in the Natal province 
have left an estimated 200 people dead. Still, Morake said the parties' 
philosophical differences have been distorted in media accounts of the 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like any new country, there are bound to be minor conflicts, so to speak, 
between organizations with various opinions," Morake said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But particularly in South Africa, most of the time the international media 
tends to exploit those minor differences and paint a picture like they are 
affecting the whole nation," he said. "Some people unfortunately will lose 
their lives, but we are going through a revolution." 
</P>
<P>
 Kunene and his roommate, Skosana, worry about the safety of their families who 
live in the small town of Springs, about 30 miles east of Johannesburg. Kunene, 
a Zulu, and Skosana, a member of the north African Ndebele ethnic group, were 
childhood friends. Both came to this country to get an education. 
</P>
<P>
 Kunene plans to return when he finishes his doctorate in history in about a 
year. He hopes to film documentaries, using experience he has gained from 
appearing as an actor and singer in American movies about South Africa, such as 
"Cry Freedom" and "The Power of One." Kunene also toured with the national 
company of the Broadway hit musical "Sarafina!" 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to make documentaries about our history," Kunene said. "Until now, 
they've all been from one (white) point of view." 
</P>
<P>
 Morake added: "That was the old South Africa. The rotten South Africa." 
</P>
<P>
 He remembers it well. Growing up in Soweto, the largest of South Africa's 
black ghettos, Morake started singing on the street when he was 5. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always had music in my heart," explains Morake, now a professional 
singer and arranger. 
</P>
<P>
 At 14, he fled without telling his parents to the neighboring independent 
country of Lesotho and a year later to New York. 
</P>
<P>
 After several years in the United States, Morake returned to Johannesburg, 
where he lives with his second wife and 6-month-old daughter. Two older 
daughters from his first marriage live in South-Central Los Angeles with their 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Morake is in town working on the soundtrack for Walt Disney Pictures' new 
movie, "The Lion King," to be released in mid-June. He also appeared in "Cry 
Freedom" and "Sarafina!". 
</P>
<P>
 Ngakane, the daughter of a Lutheran Church official active in the underground 
freedom struggle in Pretoria, spent her childhood in constant fear of the South 
African government's security forces. 
</P>
<P>
 "The police were always coming to our house," said the 25-year-old supervisor 
in the accounts payable department at All Post Inc., a Burbank post-production 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 When she was 14, her mother told Ngakane, her brother and two sisters to each 
pack a small bag of clothes for a weekend visit to the neighboring country of 
Botswana. They were never to return -- small bags were used in order not to 
arouse the border guards' suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
 Ngakane, who lives in Encino, wants to go back to South Africa for good some 
day. By then, she hopes -- even if it is idealistic in the near term -- all 
traces of the hated apartheid will have disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she likes Los Angeles, "I don't feel very safe here. The class 
separation is very evident. I feel it every day. If I decide to take a walk at 
night in my neighborhood, the police will stop me and ask me 'What are you 
doing here?' I say I live here. 
</P>
<P>
 "But my next move will be to South Africa. I'm ready to go see what my own 
people are like and what my own country will become." 
</P>
<P>
 At the parish hall in Palms, 68-year-old Gertrude Zikalala spoke of the 
country that Ngakane so badly wants to visit. 
</P>
<P>
 Zikalala recently left Soweto to visit her daughter, Thabi, in Los Angeles. 
They had not seen each other since Thabi left South Africa in 1976 during the 
Soweto student uprising. 
</P>
<P>
 Zikalala and her daughter will cast absentee ballots together. 
</P>
<P>
 "Apartheid has been too much," said Zikalala, her eyes filling with tears as 
she shook her head and stared somewhere in the distance. "Too much, it's pretty 
hard. But voting means a lot to me. I tend to vote at all costs because unless 
we get together, things will be shaky." 
</P>
<P>
 For Sam Phillips, the election will mean the end of a voter registration 
project he started before leaving South Africa years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have fought for this long and suffered long," said Phillips, 46, head of 
art and culture for the Los Angeles chapter of the ANC. "I will be happy to 
vote here, but I will not be as fulfilled as if I was back home, being with my 
people and celebrating that day together."

PILOT FROM L.A. WAS ON SHOT-DOWN HELICOPTER; TRAGEDY: ERIK MOUNSEY'S FAMILY 
SAYS HE LOVED AVIATION SINCE BOYHOOD, WHEN HE WATCHED PLANES FLY OVER THEIR 
WESTCHESTER HOME. ARMY WARRANT OFFICER WAS TO LEAVE MIDEAST NEXT MONTH.

 Erik Mounsey fell in love with flight when he was just a kid. 
</P>
<P>
 At his Westchester home near Los Angeles International Airport, he would spend 
hours studying the jumbo jets as they roared overhead. He knew the planes by 
name. He could identify them just by the sound of their jet engines. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the beginning," said Sarah Mounsey in an interview from the 
Westchester home where her son was raised. "He was fascinated by airplanes. He 
knew when he was very young that one day he would fly." 
</P>
<P>
 Army Warrant Officer Erik Mounsey was aboard one of the two Blackhawk 
helicopters downed last week by American fighters in a "no fly" zone over Iraq, 
his family said Saturday. Twenty-six people died when two F-15 fighters 
apparently misidentified the Blackhawks as Iraqi aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Military officials have not publicly identified Erik Mounsey as among those 
killed in the incident. But family members said they have been officially 
notified by the Defense Department that the 28-year-old Westchester High School 
graduate is among the dead. Although they were not told what he was doing on 
the helicopter, his family believes he was one of the pilots. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was nothing Erik wouldn't try," said his older brother, John, who 
joined his parents Saturday as they sifted through photo albums and traded 
stories about Erik. "He was the epitome of ambition. He would follow a dream, 
whatever it was, and he'd do it all the way." 
</P>
<P>
 His mother said Mounsey had been in the Middle East about a month but would 
not discuss his duties there. 
</P>
<P>
 For as long as anyone can remember, Mounsey's dream was to soar through the 
sky. 
</P>
<P>
 He had other interests as well. He was a straight-A student who liked to surf 
and ski. He married his high school sweetheart, Kaye, a few years ago. At their 
wedding, Mounsey wore a pair of black leather shoes with the word "Top" 
scrawled on the left sole and "Gun" scrawled on the right. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, family members say Mounsey did not fancy himself a "Top Gun" 
fighter pilot. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his code name was Maverick and he dreamed of being an Air Force 
pilot, he transferred to the Army so that he could fly humanitarian aid 
missions. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wasn't the type who thought he could just pull the trigger and knock 
someone down," Sarah Mounsey said.  
</P>
<P>
 At his Germany post, Erik Mounsey was known for dressing up as Santa and 
passing out presents to children on the base. In the Middle East, Mounsey flew 
aid missions that helped feed Turkish children. 
</P>
<P>
 John Mounsey said his brother wanted to pilot Coast Guard helicopters when he 
got out of the Army in a couple of years. He was scheduled to leave the Middle 
East next month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Erik wouldn't hurt anybody," he said. "He was a good kid who just wanted to 
help other people." 
</P>
<P>
 Family members said they are hoping to find out why the two helicopters were 
shot down. They say they are angry at the lack of response to their questions 
about the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of questions I have that probably will never be answered 
because of the bureaucratic red tape," John Mounsey said. "It's so maddening 
because there is nothing you can do." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, the family is left to make funeral arrangements.  
</P>
<P>
 Sarah Mounsey said she wants to bury Erik in a Santa Monica cemetery where she 
buried her first son, a boy named Keath who died in 1960 before Erik and his 
brothers were born. Kaye Mounsey, and the couple's 2-year-old daughter, 
Natasha, are expected to return to Los Angeles next week with Erik's remains. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarah Mounsey said she last heard from her son last week when she celebrated 
her 61st birthday. He sent a birthday card and a letter. And he called just to 
let her know he was OK. 
</P>
<P>
 She spent Saturday looking at old photographs of her son. And she cried a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll pick up the pieces like I did after my first son and I'll go on," she 
said. "I'm not exactly sure how, but I'll go on."

TAFT HIGH'S TEAM EARNS PERFECT MARKS IN DECATHLON FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABIGAIL GOLDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A nine-student team from Taft High School in Woodland Hills won another trophy 
for California and the Los Angeles Unified School District on Saturday, earning 
a perfect score in the national Academic Decathlon's Super Quiz. 
</P>
<P>
 Taft tied a team representing Massachusetts for first place in the 
high-stakes, game show-style quiz, the only decathlon event open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Although their Super Quiz marks do not ensure that the Woodland Hills students 
will win the 13th annual academic contest, it means they are strong contenders. 
Scores on the event's other nine tests in the event will not be released until 
this morning's awards banquet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't have asked for a better outcome," said Andrew Salter, 17, as he 
hugged his parents after the quiz. "We have a very good chance of winning." 
</P>
<P>
 Taft defeated teams from San Antonio, Tex., and Chicago, which the California 
team believed to be its biggest threats. Those schools took second and third 
place respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 The Massachusetts team from Acton-Boxborough Regional High School in Acton, 
Mass., was not considered one of the top four teams going into the competition, 
based on its scores in their state's competition. Massachusetts team members 
expressed as much surprise as pleasure after their tie with Taft was announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Taft won the national academic contest in 1989, came in second last year and 
has won the state title three times. 
</P>
<P>
 The Super Quiz is the last and most intense of the contest's events. Each team 
sent one student at a time onto a gymnasium floor at Essex Community College to 
answer five oral questions, each worth 200 points. Scores are posted after 
every question for the student's teammates, parents and competitors to see. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's theme, "The Documents of Freedom," tested students' knowledge of 
excerpts from 19 documents, including the Gettysburg Address, the Camp David 
Accord and the May 16, 1989, declaration of the students who revolted in 
China's Tian An Men Square.  
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, students representing 41 states and the District of Columbia wrote 
a 60-minute essay, gave a four-minute prepared speech, a two-minute impromptu 
speech and submitted to a seven-minute interview with a panel of judges. Then, 
before Saturday's quiz, they took written tests in math, fine arts, economics, 
science, literature and social studies.  
</P>
<P>
 The Taft group was the last team to enter the gym for the quiz, using the 
precious few minutes after their final test for last-ditch study efforts or a 
chance to pace off the last-minute jitters. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Taft students walked into the building for their final event in the 
months-long process of studying and competing, 18-year-old Sheldon Peregrino 
paused, adjusted his unfamiliar necktie and took a deep breath. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here we go," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Peregrino was the second one in the hot seat. Neither he nor Chris Huie, 17, 
the student just before him, had missed a question. 
</P>
<P>
 "Which document states that every person has the right to own property?" the 
moderator asked. "One, the Magna Carta; two, the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights; three, the Great Law of Peace; four, the May 16 Declaration, or five, 
Pericles' Funeral Oration." 
</P>
<P>
 For each question, there was a painful, few seconds delay between the time 
correct answers were announced and the time scores were projected onto a 
screen. Some students saved their teammates the agony of waiting, such as the 
teen-agers from Mesa, Ariz., who waved a good luck stuffed bull in the air when 
they knew a teammate had answered correctly. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most of his teammates, Peregrino gave no indication of his standing, 
preferring to wait and let his teammates see for themselves. The correct answer 
was No. 2, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the team would soon 
learn that Peregrino knew it. 
</P>
<P>
 After every correct answer, supporters in the gym grandstands whooped and 
howled their team's name. No group, including the team from the host state of 
New Jersey, had as much enthusiasm as the 68-person entourage that accompanied 
the Taft team. 
</P>
<P>
 They wore signature red "GO TAFT!" sweat shirts -- which debuted last year 
during the Los Angeles district's competition and were reprised at the state 
competition in Stockton last month. 
</P>
<P>
 After the victory, as the students made plans to build bonfires with their 
study aids and party through the last months of their senior year, Emily Sears 
Vaughn rejoiced with the other parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so proud and I'm so relieved," she said. "Now they can go back to being 
normal, impossible teen-agers." 
</P>
<P>
 Also competing for Taft were: Daniel Berdichevsky, 17; Michael Michrowski, 17; 
Rebecca Rissman, 17; Sage Vaughn, 17; Kimberly Shapiro, 16, and the team's only 
junior, Stephen Shaw, 16.

ON EQUAL FOOTING; CHURCHES REJOICE AS VATICAN SANCTIONS PRACTICE OF GIRLS AS 
ALTAR SERVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONIA NAZARIO and JOHN DART, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For a long time, it was an open secret at many Los Angeles Catholic churches: 
girls , imagine that, were serving at Mass as altar boys.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some churches let them help priests with the service, but hid them when 
important church honchos arrived. Not that the girls were without high-powered 
supporters. Altar girl Lauri Cuypers remembers Los Angeles Cardinal Roger M. 
Mahony celebrating Mass at St. Elizabeth Catholic Church in Altadena and 
handing her a commemorative cross etched with the words "altar boy" as she 
helped perform the service. "I hope some day it will say altar server," she 
remembers him whispering apologetically into her ear. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the Vatican, in a step toward religious equality, officially 
blessed the practice of girls serving during Roman Catholic Masses, sanctioning 
what a significant minority of Los Angeles' 284 parishes have practiced for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 At St. Elizabeth -- a pioneering parish for altar girls, where 31 of 53 altar 
servers are female -- Lauri stood outside church after Saturday morning Mass, 
happy that she can now light altar candles, hold the priest's Bible, and 
present the bread and wine to be consecrated as the body and blood of Christ 
without crossing any sacred liturgical lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like being up with the priests at the altar, not always down in the pews. I 
feel special. I feel equal," she said. Giggling, she added: "I'm more involved 
in the Mass. You can't just slack off. You have to pay attention." 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to just see guys up there. When I got up there, I felt accepted. I got 
a chance to be at a higher level," said fellow altar girl Claudia Tirado, 
brushing the hair from her face with nails painted black. "Now, they see girls 
up there with the priest. It's a good experience. You know, there were times 
women couldn't vote," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Although some have viewed it as sacrilegious, a growing number of parishes -- 
particularly in the United States -- began using altar girls after 1983, when a 
revision in church law did not explicitly forbid girls from joining boys as 
altar servers. Parishes that tapped girls nonetheless often kept them out of 
the Mass when bishops or other church leaders arrived, said Brother Dominic 
Savio of St. Benedict Church in Montebello, which has abstained from using 
girls as altar servers until now. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some conservative Catholics saw the use of altar girls as a blasphemous 
departure from 2,000 years of tradition, calling it disloyal to the Pope -- who 
had not given specific authorization for it. Because being an altar boy had 
been a training ground for the priesthood, many termed it a dangerous boost to 
proponents of priesthood for women.  
</P>
<P>
 Others saw no harm, and pointed to larger roles women held in the church. 
"Women have been proclaiming the word and distributing the Communion," said St. 
Elizabeth's Father Richard Prindle, as he donned two white robes for the 
morning Mass. "It brings the girls recognition, a chance to participate in the 
services, a sense of being valued. I suspect it brings a sense of equality, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
 "If a woman can give out the body and blood of Christ, why can't a girl hand a 
priest a cruet of wine?" some priests asked the archdiocese of Los Angeles, 
said spokesman Father Gregory Coiro. Faced with a growing controversy, the 
archdiocese four years ago asked churches that had not begun using altar girls 
to refrain from doing so until they got the papal nod. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, girls were rejoicing at their newfound legitimacy. "I was happy 
about the decision. I felt they weren't discriminating against the girls any 
more. They were before. The girls can serve just as well as the boys," said 
11-year-old Geneva Mays, an altar girl for three years at St. Brigid Catholic 
Church in South-Central L.A. She added: "If girls want to be priests, they 
should be able. They haven't approved that. Maybe they will. But I think it 
will take them a while." 
</P>
<P>
 Melissa Mirkovich, 13, was serving as altar girl during a recent Mass at St. 
Francis Xavier Church in Burbank, a skill she has honed in 20 Masses since the 
fourth grade. "The Mass is boring just sitting there. When you are the server 
you actually get to participate in the Mass." 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents approve, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes the Mass come alive for her," said Valerie Plump, 46, an elementary 
schoolteacher who attends St. Elizabeth, where her 12-year-old daughter, 
Christina, has served for five years. "It's given her a sense of 
responsibility, of service. It has brought her closer to the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes the whole family a part of the church," Plump said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, she brushed off a visitor who came to St. Elizabeth for an 
anti-abortion Mass and screamed at her daughter, who was working as an altar 
girl, "This is against Vatican rules!" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many churches -- facing an altar boy shortage -- were also breathing a sigh of 
relief. At Granada Hills' St. Euphrasia Church, which has not previously had 
altar girls, priests sometimes celebrate Mass without an altar boy assisting 
because, as Father Raymond A. Saplis put it: "We have an extremely difficult 
time getting guys to serve." 
</P>
<P>
 Heather Nowatzki, an eighth-grader at St. Euphrasia's school, said she attends 
Mass nearly every Sunday and had a brother who served as an altar boy. "If the 
girls started doing it, the boys might think we can do it better and would 
begin to show up more," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Girls jumped at the chance last week to serve at St. Benedict in Montebello. 
But Savio sees one looming problem now that churches have the pontiff's 
blessing: "I'm wondering if the boys and girls can work together. The boys 
said: 'We don't want the girls near us.' You know. They are at that awkward 
age."

SCOTT HARRIS: GETTING THE WORD ON A SENSITIVE SUBJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 She is grateful that Newsweek recognized the significance of Kurt Cobain's 
suicide. But if Rosemary Rubin were the editor in chief, she wouldn't have 
featured Cobain's gloomy face on the cover, or the word suicide in big bold 
type. 
</P>
<P>
 For that matter, Rubin, a suicide-prevention counselor in the Los Angeles city 
schools, didn't like the fact that this newspaper used the S-word in its 
front-page headline. 
</P>
<P>
 Teen-agers, she explains, "are at an impressionable age. Kids who are 
depressed don't think clearly. And when they see something like this. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 She offered to fax me literature about the phenomena of "copycat suicides" and 
"media contagion," with the hope that I wouldn't compound the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Suicide is a sensitive subject. When it was learned that Cobain, the leader of 
Nirvana, the most celebrated poet of "grunge," had silenced himself at 27, it 
wasn't just grieving fans who found themselves watching MTV and wondering why 
and thinking about others who, as the euphemism goes, "took their own life." 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy to list rock icons who self-destructed long before Cobain. It's also 
easy to think of folks who were not famous. These would be the people you knew, 
or thought you knew, or wish you had been able to know. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of my closest friends were teen-agers when their fathers killed 
themselves. This will forever be a painful subject. My cousin Jack was 41 or 
maybe 42 when he did it. An admired colleague was in her 50s. And two summers 
ago, Adam, the troubled son of a dear friend, was only 18. 
</P>
<P>
 You feel sad for the dead but worse for the survivors. Sadness gives rise to 
anger. How could they be so selfish? 
</P>
<P>
 That was one young man's quick reaction to Cobain's suicide. "I think it 
sucks," he told the MTV reporter. What really bothered him, the young man said, 
wasn't Cobain's actions so much as the fact that he left behind a 19-month-old 
daughter, Frances Bean. When people do this, they haunt the lives of others. 
</P>
<P>
 Mental illness, researchers say, is a leading cause of suicide. Kurt Cobain's 
story, well known to his fans, was that of a despairing boy whose parents 
divorced when he was 9. As an adolescent, he shuttled back and forth among 
relatives and friends but wore out his welcome. He sought solace in music and 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 To read old press clippings now is to feel a chill. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a seriously depressed kid," he told The Times' Robert Hilburn in an 
interview last August. "Every night at one point I'd go to bed bawling my head 
off. I used to try to make my head explode by holding my breath, thinking if I 
blew up my head, they'd be sorry. There was a time when I never thought I'd 
live to see 21." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the chronicle of Cobain's troubles, many fans were stunned. To sing 
along or play air guitar is to fantasize the life of the rock star. Nirvana 
sold millions upon millions of recordings. Many fans don't pay much attention 
to lyrics, but Cobain's downbeat musings touched a nerve with many. "It's cool 
to be depressed," a young woman told MTV. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Klein, a Nirvana fan who works at Tower Records in Sherman Oaks, was 
hooked by an early song called "Negative Creep," which includes the lyrics: I'm 
a negative creep/ I'm a negative creep and I'm stoned . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "The first time I heard that, I thought, 'Yeah, this is cool,' " he recalls. 
"I was feeling pretty s----- that day and it hit home." 
</P>
<P>
 The fear that some people may emulate Cobain put counselors such as Rosemary 
Rubin on alert. The former Taft High counselor is part of a two-member team 
that specializes in advising school-based counselors and teachers who are 
dealing with depressed and potentially suicidal youths. Suicide, Rubin points 
out, is second only to accidents as a cause of death in the age group between 
10 and 19. 
</P>
<P>
 As it happened, it was the suicide of a fifth-grader at 49th Street School who 
shot himself in the head with his father's gun that activated the school 
district's crisis team last week. Rubin staffed the hot line while her partner 
assisted other counselors at the school. Among her callers that day was a high 
school counselor who was working with three students deeply affected by 
Cobain's death.  
</P>
<P>
 Rubin faxed the counselor copies of Newsweek's articles to help him understand 
Cobain's significance. She also faxed him some pages from a guidebook on 
suicide counseling, a copy of which she also sent to me. 
</P>
<P>
 The guidebook urges individuals to help society form "appropriate norms" about 
suicide. "These norms should blend openness and understanding, without 
condemning or glorifying the suicide. Such norms will help to bring suicide out 
into the open where it can be talked about and prevented. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The media, it adds, should be aware that some people may receive the wrong 
kind of inspiration from news reports. "Avoid sensationalizing or romanticizing 
the suicide," it advises. ". . . Downplay the positioning of the story, 
avoiding front-page placement or large headlines. . . . Avoid using the word 
'suicide' in the headline or printing a photo of the person. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Just as the guidebook recommends, Rubin and Dr. Robert Litman, a clinical 
professor of psychiatry at UCLA, emphasized that mental illness and other 
conditions such as depression that lead to suicide are treatable. Depression, 
drug and alcohol abuse, truancy, fights and a sense of failure tend to be 
common traits among teen-agers who commit suicide. Parents and friends, they 
said, should not ignore the warning signs, but should show that they care. 
"Love is the best protection," Litman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Had I thought about it at the time, I would have asked Rosemary Rubin how one 
is to reconcile "openness and understanding, without condemning" the suicide if 
one's open, honest reaction is that of condemnation. And how does a newspaper 
bring "suicide out into the open" while avoiding the word in headlines? 
</P>
<P>
 We had talked for maybe 25 minutes when Rubin said she had to put me on hold. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got to go," she soon explained. "I've got a crisis call coming in."

ANGELS COME UP SHORT THIS TIME; BASEBALL: IT GOES DOWN TO NINTH INNING AGAIN, 
BUT THE BLUE JAYS HOLD ON FOR A 5-4 VICTORY.

<P>
 The Angels have not quite mastered the swagger. They have yet to strut down 
the basepaths, flaunt their talents, or even show disrespect for an opponent.  
</P>
<P>
 The arrogance might come in time, but for now, they will say they can play 
with baseball's elite. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels lost to the Toronto Blue Jays, 5-4, on Saturday night before 29,757 
at Anaheim Stadium, but it was as if they couldn't believe it finally happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Forget that the Blue Jays are two-time defending World Series champions. 
</P>
<P>
 Forget that Blue Jay starter Pat Hentgen, who won 19 games last season, 
flirted with a no-hitter for four innings before pitching a complete game. 
</P>
<P>
 Forget that the Blue Jays are supposed to win these games. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the ones the Angels now expect to win. And they had difficulty 
handling the loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a different team now," said Angel center fielder Chad Curtis, who ended 
a slump by going two for three with a double. "They've proven they're the best 
team in baseball the last two years, but just because they have back-to-back 
championships doesn't mean we can't play with them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels (6-6) were once in awe of the Blue Jays, but that ended June 2, 
1993 after the teams were involved in a full-scale brawl. They haven't looked 
at Toronto the same since. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they kicked the proverbial sleeping dog," Curtis said. "Before that, 
we looked at them like they were above us. It was like we were putting them on 
a pedestal." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Angel Manager Buck Rodgers: "Last year, we were a little intimidated by 
that club, and we had to have a brawl to get rid of it. Now, there's no way 
that we're intimidated by them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, who overcame a 4-0 deficit in the fifth inning, failed to 
duplicate their ninth-inning heroics of Friday night. Blue Jay Manager Cito 
Gaston, refusing to go his bullpen Saturday, decided this game would be 
Hentgen's to win or lose. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis, who was removed from his leadoff spot and was batting sixth, began the 
ninth with a leadoff walk. Greg Myers sacrificed Curtis to second. Harold 
Reynolds, one of the heroes of Friday's 14-13 comeback victory, struck out for 
the second out. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers then went to his bench, and summoned Bo Jackson, much to the crowd's 
pleasure. Jackson, who has represented at least the tying run in five of the 
last six games, was unable to deliver this time, striking out on four pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, though, believed they never should have been trailing in the 
ninth. It was a check-swing single that cost them the lead, and eventually the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Left-hander Bob Patterson, who retired the first four batters he faced in 
relief of starter John Dopson, began the seventh by getting shortstop Alex 
Gonzalez to pop up. First baseman Eduardo Perez, drifting into foul territory, 
watched the ball fall into his glove and fall out. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you want me to say? It took a bad hop?" Perez said. "I just clinked 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez then drew a walk. Patterson struck out Devon White and Roberto Alomar 
when Rodgers decided to play the percentages and called upon right-hander Mike 
Butcher to face right-handed hitter Paul Molitor. Butcher walked Molitor, and 
then Joe Carter, loading the bases. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Lefferts was summoned to face left-handed hitter John Olerud. Lefferts 
got ahead of Olerud, 1-and-2, and then watched in disbelief when Olerud hit a 
check-swing grounder toward shortstop Gary DiSarcina. The ball was hit so 
softly that Olerud was able to reach before DiSarcina's throw, allowing what 
proved to be the winning run to score. 
</P>
<P>
 Dopson was knocked out of the game before the Angels got their first hit. 
Dopson, who pitched four shutout innings, could not contain the Blue Jays past 
the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Delgado, who already has seven home runs, began the inning with a 
single to right. Ed Sprague flied out deep to left field for the first out 
before Pat Borders singled to left, advancing Delgado to third. 
</P>
<P>
 It appeared that Dopson would escape the jam when Gonzalez hit a bouncer to 
third baseman Damion Easley and Delgado broke for home. They got him in a 
rundown for the second out, but it would prove to be Dopson's last hurrah. 
</P>
<P>
 Dopson hit White with the next pitch, loading the bases. He got ahead of 
Alomar with two quick strikes, then watched Alomar hit a two-run double into 
right field. Paul Molitor followed with a single to right, scoring two more 
runs.

DODGERS' SKID SIMPLY IS TOO BAD FOR WORDS; BASEBALL: THEY LOSE TO THE PIRATES, 
4-3, THEIR FOURTH CONSECUTIVE LOSS. MISTAKES CONTINUE TO HURT 3-8 L.A. 
</P>

 The shouting of Manager Tom Lasorda before Saturday's game didn't come close 
to that milestone of a meeting he held in 1977, when he uttered 163 expletives 
in 14 minutes, and his team was in first place.  
</P>
<P>
 This time, the meeting before the game featured Lasorda's speech about how the 
team has to stop losing before the streak picks up momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, Lasorda told his players that they are much better than a 3-7 
team. Now, make that 3-8. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers lost their fourth consecutive game, 4-3, to the Pittsburgh 
Pirates, who won their sixth in a row at Three Rivers Stadium. Darren Dreifort 
(0-1) lost in the bottom of the ninth when Jeff King singled past a diving 
Delino DeShields and Jay Bell scored. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how you hit that kid (Dreifort), but I did," said King, who was 
four for five. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Dodger clubhouse after the game, the players were shaking their heads, 
believing the game never should have come down to the ninth inning. The Pirates 
hadn't led all night, tying the Dodgers at 2-2 in the fourth inning and at 3-3 
in the sixth.  
</P>
<P>
 It was the Dodgers' sixth loss by two runs or fewer. Once again, there were 
fundamental mistakes and a failure to execute at the plate when it counts.  
</P>
<P>
 "When you are not scoring, you cannot make these mistakes," said Orel 
Hershiser, who gave up three runs in six innings and left with the score tied, 
3-3. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are amplified because we are not scoring. But how many games have we 
lost by one run? When that happens, it's not a symptom, it's a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda shook up the batting order, which had as much to do with trying 
something different as it did with facing Pirate left-hander Randy Tomlin. The 
most effective move was putting Mike Piazza in the fourth spot ahead of Tim 
Wallach, the Dodgers' hottest batter, in the hope that Piazza would get better 
pitches.  
</P>
<P>
 Wallach, who didn't get many good pitches to hit, walked twice. He has hit in 
seven consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza responded by getting three singles and scoring a run in the sixth 
inning on a line drive off the mound by Raul Mondesi that put the Dodgers 
ahead, 3-2. Still, it wasn't a happy Piazza who faced reporters after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't make a difference (if I'm hitting), if we are not winning 
ballgames; that's what's important," Piazza said. 
</P>
<P>
 The most glaring mistake came in the third inning, after DeShields' single to 
left scored Jose Offerman and gave the Dodgers a 2-0 lead. Piazza followed with 
a line drive to left field that should have scored DeShields, but he held up at 
third base, not even seeing coach Joe Amalfitano waving him home until it was 
too late. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Martin, playing deep, tried to glove Piazza's drive on the short hop, but 
the the ball bounced off Martin's chest and rolled in front of him. Meanwhile, 
DeShields, who was trying to steal second base on the pitch, slid into the bag, 
later saying he didn't know where the ball was. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked up and saw the ball in front of (Martin), but I didn't think it was 
going to roll that far in front of him so that I could score," said DeShields, 
who rounded third. "I started back to third and then I looked at Joey waving me 
home, and I picked him up kind of late." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Amalfitano: "Sometimes the coach has to become the runner's eyes. I 
didn't say anything to Delino, but he said to me, 'I'm sorry, I messed up.' I 
told him that before the season is over, he will be stealing runs for us." 
</P>
<P>
 After Wallach walked, Eric Karros, who would strand seven baserunners in the 
game, struck out with the bases loaded.  
</P>
<P>
 "You cannot make mistakes, period," said Wallach, who was one for two. "We 
need to be more aggressive instead of sitting back. When you do that, bad 
things happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Mondesi saved a run with a throw from right field in the sixth to keep the 
score 3-3, but the basics had hurt the Dodgers in the fourth inning, when the 
Dodgers led, 2-1, and Hershiser was pitching to Tomlin. Wallach failed to get 
Jose Offerman's attention to try to position him closer to third base, and 
Tomlin hit a drive that would have been right at Offerman. Instead, Tomlin's 
hit tied the score. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of frustrating, I think we were all convinced coming out of spring 
training that nothing like this would happen,' DeShields said. "To be 3-8, none 
of us anticipated that."

Q & A WITH ROGER KAHN; THE BOYS OF SUMMER AND OTHERS REVISITED; BASEBALL: IT 
WAS 'THE ERA,' WHEN THE YANKEES, THE GIANTS, AND THE DODGERS RULED THE WORLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE GIETSCHIER, THE SPORTING NEWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Roger Kahn's latest book is "The Era," published by Ticknor & Fields and named 
one of the best books of 1993 by The Sporting News. In this book, the author of 
"The Boys of Summer" revisits the years 1947-57 "when the Yankees, the Giants, 
and the Dodgers ruled the world." Recently he sat down with The Sporting News 
to talk about the relationship between ballplayers and the press and how it has 
deteriorated since he was a newspaper reporter in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Weren't you rather young and inexperienced when you began to cover 
the Dodgers in 1952? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Yes. I had never traveled with any team, any professional team. I had 
done a variety of reporting, a lot of college football. I had gone to Froebel 
Academy in Brooklyn. That was a grammar school, and I was there when Pee Wee 
Reese came on as the kid shortstop for the Dodgers. Now I was covering a team 
where Pee Wee Reese was the shortstop, somebody I had actually rooted for while 
I was in grammar school. I was taken around by Harold Rosenthal, another writer 
for the Tribune, and introduced to the players. They were very open and 
outspoken. 
</P>
<P>
 That night, I found myself standing in the hotel lobby near Clem Labine. He 
came over and said, "What are you doing tonight?" My social calendar was clear, 
and he said there was a movie maybe I would like to see with him, and it was 
called "Moulin Rouge," about the French painter Toulouse-Lautrec. And he 
quickly added that he only knew about that because he was French. We went to 
the movie, and he paid for the tickets. I had heard that ballplayers were 
cheap, and I had heard that ballplayers were illiterate. We sat up and talked 
about life and love, the big issues, and Labine became a friend. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Sooner or later, didn't you have to write something negative about him? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, you have to do critical stuff. He was sent down to St. Paul. He was 
5-1 the year before. He pitched the shutout before the Bobby Thomson home run. 
He just wasn't pitching well. So I had to write that side. He would look hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 But it didn't begin to come together for me until I began to notice some of 
the players would give me a quote and pull the quote back. Roy Campanella was 
notorious for that. He was having a bad year, and he would say, "I ain't no 
eighth-place hitter." And if you wrote that, he would say, "I never talked to 
the writer." And so Campanella and I did not get along very well. Jackie 
Robinson and I did. Robinson never pulled a quote. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So this is an adversarial relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, reporting on people's lives is adversarial. You've got to be willing 
to do it. After two years with the Dodgers, the Tribune forced me to Phoenix to 
cover the Giants. I thought the Giants were drab, but I suppose I was getting 
too close to some guys on the Dodgers and too angry at others. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Did your bosses sense that? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. They said, "He's beginning to think he's a part of the Brooklyn 
National League baseball team, not a part of the editorial staff of the New 
York Herald Tribune. So we have to do something about it." I said, "I don't 
want to go to Phoenix. I don't have any sources on that team." Change is always 
frightening. I made a number of excuses, and they would buy none of them. 
</P>
<P>
 So out I went to Phoenix, and the Giants weren't drab at all. Whitey Lockman 
wasn't drab. Al Dark wasn't drab. They were different, and they were dominated 
by this loud, manipulative character named Leo Durocher. So they kind of 
receded because Durocher was so loud. The trick with writing the Giants was to 
write something more than Leo Durocher. With Durocher it was totally 
adversarial. He had lined up all of the writers and worked out all their 
weaknesses and calculated how he could work on their weaknesses to get a 
positive press. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Just like he did with his players? 
</P>
<P>
 A: One writer was a serious alcoholic. Leo kept him in booze. Another was 
impecunious. Durocher lent him some money and said that if the writer ever 
knocked the club, he would go to his paper with the notes that the reporter had 
been required to sign. 
</P>
<P>
 By this time, I was reasonably tough. I had Campanella pulling quotes, and I 
had dealt with Walter O'Malley, and I had dealt with Buzzie Bavasi. I love 
Buzzie Bavasi, but Bavasi was manipulative, and Bavasi would tell you this to 
get you to write that. So I was not what Charlie Dressen would call a "Ned in 
the third reader," Charlie's term for someone who was very naive. I called 
Durocher. I was going out to Phoenix, and I asked, "Are you going to have a set 
starting lineup this year, 1954?" In 1953, the Giants had had a bad year, and 
he was juggling his lineup a lot. He said, "Yes." I said, "Will you give me the 
lineup?" So he gave me the lineup: Wes Westrum catch, Lockman first, Davey 
Williams -- it was a set lineup -- and Willie (Mays) was going to come out of 
the Army. 
</P>
<P>
 So I wrote the story. And out I go to Phoenix, and the fellow from The New 
York Times asked Leo, "Are we going to have a set lineup this year?" Durocher 
said, "Yes, we are," and gave him the same lineup he gave me. I turned to the 
guy from the Times after the press conference and said, "I wouldn't write that 
because I used that on Sunday." He said, "If it hasn't appeared in the New York 
Times, it hasn't appeared." He wrote the same story. The Times bounced the 
story, saying the Trib had the same story three days ago. 
</P>
<P>
 These guys got together, and they called me over, and they said, "This is not 
the Dodgers. We don't work like that out here. We all work together. If you 
have something, give it to the rest of us, and if we have something, we'll give 
it to you." I said, "I'm not really going to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: At that time, did beat writers last a good long while, or did they get 
burned out, to use a more modern expression? 
</P>
<P>
 A: They lasted a good long while. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What kind of objectivity is left after many years doing the same thing? 
</P>
<P>
 A: None. I think, more than that, what kind of powers of observation are left 
after doing the same thing for so long? I was in spring training in Phoenix. 
One guy didn't go to any of the workouts or the games, but he paid a young guy 
eight bucks a week to tell him what happened. The guy never left the hotel. And 
this was tolerated by the papers. I think there were more bums -- people who 
could not write reasonable English -- than there are today, but then the few 
stars were brighter than the stars today, the few stars being Jimmy Cannon, Red 
Smith, John Lardner. I don't see anyone writing at peak as well as Lardner or 
Cannon or Smith did at their peaks. 
</P>
<P>
 But every town had hacks. Was there much sense of the player-management 
rivalry in what they wrote? No, there wasn't. I had it. Dick Young had it. But 
these hacks didn't. They wouldn't touch that. 
</P>
<P>
 The shocking thing I learned in the research for "The Era" is that when Jackie 
Robinson played his first game in Jersey City -- he had a great day -- nobody 
covered it except the beat guys. The Times didn't send anybody; the Tribune 
didn't send anybody. NBC, CBS, nobody sent anybody, just the beat guys. If you 
look, as I have done, at Robinson's year in 1947, there is very little in the 
papers about what was really going on. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you suspect it's like in the clubhouse today? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, I think the big change with the press is that today there are no 
off-limits. Young was pretty tough, and I was pretty tough, but we had limits. 
We didn't write about players getting drunk. Maybe I should have, but I didn't. 
And Young didn't. There was sex in the '50s, too. That didn't begin yesterday. 
But there was a sense of limits to what you would do. I don't think that is 
there today. I think there's this creeping "National Enquirer" impact on 
journalism. Taking it out of sports, the Times wouldn't have covered Woody 
Allen and Mia Farrow 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 So I ran an experiment last spring. I was out doing a book about pitching. I'm 
going to do the circle change, the back door slider, etc., and the only way to 
do that is to talk to the players. So, I did an experiment. I picked the 
Orioles because I knew the Orioles were going to win the pennant, which proves 
how much baseball I know. I did not have trouble with anybody. You can say, 
"Well, they know who you are. Everybody knows 'The Boys of Summer.' " I don't 
know. 
</P>
<P>
 I've got some rules. I try to relate to a guy on his terms. If I'm relating to 
Rick Sutcliffe, I know I'm dealing with a reasonably sophisticated athlete who 
has been written about, who has lived in Hollywood, who knows where he is. I 
watched him warm up. I kidded him a little bit about working on his knockdown 
pitches, and he kidded back. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Arthur Rhodes. The back of Arthur Rhodes' car is a speaker. Sutcliffe 
said, "If you want to talk to Rhodes, remember he's a kid from Waco, Texas. Do 
you know anything about the kind of music he likes?" So I tried to get some 
sense of what Arthur Rhodes was interested in. I didn't go in and say, "What 
kind of pitch was that the guy hit 420 feet in the fifth inning?" 
</P>
<P>
 For starters I try not to make it adversarial. I don't whistle in a losing 
locker room. That's a lot of work, and I think it would be hard to do if I 
began with a guy at the All-Star Game or began with a guy at the World Series. 
You don't. You begin in spring training. You begin when there's nobody around, 
and you go one on one. 
</P>
<P>
 And the reasons I can get, over the years, people to talk, is I try never to 
go into a person's horrible personal stuff. I've got a line in "The Era" that 
we were not encouraged at the Herald Tribune to throw hand grenades just to see 
how big a bang they would make. Save it. I think there's just a way to do it, 
and I probably can't define it, but I can do it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about the players' behavior toward the press? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It says in the standard minor league contract, "Player will cooperate with 
press and promotions as determined by club." You ought to have that in every 
major league contract. And this obnoxious behavior, pouring ice on (Tim) 
McCarver, shooting bleach at a guy with a water pistol, would stop. You don't 
need Deion Sanders. Sit him down for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 I tell you that if Walter O'Malley had Bret Saberhagen, he wouldn't have him 
for very long. If Branch Rickey had Bret Saberhagen, he wouldn't have him for 
very long. That kind of conduct was simply not tolerated. I think there's been 
a complete collapse of leadership.

SOCCER; U.S. LOSES GRIP ON RARE VICTORY, TIES MOLDOVA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For those wondering why the U.S. national soccer team has scheduled two 
matches against fledgling Moldova, the answer might be found in the Moldovans' 
style. However, after they rallied to salvage a 1-1 tie Saturday night, 
substance also is an appropriate answer. 
</P>
<P>
 The first thought in playing Moldova -- beside the fact it has had an open 
schedule in the three years since the former Soviet republic gained 
independence -- was that the team plays similarly to Romania, a U.S. opponent 
in this summer's World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Moldova proved to be more than stylistic stand-ins for Romania and gained a 
moral victory with the tie. Vladimir Kosse's goal on a penalty kick in the 85th 
minute provided a lift to a team sluggish from jet lag and dragging from the 
Florida humidity.  
</P>
<P>
 "The result will be a pleasant one at home," Kosse said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 So, too, was the tie disappointing for the United States as it appeared to 
have the game in hand after solving Moldova's defensive puzzle in the second 
half. Although the game had no impact on anything other than the U.S. team's 
record, no American player was happy with allowing a rare victory slip away. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion, we need to win these games," said Janusz Michallik. "What 
happens if we do this in the World Cup?" 
</P>
<P>
 All games point to the World Cup at this stage, and Michallik is correct in 
noting that bad habits have a way of hanging around. But there was something 
positive gained from the game, played before 6,103 in Wolfson Park, a minor 
league baseball stadium with a panoramic view of several freeway ramps. 
</P>
<P>
 Moldova mimicked a defensive strategy favored by Romania. When the team is 
back on defense the two attacking forwards cover the wings, leaving space in 
the middle of the field. That neutralized the Americans' speed on the outside 
and left their midfielders to distribute the ball. In the first half, they were 
notably unsuccessful.  
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't penetrating in the first half," Cobi Jones said. "They were 
dropping back and we were taking long shots. But we were able to get through in 
the second half." 
</P>
<P>
 The United States suddenly found its skill in the second half with an 
impressive display of ball control. At times, the play approximated Coach Bora 
Milutinovic's practice drills in which he stresses a one-touch style with 
minimal dribbling. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all their runs were fruitful, but -- for the first time in many games -- 
they were thoughtful and creative. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 60th minute, the Americans launched a poised attack -- Thomas Dooley 
dashed up the left side and with a heel pass left the ball for Claudio Reyna. 
Dooley cut to the center and Reyna crossed the ball to him. Dooley tapped it to 
Jones, whose powerful shot was stopped by goalkeeper Vasiliy Koshelev. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before that exchange Jones had teamed with Michallik for another scoring 
opportunity. Jones received Michallik's pinpoint cross on the volley and shot. 
His shot was saved. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. goal came in the 47th minute from Mike Sorber, who had not scored 
since Sept. 3, 1992. The goal on Saturday figured to hold up. 
</P>
<P>
 But Andrei Stroenco raced toward the U.S. goal on a breakaway and had entered 
the penalty area when he was pulled down from behind by defender Alexi Lalas. 
Kosse took the penalty kick and scored when his shot bounced in off the left 
post. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, the Moldovans celebrated as if they had won and the United States 
trudged off the field to ponder what it had learned. The teams play again 
Wednesday at Davidson, N.C.

HORSE RACING / BLUE GRASS STAKES; HOLY BULL IS SETTING THE PACE FOR THE DERBY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Any doubt about who should be favored in the 120th Kentucky Derby was cast 
aside Saturday when Holy Bull scored a 3 1/2-length victory in the $500,000 
Blue Grass Stakes at Keeneland, virtually duplicating his romp in the Florida 
Derby a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Blue Grass, the role of Derby favorite was up in the air because of 
Brocco's strong performance in the Santa Anita Derby and Holy Bull's 5 
3/4-length victory in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 But after Holy Bull's seventh victory in eight starts, owner-trainer Jimmy 
Croll's gray colt seemed to be getting most of the votes, including those of 
Mike Battaglia, the Churchill Downs' linemaker, and two California trainers 
whose horses were no match in the Blue Grass. 
</P>
<P>
 "The horse to beat is the horse we saw today," Ron McAnally said after his 
Valiant Nature chased Holy Bull for the entire 1 1/8 miles. Valiant Nature, who 
beat Brocco in the Hollywood Futurity in December before losing a photo for 
second place with him as Soul Of The Matter won the San Felipe Stakes at Santa 
Anita, finished second Saturday. He was five lengths better than Mahogany Hall 
in the seven-horse field. Kandaly, the Louisiana Derby winner, was another 2 
1/4 lengths back, in fourth place, and after him came Chimes Band, Bonus Money 
and Warn Me on a damp, windblown track that had gone from good to fast by the 
time the race was run. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Wayne Lukas, who trains Chimes Band and Tabasco Cat, the second-place 
finisher in the Santa Anita Derby: "You're asking the world's worst 
handicapper, but I think that off of those two impressive races, Holy Bull 
should be the favorite. Another thing is that he's sitting here, and he's just 
going 70 miles up the road to Churchill Downs." 
</P>
<P>
 Holy Bull's time of 1:50 was ordinary -- the track record is 1:47 2/5 -- but 
no one was giving him any demerits for this race. The colt's breeding, by Great 
Above out of Sharon Brown, an Al Hattab mare, doesn't translate into distance, 
but Lukas and Verne Winchell, the owner-breeder of Valiant Nature, don't see 
him stopping in the stretch of the 1 1/4-mile Derby on May 7. 
</P>
<P>
 "He could be an exception to that pedigree," Winchell said. "He could be a 
throwback. He could be a super horse, because my horse didn't run that bad of a 
race. When I saw that 47 4/5 on the board (for the first half-mile), I knew he 
was going to be tough to beat." 
</P>
<P>
 Before a crowd of 27,931, Holy Bull paid $3.20 in earning $310,000 for Croll, 
who inherited the colt and seven other horses last year after the death of 
Rachel Carpenter, the supermarket heiress who raced horses with the trainer for 
37 years. Holy Bull's only defeat, a last-place finish in the Fountain of Youth 
Stakes at Gulfstream Park on Feb. 19, was attributed to a temporary breathing 
disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where's Fly'n J. Bryan when we need him?" said McAnally, referring to the 
California front-runner who led the Santa Anita Derby for six furlongs before 
fading to last. "Pace plays such an important role in this game, and we can 
only hope that there will be some horses like Fly'n J. Bryan who'll run with 
Holy Bull in the Derby. But I'm not discouraged. I don't think I've squeezed 
the lemon dry. My horse has had only five races. Look at Sea Hero. He was 
fourth in the Blue Grass last year and then went on to win the Derby." 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing Holy Bull and his jockey, Mike Smith, would be taking the lead from 
their inside post position, McAnally told his rider, Laffit Pincay, to let them 
go. "Even if you're 10 lengths behind, don't go after them early," McAnally 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Holy Bull had a three-length lead on Valiant Nature after a half-mile, and 
Pincay moved to within 1 1/2 lengths at the eighth pole. Smith was unfazed. 
Holy Bull has felt the jockey's whip only four times, and he didn't add to the 
total Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith did look back at the top of the stretch. "I was just checking to see 
what Valiant Nature had left," he said, "to see if I had to use him a little 
more than I was. Fortunately, I didn't have to. I didn't hit him, but I 
hand-rode him pretty good. I wanted a good race in him. I was hoping to have 
the kind of race where I could get a good race in him and yet not have to empty 
the tank on him." 
</P>
<P>
 Croll likes his position going into the Derby. "I didn't want him to have too 
tough of a race this time," the trainer said. "If he's not fit now, he'll never 
be." 
</P>
<P>
 Valiant Nature, who broke awkwardly, suffered a minor cut to the back of his 
left front ankle. "He either hit himself, or another horse," McAnally said. "It 
doesn't look like it's serious." 
</P>
<P>
 Louie Roussel III, who trains and owns 25% of the late-running Kandaly, feared 
the Blue Grass would be run as it was. 
</P>
<P>
 "They let Holy Bull get away with 47 and something," Roussel said. "Didn't I 
tell you? If that happened, it was going to be all over. I called the race. And 
if he's not challenged in the Derby, he's going to win again."

GOLF / PGA SENIORS' CHAMPIONSHIP; MOWRY FALLS APART, SHOOTS 85; FLOYD SURVIVES 
TO TAKE LEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The comedy of errors billed as the PGA Seniors' Championship continued 
Saturday on the Champion course at PGA National Resort. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Mowry, the co-leader after 36 holes, didn't merely collapse, he scuttled 
the ship. He shot a 13-over-par 85 and needed a birdie on 18 to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 From the best score on Friday, Mowry soared to the worst in the third round. 
</P>
<P>
 He not only left the top of the leader board, he dropped to 44th place, seven 
over par. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the leader, Raymond Floyd, had trouble, finding the water on the 11th 
hole. But Floyd shot his third consecutive 69 for a 54-hole total of 207 and a 
two-stroke lead over Lee Trevino. 
</P>
<P>
 Trevino was five under for 10 holes and had a two-shot lead before the 
treacherous back nine caught up with him. Trevino finished with a 70. Another 
shot back is Dave Stockton, who had a 71. Consistent Dale Douglass is again in 
contention at five-under 211. 
</P>
<P>
 Stockton, who had a quadruple-bogey eight on the 16th hole on Friday, was tied 
for the lead when trouble struck again on the 17th. He hit a four-iron barely 
into the water on the 152-yard par three and decided to hit it out. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a shot he doesn't practice and it was obvious. He hit a sand wedge, the 
ball flew out of the water, cleared the crowd and was deep in the rough. He 
wound up with a double bogey. 
</P>
<P>
 The way leaders keep floundering on the back nine, it seems likely the winner 
will be the player who holds up the best down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 The odds again favor Floyd, who is establishing himself as the best player on 
the Senior PGA Tour. Not only does he have a two-shot lead, but he has survived 
the back nine better than Trevino or Stockton. In three rounds, Floyd is three 
under par on the back nine. Even with an eight and a six, Stockton is even on 
those holes, and so is Trevino. 
</P>
<P>
 "Make no mistake about it, with the wind blowing like it is, the last nine 
holes are some test," said Floyd, in position to win his second consecutive 
senior major. "No lead seems to be safe. I can't believe those two relatively 
short par threes (15 and 17) can be so difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 Trevino said he is putting better than he has in some time, though he had a 
double bogey on the 422-yard 14th and two bogeys on the back nine. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way I can beat Raymond (today) is not to make any mistakes," Trevino 
said. "I made some today. No. 14 isn't an easy hole for me. I tried to cut a 
three-wood off the tee and wound up with a downhill lie in a fairway bunker. 
Instead of playing it smart with an eight-iron, I tried to reach the green with 
a three. The ball hit the lip and came back. Instead of a par or a bogey, I had 
a double." 
</P>
<P>
 Mowry, who won five senior events before vertigo almost ended his career, said 
his problems Saturday might have been partly because it had been five years 
since he was in contention in a major event. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel fine physically, and found a flaw in my swing," he said, "but I was a 
little nervous because of the situation." 
</P>
<P>
 His nervousness wasn't helped by what happened on the first hole. Mowry's 
second shot stopped five feet below the cup, and Floyd ended up in a sand trap. 
Floyd knocked in his sand-trap shot for a birdie, and then Mowry missed his 
short putt. Mowry parred the first four holes, but after hitting his five-iron 
on the 171-yard fifth hole into the water, he fell apart, going 14 over par in 
the next 13 holes, then getting one back with a birdie at the 18th. Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Freddie Haas, 78, is playing in his record 27th PGA Seniors' Championship, an 
event he won the first time he played in it in 1966. After shooting a 34 on the 
first nine Friday, he made the cut with rounds of 76, 77, to become the oldest 
to make the cut in a PGA event. He had an 83 Saturday. . . . One of the reasons 
Dave Stockton is so popular with fellow pros is his willingness to help them. 
At the practice range Friday, he spotted a flaw in Gary Player's swing. "He 
noticed I was too crouched up," Player said, "and playing the ball off my heel. 
I made the adjustment and I am hitting the ball much better. Wasn't that a nice 
thing for Dave to do?"

FINE TUNING VISUAL SKILLS HELPS ATHLETES IN ALL SPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM McCALL, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The difference between a hit and a strike in professional baseball could be 
the width of a batter's nose, something it took a football player-turned-eye 
doctor to discover. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Reichow played football for Montana State before he became an 
optometrist. Now he is president of the American Optometric Assn. and one of 
the leaders in the field of sports vision science. 
</P>
<P>
 Reichow and colleague Brad Coffey say they have compiled the largest database 
in the nation that catalogs the visual skills of professional and Olympic-level 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 Their work is part of an increasingly important training program for elite 
athletes that was largely ignored when Reichow was playing college ball in the 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was just a lack of awareness," Reichow said. "Everybody got a 
physical to make sure a team was in top condition, but nobody ever checked 
their eyes. People just didn't recognize the problem existed." 
</P>
<P>
 During his optometric studies, Reichow first began to notice that some 
athletes had trouble focusing or tracking objects even though their vision was 
20-20, or better. 
</P>
<P>
 Reichow and Coffey help top athletes fine tune their visual skills, whether 
it's batting or catching a long bomb. They also help improve hand-eye 
coordination and timing, often with dramatic results. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bridge of the nose can actually block one eye, causing the brain to 
suppress the image from the other eye in some batters," Reichow said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were studying one major league team and we predicted exactly what would 
happen with one batter, that he'd be late to the left. The guy stepped up to 
the plate and sure enough, he was late to the left. The general manager 
couldn't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 One of Reichow's success stories is Jake Reed, a Grambling State receiver 
picked by the Minnesota Vikings in the third round of the 1991 NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed was sent to Reichow and Coffey at the Pacific University Family Vision 
Center in Portland after he began missing catches in the pros that he handled 
with ease in college. 
</P>
<P>
 A battery of tests showed that Reed simply lost the ability to track the ball 
when it got close to him, a problem that was also causing severe headaches 
during reading. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had clarity but no tracking system," Reichow said. "Looking ahead he was 
OK. But left or right, and he lost it. It was a serious problem. He was even 
having trouble reading the playbooks." 
</P>
<P>
 After undergoing a series of visual exercises designed by Reichow and Coffey, 
Reed began snatching just about every pass thrown his way, his former Vikings 
coach said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had gotten to the point to where he didn't know when the ball was going to 
get to him," said Tom Moore, now an assistant coach at Detroit. "Alan had to do 
a series of tests to get him to focus on fluid movement so his eyes would focus 
on things as it approached him. I saw the results. It was incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 Moore, a veteran college and pro coach, said he was impressed by the ability 
of Reichow and Coffey to predict Reed's problems on the field simply by 
performing their tests in their office. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sent Jake out there without him ever having seen Jake at a practice, and 
they gave Jake a test and it showed what kind of problems Jake would have as a 
receiver," Moore said, "and it was like they'd been to every practice Jake had 
been in." 
</P>
<P>
 Coffey said the sports vision specialty has been developing since the 
mid-1970s. He and Reichow earned a reputation in the field after developing one 
of the first formal assessment programs at Pacific University in Forest Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were approached by the U.S. Olympic Committee in the 1980s to standardize 
testing, so we developed a standardized assessment battery that has been 
adopted in the U.S., Canada and parts of Europe," Coffey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the tests appear simple, such as reacting to rows or patterns of 
flashing lights, tracking balls tethered on strings, or recognizing strings of 
random numbers flashed on a screen. 
</P>
<P>
 But Coffey and another pioneer in the sports vision field, William Harrison, 
an optometrist in Laguna Beach, say the exercises have a measurable effect on 
the intricate link between the eyes, brain and hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison, who works mostly with major league baseball teams, also has worked 
since 1971 with pro football players, golfers, tennis and water polo players -- 
just about every kind of athlete who wants an edge. 
</P>
<P>
 His patient list includes former Los Angeles Rams linebacker Mel Owens, Chris 
Duplanti of the U.S Olympic water polo team, golfer Billy Casper and Brady 
Anderson of the Baltimore Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, left fielder and leadoff hitter for Baltimore, improved his batting 
average and home run total after working with Harrison, who is modest about his 
role. 
</P>
<P>
 "I start out with the simple perspective that every athlete in the world wants 
the best equipment," Harrison said, "ranging from skis to boots to bats. But 
they also want the best physiology they can get, and vision is a crucial part 
of sports physiology. 
</P>
<P>
 "I point them in the right direction, and they do the rest."

 Kennedy McKinney bounced up from a fifth-round knockdown Saturday to win a 
majority decision over Welcome Ncita at South Padre Island, Tex., and retain 
the International Boxing Federation junior featherweight title he took from 
Ncita two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Judges Von La Prade and Barry Yeats favored McKinney, 117-110 and 117-111, 
respectively. Tobin Hansen scored it 114-114. 
</P>
<P>
 McKinney (27-0-1) said he wasn't bothered by the majority decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care if I only won by one point. I won," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 McKinney's strong jabs caused Ncita's left eye to swell early in the fifth 
round, and it plagued Ncita (33-2), a South African, for the rest of the fight.

THE NBA / MARK HEISLER; THERE WAS NO MAGIC FOR SOME BAD TEAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MARK HEISLER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael Jordan left, Magic Johnson returned but only for a month, and scoring 
fell off five points a team or 10 a game. There were no great teams but lots of 
awful ones. 
</P>
<P>
 On the bright side, TV ratings stayed up. If people sat still for this season, 
the future's so bright NBA execs have to wear shades 
</P>
<P>
 Where did all these skunks come from? 
</P>
<P>
 The Dallas Mavericks are about to become the first team to post consecutive 
70-loss seasons. Only two other teams had lost 70 games once, the 9-73 
Philadelphia 76ers in 1973 and the 12-70 Clippers in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Five teams won't hit .300, which may be great in baseball but is only 25-57 in 
an NBA season. 
</P>
<P>
 Three more won't win 30 games, which makes eight teams -- almost a third of 
the NBA -- a competitive write-off. 
</P>
<P>
 This and everything else including the killing of Cock Robin is usually blamed 
on expansion, but only one of these eight slugs joined the league in the 
expansion classes of 1988 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest bumbled their way to the bottom, some on age, most on merit. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting from the bottom: 
</P>
<P>
 Mavericks -- When the owner starts getting rid of everyone so he can bring 
back his original coach, who already has proven to be a pain there and 
everywhere he went thereafter, you glimpse the dimensions of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 That's just what's happening in Big D where Donald Carter, the 
well-meaning-but-a-tad-confused owner, sacked personnel director Rick Sund, 
booted General Manager Norm Sonju upstairs, is expected to ax 
all-world-disaster Coach Quinn Buckner . . . and wants to bring back Dick 
Motta. 
</P>
<P>
 Motta an old-school, bad-tempered tyrant who couldn't handle young players 10 
years ago when they weren't half the head cases they are now, doesn't want to 
be the new general manager but may consider coaching. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee Bucks -- They outsmarted people with an aging roster for years, then 
fell like a dead tree in a hurricane. Mike Dunleavy, who has the brains and the 
necessary long-term deal, backed up the truck but he's just starting. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota Timberwolves -- Mismanagement clinic, featuring woolly choices in 
coaches, starting with strung-out Bill Musselman, leading to Mr. Nice Guy, 
Sidney Lowe, whom temperamental young stars Christian Laettner and Isaiah 
Rider, trample daily. Owners Marv Wolfensen and Harvey Ratner incurred a 
$75-million cost overrun on a $50-million arena -- maybe they didn't need that 
health club? -- making the final tab $125 mil and a debt that has them 
threatening to move. Commissioner David Stern is trying to keep it together but 
everyone in the Twin Cities has had a bellyful of the T-Wolves. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit Pistons -- Marketing skill kept people coming and they just can't bear 
to actually tear it down and rebuild. So they'll be down that much longer. With 
Isiah Thomas moving upstairs, maybe they could make Bill Laimbeer coach as a 
public relations move. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington Bullets -- If it wasn't for bad luck, they wouldn't have any luck 
at all. Despite five straight lottery appearances, they haven't drafted better 
than fifth. The last time they were in the top three was 1968, when they took 
Wes Unseld, now the coach who's about to be booted upstairs. 
</P>
<P>
 76ers -- Years of owner Harold Katz's madcap deals and drafts -- remember 
Kenny Payne over Vlade Divac? -- cost them players like Brad Daugherty and 
Charles Barkley and cast them into the lottery until 1995, at least. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento Kings -- Should they have drafted Pervis Ellison? Should they have 
traded Ellison? Should they have drafted Dikembe Mutombo? What ever happened to 
Walt Williams? When are they going to get a break? 
</P>
<P>
 Clippers -- Another lost season. This year's team should have gone 41-41 by 
mistake. It might at least have finished strong but instead quit dead in its 
tracks. Management bought another two years by trading Danny Manning for 
34-year-old Dominique Wilkins but even if 'Nique and Ron Harper sign, is this a 
playoff team? Which of the present eight in the West can they beat out? What 
happens in two years? 
</P>
<P>
 Of such vision are losers made. I'D LIKE TO NOMINATE . . . ME! 
</P>
<P>
 Mutombo speaks five languages but the Nugget center must have missed a word or 
two of English, like, modesty.  
</P>
<P>
 Since he plays in the NBA where the rule is, "I'd be more modest if I wasn't 
so great," we'll forgive him this one. 
</P>
<P>
 Reward. This is something one earns with superior performance, rather than by 
asking for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign. This is a process through which one persuades others with logic and 
sentiment, rather than by threatening them. 
</P>
<P>
 Mutombo, an otherwise nice young man, now refers to himself as "a great 
defensive player" and demands to be enshrined as the NBA's defender of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 He leads the league in blocks, is praised by rival coaches such as Seattle's 
George Karl ("He must block seven a game against us") and even endorsed by a 
competitor, Hakeem Olajuwon ("He's got my vote.") 
</P>
<P>
 To Mutombo, that makes it unanimous. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there is no doubt in my mind, I have to win that thing," he said. "I 
deserve it. If I don't get it, I will tell the league to kiss my rear end. I 
will tell the media and the press. I don't know what else should I do to tell 
them I deserve the reward." 
</P>
<P>
 I can't think of anything. HE OBVIOUSLY FEELS ANOTHER BOOK COMING 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Riley's Knicks continue to swing from naught to juggernaut, losing eight 
of 12, winning 15 in a row, losing four of five. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley says it's that old menmotum. 
</P>
<P>
 "You won't find it in your dictionary," he says. "It's the reverse of 
momentum. You can never feel when menmotum will grab you around the throat 
because if just keeps subtly cropping up. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the last few games we'd won, we hadn't played as well as we could. When 
you tell guys they're doing something wrong while they're winning, they roll 
their eyes. But when you lose, they listen." 
</P>
<P>
 For those who insist on explanations using words found in the dictionary, try 
this: The Knicks overachieved for a month with a fantastic defensive effort and 
a weak schedule. (NBA streaks usually start with an opportunity granted by the 
schedule to build momentum.) Upon returning to earth, they missed the injured 
John Starks. How would a team averaging 96 points not miss a 19-point scorer? 
</P>
<P>
 Starks' rehab is ahead of schedule and he'll be back by the playoffs. 
Meanwhile, the Knicks and Atlanta Hawks face off for best record in the East 
Tuesday in the Garden. WAITING FOR MAGIC (ONE MORE TIME) 
</P>
<P>
 One step up. One step back. 
</P>
<P>
 We're doing the Magic Mambo. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so it was tough making up his mind. OK, so he passed out different hints 
different days, the kind of thing that can drive a general manager to 
distraction. 
</P>
<P>
 I think it's nice Johnson gives you a straight answer, even if he has a 
different answer to the same question a day later. He didn't ask to coach the 
Lakers. They asked him, after which he showed why it was a good idea, no matter 
how it turns out. 
</P>
<P>
 That's how it is with big guys, they have options. If the Lakers pursue Rick 
Pitino, he isn't going to say, "Really? Me? I'll be right out!" 
</P>
<P>
 He'll say "I've got the Hornets on the other line. How about 10 years at $25 
million and a say in personnel?" FACES AND FIGURES 
</P>
<P>
 OK, it was me: Ken Norman, who left the Clippers as a free agent, was so hated 
in Milwaukee, he tried to talk the Clippers into dealing for him. "I'm a much 
better player than I displayed and I'm a much better leader than I displayed. 
I'm somewhat embarrassed about the season. In fact, it's the biggest 
disapppointment in my life, the way the season has gone for me." . . . Orlando 
Magic players donned special T-shirts and did what Shaquille O'Neal called "the 
young guns' tribal dance" to celebrate making the playoffs for the first time. 
Said Jeff Turner, "The tribal dance was my signal to leave." Magic players then 
carried Coach Brian Hill off the floor. Said Dennis Scott, "We did that for B. 
You can open the paper and see where Don Nelson or some coach with a 
prestigious name should be our coach but we know Brian is the only coach for 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 Magic Johnson on Chris Webber, whom he befriended when Webber was an eighth 
grader: "The players are so different now. I was just hearing the other day 
Chris Webber was complaining about Don Nelson. I was thinking to myself, 'What 
do you want?' I've always thought of Don Nelson as a player's coach. He lets 
you run. He lets you shoot. What more do you want? And Nellie's a good guy, 
too. I just don't understand." Webber then went for 25 points, 10 rebounds and 
nine assists against the Lakers, proving that while youth may be inscrutable, 
it must also be served. 
</P>
<P>
 NBA types are advising Purdue's Glenn Robinson to declare for the draft -- 
whether he leaves school or not. He's guaranteed to be the top pick this year. 
Next year, he could conceivably go No. 2, behind Rasheed Wallace, or could get 
hurt and lose some value. . . . Ricky Pierce, the closest thing the Seattle 
SuperSonics have to a go-to guy, is back after having a spur shaved off the top 
of his left foot. However, Gary Payton and Kendall Gill blossomed with 
additional minutes and Coach George Karl must now find time for four guards. . 
. . Coach Phil Jackson admitted he'd thought his Chicago Bulls would win 49 
games this season. With a 4-1 finish, they will equal last season's 57. 
</P>
<P>
 Askia Jones of Kansas State, the son of former 76er Wali Jones, was the MVP at 
the Portsmouth, Va., tournament, the first of the pre-draft camps. The rest of 
the all-tourney team: Melvin Booker, Missouri; Lawrence Funderburke, Ohio 
State; Brooks Thompson, Oklahoma State, Dickey Simpkins, Providence; Travis 
Ford, Kentucky; Kendrick Warren, Virginia Commonwealth. Portsmouth is for 
relative unknowns and leads to invitations to the Phoenix camp in June. Most 
lottery picks won't attend any camp until the Chicago camp where they will only 
allow themselves to be measured and weighed. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota broadcaster Kevin McHale, a passionate Democrat, on turning down an 
invitation to meet President Bill Clinton: "I've had my experience with those 
Presidential things. We (the Boston Celtics) went to the White House after we 
won in 1984. It was about 150 degrees in the Rose Garden. (Ronald) Reagan came 
out and he mumbled something. Then he butchered (John) Havlicek's name. That 
was it for me."

HIS WRIST IS BAD, BUT WILKINS GOOD FOR A SMOOTH 42; PRO BASKETBALL: CLIPPERS 
HOLD OFF LAKER RALLY, MAKE UP FOR EMBARRASSMENT AGAINST SEATTLE, 108-103. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Dominique Wilkins of the Clippers almost didn't play in Saturday night's game 
against the Lakers because he had a sprained right wrist. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilkins decided to play after testing his wrist in pregame warm-ups. He 
was eager to play against the Lakers for the first time since he joined the 
Clippers, and he wanted to avenge Thursday's embarrassing 49-point loss at 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins scored a season-high 42 points as the Clippers held off the Lakers, 
108-103, Saturday night before a sellout crowd of 16,005 at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 One game after suffering the second-worst loss in franchise history, the 
Clippers (27-51) rebounded by beating the Lakers (33-45) for the second 
consecutive time after losing the first three games of the series this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It meant a lot to us to win this game and kind of redeem ourselves from the 
embarrassment we had in Seattle," Wilkins said. "This game was kind of special 
because we played so bad the last game." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins, who had shot only 36% in his last four games, didn't seem bothered by 
his sprained wrist. He made 16 of 30 shots, including the final two baskets of 
the game, as the Clippers ended a five-game losing streak and extended the 
Lakers' losing streak to a season-high six games. Wilkins also had 11 rebounds, 
two assists and two blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm surprised I was able to shoot the ball that well," Wilkins said. "But 
once you get into the thick of things, you have a way of forgetting about the 
pain." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins made a spectacular block of a Doug Christie shot, and guard Mark 
Jackson, who had 12 points and 12 assists, then fed Ron Harper, who had 19 
points, for a three-pointer with 1:41 left in the third quarter. The Clippers 
took an 86-70 lead into the fourth quarter. The Clippers held the Lakers, who 
shot only 20% in the third quarter, to 11 third-quarter points. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers, who trailed by 20 points with 10:13 remaining, outscored the 
Clippers, 26-12, to trim the Clipper lead to 102-96 with 3:09 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was happy about the effort," said Laker Coach Magic Johnson, who is 5-7 
since replacing Randy Pfund last month. "I told them if we had been playing 
like this all along, we would be in the playoffs. We fought back and played 
smart. That's all you can ask." 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing, 104-98, after Harper made a free throw, the Lakers cut it to 104-103 
after Nick Van Exel, who had a team-high 28 points, made a three-pointer and 
Tony Smith made a jumper with 1:22 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Guard George Lynch then stole a Harper pass, but Van Exel shot an airball on a 
drive and Wilkins blocked a desperation jumper by Kurt Rambis as the shot clock 
expired with 46 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt it leaving my hand and slip a little bit," Van Exel said. "I didn't 
get the full release I wanted, so I knew it was going to be short." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins then made a jumper with 25.4 seconds left for 106-103 and dunked after 
Van Exel missed another shot. Clipper-Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Laker rookie forward Antonio Harvey left the game with 6:56 remaining in the 
first half with a rapid heartbeat and was taken to Centinela Hospital Medical 
Center for observation. Harvey, who experienced similar problems in college, 
was expected to spend the night in the hospital. . . . Laker forward James 
Worthy didn't play. It was only the second time in Worthy's career that he 
didn't play in a game because of a coaches' decision. "It wasn't that tough," 
Worthy said. "I kind of understood before the game that it would be limited 
minutes, if anything." . . . Clipper forward John Williams, who had sat out the 
last five games because of a small fracture of his left ankle, had 11 points, 
two rebounds and four assists in 33 minutes.

NBA ROUNDUP; SEATTLE RECORDS 60TH VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Seattle SuperSonics posted their NBA-best 60th victory Saturday, defeating 
the Houston Rockets, 100-97, at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a nice history to winning 60 games," Coach George Karl said. "Only 35 
teams have ever done it. To do it against Houston is even more important." 
</P>
<P>
 Shawn Kemp had 22 points and 17 rebounds and Gary Payton added 21 points as 
the SuperSonics became the 36th team in league history to win as many as 60 
games in a season. They won their fifth in a row and 14th in 15 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 35 clubs to have won 60 games, 17 went on to win the NBA championship. 
The 1991-92 Chicago Bulls were the last team to win 60 games en route to the 
NBA title. 
</P>
<P>
 The SuperSonics moved within one victory -- or a Houston loss -- of getting 
home-court advantage throughout the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Hakeem Olajuwon scored 31 points and Vernon Maxwell 30 for the Rockets, who 
have 56 victories and the league's second-best record. The Rockets had a 
six-game winning streak ended. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 123, Philadelphia 94 -- Andrew Lang matched his season high with 20 
points at Atlanta, including eight during a decisive 26-8 first-half run, to 
help the Hawks take over first place in the Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawks' 12th victory in 15 games and fourth in a row moved them a half-game 
ahead of New York and one game ahead of Chicago in the race for the best record 
in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix 96, San Antonio 94 -- Charles Barkley scored 26 points and Kevin 
Johnson had 16 points and 16 assists to lead the Suns at Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 A.C. Green, who scored 23 points, gave the Suns the lead for good with a 
three-point play with 1:38 left. The Spurs' Negele Knight missed a 
three-pointer with 4.1 seconds left, and Willie Anderson's reverse layup rimmed 
out at the buzzer. David Robinson had 39 points, 15 rebounds and seven assists 
for San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden State 109, Utah 105 -- Chris Mullin scored 28 points and Latrell scored 
18 of his 25 in the fourth quarter as the Warriors won at Oakland to give Don 
Nelson his 800th coaching victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento 106, Dallas 98 -- Spud Webb scored 26 points to lead the Kings at 
Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 91, Milwaukee 90 -- Chris Mills' rebound basket at the buzzer gave 
the Cavaliers the victory at Milwaukee.

TRACK AND FIELD / MT. SAC RELAYS; GRANVILLE'S TALENT SEEMS UNLIMITED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD, TIMES PREP SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Already established as the top high school 800-meter runner in the nation, 
Michael Granville showed he is capable of much more at the Mt. San Antonio 
College Relays in Walnut on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bell Gardens High sophomore altered his routine by dropping the 800 in 
favor of the 400 and 200 at the biggest meet of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Before 7,000, Granville did not disappoint. He started the day by winning the 
400 in 46.67 seconds, the nation's fastest prep time this year. He followed 
that with a strong third-place finish in the 200 in 21.75. 
</P>
<P>
 The performance came one week after Granville won the 800 at the Arcadia 
Invitational in a season-best 1:51.90. 
</P>
<P>
 What's next? 
</P>
<P>
 "I still have not decided what I want to run in the league finals, so I'm 
trying different events," said Granville, who occasionally runs the 100 as 
well. "Track is fun for me, so I don't want to limit myself to one event." 
</P>
<P>
 Granville said he was not disappointed by his finish in the 200. Pat Johnson 
of Redlands, who won the race in 21.03, and Bryan Howard of Moreno Valley 
Canyon Springs, who finished second in 21.22, are two of the nation's top 
sprinters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good experience to run against guys of that caliber," Granville said. 
"It can only make me stronger." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson and Howard continued their season rivalry, which started three weeks 
ago at the Inland Empire Championships at UC Riverside. Johnson won the 100 and 
200 that day, establishing the nation's fastest prep times in both events. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard skipped the 100 Saturday, and Johnson finished second in 10.62 behind 
Marques Holiwell of Bakersfield West, who ran a 10.57. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 200, Johnson relied on a strong kick to come from behind with 15 meters 
to go. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most exciting events of the meet was the boys' high jump, won by 
Jeremy Fischer of Camarillo at 7 feet 3 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer and Art Lloyd of Rialto Eisenhower cleared 7-2, but Lloyd missed three 
attempts at 7-3 and Fischer cleared it on his third jump. 
</P>
<P>
 The Camarillo senior then moved the bar to 7-5 1/2, which would have been a 
national high school record. Although close on his first jump, he missed all 
three attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very proud that I am consistently jumping 7-2 and 7-3 this season," 
Fischer said. "I'm getting a little closer to the national record, but that 
will come in time." 
</P>
<P>
 National sprint leader Andrea Anderson of Long Beach Poly followed up an 
impressive performance at Arcadia with another strong day. The junior won the 
100 in 11.86 and anchored the team's 800-meter relay, which recorded the 
third-fastest time ever in 1:36.77.

<P>
 For the first time in five USAC Western States Midget races, someone other 
than Page Jones or Tony Stewart won a main event. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix resident Billy Boat won the 30-lap feature race at Ventura Raceway on 
Saturday night, with some help from Lady Luck and Val Verde resident Jay Drake. 
</P>
<P>
 After running neck and neck with Stewart for most of the race, Boat managed to 
put a couple of car lengths between himself and the current Midget points 
leader from Indianapolis when Simi Valley's Rick Hendrix flipped on lap 28 in 
the fourth turn in front of Jones and Ron (Sleepy) Tripp. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones and Tripp were forced from the race and Stewart closed the gap during 
the caution period. 
</P>
<P>
 When racing resumed, Stewart slipped past Boat, but Drake flipped in almost 
the same spot as Hendrix did, bringing out another caution flag and nullifying 
the lap. Boat held on the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's just a part of the game," Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending champion Robbie Flock of Temecula finished fourth in the main event 
and won the 12-lap semi-main. 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Hart of Ventura won the 20-lap three-quarter Midget main event and 
Frazier Park's Ted Miller took the eight-lap semi-main.

<P>
 Defending Sportsman champion Pat Mintey Jr. made it three straight victories 
to start the season by winning the 40-lap main event Saturday night in front of 
3,335 at Saugus Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancaster resident started on the outside of the first row, but moved 
ahead of pole-sitter Lee Ladd of Thousand Oaks on the opening lap before 
pulling away. 
</P>
<P>
 Ladd held on for second, followed by Craig Rayburn of Santa Clarita and Gary 
Sigman of Carson. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Street Stock oval, John Schultz of Valencia took advantage of several 
mistakes by the leaders in the 25-lap oval main event and turned it into his 
third victory in as many races this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've just tried to be patient and let the race come to me," Schultz said. "I 
try to let the race develop and avoid problems ahead of me." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Gilmore of Van Nuys led early in the race, but lost his position when he 
and Valencia's Dana Moore made contact on the 13th lap. Moore was black-flagged 
and sent to the pits, enabling Schultz to inherit the top spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Benner of Whittier provided the final obstacle, shadowing Schultz the 
final five laps. "Greg put up a good fight," Schultz said. "I got a little 
loose at the end, but was able to hold my line." 
</P>
<P>
 Benner was second, followed by Kirk Miller of Alta Loma and Frank Debiasio of 
Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 20-lap Mini Stock feature race, John Petsco of Newbury Park notched a 
runaway victory.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; GALARRAGA ENDS SLUMP IN GRAND STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Andres Galarraga, the National League batting champion last season, ended a 
troubling slump with a grand slam in the seventh inning Saturday, powering the 
Colorado Rockies to a 7-3 victory over the Montreal Expos at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockies rallied from a 3-2 deficit with a five-run seventh, capped by 
Galarraga's blow, to extend their winning streak to three games. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberto Mejia led off the seventh with a triple against Ken Hill (2-1) and 
scored on Walt Weiss' single. The Rockies loaded the bases and Galarraga 
cleared them with his home run against reliever Mel Rojas. Galarraga, who 
played seven seasons with the Expos, has hit two of his four grand slams 
against his former team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure I get more emotional when I play against Montreal," Galarraga said. 
"I think everybody -- when you get traded or released -- wants to play harder 
against their old team, to show them they made a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 Galarraga, who hit .370 last season, had singled in the sixth to end an 
0-for-16 slump that dropped his average to .275. He struck out eight times 
during his hitless streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Reed (1-1) pitched a hitless seventh for the victory, and Bruce Ruffin 
and Darren Holmes finished up. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 9, Houston 1 -- Dwight Gooden, sidelined since opening day because of 
a toe injury, pitched six shutout innings for the Mets at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Gooden (2-0) gave up four hits, struck out five and walked three. He had not 
pitched since hurting himself in a victory over the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley 
Field. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Maddux went three innings for his second save of the season. He gave up 
one hit, a solo home run by Steve Finley in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Hundley, David Segui and Ryan Thompson each drove in two runs. The Mets 
had 11 hits against three pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 4, Chicago 1 -- Kent Mercker, pitching eight days after his no-hitter 
against the Dodgers, came back with seven strong innings at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercker (2-0), the Braves' No. 5 starter, gave up one run and six hits -- 
including a single by Ryne Sandberg, the Cubs' second batter of the game. He 
struck out eight and walked three. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory improved the Braves' record to 11-1 overall, 9-0 on the road. Greg 
McMichael worked the ninth for his third save. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Pendleton doubled to left-center after a single by Ryan Klesko and walk 
to Fred McGriff in the fourth, giving the Braves a 2-0 lead against Willie 
Banks (1-2). 
</P>
<P>
 Florida 5, San Francisco 3 -- Bret Barberie hit a home run and pinch-hitter 
Jerry Browne added a run-scoring single in the eighth inning for the Marlins at 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 With the score tied, 3-3, and one out in the eighth, Barberie homered against 
Rich Monteleone (1-1) to give the Marlins the lead. One out later, Kurt Abbott 
doubled and scored on Browne's pinch-hit single to make the score 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Marlin reliever Jeremy Hernandez (1-1) gave up a leadoff triple in the eighth 
to Matt Williams, but stranded him at third by striking out Barry Bonds and 
retiring Royce Clayton and Kirt Manwaring. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryan Harvey gave up two singles in the ninth but got Williams on a groundout 
for his third save. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 6, Cincinnati 4 -- Danny Jackson pitched 6 2/3 strong innings and 
Darren Daulton hit a home run for the Phillies at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson (1-0) gave up two runs and six hits, and got his 1,000th strikeout by 
fanning Brian Dorsett in the second inning. He walked three and struck out 
four. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson left in the seventh with runners on first and second. Heathcliff 
Slocumb came in and threw a wild pitch, advancing both runners, but struck out 
Reggie Sanders to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Jones got the final three outs for his third save, despite giving up a 
run-scoring single to Kevin Mitchell in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego 8, St. Louis 2 -- Wally Whitehurst lasted beyond the fifth inning 
for the first time this season and Dave Staton hit a two-run home run at St. 
Louis to help the Padres end a six-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitehurst (1-2), who had not pitched more than 4 2/3 innings in his two 
previous starts, gave up one run and seven hits in ending the Cardinals' 
three-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Gregg Jefferies went four for five with a double for St. Louis.

STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS; BRUINS USE POWER PLAY TO BEAT CANADIENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mariusz Czerkawski, who was playing in Sweden two weeks ago, had a goal and an 
assist. Al Iafrate, obtained last month in a trade, contributed excellent 
defense and solid checking. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was the return of a familiar player, Ray Bourque, that turned the 
Bruins from a ragged regular-season team into a solid playoff unit as Boston 
opened its series against Montreal with a 3-2 victory Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Bourque, who sat out the last 11 games of the regular season because of a knee 
injury, had two assists against the Canadiens and helped stabilize a power play 
that was struggling coming into the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins, who scored on only two of their final 39 power plays during the 
regular season, got all three of their goals against Montreal with a man 
advantage -- including goals by Adam Oates and Ted Donato only 51 seconds apart 
late in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
 Bourque said Iafrate's crunching hits in the Bruins' defensive end disrupted 
the Canadiens' attack and also credited him for the power-play success. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we worked well on the power play tonight," said Bourque, whose two 
assists tied him for ninth in career playoff assists with former Canadien Jean 
Beliveau with 97. "With a guy with that much ability and his talent, things are 
going to happen for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Boston plays host to Montreal on Monday night in Game 2 of the opening-round 
series. The Bruins have defeated the Canadiens in four of their last five 
playoff series. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory broke a Boston streak of eight consecutive playoff losses. The 
Bruins were eliminated in four straight by Pittsburgh in the second round in 
1992 and in four games by Buffalo in the first round last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Al (Iafrate) and Eric Lindros are the two biggest, strongest men in the 
league. When you make them a little bit ornery, they become a little bit bigger 
and a little bit stronger," Boston Coach Brian Sutter said. "But it was good to 
have Raymond (Bourque) back there. He kept it simple, and we did what we had to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Bellows and Mike Keane scored for Montreal, which won only one of its 
final 10 road games during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the loss, Patrick Roy was magnificent in goal for Montreal. He made 
four excellent saves in the second period, including a stop against Oates on a 
breakaway and a follow shot by Glen Wesley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Patrick can't be faulted. They scored on a five-on-three (advantage) and I 
think the winning goal was picked up in the air," said Montreal Coach Jacques 
Demers. "We had our chances, but we didn't put the puck in the net. It's not 
that this team was outplayed."

BASEBALL'S BIGGEST NIGHTMARE: STRIKE FIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD BLUM, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Under the idyllic sun of spring training, no one wants to think about it, much 
less talk about it. At a time of hope, it's baseball's worst nightmare: Strike 
Five. 
</P>
<P>
 "The newspapers have been filled with threats to do that," says Richard 
Ravitch, the owners' labor negotiator. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't confront that until you have to, and we're a very long way from 
doing that," players' association head Donald Fehr says. 
</P>
<P>
 The collective bargaining agreement signed after a 32-day lockout in 1990 
expired last Dec. 31. While owners agreed not to lock out players this year, 
the union is considering a protective strike during the second half of the 
season to prevent owners from unilaterally implementing a salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 "Worrying about impending crises is something we'd rather not get into now," 
says Milwaukee Brewers president Bud Selig, chairman of the ruling executive 
council. "There's so much optimism, the spring is filled with that, you hate to 
see any negative talk now. We have a lot of momentum building, we're coming off 
a great year attendance-wise, we have the new stadiums, the expanded playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr has spoken to every major league team in Florida and Arizona this spring, 
warning players that a strike is a "real possibility." Players want to continue 
the system that pushed the average salary $1,076,089 last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd like to think this might be a year we could avoid problems, but it may 
not work out that way," Atlanta pitcher Tom Glavine says. "It doesn't sound 
good, from what I've heard." 
</P>
<P>
 There have been seven work stoppages in a 22-year span: strikes in 1972, 1980, 
1981 and 1985, and lockouts in 1973, 1976 and 1990. Owners are insisting that 
players agree to a salary cap, and that's likely to cause a confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 Management financial documents show collective profits dropped to $22.2 
million in 1992 from $99 million the previous year, and Ravitch predicts a $140 
million loss when 1993 is added up. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like they're saying a lot of the same things they've said before," 
Todd Zeile of the St. Louis Cardinals said. "I guess we'd hoped to hear 
something more after so long." 
</P>
<P>
 Owners, deeply divided into labor hawks and doves, voted in December 1992 to 
reopen the collective bargaining agreement's key components. After two 
negotiating sessions the following month, they recessed talks to discuss a new 
revenue sharing plan themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, after a year of internal debate, owners finally passed a revenue 
sharing plan but made it subject to the union agreeing to a salary cap. Fehr 
says that for players to seriously consider a cap, owners must both show 
financial need and agree to share decision-making. 
</P>
<P>
 "The owners have reopened; they've had 15, almost 16 months to get ready to 
bargain after they reopened," Fehr says. "As of now, we have no indication when 
or if the owners will make a proposal or tell us what they want to do other 
than utter the word salary cap. It appears it will be a long negotiation and a 
difficult one." 
</P>
<P>
 If players allow the season to finish without an agreement, owners could 
declare they've bargained to an impasse, then impose a salary cap that could 
gut free agency and salary arbitration next winter. In that scenario, players 
couldn't take any action until spring training 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody cares if you strike in November," Fehr says. "It would therefore be 
doubtful that the union would very easily put itself in that position." 
</P>
<P>
 Not much bargaining is taking place. Ravitch wants the union to give cost 
certainty and saw how much it will cost owners to play ball in 1995. Fehr wants 
owners to make a proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't predict what's going to happen," Ravitch says. "I hope they're 
serious, good faith bargaining sessions and I expect to do serious work with 
Don and his colleagues." 
</P>
<P>
 If so, they would be the first in baseball history. The historical pattern is 
for bargaining to begin only after one side sets a deadline for a work 
stoppage. 
</P>
<P>
 Ravitch says he doesn't think owners would avoid a confrontation by extending 
the current agreement for one more offseason. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expect we'll have a contract by the end of this season," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, players and their agents are preparing for another war. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm building a new house," Gregg Jefferies of the Cardinals says. "If there's 
a work stoppage, I'm going to stop building that house."

HORSE RACING; DEEP IN THE HEART OF A WHOLE DIFFERENT RACETRACK WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW BEYER, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the steel framework of Sam Houston Race Park was being erected, the 
management of Texas' first major league track was making plans to advertise and 
sell boxes and luxury suites. This wasn't necessary. Before it could even print 
the brochures, the track was deluged with inquiries and requests, and it sold 
all 19 of the suites, at prices from $45,000 to $65,000 a season, with a 
minimum three-year lease. The boxes, priced at an average of $10,000 a season, 
sold out too. 
</P>
<P>
 When he observed this response, General Manager Jim Murphy was astonished. He 
had come to Houston from Maryland's Rosecroft Raceway, and had previously 
operated Atlantic City Race Track, and in those oversatured markets it is a 
constant struggle for racetracks to attract customers. But Texas is a whole 
different world. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have been waiting for years for horses to come here," Murphy said. 
"There's a lot of pent-up demand. Racing hasn't experienced anything like this 
in a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, there is so much enthusiasm for the sport that some people with 
Texas-size optimism think their state could one day challenge California as the 
nation's No. 1 racing center. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Houston Park is scheduled to open April 29, and a full-fledged state 
racing circuit will exist when tracks in Dallas and San Antonio begin operating 
in 1995. But the immense possibilities of Texas racing have been evident for 
decades -- even before parimutuel wagering was legalized. 
</P>
<P>
 Horses have always been an integral part of the state's history and culture. 
Texas ranks fourth in the nation in the production of thoroughbred foals, and 
tbe state is the home of many of the country's most prominent horse owners. 
Texans like to gamble too. 
</P>
<P>
 "This state is like Kentucky," Murphy said. "Here, betting the horses is not 
something you have to apologize for." 
</P>
<P>
 In order to play the horses, Texans were forced to travel to neighboring 
states, and their money fueled the prosperity of Oaklawn Park in Arkansas, 
Remington Park in Oklahoma and Louisiana Downs. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas finally legalized parimutuel betting in 1987, but the tax on wagering 
was set so high that there was no way for a prospective investor to build an 
expensive track and hope to make a profit. Two minor tracks, Trinity Meadows 
and Bandera Downs, did open, and they generated respectable business despite 
their primitive facilities. When the state's tax laws were changed, however, 
groups of investors moved rapidly to develop tracks in three cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Political infighting and lawsuits delayed the opening of the biggest market, 
Dallas, enabling Houston to break out of the starting gate first. The $85 
million Sam Houston Park is fairly modest in size, but it is going to be a 
first-class facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I walked through it," said Steve Davidowitz, turf writer for the Houston 
Post, "I kept thinking 'That's smart' or 'That looks good' whenever I looked 
around. There's a video-replay library and plenty of table spaces for 
horseplayers. There are groups of television monitors that show the races, 
replays and odds, and they're set up so you can see them when you approach the 
betting windows." 
</P>
<P>
 But Sam Houston Park will have an even more important enticement for bettors: 
It will have horses in abundance. Racetracks from coast to coast have been 
plagued by a thoroughbred shortage that makes their races unattractive as 
betting propositions. 
</P>
<P>
 But so many owners and trainers are eager to race in Texas that the Houston 
track's racing secretary had the luxury of sifting through 4,500 applications 
for the 1,200 available stall spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 The quality of the horses in Texas is almost certain to become stronger in the 
coming years. Jeff Hooper, executive director of the Texas Thoroughbred 
Breeders Assn., said people in the state are already responding to the vision 
of a prosperous state racing circuit. "People are putting money back into the 
game and buying higher-quality mares," he said. "Among breeders, the enthusiasm 
level is now at an all-time high." 
</P>
<P>
 It is the prospect of a Texas racing circuit that gives the sport its most 
exciting possibilities. If the three major tracks can agree on a racing 
schedule (which, so far, they haven't), they can operate virtually year round, 
with each track simulcasting to the other two. 
</P>
<P>
 And when Texas legalizes off-track betting (which hasn't happened yet but is 
seen as inevitable), the possibilities are almost unlimited. Murphy cites this 
statistic: There are 21 cities that have populations of more than 100,000 and 
which are more than an hour away from one of Texas's three major tracks. This 
is the reason that one state racing official said that "when God invented OTB, 
he had Texas in mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Skeptics may note that the opening of a new track is always accompanied by a 
flush of optimism -- and that it is often followed by a confrontation with 
harsh economic reality. The last two big tracks built in this country, 
Canterbury Downs and Birmingham, both launched their operations amid much 
fanfare, and both eventually went broke. Even so, Texas' situation is so unique 
it seems almost certain that April 29, 1994, opening day at Sam Houston Race 
Park, will mark the start of an important new era in the sport.

FISCHER MISSES CHANCES TO CLIMB TO NEW HEIGHTS; TRACK AND FIELD: HE CLEARS 7-3 
TO WIN AT MT. SAC RELAYS BUT FAILS TO SET STATE OR NATIONAL RECORD. 
</P>

<P>
 The state record in the boys' high jump appeared to be in jeopardy, but Jeremy 
Fischer of Camarillo High decided to hunt bigger game in the Mt. San Antonio 
College Relays on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 After watching Fischer clear a meet record of 7 feet 3 inches on his third 
attempt, most fans expected the Wisconsin-bound senior to have the bar raised 
to 7-4 3/4 or 7-5, which would surpass the state record of 7-4 1/2 set by 
Maurice Crumby of San Francisco Balboa in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer had the same thought initially, but the national high school 
federation record -- a fancy name for the highest mark ever produced in a high 
school meet -- of 7-5 1/4 beckoned, so he had the bar raised to 7-5 1/2 before 
missing three times at that height. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were going to go 7-5, but then we figured if I'm going to clear 7-5, I'm 
going to clear 7-5 1/2," Fischer said. "It wasn't like a half-inch was going to 
make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Turns out it might have made all the difference necessary for a state record 
as Fischer's first miss at 7-5 1/2 looked as though it might have been 
successful at 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like I had a good jump at 7-5 1/2," Fischer said. "I just wish my 
(clearance at 7-3) had been at 7-5 1/2." 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer had a couple of inches to spare when he scaled 7-3, but that turned 
out to be his best technical jump of the meet, prompting Camarillo Coach Dennis 
Riedmiller to plan ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next time he gets up that high, the bar's going to 7-5," Riedmiller said. 
"I want to see him get that state record, then we can worry about the national 
mark." 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Lloyd of Rialto Eisenhower equaled his personal best of 7-2 to finish 
second, but Fischer took the lead in the competition when he cleared 7-0 on his 
second attempt and Lloyd needed three tries.  
</P>
<P>
 Fischer made 7-2 on his second attempt while Lloyd cleared that height on his 
third. 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer's performance, which made him the first three-time winner of the boys' 
high jump, was one of 10 victories by local performers. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolores Tuimoloau of Channel Islands, Jason Medearis of Hart and Jamaal Chase 
of Quartz Hill were the most impressive of the others. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuimoloau won the girls' shotput with a regional record and state-leading mark 
of 47-0 1/4 to avenge last week's loss to Gina Heads of Newport Harbor in the 
Arcadia Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
 Heads edged Tuimoloau by 3 3/4 inches at Arcadia, but was a distant third at 
44-2 this time. Suzie Shanley of Tulare Union finished second at 44-4 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 "Losing actually might have helped me," Tuimoloau said. "Until then, I had 
been basically competing against myself all season. Losing there let me know 
that there are some other good throwers out there. That I have to keep pushing 
myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Medearis was expected to renew his rivalry with Kenny Haslip of Pasadena Muir 
in the boys' 110-meter high hurdles and 300 intermediates, but when Mustang 
Coach Clyde Turner decided to give his team a much-needed rest, Medearis 
assumed the role of favorite and responded with winning times of 14.13 seconds 
in the highs and 37.76 in the intermediates. 
</P>
<P>
 Medearis overtook fast-starting Tyson Murphy (14.25) of Santa Monica at the 
seventh flight of hurdles in the highs, then withstood a late rush by Bryan 
Jones (14.17) of Arroyo Grande. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach Poly freshman Kenyon Rambo (38.09) ran even with Medearis for the 
first six flights of the intermediates before the Indian senior pulled away in 
the homestretch. 
</P>
<P>
 Chase leaped 23-4 3/4 to remain undefeated in the long jump and bounded 48-2 
1/2 in the triple jump to turn back Arcadia champion Von Ware (48-0 1/2) of 
Vista Rancho Buena Vista. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks boys were victorious in the distance medley and 6,400-meter 
relays. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancer foursome of Kevin Marsden, Rob Scherrei, Chadd Aldrich and Jeff 
Fischer timed 10 minutes 29.41 seconds in the distance medley and Marsden, 
Aldrich, Brandon Del Campo and Fischer ran the 6,400 in 17:42.54. Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Already established as the top high school 800-meter runner in the nation, 
Michael Granville showed he is capable of much more. The sophomore from Bell 
Gardens High altered his routine by dropping the 800 in favor of the 400 and 
200 at the biggest meet of the season thus far. Before 7,000, Granville did not 
disappoint. He started the day by winning the 400 in 46.67 seconds, the 
nation's fastest prep time this year. He followed that with a strong 
third-place finish in the 200 in 21.75. The performance came one week after 
Granville won the 800 at the Arcadia Invitational in a season-best 1:51.90. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Johnson of Redlands won the 200 in 21.03, and Bryan Howard of Moreno 
Valley Canyon Springs was second in 21.22. Marques Holiwell of Bakersfield West 
won the 100 in 10.57. 
</P>
<P>
 National sprint leader Andrea Anderson of Long Beach Poly won the 100 in 11.86 
and anchored the team's 800-meter relay, which recorded the third-fastest time 
ever in 1:36.77.

 Hawaii, fielding a team of gap hitters, found all the alleys Saturday night 
and rolled to a 13-7 victory over Cal State Northridge in a Western Athletic 
Conference game before 2,956 at Rainbow Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawaii (23-20, 5-9 in conference play) jumped to a 2-0 lead in the second 
against Aaron D'Aoust on doubles by Jason Ross and Sy Farinas. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third, Corey Ishigo's double to right-center drove in two runs as 
Hawaii scored four times for a 6-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge had beaten Hawaii seven consecutive times entering the game, but 
managed only one hit through three innings.STEVE ELLING

VALLEY SHAKES OFF BATTING SLUMP, SENDS GLENDALE REELING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Coming off a two-game drought in which it had scored only four runs, Valley 
College broke out of it Saturday with a 14-6 victory over Glendale in a Western 
State Conference South Division game at Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley (10-15-1, 8-9 in conference play) stayed within shouting distance of 
division leaders Pierce and Bakersfield, both of which entered Saturday night's 
head-to-head contest at Bakersfield with 10-6 records. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley got the job done with a 14-hit attack that included five doubles and a 
home run. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had been struggling with the bat," Coach Chris Johnson said. "We were able 
to stay calm today when we were down and we didn't panic. It was nice to see." 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale (10-16-1, 8-8-1) jumped to a 4-0 lead against right-hander Doug Rubin 
(2-1) with one run in the first and three in the second, including a solo home 
run by first baseman Robb Turner over the 380-foot sign in left-center field 
with one out in the second. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Monarchs bounced back with three in the bottom of the inning against 
left-hander John Nall (4-4), sparked by a two-run double by catcher Amani Smith 
(two for three and four runs)  
</P>
<P>
 After scoring two in the third on run-scoring doubles by David Stevenson and 
Marlon Hamilton, the Monarchs broke open the game with five runs in the fourth 
on four hits and three errors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want our team, under any circumstances, to keep going, to keep fighting," 
Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 A double by Ed Gillis and an infield hit by Randy Vickers gave Glendale a run 
in the fourth and the Vaqueros scored another in the seventh on a sacrifice fly 
by Armando Mesa that drove in Steve Mikesell. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley chased Nall in the seventh when right fielder Will Skett homered to 
left with Smith aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Skett, a redshirt freshman from Reseda High, also had a two-run double in the 
eighth and was four for five with five runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin, a converted catcher, settled down after a shaky start and made it into 
the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley second baseman Jorge Dorado was three for six.

MOORPARK TAKES CARE OF NO. 1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Moorpark is a sleepy little town west of Simi Valley, right? On Saturday, Simi 
Valley played quietly while Moorpark became Boomtown. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark High's baseball team, hailing from the small-school Frontier League, 
got 10 hits and a complete game from an improbable starter to beat big Simi 
Valley, 9-5, and win the championship of the Camarillo tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley, the Big Maroon Machine, is ranked No. 1 in the Valley by The 
Times and returned key players from its 1993 team that reached the Southern 
Section Division I final. Losing pitcher Bill Scheffels is one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 The Musketeers? They are unranked and entered the season as an unknown 
quantity in Division IV. Both teams are 13-3. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I went to sleep last night, this was on my mind," said Moorpark's Jason 
Adamson, his voice shaking with emotion. "I thought we had a legitimate chance, 
but this is one of the greatest feelings of my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Adamson bashed a 360-foot triple to right-center field, then scored on winning 
pitcher Ryan Huisenga's single in the bottom of the sixth inning to make it 
9-4. Adamson went two for three, scored two runs and drove in two. Huisenga was 
also two for three and drove in a run. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach David Rhoades was more concerned with Huisenga's arm than his bat, 
however. The junior right-hander had no starts, only 10 innings of work, a 5.13 
earned-run average and -- after throwing 30 pitches and spotting Simi Valley a 
2-0 lead in the first -- a tired arm. 
</P>
<P>
 But fatigue made Huisenga's fastball sink and kept the Pioneers scoreless in 
the third, fourth, fifth and sixth innings. Huisenga (1-0) wasn't fazed when 
Ryan Hankins (three for three, three RBIs) homered with one out in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 Huisenga struck out Scheffels and got Brian Kavanagh to fly to center for the 
final two outs. "I just put Hankins' home run out of my mind," Huisenga said. 
"By then, I knew we were going to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark tied the score, 2-2, in the bottom of the first on Craig Weaver's 
check-swing single to left. The Pioneers led, 4-2, after the top of the second. 
But Bill Finnerty's two-run double in the bottom of the second highlighted a 
three-run rally. 
</P>
<P>
 The Musketeers added two in the third and two in the sixth as Scheffels (5-1) 
labored, walking seven and throwing 127 pitches.

CSUN'S VASEY WINS, BUT KERNEN AT A LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The coach looked for the words to explain how right-hander Brian Vasey, 
normally a utility man for Cal State Northridge, came to be inserted into the 
starting rotation. 
</P>
<P>
 Try desperation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was pretty much out of necessity," Coach Bill Kernen said. "Who else do we 
have?" 
</P>
<P>
 Friday night, Vasey and a couple of runs were all Kernen needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasey, starting because of injuries to two Northridge pitchers, helped the 
Matadors shock Hawaii, 2-1, in a Western Athletic Conference game before a 
capacity crowd of 2,673 at Rainbow Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasey's eight-hitter was so improbably impressive that Kernen struggled to 
find words to properly frame it. His memory was on full scan. At one point, he 
actually stammered. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, I watch Hawaii games on TV all the time," Kernen said. "I don't 
ever remember anybody coming into Rainbow Stadium and winning, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a major, significant performance." 
</P>
<P>
 Vasey, making only his third pitching appearance since his senior year at Simi 
Valley High in 1991, responded to every daunting challenge -- and there were 
plenty. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasey surrendered a one-out triple to Shawn Rogers with one out in the ninth 
with the Matadors leading by a run.  
</P>
<P>
 It was starting to look like a replay of Vasey's tough no-decision against 
Long Beach State on April 4, when the bullpen blew a four-run lead in the 
ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't really scared," Vasey said.  
</P>
<P>
 "There wasn't a doubt in my mind that we weren't going to win. I wasn't gonna 
allow us to lose." 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't. Vasey (1-0) blew two wicked split-finger fastballs past first 
baseman Chris Garnett, then retired him on an popup.  
</P>
<P>
 Tyler Cheff, who already had two of Hawaii's hits, skied to second to end it. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasey, who threw 108 pitches, walked one and struck out five. 
</P>
<P>
 He was matched almost every step of the way by Bobby Moore, a 6-foot-6 
right-hander who pitched a four-hitter, struck out 10 and gave up one earned 
run. From the start, though, it wasn't his night. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge center fielder Joey Arnold, the game's second batter, lined a shot 
that left fielder Kirk Taguchi misplayed for a two-base error and scored on a 
single by Jason Shanahan. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore (6-4) walked only two batters, both in the fifth, and it cost him the 
ballgame. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Howard walked to lead off and was sacrificed to second by Tyler Nelson. 
After a walk to Jonathan Campbell, freshman catcher Eric Gillespie drilled a 
run-scoring single into center for a 2-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way they were throwing, I went up there figuring that (Howard) could be 
the run that decided it," Gillespie said. "I definitely wasn't thinking, 'Oh, 
it's just another at-bat.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge (20-20, 8-5 in conference play) managed one hit thereafter as Moore 
retired 14 of the last 15 batters. 
</P>
<P>
 As solid as Vasey was on the hill, the defense was afield.  
</P>
<P>
 With Hawaii (22-20, 4-9) trailing by a run in the third inning, Taguchi 
singled to center to drive in Sy Farinas from third. Jaime Ahu attempted to 
score from second on the play, but was shot down at home by Arnold. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell, the left fielder, made the defensive play of the year in the eighth 
when Taguchi sent a high fly into foul territory.  
</P>
<P>
 Campbell bolted across the foul stripe and plowed into a chest-high chain-link 
fence as he caught the ball, then bounced backward onto his wallet. The 
spectacular play made several TV highlight reels. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors moved to within one-half game of first-place San Diego State (8-4 
in conference) in the WAC West Division standings. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that Northridge satisfied its initial goal of winning at least once in 
Hawaii, Vasey had a hankering for more. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just the first one," Vasey said. "I hate losing. I want all three."

THE HIGH SCHOOLS / KENNEDY COSGROVE; PULLED MUSCLE PUT SCARE INTO WORLEY, 
SCOUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNEDY COSGROVE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Quartz Hill High pitcher Roger Worley received a double jolt when he unleashed 
a hard fastball Tuesday against Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior right-hander felt a sharp pain in his elbow and his fingers started 
tingling, and he was immediately removed. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most pain was mental. 
</P>
<P>
 "It scared me so bad," Worley said. "I've heard so many stories about guys 
blowing out their arm on one pitch." 
</P>
<P>
 Worley has more to worry about than most high school players, because the 
6-foot-3, 190-pounder is probably the area's top professional prospect. 
</P>
<P>
 His dream of pitching professionally was suddenly jeopardized by that sharp 
pain in his elbow, but fortunately, Worley's fears proved groundless. His 
doctor diagnosed his condition as only a slight pull of his triceps muscle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so relieved when the doctor said I had just pulled my triceps," he 
said. "I was like, 'Thank you. ' " 
</P>
<P>
 Worley has thrown without pain in recent days, which is good news for him, and 
for the 15 scouts he estimated have inquired about his health. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've all been calling my house, asking me, 'How's your arm?' " Worley 
said. "I've even sent a doctor's report to some of them." 
</P>
<P>
 The scrutiny is something Worley has grown accustomed this season. After a 
relatively nondescript junior year ("I only pitched against the weaker teams in 
our league," he says), he added about 25 pounds to his frame and eight miles an 
hour to his fastball. 
</P>
<P>
 He showcased both when he played in a scout league last fall. Worley, with his 
new and improved fastball, suddenly was a hot topic of baseball conversation in 
the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "He became kind of the buzzword up here," Coach Mike Nielson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The buzz drones on. Nielson estimates that at least six scouts are on hand 
each time Worley pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 "My teammates joke about it with me," Worley said. "They make comments like, 
'All your buddies are coming,' stuff like that." 
</P>
<P>
 They will be watching extra closely Tuesday, when Worley is scheduled to pitch 
against Littlerock. And if he is unaffected by the injury, scouts will continue 
to like what they see. 
</P>
<P>
 Worley has consistently been clocked in the mid-to-high 80s this season, and 
both he and Nielson say he has hit 93 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has progressed along real well," Nielson said. "We talked about him 
becoming mentally tough, and I think he's handled the pressure well." 
</P>
<P>
 He certainly has faced different expectations than he did a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like night and day," he said. "At the beginning of this season, I was 
real nervous. It's a lot of pressure, but I usually pitch better under 
pressure. I know I have to do a good job." 
</P>
<P>
 And he has, building a 4-1 record with 58 strikeouts in 38 innings, with an 
earned-run average of 1.27. 
</P>
<P>
 His performance has helped put the Rebels (9-7, 4-3 in league play) in the 
thick of the Golden League race, and has positioned him to be a top selection 
in the coming amateur draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Worley has been told he could go anywhere in the top three rounds, and scouts 
have mentioned him as a possible late first-round selection. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever round he is drafted, Worley plans on signing. "It's the only thing 
I've ever wanted to do," he said. 
</P>

 Two recent coaching changes have taken place at Royal. Girls' soccer Coach 
Monte Berna resigned and was replaced by Andy Silva, who coached the Simi 
Valley boys' team from 1980-93. Silva was a boys' assistant at Royal last 
season. Less settled is the girls' basketball team. Coach Paula Getty-Shear was 
asked to resign. 
</P>
<P>
 Getty-Shear coached Royal for six seasons and the team's 14-9 record last 
season was the best in her tenure. "It's a real bummer," she said. "I'm not 
sure why they wanted me to resign." 
</P>
<P>
 Royal Athletic Director Terry Dobbins said the school would like to name a new 
coach within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Recruiting update: Granada Hills volleyball player Mike DiSimone, an All-City 
Section 4-A Division pick last season, should sign with a college by the end of 
the month. The 6-5 senior outside hitter is considering San Diego State, Long 
Beach State and Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 * Palmdale soccer player Mike Dibbini, an All-Southern Section Division III 
selection who scored 88 goals the past two seasons, said he likely will play

ROUNDUP; STEVENS TAKES OVER AS IRGUN WINS THE WOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is no choice to be made for Gary Stevens. He will ride Brocco in the 
Kentucky Derby on May 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the jockey didn't mind keeping company with Irgun for one day at 
Aqueduct in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks after an easy victory in the Gotham under Jerry Bailey in his 
first race in New York, Irgun came back to win the $500,000 Wood Memorial on 
Saturday, defeating favored Go For Gin by 1 1/2 lengths in 1:49 for the 1 1/8 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
 With Bailey committed to Go For Gin, Stevens became the third jockey to win on 
Irgun, who has had only four starts. Eddie Delahoussaye rode when the Sunny's 
Halo colt broke his maiden on Feb. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Owned by Brandon and Marianne Chase and trained by Steve Young, Irgun, the 9-5 
second choice Saturday, led all of the way on a track listed as "good." Go For 
Gin, who was nearly nine lengths ahead of third-place finisher Shiprock, 
suffered his first loss in four starts at Aqueduct. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a good horse," Young said of Irgun, who bears the name of the Jewish 
underground organization once led by the late Israeli prime minister, Menachem 
Begin. "He just keeps jumping the hurdles. I think he's going to go to Kentucky 
on Tuesday." 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens was more than happy to pinch-hit Saturday in the Grade I race. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like they brought me in in the bottom of the ninth with the bases 
loaded and they pitched a high fast ball at me and I knocked it out of the 
park," he said. "I had a lot of confidence in this colt. In all actuality, I 
think he should be undefeated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I had a lot of horse at the quarter pole. He showed a ton of talent." 
</P>
<P>
 Go For Gin, who got to within a half-length approaching the stretch, probably 
also will go to Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew (Irgun) was a good horse," Bailey said. "He's very talented. I got 
even on the far turn, but that was it." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Last in the San Francisco Mile at Golden Gate Fields in his first start in 
more than 10 months, Norwich bounced back Saturday and won the $132,100 El 
Rincon Handicap at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridden by Pat Valenzuela and coupled in the betting with Pembroke, the 
7-year-old led all the way in ending 7-10 favorite Megan's Interco's winning 
streak at five. He won by nearly two lengths in 1:34 for the mile on turf, and 
the entry paid $9.60. 
</P>
<P>
 Angry over what he said was "team riding" by Chris Antley on last-place 
finisher Pembroke, Corey Black, Megan's Interco's rider, threw a punch at 
Antley in the jockey's room, leading to a brief scuffle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would try to move up and every time I tried to move up, (Antley) would slow 
down in front of me," Black said. "I almost clipped his heels on the first 
turn. On the back side and turning for home, he takes me out to the middle of 
track. It seemed to me like it was a case of team riding." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 King's Blade, who floundered when tried on the turf and finished last as the 
9-10 favorite in the Baldwin Stakes, returned to his preferred surface and won 
the $110,700 San Pedro Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 After breaking a step slowly from the outside post under Delahoussaye, the 
3-year-old Wavering Monarch gelding quickly took control and went on to defeat 
11-1 shot Al Renee by a half-length in 1:16 1/5 for the 6 1/2 furlongs. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2-1 favorite paid $6 for his fourth victory in six lifetime starts. 
Halloween Treat, the 3-1 second choice, was 1 1/4 lengths behind Al Renee. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No California Derby winner has won the Kentucky Derby, and that's not going to 
change this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Screaming Don, the longest shot in the field of seven, rallied to win the 
$200,000 race at Golden Gate Fields, and the only Derby his trainer Lanny Sharp 
mentioned afterward was the Colorado Derby in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Beaten in both the Southwest and Rebel at Oaklawn Park before shipping to 
California, the Lyphard's Ridge colt took advantage of a perfect trip to beat 
6-1 shot Silver Music. Favored Dramatic Gold and second choice Bai Brun both 
weakened after battling with Double Jab, who finished third, for the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, Screaming Don, who paid $103.60 and was ridden by Adalberto Lopez, 
had won five of six starts at Turf Paradise. He completed the 1 1/8 miles in 
1:48 1/5. Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Corrazona, an impressive winner of her American debut on March 16, is the 8-5 
morning-line favorite against five opponents in the $154,000 Santa Anita 
Budweiser Breeders' Cup today. Shipped to trainer Richard Mandella after 
winning three of eight in France, the 4-year-old El Gran Senor filly won by 2 
1/4 lengths in 1:34 4/5 for the mile on turf, the same distance she will be 
running today. Chris McCarron will ride. The rest of the field: Cargo, Skimble, 
Shooting The Moon, Island Orchid and Lyphard's Delta. . . . Pat Valenzuela won 
three times at Santa Anita on Saturday.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE BASEBALL ROUNDUP; HODGES, BELOVSKY HELP CYPRESS WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Josh Belovsky made his second consecutive impressive start, and Jason Hodges 
drove in five runs as host Cypress beat Golden West, 11-3, in an Orange Empire 
Conference baseball game Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory moves Cypress (26-9, 12-4 in conference) into a first-place tie 
with Riverside with eight games left. The Tigers lost to Rancho Santiago, 5-3, 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Belovsky, a sophomore from Orange, was coming off a five-hit shutout of Rancho 
Santiago last Sunday. He moved into the starting rotation for that game because 
Rob Crabtree has a sore arm. 
</P>
<P>
 Belovsky improved to 6-1 Saturday, allowing two runs and eight hits in 7 2/3 
innings. He was most effective when in trouble, which was often. He walked six, 
hit a batter and threw two wild pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 But Belovsky had nine strikeouts, eight with runners on base. Five times he 
struck out a Golden West batter with a runner on third. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's really stepped it up for us," Cypress Coach Scott Pickler said. "The guy 
will battle for you. I can't say enough about him." 
</P>
<P>
 Hodges had an RBI groundout in the first to give Cypress a 1-0 lead. He had an 
RBI double and later scored in the third as the Chargers took a 4-0 lead. 
Hodges singled and scored in the fifth as Cypress went up, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Hodges, a left-handed sophomore designated hitter, started the seventh with 
his seventh home run to put the Chargers ahead, 7-2. He added a two-run double 
in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 Andy Gonzales hit a two-run home run, his second, for Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
 Dustin Martin had a triple and an RBI single, and Nick D'Amato had two hits 
for Golden West (13-16, 6-10). 
</P>
<P>
 In other conference games: 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago 5, Riverside 3 -- Toby Sanchez hit a two-run homer, his 13th, 
for host Rancho Santiago (26-9, 9-7). The Dons got solid relief pitching from 
Kirk Irvine and Brandon Hoalton, both normally starters, to secure the victory. 
Irvine got a strikeout with two runners on to end the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoalton earned his first save by getting the final two outs with a runner on 
second in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 David Mallas had a sacrifice fly and a run-scoring groundout for Rancho 
Santiago. Riverside is 25-7, 12-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Coast 9, Fullerton 8 -- Nick Valencia hit a three-run home run in the 
ninth for host Orange Coast (7-23, 2-16) to cap a four-run rally. 
</P>
<P>
 He also had a two-run double earlier in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiki Blanchet walked and Richard Ernst singled with one out in the ninth for 
OCC. Chris Yakura then singled to cut the lead to 8-6, bringing Valencia to the 
plate. Steve Escobar had three hits, including a triple, and drove in two runs 
for Fullerton (16-14-1, 7-9).

COLLEGE ROUNDUP; OLSEN HELPS TITANS ROUT UNLV, 20-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Behind D.C. Olsen and Tony Miranda, Cal State Fullerton pounded Nevada Las 
Vegas, 20-1, in a Big West Conference baseball game Saturday at Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Olsen went three for five with two homers (one grand slam), a double and seven 
runs batted in for Fullerton (30-8, 8-3). 
</P>
<P>
 Miranda hit a leadoff homer, his second, in the sixth and finished three for 
five with three RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 Titan pitcher Matt Wagner improved to 9-0, pitching seven innings, allowing 
only three hits and striking out 10. 
</P>
<P>
 In Golden State Athletic Conference baseball: 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California College 6-4, Westmont 3-3 -- Jason Brissey hit a home run 
in the bottom of the ninth inning of the second game to lead Southern 
California College to the upset sweep of first-place Westmont (20-13, 8-5). 
</P>
<P>
 The Vanguards are 15-22, 5-8. 
</P>
<P>
 In Big West softball: 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton 1-1, Hawaii 0-0 -- Fullerton manufactured runs in the 
bottom of the final inning of each game to upset eighth-ranked Hawaii in both 
ends of a doubleheader at Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton, the home team because the entire season series was played this week 
in Hawaii to save travel costs, improved to 20-25, 9-9 in the Big West. Hawaii 
is 40-9 and 16-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Mortensen (13-14) won both games, the second with five innings of 
relief. She also scored the winning run in the second game, singling to open 
the sixth, going to second on a groundout, third on a single and scoring on a 
wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton scored the only run in the eight-inning first game without the 
benefit of a hit. Laurie LoForti reached base on an error, advanced to second 
on a wild pitch, to third on a fielder's choice and scored on another wild 
pitch. Mortensen pitched a three-hitter, striking out five and walking one. 
</P>
<P>
 In Golden State Athletic Conference softball: 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California College 5-4, Azusa Pacific 4-0 -- Amy Lewis had two hits 
and three RBIs in the two games for SCC, and she drove in the winning run in 
the first game. Carrie Nelson added three hits and three runs scored for SCC 
(36-7, 12-2).

PREP SWIMMING / ORANGE COUNTY CHAMPIONSHIPS; DAY GOES JUST SWIMMINGLY FOR 
BUYUKUNCU, WOODBRIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIK HAMILTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While Mater Dei billed its premier Orange County Swim Championships on 
Saturday as a 10-school invitational, it simply seemed like another 
Woodbridge-Irvine happening when the boys' competition was over at Heritage 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge, behind two lifetime bests by Turkish star Derya Buyukuncu, won 
with 520 points. Irvine was second with 478 as the schools accounted for more 
than half the boys' total. Mater Dei was a distant third with 316. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor won the girls' competition with 489 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge quickly went to work with the 200 medley relay team of Andrew 
Lazenby, Sean Moore, Justin Steinhouser and Dawson Hughes winning in 1 minute 
43.69 seconds. Irvine finished second, as it did in the other two relays. 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't easy for the Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 400 freestyle relay, Irvine's Steve Ronson gave anchor Jason Lezak a 
slight lead. Lezak, who has the second-fastest county time in the 100, was 
racing Buyukuncu. Lezak maintained the lead for 75 yards, but Buyukuncu crept 
up and touched him out in 3:20.03. 
</P>
<P>
 It was equally close in the 200 freestyle relay (1:30.33), Woodbridge 
defeating Irvine by seven-tenths of a second. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the relays showed how strong the two schools are in these events, the 
day undoubtedly belonged to Buyukuncu, with personal bests in the 50 (20.82) 
and 100 freestyles (45.44). They were the fastest times in the county this 
year, and the 50 mark was just off the Southern Section record of 20.65 set by 
Mission Viejo's Eric Diehl in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I went out, I was trying to break the record," Buyukuncu said. "I'm 
happy with my time, but I think I can get the record." 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge Coach Dan Gains, who said he entered this meet more for his 
swimmers to have fun than to compete seriously, was surprised how well his team 
did, especially Buyukuncu. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing. No matter how many times I watch him swim, he does these 
incredible things," Gains said. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine's Ronson recorded the year's fastest county time in the 100 
breaststroke in 59.74 and won the 200 individual medley (1:57.28). 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor Coach Todd Kilber said he was a little surprised how well his 
girls did. "We had some good swims from our girls. And while some of Irvine's 
top girls were not participating, I'm still happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Seven of Irvine's top girls did not compete because they were preparing for 
next week's Foothill Swim games. Mater Dei finished second with 450 points, and 
Irvine was third with 446. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Sailors, Rachel Arrow won the 200 IM (2:19.81) and 100 breaststroke 
(1:12.54) and was on the winning 200 IM relay with Melissa Pomeroy, Carey Read, 
and Kelly McIntee.

PREP TRACK / MT. SAC RELAYS; FOOTHILL GIRLS GETTING WARMED UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT FARMER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Foothill girls' track and field team used the Mt. San Antonio Relays 
Saturday to show that they are prepared for next weekend's Orange County 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind strong performances by juniors Tara Oettinger and Katie Mook, the 
Knights asserted themselves as a favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 Oettinger, already the county leader in three events, equaled her lifetime 
best in the invitational 200 meters, running fifth in 25.17 seconds, identical 
to her mark at last weekend's Arcadia Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach Poly's Aminah Haddad won in 24.11. 
</P>
<P>
 Oettinger, who leads the county in the long jump with a best of 18 feet 11 3/4 
inches, again went past 18 feet, to 18-5. The ninth-longest jumper in county 
history, Oettinger went over 18 for the third week in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, I was just OK in the long jump," said Oettinger, who has found 
success after a change in jumping technique from the hang to the hitch kick, 
"but now, it's becoming my favorite event." 
</P>
<P>
 Mook did her part for the Knights by posting a personal best in the 300 low 
hurdles and taking over the county lead. Her 45.26 clocking was just behind the 
45.12 run by Stacy Edwards-Hambrick of Moreno Valley in the invitational event. 
</P>
<P>
 Mook, a junior, also finished fourth in the invitational 100 hurdles. The 
defending Century League champion in the event ran 15.39, just off of her 
county-leading 15.03 from Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
 The race was won by Oxnard Rio Mesa's Andrea Wasden in 14.64. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came here wanting to break fifteen, so I am kind of disappointed," Mook 
said. "But at least every week is coming down more and more." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Knight Coach Jerry Whitaker: "There are still a couple of things that we 
can do with her hurdles to get her running faster." 
</P>
<P>
 The Knight boys' star, Ethan Taub, finished fifth in the invitational 800 in 
1:55.82. Taub, a senior who was in the State 400 final last year, was in second 
with 200 meters remaining but faded in the stretch. His time was just behind 
his county-leading 1:55.05. Arroyo Grande senior Eric Dunn won in 1:52.88. 
</P>
<P>
 Other highlights included: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Camarillo senior Jeremy Fischer continued his consistent ways, winning the 
high jump in a meet record 7-3 to edge Rialto Eisenhower senior Art Lloyd, who 
jumped 7-2. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bell Gardens sophomore Michael Granville, one of the nation's top 800 
runners, dropped down to 400 and turned back a strong field, posting a lifetime 
best and nation-leading 46.67. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Redlands senior Pat Johnson, competing in his second track and field 
season, ran down Moreno Valley Canyon Springs junior Bryan Howard in the final 
60 meters to win the 200 in 21.03. Howard was timed in 21.22, with Granville 
third in 21.75.

INTERVIEW; MEET OUR NEWEST INTERVIEWER; HOW DO YOU INTERVIEW A GUY WHO'S MADE A 
CAREER OF TALKING ABOUT HIMSELF? EASY -- LET SPALDING GRAY INTERVIEW SPALDING 
GRAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his tale of an eye operation and the events leading up to it, actor 
Spalding Gray's latest monologue "Gray's Anatomy" -- his 14th -- continues his 
tradition of turning the particulars of his own life into epic storytelling.  
</P>
<P>
 Beginning this week, the 52-year-old actor best known for his 
monologues-turned-films "Swimming to Cambodia" (1987) and "Monster in a Box" 
(1992) brings "Gray's Anatomy" to Los Angeles, Santa Barbara and Irvine. He can 
also be seen in the recently released film "The Paper" and is currently filming 
in "Beyond," starring Rosanna Arquette and directed by John Boorman.  
</P>
<P>
 Because talking about himself is something he does so well -- and so often -- 
and because he says he has become exhausted by the repetitiveness of being 
interviewed by journalists, we asked Gray to try something different: We 
invited him to interview himself, to ask himself the questions he's never been 
asked. He agreed to the task, but responded that he couldn't think of any 
question that he had never been asked in an interview. "I just started with the 
most often asked question, and the rest just followed , " he told us when he 
turned in a 60-minute tape. What follows is a transcript of that tape, which 
Gray says has triggered him to begin thinking in terms of a new book called 
"Talking to Myself."  
</P>
<P>
 Question: We'll begin with the first question. What do you call what you do? I 
mean for work. Are you a monologuist? A performer? A performance artist? A 
storyteller? What? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: The definition that I like the most for what I do came from a 
10-year-old girl who I saw hanging around after one of my shows. And being 
surprised by how young she was I questioned, "What are you doing here?" And she 
said, "My dad said I had to come and see the talking man." I liked that 
definition. I'm the man who sits behind a table and tells true stories from his 
life. I'm also an actor. I was trained as an actor at Emerson College and I use 
that training to play myself. With the help of my director, Renee Shafransky, I 
split myself in two and take the memory of myself in the past and develop that 
self as a character. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, most of the events in my new monologue titled "Gray's Anatomy" 
took place two or three years ago. I'm not in that same emotional or physical 
situation, so like any actor I have to recall and re-create a role. I'm like an 
introverted Method actor in that way. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Let me stop you again and just ask you how you came into this form. As a 
child, were you exposed to storytellers in your family? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No, no, just the opposite. There were no stories -- nope, just the 
opposite. There were no stories, no personal historic narrative. I'm from New 
England and everything there gets kind of swept under the rug, so I think I 
began to talk in reaction to that. I was talking in reaction to repression. I 
can remember once some years back I was doing a taped interview with my father, 
trying to find out some facts about my personal history -- you know, trying to 
find out who I was and how I came to be whatever it is I am -- it was a kind of 
identity search and one question I asked him was "Why, out of his three sons, 
was I the only one that was not circumcised?" And his response was, "Oh, you're 
not?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Just tell me, briefly, how you came into the theatrical form. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, when I first came to New York City in 1967, I joined up with Richard 
Schechner's Performance Group -- where we worked in the Performing Garage in 
SoHo. We worked on making our own group pieces through improv so we all had a 
chance to be both actors and the creators of what it was we were making 
(although Schechner might have referred to it as performance, I still think of 
it as acting). 
</P>
<P>
 It was a very whole full kind of acting that bordered on music and dance 
because it employed our whole bodies and voices. But I'm sorry, let me get to 
the point or at least the point of your question. The most important part of 
that experience for me came during a production of our first piece called 
"Commune." That was an environmental theater piece with no fixed seating. The 
audience just sat on risers and platforms all around us. There was a lot of 
audience participation in this piece -- we called it a piece, not a play, 
because it really wasn't a well-made play -- so there was a lot of audience 
participation built into the work -- when the action stopped -- we'd go 
directly into the audience and involve them in some way, we had to interact 
with them. 
</P>
<P>
 So there was this one section in the piece about death and dying and Richard 
asked all of us, I think there were eight in the cast, to go into the audience 
and chose one person to deliver a personal story to about death. I know this 
sounds strange now but in those days most of the audience was wide open to 
this, wide open to this kind of encounter. I mean, they were consistently 
receptive. So each night I would go out and find someone -- I think it was 
almost always a woman -- and I would tell the story of how when I was in Mexico 
in 1967 my mother killed herself by starting up my father's car and 
asphyxiating herself in the garage. And the story I told was of my return home 
and all the details I remembered that grew out of that traumatic return. And 
those details were etched in my memory and I could see it all like a film in my 
head as I spoke it. 
</P>
<P>
 This really was my first monologue. It was hardly performed at all, just 
spoken directly into the eyes of a stranger -- well, not quite a stranger, a 
member of our audience. This event was extremely powerful for me -- for at 
least two reasons. One was that it helped me to break through my fear of 
looking directly at the audience -- you see every actor, in film or stage is 
never, or rarely, allowed to do that, so that produces, of course, a great 
desire to break that taboo and have direct contact with the eyes of the viewer 
-- at least that was true for me. And the experience was very powerful. It 
changed the whole way I thought about theater. I was no longer just interested 
in looking at my fellow actors on stage, I was now yearning to relate to the 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
 The other powerful thing that happened in that event was the fact that I was 
publicly breaking the taboo around my mom's suicide. It was never openly known 
that she had killed herself. It was all sort of covered up -- the shame. Her 
obituary just read Margaret Elizabeth Horton Gray, deceased. And then, of 
course, there were rumors as there are always rumors when you don't tell the 
whole truth. There were rumors that she died of cancer. So for me it was so 
important to set the story straight. You know, tell it right. Also, it was very 
important for me to tell the story in order to heal myself through the telling 
-- you know, to try to make sense of it. It was a way both of mourning her and 
accepting the gigantic horror of the event. I can see that you want to ask 
another question so just let me finish by telling you that this one event 
liberated me in such a way that by 1967 I had co-founded the Wooster Group with 
Elizabeth LeCompte and we created a piece together called "Rumstick Road" -- 
this piece of theater was a most powerful alchemistic event for me -- and 
opened the door to my monologues. 
</P>
<P>
 I haven't got time to tell you about that piece in any detail, nor could I 
capture it in words -- it was for me a true theatrical masterpiece. But one 
thing I want to point out is that it led me on to taking myself as a character. 
At the very beginning of it I would step forward and speak directly to the 
audience, and I would say, "My name is Spalding Gray, Spud, Spud Gray," so that 
it was clear that I was playing myself and also Elizabeth LeCompte was 
directing me to play myself, or at least a theatrical aspect of me. It was she 
and the Wooster Group that taught me that ability to split myself and play 
certain aspects of myself exactly like an actor would play a character or role. 
And of course the monologues grew out of that. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Speaking of directors, don't you work with Renee Shafransky as a director 
now? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, Renee directed my last two monologues, "Monster in a Box" and "Gray's 
Anatomy." And she has been invaluable to me. She's worked not only as a 
director but as a co-creator. Much of the consciously written parts of "Gray's 
Anatomy" are hers. I don't do actual writing, I just talk -- and Renee supplied 
some actual writing to the piece. Let me make you aware, in case you're not, 
that none of my monologues are previously written. I'm an oral writer and I've 
evolved all my monologues from the beginning in front of an audience. Because 
Renee and I have lived together for so long, she has always been around that 
evolution and I'd always be listening to her feedback -- she was a kind of 
psychic mirror for me, I mean she perceived me often like a character and would 
reflect that back to me. And this worked very well because she not only has a 
fine eye for directing, but because she is also a good writer with a 
concentration on screenplays. Really, from early on, Renee had a lot of input 
to the monologues. So, of course, it was only natural for her to become the 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Please tell me just a little of how you work together, say in the 
development of "Gray's Anatomy." 
</P>
<P>
 A: Working from my outline I start first with a linear recollection. All that 
I remember about the events as well as all the other associative personal 
stories that grow up around that event. And I tell that to my first audience. I 
make tape recordings of these early performances. Then Renee and I sit down and 
work with those tapes. Like you'd work with any text. We begin to make a 
dramatic structure together. I'd give you examples of that but I don't want to 
give away the stories in "Gray's Anatomy." You can see and enjoy that for 
yourself. Just suffice it to say that we make dramatic changes based on 
original truths. We use hyperbole and rearrangement of the way events occur in 
time. So together we evolve the monologue into a well-structured lyrical 
dramatic piece. That's where it is now. And, of course, it's never finished 
until I stop performing it. It's always open and flexible. 
</P>
<P>
 Renee is also directing me all the time to play myself as I was three years 
ago when most of the events took place. This works very well because Renee 
lived through those events with me and has her own memory of them. So it is in 
fact two personal memories interacting. And that really makes "Gray's Anatomy" 
so much more complex. It makes it much more than a solo work. I may be 
performing but Renee's presence -- it is completely interwoven in that 
performance. I really don't know how I would make a monologue without her. The 
other wonderful thing that has grown out of working with Renee as a director is 
that it has reconnected me with the ability to take direction as a film actor. 
It's also freed Renee up to direct other actors in more traditional plays, 
which she is doing right now. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Please tell us something about your film work, I mean other than the films 
you have made of your monologues. But first, one question before you answer 
that. Why do you think "Swimming to Cambodia" works so well as a film? Why 
would an audience want to see a film of one man talking? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, first of all I was lucky to work with a very talented director, 
Jonathan Demme. That made a world of difference. But in all humility I have to 
say "Swimming to Cambodia" was a radical breakthrough in film because it was so 
relentlessly minimal. And I think it worked because your regular film audience 
comes into the theater with expectations of imagery. 
</P>
<P>
 And you have to understand there is a certain audience that will not go see a 
live show. They feel more comfortable in movie theaters because that's where 
they've been going all their lives; they just haven't been accustomed to going 
to the theater. So there's a whole new audience there that wouldn't have come 
to see me live. Now they're coming to see a movie, and what makes a good movie 
is imagery. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course text is important but when we think of film we usually think of 
images. And in the case of "Swimming," I was creating the image with words 
through my performance and gesture. This throws the audience back on their own 
imaginations. They have to interact with their own personal images which I am 
provoking and are constantly growing out of my narrative. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, most films literalize reality into a selected image. What I 
was doing, and am still doing, is close to what I grew up with as a kid, radio, 
good old radio. Oh, how I loved it because I could create my own image of what 
was not seen but only heard. We did not have a TV in our home until I was 11 
years old. So I had all those years of "Ozzie and Harriet" on radio first, and 
I created Ozzie and Harriet's house in my mind, as well as David and Rick and 
Ozzie and Harriet. I mean, just think of the name Ozzie, what does that do to 
you? Doesn't it tickle your imagination? What image do you have of an Ozzie? 
</P>
<P>
 Radio allowed me to be a creator and TV stole that creation from me by 
literalizing and to some extent limiting my vision. Suddenly we had their house 
as chosen and given by a TV production company. The audience seeing "Swimming" 
has to make their own images and I think on the whole they like that. I mean, 
for many people it's a new experience, particularly for the younger audience. 
The other wonderful aspect of "Swimming" being made into a film had to do with 
the fact that much of the narrative in the monologue was about the making of a 
film -- "The Killing Fields." So then when the monologue became a film it was 
wonderfully self-reflective in its medium -- celluloid commenting on celluloid 
-- it became a film talking about a film; it became a lovely satellite to the 
original planet, "The Killing Fields." And so I see them as two films spinning 
around each other. At best they should be seen together as a unit work of art. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Now would you mind saying a few words about your more commercial film work? 
</P>
<P>
 A: When people used to ask me why I got involved with Hollywood films, I would 
say jokingly that it was for the health insurance. Then I thought that the 
powers that be in Hollywood got wind of that and decided to play a sick joke on 
me. In my paranoid mind I thought they said, "All right. He's doing it for the 
health insurance? Well, then, let's cast him as a doctor for the rest of his 
life." And they started casting me as doctors. But that seems to be over now 
and things are looking brighter. First of all, I want to say I have no 
complaints about my experiences with commercial films. I've had nothing but 
good experiences and I'm very happy that my film work has become even more 
interesting and creative for me lately. I seem to be moving away from the 
doctors and into a more varied world of characters. And I really do see myself 
as having the potential of becoming a very good character actor. Most recently 
I've had the good fortune of acting in a number of good projects. Those were 
"King of the Hill," "The Tool Shed" (not yet released), "The Paper," and now 
I'm blessed to be working with John Boorman on his latest project, which has 
the potential of being as powerful and as historically revelatory as "The 
Killing Fields." 
</P>
<P>
 Working with Steven Soderbergh on his film "King of the Hill" was particularly 
important for me, first of all because he chose me -- I was his first choice -- 
that had never happened to me before. I always felt, you know, easily replaced 
or expendable or that they were just casting me for my WASP patrician look. 
Steven didn't even screen test me, we just ate lunch together in New York City 
at Jerry's and he told me he chose me to play the role of Mr. Mungo from 
reading my novel "Impossible Vacation" and immediately I thought, "What an 
interesting way to cast someone in a film -- to be cast through my writing." 
Steven said he saw my "character" of Brewster North in my autobiographic novel 
as a man being ruled by regret, which for him was the key to Mr. Mungo's 
character. 
</P>
<P>
 The other important thing that happened in that film was that Steven and the 
role allowed me to express my sense of deep sadness. In my own monologue work I 
see myself as a humorist and at the bottom of all humorists you will almost 
always find a deep well of sadness. In my monologues I feel often under some 
pressure to make the audience laugh -- although, don't get me wrong, I enjoy 
that, but Steven allowed my sadness to surface publicly for the first time. 
Previous to that most Hollywood casting agents only reacted to my kind of WASP 
exterior. But Steven and his casting director Deborah Aquila saw something else 
under that image, and he went for it, and so did I. Also that film was strongly 
connected to my autobiography, and I think that always helps an actor find his 
or her personal line to a role. 
</P>
<P>
 If you haven't seen "King of the Hill," and you should, you can see it on 
video now. The character I play, Mr. Mungo, ends up committing suicide. This 
was a very powerful scene for me because it was shot in the summer which was 
the time my mother had killed herself in 1967, at age 52. And I was just 
approaching 52, and all these fears were surfacing that I would somehow repeat 
that act in order to join her wherever she was -- that she was pulling me to 
her through suicide. You see, my mother actually told me a year before she 
killed herself how she planned to do it. And I didn't take her seriously. And I 
did not take any action to warn my father to please hide the keys to the car, 
just keep them out of sight. Then a year later, while I was spending the summer 
in Mexico, she did exactly what she said she wanted to do. She got up in the 
night while my father and younger brother were asleep and went out into the 
garage and started up the car and that was it. I returned from Mexico to find 
that she was only ashes in an urn in a cardboard box beside my father's bed. So 
there I was, years later, at almost 52 years old, getting to create my own 
suicide. The scene took all day to shoot, starting with the very realistic 
makeup job of slit wrists complete with dried blood running out of the wounds 
and down my hand. 
</P>
<P>
 The odd thing about this choice of suicide in the film was that it had fit 
right into some recent pre-film fantasies I had had of how I would do it -- how 
I would commit suicide in real life. They were only fantasies, mind you, and 
still it was very present in my consciousness and it was most present when I 
was performing my monologues in Taos, N.M., and staying at a hotel in town -- 
there was a very large outdoor Jacuzzi and I was thinking the way I'd do it 
would be to take a good dose of Quaaludes, then take a very sharp 
straight-edged razor and get into that tub until I reached a state of complete 
relaxation -- a state I've hardly ever known in my sober life before, and then 
just draw that razor down both wrists and lie back in my own hot blood and 
expire. Of course at the time I was aware that this was only a fantasy -- I 
didn't own a straight-edged razor nor did I have any Quaaludes -- still it was 
a very intense one that kept coming back on me. And in the end I thought the 
combination of the hot tub and the Quaaludes would make me feel so good, so 
relaxed, that I'd just give up on the razor and relax and live. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it all was just a few months later that I was in Steven's film and it was 
not a hot tub but just a hotel room in which I was doing the slashing. But 
there was the straight-edged razor right on the sink, and me with my wrists 
looking exactly like they'd been slashed. And there I had to sit for hours, 
slumped over that sink while special effects had to create a condition where 
the blood and water from the sink overflowed and ran along the floor and out 
under the door where Aaron, the young boy that Mungo had befriended, discovered 
and followed it to the ultimate horrible image of my body slumped over the sink 
-- or Mungo's body -- which for me at the time were interchangeable. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a very powerful scene for me because of all the associations of mixed 
identification. I was me, Mungo and my mom, as well as Aaron finding me/Mom in 
Mungo. It was also very illuminating for me because I was forced to sit there 
for so long and stare at all that mess the blood made, and it made me realize 
what a selfish, horrible mess a suicide is for those who have to deal with it 
and clean it up. Then one of those strange behind-the-scenes events occurred 
which I always love. It's as though doing a film often provokes a film reality 
in me that I carry off the location, and in this case this was an extreme and 
perfect example of it. 
</P>
<P>
 I was in a real rush to catch a flight out that night because Renee and I had 
rented a nice and expensive house in the Hamptons for the month of August and 
because of the film I had spent very little time there and it looked like we 
might not finish the suicide scene in time for me to catch my flight due to the 
fact that the crew had to set up and re-light for my last scene in which they 
carry my body out covered by a sheet on a stretcher. So I asked Steven if there 
was any way they could use a stand-in or, in this case maybe they call it a 
"lie-in" for me. And Steven half-jokingly and half-seriously said, "What, 
Spalding, don't you want to be in my movie?" I laughed (a little) and said, 
"All right, Steven. I'll do it if you'll let me run back to the hotel, pack my 
bag and check out so I'll be all ready to go straight to the airport." And to 
my amazement he agreed. So out I headed dressed in this 1929 outfit with an 
ashen white face, slit wrists and dried blood streaming down my hands. The 
hotel was only a few blocks from the location and to my amazement I got there 
without turning a single head. The only person that reacted to me was a 
homeless person asking for change in front of the post office. As soon as he 
saw me coming, he ran. 
</P>
<P>
 Then checking out of the hotel the woman at the front desk, knowing I was an 
actor in a film, asked me how the film was going and I just lifted my slit 
wrists and she, fully in control because she was aware that I was, after all 
really just an actor and this reality was all part of the film, and she said, 
"Oh, gross-out!" 
</P>
<P>
 No, that was not enough for me. I just had the strong urge not to leave that 
hotel until I affected someone in some real way. So feeling like a little kid 
at Halloween I proceeded diabolically toward the hotel pharmacy and upon 
entering discovered it empty except for a woman who was behind the counter 
filling prescriptions. She was just about my mother's age when my mother had 
killed herself and I just walked right up to the counter and with my sleeves 
rolled up held up my slit wrists and said, "Do you have anything for my 
wounds?" She turned as pale as I was and staggered back and, grasping one of 
the medicine cabinets to steady herself, she sputtered, "We have 
Mercurochrome." And that's when I knew she was in shock. Mercurochrome, I 
thought, that fits right in with the period of the movie. Iodine, maybe, but 
Mercurochrome? Then as she rushed to get it, she said, "Whatever happened to 
you?" And I said, "Oh, I just slit my wrists." 
</P>
<P>
 It was only then that I pulled out of this bizarre diabolical reality I'd 
created and realized I was re-enacting yet another aspect of the whole suicide 
scene. I was casting this poor pharmacy prescription filler as my mother and in 
my own strange dramatic way was saying, "Look, Mom, I can do it too!" As soon 
as I had that realization I was all apologies and told her I was only an actor 
working on a film nearby. Then I fled out of shame, leaving her in a state I 
will never know. Later I thought it was a wonder the whole event didn't provoke 
her to have a heart attack. It was all a very odd event, and one I'm not proud 
of. It was a very clear and weird case of what would be called, I suppose, 
"acting out." Well, I've always had a problem with boundaries and that day I 
just overflowed. That's the end of the answer. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Q: Did you make your flight back to New York that night? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No, I didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I just have two more questions. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Oh, too bad. I was hoping we could go on a little longer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Well, I'd love to but I'm afraid we have to wrap it up. You have to realize 
this is for the L.A. Times, which is only a newspaper, and you talk like a 
book. 
</P>
<P>
 A: OK, shoot. What are the last two questions? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I'll be brief. The question is: Can you think of a director you'd like to 
work with on a particular film project? And what would that project be? 
</P>
<P>
 A: That's a tough one. I'd love to work with Jodie Foster, Jane Campion, 
Jonathan Demme, Stephen Frears. I'd very much like to work with Peter Weir, I'd 
love to work with Ron Howard and Steven Soderbergh again, as well as Renee 
Shafransky. I mean, there are so many fine and talented directors out there to 
work with. But as for projects, that's a whole other story. That's a tough one. 
I just don't think I'm ethnic enough. I mean, who wants to do a story about an 
existential uptight doubting New Englander? I suppose I might fit into an 
Updike story, I might be perfect for that. But look who they cast in the last 
one, "The Witches of Eastwick." Hah, not a chance for me there. Oh, that 
reminds me of a story about another talented director, Paul Mazursky. I was 
working with him on "The Pickle," playing yet another doctor, and I was hanging 
out in my dressing room receiving lessons from a real doctor on how to give 
Danny Aiello a realistic blood pressure workup, and Paul burst into my dressing 
room with that enthusiastic way he has. He was on his break and he came in with 
all this energy and enthusiasm and said, "You know, Spalding, I had forgotten 
that you are a really good actor. I keep thinking of you as a storyteller. But 
you're also a great actor. In fact, I think you'd be perfect to play the role 
of John Cheever when someone at last makes the John Cheever story." I said, 
"Right on! Sure! You direct it and see if you can raise the money on my name 
playing a very talented complex depressed drunken bisexual writer living on the 
Hudson River. That one is sure to capture the hearts and imaginations of 
America." Anyway, let me finish by telling you, I do have one fantasy project 
and that is to play opposite Madonna in the remake of "The Blue Angel."

<P>
 Q: OK. Wonderful. Now for the last question. Back to your own work for this 
one. I noticed that you work a lot out of fear. What is your big one? What is 
your big fear? 
</P>
<P>
 A: My big fear is that I lack the courage it takes to live a real life. And by 
that I mean to really sit in it, feel and be in it. To dive into life, if you 
know what I mean. I'm afraid I treat life too much like theater. I frame it in 
a story and run from frame to frame. I'm always controlling it, I'm always 
creating it. The shadow side of my art form is that I'm so good at storytelling 
that I can now tell the story before I have the feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 Storytelling can become a defense against just feeling and being, a defense 
against living. I'll give you an example and we'll end with that. Last summer 
Renee and I were at a Lincoln Center after-show party at Tavern on the Green. I 
had been Upstate and traveled in to meet her there. I thought I'd be late for 
the show because I'd encountered a couple of accidents along the way -- one was 
on the highway and had held up traffic for quite a while; the other was on 
Metro North, some minor derailment problem. Anyway, I made it on time after 
all. And as we were leaving the party Renee and I caught a cab just outside 
Tavern on the Green. We were pulling out of the parking lot and there was a 
three-car collision on Central Park West right in front of us. It was a real 
mess. And one of the vehicles was an open jeep, and this poor man had cracked 
the windshield with his head and he was rocking back and forth in shock and 
pain. And as soon as Renee saw that she burst into tears. And I immediately 
said, "Wow, that's the third accident I've encountered today." I just neatly 
fit it into my ongoing narrative. I'm working a little bit on all that in 
therapy now -- how to make a crack in the narrative to let the feelings in. It 
takes a good therapist to do that because there's nothing people love more than 
a good story and we all just want it to go on and on and on.

BOULEZ, THE MELLOW YEARS; PIERRE BOULEZ WAS ONCE A FEARED COMPOSER-CONDUCTOR, 
BUT TODAY HE IS A GRACIOUS, WITTY CONDUCTOR WHO IS CONSIDERATE TOWARD HIS 
MUSICIANS AND STILL PASSIONATE ABOUT HAVING CONTEMPORARY MUSIC IN PEOPLE'S

<P>
 The scene at the PolyGram post-Grammy party a few weeks ago was unprecedented. 
An exuberant young staff member of the once-stuffy German classical music label 
Deutsche Grammophon was literally shouting the news from the rafters and 
inviting revelers to party. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierre Boulez's recording, with the Chicago Symphony, of Bartok's 
seldom-played early ballet score "The Wooden Prince" and his even less-known 
choral work "Cantata Profana," had won Grammys for best classical recording, 
best orchestral recording, best choral recording and best engineered recording. 
If one were to equate the classical music Grammy Awards to Oscars, this grand 
slam makes Boulez the equivalent of Steven Spielberg and Jane Campion rolled 
into one. 
</P>
<P>
 But, ironically, the notable achievement for Boulez is that no one in 
classical music, except perhaps fidgety marketing executives, really takes the 
Grammys very seriously. They are not sophisticated awards. They generally go to 
big names, to potboiler releases or to sonic blockbusters. So what all the 
shouting was about was that Boulez -- the rigorous modernist leader of the 
European total serialism movement in the '50s and composer of probably the most 
formidable music to actually enter into the fringes of the repertory -- was no 
longer scary and had even developed some mass-market appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelenos, of course, knew this long before the rest of the country caught up 
with the new Boulez, 69, and his appearances at the Music Center this week and 
next would probably have been eagerly awaited with or without the Grammys. 
</P>
<P>
 When he began biannual visits to the Los Angeles Philharmonic a decade ago, 
his American profile was low and his reputation was that of a new-music ogre. 
At that time he was still remembered as "The French Correction" of the New York 
Philharmonic, the audience-unfriendly disciplinarian who followed Leonard 
Bernstein as its music director. He was feared as the tyrant of French music 
and something of a mad musical scientist who had become the head of IRCAM, the 
Space Age computer-music facility in Paris he created after leaving the New 
York Philharmonic. Furthermore, the complexly organized music he wrote had gone 
completely out of fashion once Minimalism and New Romanticism had begun to 
dominate American music. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Philharmonic found, instead, a musician nearly the opposite of 
his reputation. He turned out to be a gracious, witty, supporting, elegant 
conductor with an uncanny knack for making the most difficult music seem, if 
not exactly easy, at least natural. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the biggest surprise of all was that Boulez proved to be uncommonly 
considerate toward the players. He is relaxed when conducting, because, he 
says, a tense conductor makes the players tense. "If you don't care for them, 
they won't care for you," he advised a young conductor more wrapped up in his 
manner than in the players during a conducting workshop at Carnegie Hall last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles no longer has Boulez exclusively in America. He now spends a month 
each year with the Chicago Symphony and two or three weeks with the Cleveland 
Orchestra. For the past three seasons he has also led special workshops in 
conducting or composing at Carnegie Hall. And everywhere the story is the same, 
with Boulez seeming to win over everyone with whom he comes into contact. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this season in Chicago, for instance, scalpers were carrying on a 
brisk business the day after Thanksgiving for Boulez's performance of Mahler's 
Sixth Symphony. The previous season Boulez appeared with the Cleveland 
Orchestra at Carnegie Hall for the kind of 20th-Century program that had so 
annoyed New Yorkers when he was music director of the New York Philharmonic, 
and got a hero's welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 So dazzled and surprised was that audience that for one of the rare times in 
recent memory there wasn't that typical New Yorker rush up the aisles at the 
final downbeat (or earlier) to be the first to get a cab or to avoid the long 
lines at the parking garage. 
</P>
<P>
 And now the Grammys. 
</P>
<P>
 Boulez himself takes all of this new-found popularity and adulation in stride. 
Reached by phone recently at his home in Paris, Boulez laughed at the irony of 
his winning all those Grammys. "I am not personally proud about this," he said, 
"but I am happy because it helps this music to be much more known than it is. 
If many people hear, for the first time, either 'The Wooden Prince' or the 
'Cantata Profana,' then that is a good result." He is also predictably pleased 
that this will perhaps help egg on Deutsche Grammophon, which has undertaken an 
extensive recording project of 20th-Century works with Boulez conducting 
several major orchestras, into unchartered repertory. 
</P>
<P>
 Boulez, however, attributes his recent success to the fact that he has always 
worked hard to obtain the right conditions for making music, and by this point 
in his career he has achieved them. He no longer is an administrator, having 
resigned both as head of IRCAM and as president of the Ensemble 
InterContemporain, the group he helped found in 1975, although he remains 
active in both institutions. He only conducts part time, 10 to 12 weeks a year, 
and then with just a handful of orchestras. 
</P>
<P>
 He goes to Chicago, because he developed a close relationship with its music 
director, Daniel Barenboim, when Barenboim led L'Orchestre de Paris. Likewise 
he comes to Los Angeles because of his longstanding friendship with L.A. 
Philharmonic Managing Director Ernest Fleischmann. He has begun returning 
annually to Cleveland because it is the first American orchestra with which he 
became associated, in the '60s. He conducts the Berlin and Vienna philharmonics 
because, well, who wouldn't? 
</P>
<P>
 But mainly, Boulez says, he only goes where he can spend two weeks or, 
preferably, more, so that he can develop a relationship with the players. He 
also goes where circumstances allow him to perform the music he cares about. 
Berlin, for instance, is willing to sponsor a Webern festival for Boulez, who 
will then record the composer's complete works with its orchestra. "I don't 
want to make a concert just for the sake of making concerts. That does not 
interest me. But when there is an artistic goal, that is more satisfying." 
</P>
<P>
 Another, for instance, is Boulez's upcoming two weeks in Los Angeles, where he 
will perform his "Le Visage Nuptial," an ambitious and demanding song cycle for 
soloists, chorus and orchestra that cannot be properly prepared in the standard 
rehearsal time. "But because I am in Los Angeles for two weeks, I can rehearse 
it for two weeks," Boulez said. "I can make an easy program for the first week, 
and therefore can have more time to rehearse ("Le Visage Nuptial") for the 
second program." (This week's "easy" program is maybe an understatement, since 
it includes Bartok's sweeping and terrifying ballet score "The Miraculous 
Mandarin," but Boulez has conducted the orchestra in it before.) 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing, moreover, better typifies Boulez than "Le Visage Nuptial" and his 
programming it. For all his new-found popularity, Boulez is still not exactly a 
beloved composer by the general public, which would be happiest if he stuck to 
the early 20th-Century hits by Debussy, Ravel, Stravinsky and Bartok. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the success he had with his Cleveland Orchestra concert at Carnegie 
Hall last season, Boulez got a much cooler response this season when he led the 
Ensemble InterContemporain in the American premiere of the latest version of 
his " . . . explosante / fixe . . . " -- a 35-minute work for solo flute and 
ensemble, electronically expanding the flute sounds instantaneously as it is 
played by utilizing the latest computer hardware and software from IRCAM. It is 
a rich, intricate, subtle, sensual score, but not one easily apprehended in 
first hearing. The audience dwindled appreciably throughout the concert. 
</P>
<P>
 Still Boulez -- like Mahler, who was adulated as a conductor but certainly not 
as a composer by his audiences -- is a composer first and performer second. 
And, as with conducting, Boulez the composer has had to fight against his 
reputation for exerting calculated control over every aspect of the music. 
Indeed, Boulez's polemical domination of '50s serialism, in which every element 
of the music was mathematically predetermined, proved a technique so ferocious 
that he himself eventually came to call it totalitarian rather than total 
serialism. 
</P>
<P>
 But Boulez's music has become freer in recent years, and many of his orchestra 
and short chamber works have found much favor. "Notations I-IV," orchestral 
expansions of four student piano studies, has found favor with orchestras 
everywhere, including in Los Angeles. But even his most rigidly structured 
early music, with its textures as arresting as ever-changing intricate computer 
imagery of fractal patterns, can seem beautiful when brilliantly played. 
</P>
<P>
 Boulez is also as stubborn a composer as he is a conductor -- maybe more so. 
In both personifications he will not rest until he gets it right, which in 
conducting maybe means a little extra rehearsal, while for a work like "Le 
Visage Nuptial" it has meant waiting 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Le Visage Nuptial," in fact, is one of the most illuminating examples of 
Boulez's artistic personality. It is based upon an extraordinary erotic poem by 
Rene Char, the French surrealist poet. Boulez describes it as an unusually 
narrative poem written by Char, one of the French poets of our century he most 
admires and with whom he became friends. "The story is very simple. The 
beginning of love. The climax is in the middle. Then at the end, the 
disenchantment and farewell." The language, however, is anything but simple. 
The imagery is often erotic and violent, with narrative events only implied, 
nothing ever spelled out. 
</P>
<P>
 The circumstances of its original composition in 1946 are unclear. Joan 
Peyser, in her 1976 biography of Boulez, implies a mysterious love affair and a 
suicide pact. Boulez has never spoken of it. But the Boulez of that period was 
clearly high-strung, subject to extreme emotions that for a long time went 
unrecognized in his formally predetermined music. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Boulez's description of "Le Visage Nuptial" closely parallels his 
artistic friendship with John Cage a few years later, which is traced in the 
correspondence between the two composers recently published by Cambridge 
University Press. Boulez met Cage in Paris in 1949, was enchanted, and struck 
up an immediate friendship with the composer, who was 13 years his senior and 
already well known. After Cage returned to New York, an excited correspondence 
between the two began, with both breathlessly exchanging their ideas about the 
employment of chance in composition. When he finally visited Cage in New York 
in 1952, however, he found that Cage had moved in the direction of anarchy. 
Disenchantment set in, and Boulez rapidly and unsentimentally ended the 
correspondence. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I put it on paper in 1946," Boulez recalled of the original version of 
"Le Visage Nuptial," "that was just for a small combination of one voice and 
four instruments. Going back to this in 1953, I thought it needs a bigger body 
of sound to express what I want. But when I did it, I was in a very austere 
phase. I forced the score into a kind of straitjacket. I was very inexperienced 
in orchestration. At the same time I was very dogmatic: 'I want to do this; I 
want to do that.' And finally it was not possible to realize it correctly." 
</P>
<P>
 When Boulez first conducted the orchestral score in 1957 in Cologne, Germany, 
it also happened to be the first time he had faced a large orchestra. While the 
reviews spoke of a born conductor, Boulez thought something was very wrong but 
he says he was too inexperienced to tell if the problem was him as a conductor 
or composer. When he conducted it again many years later, in the late '70s in 
Paris, he knew. 
</P>
<P>
 "I stopped after one rehearsal," he explains. "I thought, 'No, that's not 
possible, I must write it again.' With the freedom I had acquired and the 
experience through conducting, I went back to it with less austerity, and on 
the contrary I expanded the work quite a lot. But it retains exactly the same 
frame of action." 
</P>
<P>
 The final form of "Le Visage Nuptial" is more complex, more elaborate, 
"definitely, definitely more sensual," and less violent, which pretty much 
characterizes Boulez today. He doesn't revert to polemics much anymore because, 
he says, he doesn't have to. He is not outside shouting to get in. He is the 
Establishment. Boulez feels that it is not what he wants that has changed, only 
that years of experience as a composer and conductor and administrator have 
taught him how to get it. 
</P>
<P>
 But experience has not made writing music any faster or easier for Boulez. 
Among his many projects are finishing the final sections of " . . . explosante 
/ fixe . . . " -- another piece that has been years evolving for years. He has 
missed several deadlines for the next set of "Notations," though he promises 
they will be ready for Chicago, which has programmed a number of Boulez works 
to celebrate his birthday next season. He has also promised to write an opera, 
to a libretto by the experimental German playwright Heiner Muller, for Daniel 
Barenboim to conduct in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor has Boulez lost any of his vision for the future. He maintains close 
contact with IRCAM and employs its latest technology. He has hand-picked the 
new music director of the Ensemble InterContemporain, David Robertson, a young 
conductor from Malibu, who is little known in the United States. He is involved 
with a new campus of the Paris Conservatory, where the Ensemble 
InterContemporain will be in residence and where he is working with architects 
and acousticians on a new modular concert hall. 
</P>
<P>
 And, as he has done all his life, he is lobbying for contemporary music to be 
a more integral part of contemporary life and thought. He complains that modern 
concert halls are old-fashioned, unchanged throughout his lifetime. He wants 
them more like museums, open long hours, full of resources -- books, scores, 
records, tapes. He is lobbying for the development of interactive CD-ROMs about 
contemporary music. He is always listening and glad to conduct new works that 
interest him. 
</P>
<P>
 He now pays particular attention to French composers between the ages of 35 
and 45. 
</P>
<P>
 "They interest me because theirs is a very different approach from my 
generation. Maybe it is less didactic than we had at their age, therefore it's 
interesting to look at the way they react. For instance, with some people I 
have almost 40 years difference. That's like me with Stravinsky, approximately 
40 years difference, two generations. If I am interested I conduct them." 
</P>
<P>
 And that is one more thing that has not changed over the years with Boulez -- 
his love for the word interesting. Maybe what he finds interesting has changed, 
but the word has been, and remains, his highest compliment. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pierre Boulez will conduct the Los Angeles Philharmonic at the Dorothy 
Chandler Pavilion Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m., next Sunday at 2:30, April 
28-30 at 8 p.m. and May 1 at 2:30. He also will give an open rehearsal Thursday 
at 10 a.m. For information, call (213) 850-2000.

PROFILE; THE AMY CHRONICLES; AFTER YEARS IN THE SHADOW OF HER PARENTS, NOT TO 
MENTION EX-HUSBAND STEVEN SPIELBERG, AMY IRVING IS NOW SECURE IN HER OWN 
IDENTITY. 'I'VE NEVER BEEN SO ALIVE,' SAYS STAR OF ARTHUR MILLER'S NEW PLAY, 
'BROKEN GLASS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK PACHECO, Patrick Pacheco is a regular contributor to Calendar who 
lives in New York. Judy Brennan, a regular contributor to Calendar, contributed

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sitting in a restaurant here, Amy Irving looks as if she could well be an 
extra from ex-husband Steven Spielberg's "Schindler's List." With no makeup, a 
babushka taming her frizzy brunet curls and a long gray shawl draped over her 
shoulders, the blue-eyed actress conveys a picture of severe beauty and 
intensity. 
</P>
<P>
 But Irving's character is a Jewish refugee not of an Eastern European pogrom 
but of 1938 Brooklyn. She has just finished a performance of "Broken Glass," 
Arthur Miller's new Broadway drama. And though Sylvia Gellburg, the character 
she plays, is 3,000 miles from the horrors of the incipient Nazi Holocaust, 
they are still very much present in her thoughts and dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first time I imagined Sylvia's nightmares in the play, I pictured Ralph 
Fiennes," Irving says, referring to the actor who played a Nazi officer in 
"Schindler's List." 
</P>
<P>
 Irving, interviewed after a Saturday matinee at the Long Wharf Theater, where 
the drama is trying out before bowing on Broadway next Sunday, continues: "This 
woman is sitting in Brooklyn but she's imagining herself in the situation of 
the Jews in Berlin after Kristallnacht. Steven's film immediately came to my 
mind because the images were so haunting." 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't take long for Spielberg's name to crop up. The surprise is that 
Irving is the one to bring it up, given the fact that a good part of the 
actress's life and career has been spent in the glare and the shadow of being 
first Spielberg's girlfriend; then his wife and the mother of their child, Max, 
and now the ex-Mrs. Spielberg, happily coupled with Brazilian film director 
Bruno Barreto, with whom she has another son, Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
 In that regard, Amy Irving has always been another sort of refugee, one who 
has escaped the distortions of Hollywood through periodic forays in the 
theater. Now, after the dismal failures of her movies "A Show of Force" (a 1990 
film directed by Barreto) and "Benefit of the Doubt" (1993), Irving has once 
again returned to a place that has been welcoming her since a 1980 Broadway 
debut in "Amadeus." While her ex-husband glories in unprecedented commercial 
and artistic success, the 40-year-old actress finds herself working for 
relatively little money at a small regional theater -- though she says she 
loves every torturous, nerve-racking moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's exciting, it's terrifying, and I've never been so alive," Irving says, 
sipping a glass of mineral water and nursing a swollen lower lip, the result of 
an accident that occurred in a blackout that ends the show. "I've never created 
a role for the theater before. You're given new pages, you try them, and they 
don't work and you feel so exposed. But everyone tells me: 'Be patient. We'll 
get there. This is the way the theater works.' " 
</P>
<P>
 (Indeed, the rigors of mounting a new play would take their toll in the 
succeeding weeks when, just before the play departed New Haven for Broadway, it 
was announced that David Dukes would replace Ron Silver in the lead role of Dr. 
Harry Hyman.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On first glance, Irving's choice for her return to the theater seems at odds 
with the astringent beauty and spunkiness that have imbued her previous roles 
onstage ("The Heidi Chronicles") and often in film ("Crossing Delancey," 
"Yentl"). Sylvia Gellburg is a Brooklyn woman stricken with a sudden hysteric 
paralysis. Harry Hyman, her doctor, uncovers some clues for the medical 
mystery: her near-psychic identification with the suffering of the Jews in 
Germany, which she obsessively reads about in the newspapers, and, more 
notably, her self-hating martinet of a husband. As she becomes increasingly 
emotionally involved with Hyman, Sylvia begins to realize that what she sees as 
the passivity of the European Jews echoes her marital resignation, sparking in 
her a personal uprising. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has a lot bubbling up in her," Irving says. "No one will ever think of me 
as a delicate, fragile woman after this play." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor would they think that if they ever met her in person. While Irving is 
agreeable when someone approaches her for an autograph in the restaurant, what 
she communicates most is clarity and directness. She doesn't suffer fools 
gladly. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, although Irving may share Sylvia Gellburg's moxie, as one character 
puts it, the similarities end there. Miller's description of the character in 
the play -- "She is in her mid-40s, a buxom, capable and warm woman" -- 
indicates the playwright and director John Tillinger decided to go in a 
different direction when they cast Irving. In fact, Dianne Wiest had initially 
been announced for the role but backed out because, Tillinger said, "she 
couldn't give it the time and energy that the role required." 
</P>
<P>
 "I suppose there are people who will still say she's too young for the part," 
Tillinger says of Irving. "But there's no question she has the right emotional 
makeup for this highly strung woman. We felt that those strengths would 
override any reservations that she wasn't physically right." 
</P>
<P>
 Irving got the chance to join the company, which also includes Ron Rifkin and 
Frances Conroy, in December when she received a copy of the play at the Santa 
Monica home she shares with Barreto, 4-year-old Gabriel, 8-year-old Max and 
Helena, Barreto's 17-year-old daughter by a previous marriage. Since Miller was 
not familiar with Irving's theater work, the producers were keen for her to fly 
to New York to audition for the playwright. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to hate this play," Irving says, alluding to the disruptions that 
doing the play would visit on her family. "But then I read it. I showed it to 
my mother (actress Priscilla Pointer) and she said, 'Go. Do it. Your family 
will survive.' " 
</P>
<P>
 On a December morning just after seeing a private screening of "Schindler's 
List," Irving flew to New York and auditioned. "How do you know this woman so 
well?" Miller asked of Irving after she had read the first scene of the play. 
Although she quickly won the part, there was still some question among the 
creative team as to whether Irving could pull it off. Makeup, after all, could 
only fade her beauty so much. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were all concerned," Irving says. "But I've had a lot of experience in 
my life. I have a lot to draw on. It's not just the obvious marriage f---ups. 
It's a lot of, you know, growing up . . . loss, whether it's through death, 
career disappointments, marriage failures. I've spent a lot of time exploring 
very strong issues with my father, very strong issues with Steven, very strong 
issues with my husband (she calls Barreto her husband, though they are not 
legally wed). I've had very intense relationships all along the way, and 
they've all, in one way or another, involved a loss of identity. I can't be 
more specific than that." 
</P>
<P>
 "Amy's a very complicated person," says Rifkin, who plays her husband in the 
drama and recommended her for the role. "There are a lot of layers to her. And 
the more you get to know her, the more layers you discover underneath those 
layers. She has the maturity that comes from knowing that life is full of 
surprises, some of them pleasant and some of them painful. Like any good actor, 
she can translate those deep feelings into her work. I think she's a lot more 
like Sylvia than anybody thought." 
</P>
<P>
 Irving struggled for her own identity from early on, as the daughter of 
Pointer and her husband, distinguished director Jules Irving. Irving's paternal 
grandfather was a Russian Jewish immigrant, and she says she has drawn on that 
heritage to create the Jewish characters she has played in "Crossing Delancey," 
"Yentl" and now "Broken Glass." 
</P>
<P>
 She was reared a Christian Scientist, however, and the family observed no 
religious customs or traditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not an advocate of organized religion," she says resolutely. "I really 
leave my children's religious education to their fathers. Max gets his sense of 
Jewishness from Steven; Gabriel gets his Catholicism from Bruno." 
</P>
<P>
 The altar in the Irving household was the stage. Along with her brother, 
David, now a film director and teacher, and her sister, Katie, who works with 
deaf children in Santa Fe, N.M., Irving literally grew up in the theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't imagine a more wonderful way of growing up," she says of her youth, 
spent first in San Francisco, where her father headed the prestigious Actor's 
Workshop, and then in New York, where he was appointed director of the Lincoln 
Center Repertory Theater. Pointer was a leading member of her husband's 
repertory of actors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of using baby-sitters, Mama would put us in the front row where she 
could watch us from the stage," Irving recalls. "My father was an amazing 
artistic director, and the values of the Actor's Workshop were special. It was 
about the work, not money or fame. Things were very disillusioning when I got 
out into the real world." 
</P>
<P>
 After studying at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art and the 
American Conservatory Theatre, Irving worked in the competitive arena of Los 
Angeles theater, where actors kept one eye cocked for a spot on "Starsky and 
Hutch." Despite her dismay at the bald ambition, Irving initially thrived in 
that environment. She was soon making a splashy film debut in Brian De Palma's 
"Carrie" (1976), which she followed with the director's "The Fury" (1978). 
</P>
<P>
 "The most shocking thing to me was that talent or training had little or 
nothing to do with it," Irving says. "The reason people were working was 
because they were a type or a look. I couldn't really complain, because my 
career was happening as fast as I might've wanted it to. Working with De Palma 
was great -- completely strange -- but great." 
</P>
<P>
 About this time, Irving met Spielberg through George Lucas (she had auditioned 
for but lost out on the part of Princess Leia in "Star Wars"). The attraction 
was instantaneous but volatile from the start, exacerbated by the director's 
growing profile. After several years together, the two split up in the early 
'80s. Irving gave up the role she was set to play in "Raiders of the Lost Ark" 
and took stock of her life in an adobe house high above Santa Fe. 
</P>
<P>
 "You start out being Jules Irving's daughter," Irving said at the time, "and 
you finally break away from that to become Amy Irving, and then you become 
Steven Spielberg's girlfriend, and, well, I was having an identity crisis. I 
had to take positive action and get a new sense of myself." 
</P>
<P>
 The positive action led her to the New York stage, earning good reviews and, 
more important, her exacting father's approval, when she took over the role of 
Constanza, Mozart's wife, in "Amadeus" in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Irving says it was one of the happiest times of her life, and more success 
followed in movies, including Barbra Streisand's "Yentl" (1983), for which she 
was nominated for an Academy Award as best supporting actress, and Joan Micklin 
Silver's "Crossing Delancey" (1988). 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to do 'Yentl' at first," Irving says now. "I thought Hadass was 
just this submissive and pretty little airhead, but Barbra's a hard woman to 
say no to." 
</P>
<P>
 Irving's successes on film and stage gave her enough confidence to resume her 
relationship with Spielberg in 1985. When she became pregnant with Max, the 
couple decided to tie the knot in a private civil ceremony in Santa Fe later 
that year. 
</P>
<P>
 While Spielberg continued to develop and oversee projects in his film empire, 
Irving opted largely for television ("Anastasia," "Far Pavilions") and theater 
("The Road to Mecca"). She received few film offers, but she did get a chance 
to try out a sultry vocal technique when she dubbed in the singing voice of 
Jessica Rabbit in 1988's "Who Framed Roger Rabbit," for which Spielberg was an 
executive producer. 
</P>
<P>
 The marriage, however, soon started to show the strains of an ambitious couple 
pursuing their private agendas. And Irving continued to rankle under her 
unofficial status as consort to the Prince of Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "During my marriage to Steven, I felt like a politician's wife," she says. 
"There were certain things expected of me that definitely weren't me. One of my 
problems is that I'm very honest and direct. You pay a price for that. But then 
I behaved myself and I paid a price too." 
</P>
<P>
 Irving made it clear, however, that it was she, more than her husband, who 
placed those pressures on herself. The marriage ended amicably in 1989 amid 
reports in the press of a divorce settlement of about $100 million. Spielberg 
married actress Kate Capshaw in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Irving almost immediately became involved with director Barreto ("Dona Flor 
and Her Two Husbands"). They met when he cast her for the role of a spirited 
Puerto Rican television reporter who uncovers political chicanery in "A Show of 
Force," which was critically panned and fared poorly at the box office. 
</P>
<P>
 Their relationship, however, bloomed. Suddenly, Irving was dancing samba and 
singing in full costume at Carnaval in Rio de Janeiro, speaking Portuguese in 
the couple's home in the coastal resort of Buzios, north of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I was just as surprised as everybody else," she says. "I didn't want 
to get involved that quickly, and Bruno and I tried to keep our relationship 
professional at first. But being exposed to this Brazilian world has enriched 
me in multiples. I've enjoyed it -- a lot ! This has been the happiest 
relationship of my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Barreto has been supportive of her professional life, even if that has meant 
occasionally uprooting family. But the film offers, somewhat to her chagrin, 
remain meager. Acknowledging that she finds the self-promotion necessary for 
stardom to be "hideous," Irving says that at the same time, she is frustrated 
by her lack of options. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was out there trying," she says. "I couldn't get meetings. I couldn't beg 
through the door." 
</P>
<P>
 Could Hollywood's cold shoulder have been caused, at least in part, by her 
split from the powerful Spielberg? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it hurt being Steven Spielberg's wife," she says, "and then it hurt 
being the ex-Mrs. Steven Spielberg. It was awkward for a while. I don't know 
why. I only know that I felt nonexistent." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Irving has had a reputation for being difficult with some 
producers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I absolutely never found that to be the case," says Micklin Silver, who 
directed Irving in what is widely considered to be her best film role, 
"Crossing Delancey." "Amy is a pleasure. She has a great delicacy as an actress 
that I appreciated. She was never on a star trip, always the professional and 
generous to a fault." 
</P>
<P>
 But Irving is the first to say that some producers wouldn't agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get along great with directors, but I think some producers would tell you 
I'm a pain," Irving notes. "They may say I'm tough to work with, but I have a 
great passion for what I do. I believe in fighting for it." 
</P>
<P>
 One production source at Warner Bros., which produced two of Irving's films 
("Crossing Delancey" and 1980's "Honeysuckle Rose"), agreed with Irving's 
assessment, saying that she was considered by some at the studio to be very 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian De Palma, on the other hand, says, "She was a delight to work with." 
Although De Palma used Irving in two films nearly back to back, he has not used 
her since. "She just wasn't right for the roles" in his other pictures. "But I 
would work with her again anytime." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he ever felt any implied pressure from his close friend Spielberg 
when working with Irving, De Palma laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was married to an actress (Nancy Allen) at the time whom Steven used in two 
of his films," he says, referring to "1941" and "I Wanna Hold Your Hand," which 
Spielberg produced. "Anybody who says that is ridiculous. Steven would never 
put pressure on anyone for something like that. Amy is a talent in her own 
right." 
</P>
<P>
 Irving says that at most the Spielberg factor is just one possible 
explanation: "There were other aspects; I'm not 20 years old, and I haven't 
been in blockbusters." 
</P>
<P>
 That's something of an understatement. Last summer's "Benefit of the Doubt" 
earned Irving some good reviews as a tough-talking blond cocktail waitress 
opposite Donald Sutherland, but the film, a thriller with heavy scenes of 
father-daughter incest, flopped. 
</P>
<P>
 Her most recent film, "Kleptomania," directed by Dan Boyd ("Twenty-One") and 
produced by Carol Curb Nemoy, in which Irving plays a spoiled socialite who 
also happens to be a kleptomaniac, may never see the light of day because of 
differences between the director and the producer. ("The urge to steal has a 
lot to do with a lack of love and loss of sexuality in her life," Irving says. 
"The character is very interesting . . . and far different from anything I've 
ever known.") 
</P>
<P>
 Irving has also finished a role in a "Twilight Zone" CBS movie that will air 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've gone from 'low-budget' movies to 'no-budget,' " she says with a rueful 
laugh. "I think 'Kleptomania' is the best work I've ever done. I put my heart 
and soul in that film, and it breaks my heart that it may never get released. 
And so you let go and move on, and just as my heart's breaking over that, 
Arthur Miller's asking me, 'How do you know this woman so well?' I wouldn't 
trade doing this play for the biggest film. 
</P>
<P>
 "People shouldn't waste time thinking about what happened to Amy," Irving 
says, a little snappishly. "I'm living in a very beautiful, intimate way. Maybe 
I'm less ambitious, but my life is so full. So excuse me for having an 
incredibly wonderful life." 
</P>
<P>
 After her run in "Broken Glass" ends, Irving plans to do a movie with a 
Brazilian friend, but she doesn't foresee working with either Spielberg or 
Barreto anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd do a movie with Steven," she says, "but I think it would be awkward for 
him. Our friendship is very valuable to us, and that would probably put a 
strain on it." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Spielberg's company, Amblin Entertainment, is producing Barreto's new 
film, "Casanova," starring Antonio Banderas. But while Irving maintains that 
she is "too old" for a part in the movie, she does say that she and her 
stepdaughter, Helena, plan to visit the set in Spain. "We're just going to 
watch from the sidelines and drool over Banderas." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Irving has been happy to be a homemaker and mother. Her concerns 
these days include helping her young boys navigate the shoals of celebrity as 
they show indications of following in the footsteps of their famous parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gabriel hasn't really mentioned it, but he's already an actor," she says. 
"Every once in a while Max says he wants to be in a movie, but I won't let him. 
If he's serious about it, let him get some training first. Let him earn it. 
Just don't go and be a celebrity. He's famous enough. He really wants to be a 
director. God knows, he's got a hard act to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to expose them to enough so that they realize there are other 
choices," she adds a little hopefully. 
</P>
<P>
 More than most celebrities, Irving has been especially successful in 
protecting her public image, even if she has emerged as something of an ice 
princess in the press. Lucky, to be sure, but also certain of her prerogatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a princess," she says. "There are a lot of givens that don't 
necessarily make for happiness. I've had a lot of s--- to swallow and stuff to 
work out. I have scars nobody knows about. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, my life looks hunky-dory to someone living in Tucson. They read (the 
tabloids) -- lies about things that didn't happen and things they say I've 
gotten that I haven't gotten. But if I don't have pain, I don't grow. I like to 
take chances. I like to get hurt. I like to jump in and have it slapped back in 
my face. Otherwise, I'll just be like Sylvia Gellburg. Life will just close 
over you like a grave."

AN AMERICAN EXPORT SUCCESS STORY; IN EUROPE, AUSTRALIA AND RUSSIA, POPULAR 
AMERICAN SERIES ARE BEING RECAST AND RE-SHOT AS HOME-GROWN PROGRAMMING. IN MANY 
CASES, AUDIENCES DON'T HAVE A CLUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD COVINGTON, Richard Covington is a free-lance writer based in Paris. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The rangy former soccer star-turned-housekeeper waltzes blithely into the 
bathroom, towel in hand, and stops dead in his tracks. His boss -- a leggy 
advertising executive, normally high-powered but considerably less so reclined 
stark naked in her bath -- lets out a scream that would have undone the 
starchiest of her boarding school matrons. He retreats, she scrambles for 
cover, glaring. The laugh track explodes. 
</P>
<P>
 If there's an odd sense of deja vu to this scene, it's for good reason. 
Substitute a stockier Tony Danza as an ex-baseball player and Judith Light as a 
Madison Avenue advertising executive and "Who's the Boss?" comes clearly into 
focus. 
</P>
<P>
 In Britain, across Europe, Australia and even Russia, American television 
series are being resurrected, recast and re-shot as home-grown programming. 
"Who's the Boss?" becomes "Ein Job fur Leben" on RTL in Germany and "The Upper 
Hand" on ITV's Channel 3 in Britain. "Maude" turns up in France 2 as "Maggie." 
Italian viewers tune into "L'Ultimo Minuto," oblivious to the fact that "Rescue 
911" is the American precursor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sesame Street" is transferred from a Brooklyn brownstone to a train station 
in its Norwegian adaptation and to a bazaar in the Arab version -- two of the 
14 different international takes on the PBS children's series. And in Russia 
and Australia, audiences shadow investigative reporters copied directly from 
"60 Minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 This latest wave of American television exports is reformatted , as opposed to 
dubbed programs. They use local actors and sets and are shot from the original 
scripts, which have been translated and adapted by local writers and producers. 
In many cases, audiences have not a clue that they are watching recycled clones 
of American shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "If 'The Upper Hand' were a car," offers the show's producer, Christopher 
Walker, in an irresistible metaphor, "it looks and feels British and drives 
like a British car, but under the hood is a huge American V-8 engine. It's the 
engineering that's American, the pace and the drive that moves the stories 
along. The factories out in Hollywood producing these shows know what they're 
all about. We're benefiting from that engineering." 
</P>
<P>
 For years, the flow had been in the opposite direction, with U.S. television 
producers liberally adapting British series -- "Man About the House" became 
"Three's Company," "Till Death Do Us Part" turned into "All in the Family" and 
"Steptoe and Son" was reborn as "Sanford and Son." 
</P>
<P>
 Several years ago, however, Walker began casting about for new series for 
Britain's ITV network, the largest private television chain, and wound up in 
Hollywood. "Without making any bones about it," he says from his London studio, 
"there was a dearth of new concepts here. Let's be honest: If we were brimming 
with wonderful, comic ideas, we would not have bothered hopping on a plane to 
go looking elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Walker settled on "Who's the Boss?" because of its class and ethnic conflicts, 
its sexual tensions and the flight from the inner city that motivates the Danza 
character -- all elements with which British audiences could intuitively 
identify. "It also had kids in pivotal roles," he explains, "and this was 
especially appealing since it was so rare for British sitcoms." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Upper Hand" has scored an enormous success, garnering 10 million viewers 
every week for the past 3 1/2 years, frequently making it the No. 1 situation 
comedy in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Long pilloried by the guardians of European culture but lapped up by the 
European consumer, dubbed U.S. television series have been slipping of late. 
Local audiences no longer sit rapt watching the antics of characters, plots and 
sets that may be light years from their daily lives and concerns. For just 
these reasons, reformatted shows have been surging forth like velociraptors. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question that reformatting has been growing exponentially over the 
past few years," says Paul Bricault, a Los Angeles-based media analyst with 
Paul Kagan Associates. "A good ballpark guess would be that it accounts for at 
least $60 million-$70 million of the total $1 billion of overseas television 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a number of reasons for this growth. Dubbed American series are no 
longer scoring the best ratings and European broadcasters that are now making 
substantial revenues can afford to develop programming." 
</P>
<P>
 Another less obvious incentive is that reformatted shows neatly sidestep 
European quotas for American-produced series. In France, for example, 60% of 
programs must be produced in Europe. Since the reformatted series qualify as 
European productions, they enable European broadcasters to air American-style 
programs without filling their quotas. At the same time, American distributors 
benefit from extending the market longevity -- not to mention the profit 
margins -- of American series that might otherwise be restricted. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on your point of view, this reformatting phenomenon is either the 
latest glove across the face or the great video hope, a bridge enabling 
fledgling local programming to gain its footing. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are the first step in national production," says Nicholas Bingham, 
president of Columbia-TriStar International Television. "They help develop an 
industry which can obviously compete with American imports." 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia-TriStar is among the most active reformatters, licensing "Married . . 
. With Children," "Who's the Boss?" and "Maude," among other series. Other 
major packagers include NBC, CBS, the Dutch company Endemol Entertainment, 
Monaco-based Grundy Worldwide and U.S. games developer Fremantle International. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reformatting is a very important part of our strategy," Bingham explains. "We 
cannot expect to remain exporters of American programs forever; we need to 
become more involved in promoting local productions." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sesame Street" has been reformatting its shows for 20 years, and its 14 
international editions appear in 30 different countries. The American producers 
studiously avoid any hint of cultural or religious bias -- down to eliminating 
U.S. cars and flags -- and collaborate with local broadcasters on matching the 
educational focus of the shows to each country's school curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Germany, the emphasis is on cognitive learning, numbers and math," 
explains "Sesame Street's" Baxter Urist. "But next door in Holland, the Dutch 
concentrate on Dutch culture. They want to ensure that recent immigrants 
understand the language of their adopted country." 
</P>
<P>
 Formatting setups vary genre to genre and country to country. Game show 
adaptations, for example, are the most straightforward, sitcoms the most 
problematic. King World's "Wheel of Fortune" airs in 25 countries with very 
little variation. "We provide the local broadcasters with what we call the 
bible," explains King World president Fred Cohen, "and they follow the game 
plan -- how to get contestants, the questions, etc. Once the show is up and 
running, we check it every few months to insure they're adhering to our 
production values. It's much like being a master licensee for Benetton or 
McDonald's." 
</P>
<P>
 Reality shows generally undergo more radical surgery. CBS' hour-long "Rescue 
911" appears in Italy as a three-hour marathon titled "L'Ultimo Minuto," with 
the original protagonists of the dramatized re-creation brought in for live 
interviews before a studio audience. "It has the look and feel of a variety 
show as much as a reality show," says James Warner, president of CBS 
Enterprises. "That's the custom; that's what Italians are used to watching. 
</P>
<P>
 "Typically on these shows, we change the title, provide access to all of our 
segments, provide production expertise. We encourage our clients to find a 
local host and produce their local segments. Some countries dub our segments, 
some subtitle them, using the same video shot in the U.S. Their segments mirror 
ours so they all seem to have come from the same source. 
</P>
<P>
 "For CBS, reformatting is definitely growing. From our standpoint, it's the 
most effective way to market the reality programming that has taken hold 
internationally. Overseas broadcasters are looking for ways to access our 
material, and giving it a local identity does that." 
</P>
<P>
 Not incidentally, these adaptations give new -- and very lucrative -- life to 
old formula series. Licensing fees for situation comedies run around $10,000 
per episode, according to Bricault; game shows around $7,000, and reality shows 
close to $5,000. When production costs are added on, a reformatted episode of 
"Who's the Boss?" in Germany, for example, will run about $200,000, compared to 
$50,000 for the dubbed version. 
</P>
<P>
 To Helmut Thoma, managing director of RTL, Germany's largest private 
television network, the quadrupling in price is worth it. "A dubbed series is 
perceived as foreign and has only a limited ratings potential," Thoma points 
out. "But if you turn this same foreign series into a German version, the 
ratings potential is two or three times higher." 
</P>
<P>
 Given the fact that two of the series RTL has reformatted so far -- "Who's the 
Boss?" and "Married . . . With Children" -- have bombed, these are the words of 
a true believer. (Encouraged by the success of another foreign adaptation, "The 
Restless Years," an Australian series developed by Grundy, Thoma is ready to 
embark next on a reformatted "Maude.") 
</P>
<P>
 The RTL executive is the first to admit that the local versions suffered from 
fundamental problems. "There's no tradition of sitcoms here," Thoma explains. 
"Finding the writers in Germany is very difficult and the German actors simply 
didn't understand the scripts. Even the sets looked more American than German. 
The audiences could not relate to the shows at all." 
</P>
<P>
 With "Who's the Boss?" Thoma found frankly that "the German actors were not as 
good as the Americans." The hybrid set posed another stumbling block. John 
Barber, the show's American producer, recalls his dismay at befuddled German 
audiences recoiling from it, protesting: "What is this? It's an American house 
with German furniture." The final shot in the foot was the network's 
ill-advised slot for the reformatted weekly show -- three hours after the daily 
dubbed version. Ignominiously, the German adaptation drew consistently poorer 
ratings, and the German press ridiculed it with headlines reading: "Beware 
forgery." 
</P>
<P>
 The adaptation process was fraught with growing pains and cultural confusions, 
starting with the series' initial premise. "I have to be a bit careful about 
stereotyping the German sense of humor, but the Germans can be extremely 
rigid," Bingham delicately observes. "I remember one conversation where someone 
objected, 'Ah, but in Germany, women do not have male housekeepers.' And we 
answered, quite tongue in cheek, 'Really, how surprising, in Britain and the 
United States, nearly all women have male housekeepers.' We had a little 
difficulty explaining to them that's part of the fun and fantasy of the thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The next major hurdle was training German scriptwriters how to write for this 
new animal -- the totally unfamiliar situation comedy -- using German actors 
who had never before played in them. "Part of the process that makes American 
sitcoms so contemporary is giving feedback to the writers on how the show is 
actually coming to life," explains Barber. "This proved very confusing to the 
writers and the cast, since in German TV, the finished script is considered 
untouchable. Still, they ended up adapting quite well, taking risks no one had 
ever asked them to take before." 
</P>
<P>
 The series was produced in Berlin with a cast drawn from all over the country. 
Despite a fleeting resemblance to Tony Danza, his German counterpart lacked 
Danza's energy and stage presence. "We had to find ways of protecting him more 
so he would not be overwhelmed and would be as attractive to women as Danza," 
says Barber. 
</P>
<P>
 In the adaptation process, American institutions are Germanized: Thanksgiving 
dinner might become the pre-Lenten carnival celebration Fasching ; a suburban 
outdoor barbecue set instead in a beer garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally speaking, about 75% of the jokes go over with foreign audiences with 
simple translation. But as Bingham points out, "It's easier to do sitcoms that 
are not full of one-liners, but where the emphasis is on the situation more 
than the jokes driving the comedy." 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, what seem to be sure-fire routines in one country draw an 
absolute blank in others. "Sesame Street's" Urist recalls one memorably 
frustrating meeting with producers of the Mexican version screening a skit 
entitled "What's Alive." 
</P>
<P>
 "Tully was hopping up and down, crying out: 'Pick me, pick me!' We were dying 
with laughter and the Mexicans were stone-faced. How do you teach a sense of 
humor?" he asks rhetorically. 
</P>
<P>
 For the British "Who's the Boss?" Walker ultimately had to jettison all the 
scripts that were centered around American high schools. "The whole culture of 
cheerleaders, proms and football jocks doesn't readily translate to an English 
environment," he explains. By contrast, episodes where the ex-footballer is 
ridiculed at an exclusive boarding school and an equally exclusive golf club 
were another story. The producer found that "shows based on social snobbery 
worked better in Britain than in the original." 
</P>
<P>
 "People say that Brits and Americans are divided by a common language, but a 
lot of the jokes did transfer. The main thing I toned down were the vulgar 
elements -- that sort of slapstick, physical humor." 
</P>
<P>
 If the American formula continues to draw audiences, why not simply -- and 
more cheaply -- make a close study of American series and write your own? By 
and large, this has not happened -- for the practical reason that this 
imitative, unauthorized borrowing generally does not work as well. In cases 
where it does, it has struck fear and resentment in the executive suites and 
has undoubtedly nudged American distributors to speed up the pace of licensing 
reformat deals. NBC's Todd Leavitt, executive vice president of NBC 
International, can barely contain his contempt for European -- and particularly 
French -- spinoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the dubbed version of 'Saved by the Bell' proved such a great success 
in France, there was a whole crew of 'derivative' products like 'Helene et les 
Garcons' ('Helen and the Boys') that were French versions of our shows, without 
the time and attention to plot we take," he complains from the network's 
Burbank office. "They would shoot an episode in two days and eventually the 
show gobbled up 60% of the audience share. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where our shows use between eight to 15 writers doing 22-24 episodes a year, 
the French situation comedy will have two to four writers churning out 50 
episodes and more a year. Where we spend north of $600,000 per episode, the 
French will spend the equivalent of $125,000." 
</P>
<P>
 Voila : another convincing argument encouraging American distributors to turn 
to format licensing -- heading foreign producers off at the pass while 
simultaneously stretching out the profitable life of long-running series. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big advantage to reformatting American shows," says Peter Brouwer, 
president of Endemol Entertainment, B.V., "is that you know you have a proven 
success on your hands." Endemol's latest project is an upcoming adaptation of 
"The Mary Tyler Moore Show" for the German network RTL Plus. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a whole new way of working with American distributors," Brouwer 
maintains. "It's a shift in the industry that the European Commission very much 
favors. They want to take advantage of American television expertise and let 
European writers and producers master the story structures themselves. It's a 
great boon to the European television industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key to success," he adds, alluding to the failure of earlier reformatted 
series in Germany, "is not to let audiences know they are watching reformatted 
American shows."

COULD IT BE MAGIC?; THE LAWNS ARE ALIVE WITH THE SOUND OF MANILOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With young children across the country playing Barry Manilow's "Thumbelina" 
songs over and over and over, as kids are wont to do with favorite music, it's 
easy to imagine their otherwise sweet and charming mothers being driven into 
homicidal rages. 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds like an idea for a John Waters movie, eh? 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, it's Manilow's sunny "Daybreak" that is sort of the theme song for 
fussy housewife Kathleen Turner's psychopathic rampage in Waters' new "Serial 
Mom." And if that's not enough Manilow for you, Mike Newell's sloshed English 
wedding-goers are driven to distraction by a "Frightful Folk Duo" performing an 
incessantly bubbly version of the schlock-pop god's "Can't Smile Without You" 
at the first nuptial of his "Four Weddings and a Funeral." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, folks, it's Manilow season at the movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Open season. 
</P>
<P>
 What's Manilow think about all this? He's not talking. His spokeswoman says 
he's too busy rehearsing those "Thumbelina" numbers for his upcoming concert 
tour. (Maybe they should check purses for sharp objects at each show.) 
</P>
<P>
 But by all accounts Manilow must have a good perspective about his reputation 
as the embodiment of all that is white bread and wholesome in pop music. In 
fact, for years he's been laughing all the way to the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish every person who ever hummed ("Daybreak") would come to my movie," 
says Waters, dreaming wistfully of the kind of cushy retirement in his 
Baltimore home that such massive popularity would bring. 
</P>
<P>
 Waters insists that he's laughing with Manilow -- who's close pals with 
Suzanne Somers, who has a funny role as herself in the flick -- and not at him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard he has a great sense of humor -- he started out working with Bette 
Midler and I'm sure I'd love him," says Waters, who has never met Manilow. "I 
just wanted the music to be extreme -- but a different kind of extreme music -- 
and to me that song is extreme suburbia. I like the song." 
</P>
<P>
 He also says he delighted in pairing the song on the soundtrack album with 
"Gas Chamber," performed by the rowdy female rock group L7, cast in the film as 
the fictional group Camel Lips. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting permission to use Manilow's song actually proved easy, Waters says. It 
was much harder to get clearance to use the song "Tomorrow" from "Annie," and 
the name of the Franklin Mint, two other symbols of Middle American values. 
</P>
<P>
 "For 'Annie' it was more difficult," he says of "Tomorrow," which figures in a 
particularly humorous murder. "Especially when we sent them the script pages. 
They'd asked, 'How's it used?' 'Well, someone's singing it and, um, something 
happens.' We try to be vague. It never works." 
</P>
<P>
 In Manilow's case, his spokeswoman, Susan Dobow, says that the singer "said it 
was OK as long as (its use) wasn't mean-spirited." She noted that Manilow also 
approved a long-running gag about him on "Murphy Brown," in which the 
Manilow-hating Murphy was dismayed to discover that his music was the only 
thing that would calm her infant. Manilow even made a guest appearance last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Waters admits that he was not really a Manilow fan before deciding to use one 
of his songs in the film and had to do a little research to find just the right 
tune. 
</P>
<P>
 "You should have seen the guy's face in the record store where I always shop 
when I had like five Manilow albums at once," Waters says. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he is something of a fan, and among his treasures is an autographed 45 of 
the original recording that Turner gave him after the film was completed. 
</P>
<P>
 And what of the parents being run 'round the bend by the "Thumbelina" 
soundtrack? 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe they can put on 'Daybreak,' " says Waters, "and relieve their 
tensions."

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: RELUCTANT MACY'S RAINS ON 
NEW 'MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET'S' PARADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE GALBRAITH

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Miracle on Michigan Avenue"? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, the movie won't be titled that, but that's where the remake of "Miracle 
on 34th Street" is taking place -- half a continent away from New York at the 
School of the Art Institute of Chicago, of all places, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 And as if that weren't sacrilege enough, the Grinch also came early for John 
Hughes, whose Hughes Entertainment is producing the movie. He was unable to 
interest Macy's Department Store -- at Herald Square (on 34th Street) in 
Manhattan -- in participating in the remake of the classic 1947 production that 
has become a Christmastime viewing ritual alongside "It's a Wonderful Life." 
</P>
<P>
 No matter that Macy's is integral to the story of "Miracle," in which Edmund 
Gwenn was so convincing as Kris Kringle that cynical little Natalie Wood came 
to believe in Santa Claus. The retailer just wasn't interested. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel the original stands on its own and could not be improved upon," said 
Laura Melillo, a spokeswoman for Macy's. 
</P>
<P>
 The tip-off came last week when an unseasonable parade of Macy's Thanksgiving 
Day Parade-like balloons (actually, rather smaller versions of them, said one 
observer) were spotted floating down Central Park West carried by young adults 
in green and red costumes. A closer look in at the action in front of the 
cameras revealed a two-shot with Sir Richard Attenborough talking to Elizabeth 
Perkins. 
</P>
<P>
 In the remake for 20th Century Fox, Attenborough takes the part of Kringle 
(which won Gwenn an Oscar) and Perkins has Maureen O'Hara's role as the mom and 
Macy's advertising executive. Six-year-old Mara Wilson, the littlest child in 
"Mrs. Doubtfire," fills Wood's shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in 1946, Macy's allowed director George Seaton to roam the store's 
hallways to capture the holiday shopping hustle and bustle. There is 
unconfirmed speculation that Macy's did not want to cooperate this go-round 
because it is nearly $6 billion in debt and didn't want to be in the spotlight 
until its expected emergence from bankruptcy next year. The retailer's 
spokeswoman declined to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
 So Macy's will be known as Coles Department Store in the remake, which is 
being directed by Les Mayfield. As for the rest of the New York settings -- 
there aren't any. After the parade shots were finished, the whole production 
moves to Chicago, Hughes' hometown, this week. 
</P>
<P>
 And instead of doing some location filming in a Macy's stand-in -- notably 
Marshall Field -- the crew will instead transform the ballroom of what is now 
the School of the Art Institute of Chicago into sales space with props supplied 
by Marshall Field. Other Macy's scenes will be shot on sound stages. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted it to be 'Miracle on State Street,' " said store spokeswoman Laura 
Sandall, commenting on past discussions with Hughes to film at Marshall Field's 
flagship store on State Street. "We hoped they'd film here." 
</P>
<P>
 The school's ballroom is described by the institute's public affairs director 
Joyce Rowe as "very ornate" and having gilded high ceilings and stained glass 
windows facing Michigan Avenue. The golden Hollywood era of Macy's, apparently, 
is over.

UP TO 'SPEED'; CHILLS, THRILLS, MAYHEM, AND STILL ONLY $1.10 A RIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDY BRENNAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This summer's "Speed," dubbed "Die Hard"-on-a-bus by those who have seen it, 
has gathered so much positive buzz that 20th Century Fox has already begun 
discussions of a sequel. 
</P>
<P>
 In the words of one Fox source, "they're banking the store on this one," with 
the studio already pushing up its Aug. 5 release date to June 10. 
</P>
<P>
 The last overly ambitious producer to begin hustling a sequel before the first 
even hit the screen was Arnon Milchan's New Regency Productions and its "Made 
in America" for Warner Bros. But that $25 million-plus offbeat romantic comedy, 
which starred Whoopi Goldberg and Ted Danson, sputtered last summer, garnering 
only $41.8 in domestic box office, far short of Warners' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox isn't fazed by the "Made in America" experience, although studio insiders 
and "Speed" producer Mark Gordon say that they are broaching the sequel subject 
cautiously. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources involved with the production say that studio executives met last week 
with representatives of two of the film's stars, Keanu Reeves and Sandra 
Bullock, to begin discussions on a sequel. 
</P>
<P>
 While Gordon says he and Jan De Bont, who makes his directorial debut, are 
excited about the film's possibilities, he cautions, "We just want to get this 
one out first. There is always talk about sequels and there are characters in 
this movie that could easily go into a sequel. But for now, we want to focus on 
this one doing well." 
</P>
<P>
 De Bont is the veteran action cinematographer who shot "Die Hard," "Basic 
Instinct," "Lethal Weapon 3" and "The Hunt for Red October." 
</P>
<P>
 The film, which cost roughly $25 million, is an action-packed thriller, minus 
much of the gore and violence of the genre, thereby appealing to women, early 
test screenings show. "There is violence, but not to the level most people are 
used to seeing," says one Fox executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Driving Graham Yost's story is Jack Traven (Reeves), a Los Angeles cop and 
member of the SWAT team, who must disengage a bomb placed on a speeding L.A. 
bus by sociopath Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper) and his crime pal Harry (Jeff 
Daniels). 
</P>
<P>
 As the bus speeds through streets, freeways and tunnels of the city's new 
Metro Rail system -- the speedometer can't drop below 50 m.p.h. or it will 
trigger the explosion -- Traven enlists the help of passenger Annie (Bullock), 
while two bad guys threaten mayhem to other transit lines. There are plenty of 
breathtaking sequences, including Traven trying a little bus-hopping at high 
speeds. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a movie where a lot of people get killed," says Gordon of the 
picture, which is in post-production. "It's wildly exciting, but not a lot of 
violence and that's why we think it appeals to women. But you'll find out soon 
-- the trailers will be on screens everywhere in the next 10 days."

QUILTING BEE; AN AMERICAN TALE, HUMAN DIVISION, FROM SPIELBERG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDY BRENNAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trade mah-jongg for quilting. Switch mother-daughter relationships to aunties' 
marriages over the ages. And forget the cross-cultural barriers. 
</P>
<P>
 And, bingo, you have "The Joy Luck Club" a la 1994.It's called "The Making of 
an American Quilt," a book written by Whitney Otto that is being produced on 
the big screen by Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment and directed by 
Jocelyn Morehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Writer Jane Anderson is currently adapting Otto's work for the screen. It will 
be an ensemble piece with six or seven major roles for actresses 50 and older. 
</P>
<P>
 Morehouse, who lives in Australia, jokes that she has this "deeply wonderful 
fax relationship" with the Los Angeles-based Anderson, as they stitch their way 
through the rewrite. If all goes well, Morehouse hopes to be in production this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an unbelievably, beautiful story about wisdom, true love and hope. 
Yes, it's a bit like 'Joy Luck Club,' but instead of stories about mothers and 
daughters it is a story about the loves of their lives," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Tailored around the pending marriage of a young woman named Finn, the story 
opens with the bride-to-be hoping to sort out her premarital doubts with a 
visit to her grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
 When she arrives, she finds that her grandmother, her elderly friends and 
grand-aunts are basting together her wedding gift -- a friendship quilt, to 
which each contributes a square. 
</P>
<P>
 Amblin expects to begin casting in the coming weeks. "You know, there is a lot 
of comedy in the script. These women are a bunch of crusty old broads with 
wonderful stories to tell," says Morehouse. "They are roles any actress would 
want. And you know, the phone has already started to ring."

'MMM MMM MMM' SAYS IT ALL; THE UNLIKELY SUCCESS OF CRASH TEST DUMMIES' 
ENIGMATIC SONG PROPELS THE CANADIAN BAND'S SECOND ALBUM UP THE MAINSTREAM POP 
CHARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN, Richard Cromelin writes about pop music for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A boy's hair turns white from the shock of an auto accident. A young girl's 
schoolmates discover that her body is covered with birthmarks. Another boy is 
taken to church, where he watches as his parents flop around on the floor in a 
religious ecstasy. 
</P>
<P>
 These three cryptic vignettes, set in a mock-solemn, deliberate musical 
framework and intoned by a rough, bottom-feeding bass-baritone, form the Crash 
Test Dummies' enigmatic but evocative song "Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm," the leading edge 
of the Canadian band's unlikely penetration of the mainstream pop charts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mmm" has helped boost "God Shuffled His Feet," the band's second album, to 
the brink of the Top 10 in the national album sales chart. The video for the 
song is a frequent sight on the music channels, and the group recently 
performed on "Saturday Night Live." They'll open for Elvis Costello at the 
Universal Amphitheatre on May 11 and 13 and Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre on May 
14. 
</P>
<P>
 The hit single's title is drawn from its hummed chorus -- a haunting, wordless 
expression of ambiguity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, the last thing I wanted to do was present the listener with some 
kind of tidy moral message about what it's like to be a child," says Brad 
Roberts, the group's leader. "I think that would be condescending and pedantic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think life is a complicated thing and there's plenty of gray areas and not 
too many black-and-white areas, and writing pat, easy answers to problems would 
be trite and didactic." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not a surprise that Roberts, 30, sounds like an academic when he gets 
rolling like this. He was preparing to return to the University of Winnipeg as 
a graduate student in English literature a few years ago when he was 
sidetracked into music. 
</P>
<P>
 In rock 'n' roll, where impulsiveness, immediacy and expressive release are 
the prized values, Roberts is an intriguing anomaly -- a self-described "icy 
rationalist" with a literary take on songwriting and a meticulous musical 
methodology. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't often write from life experience in a direct way," says Roberts, 
sitting in the band's tour bus outside the Ventura Theatre, where they are to 
perform in a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing shorts and a black sweat shirt, his falling hair cut straight across 
at shoulder level, he could pass for one of the beach-town fans who will fill 
the theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "I write about things that I think about and things that I've read about and 
things that I wonder about," he continues. "Off the top of my head, God, sex 
and death would be things that seem to crop up several times. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "It would be very easy for those themes to be heavy-handed and annoying if 
they weren't handled with a certain amount of levity. I find existential, Angst 
-ridden lyrics to be pretty tiresome pretty quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts used to think that disc jockeys played the records that they liked. 
Now he can tell you the locations of the album-adult-alternative format radio 
stations closest to the Los Angeles market. 
</P>
<P>
 The Crash Test leader's crash course in Music Biz 101 began when Canadian 
record companies launched a bidding war for his services after his demo tape 
made the rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Up until then, Roberts had been in Winnipeg bar bands, mostly playing other 
acts' songs just for fun while he was a student majoring in English literature 
and philosophy. He'd studied music for much of his life, but it was a visit to 
the Winnipeg Folk Festival after graduation that changed his plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw Lyle Lovett playing some workshops, and I was very captivated by what 
he was doing. I liked the irony, I liked the quirky sensibility, I liked the 
marriage of unconventionality with a very conventional form of music, i.e. 
country music. And it really gave me the urge to try writing on my own." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts wrote four songs and recorded a demo tape that made its way to the 
Canadian labels. When he saw their interest escalating, he hired a lawyer, put 
together a permanent band and started figuring out how the business works -- 
another example of his disciplined approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think some artists are alienated by that whole process," he says. "They 
feel as soon as you start applying the word product to what they do that 
somehow their integrity has been pulled out from under their feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just think that's completely naive. I mean, I don't target a market when 
I'm writing. . . . But once the record's been made, then it's time to start 
thinking about who's gonna play it. If you want to maintain any kind of control 
over your career and your destiny, you better bloody well figure out what's 
going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Arista Records signed the band (Roberts, keyboardist Ellen Reid, mandolinist 
and harmonica player Benjamin Darvill, drummer Michel Dorge and Roberts' 
brother Dan on bass) and released its first album, "The Ghosts That Haunt Me," 
in 1991. It didn't make much of a mark, but the follow-up, "God Shuffled His 
Feet," proved a very different kind of album when it came out last October. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts' humorous accounts of the physical body's rise and fall, and his 
reflections on the metaphysical (the title song recounts an oddly touching 
impasse between the Supreme Being and his human creatures in the Garden of 
Eden) are accompanied by music whose subtle modulations in texture and key 
instill an element of surprise and tension in the simple-sounding pop 
structures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say the quirkiness of the material is both a strong point and a 
problem for us," says Roberts. "It's a problem to the extent that simply 
talking a (radio) program director into adding the record can be a tough sell. 
Most of the time . . . the song goes through the radio station's music meeting 
and they just go, 'What the hell is that?' " 
</P>
<P>
 But the relatively new, fairly free-form format known as triple-A -- for 
"album-adult-alternative" -- proved to be a perfect steppingstone to the 
mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Roberts, "Once it's on the radio, then the fact that the record's a bit 
quirky becomes a strong point, because people do actually react and they phone 
in and say what is that? . . . That's kind of how it's gone for us." 
</P>
<P>
 It's time for Roberts to join the rest of the band for a pre-concert dinner. 
Out on the sidewalk he leans into the bus door, and after a brief struggle 
manages to get it locked. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts heads toward the theater, but instead of going to the stage door, he 
makes a wrong turn into the lobby. Though it's two hours before show time, the 
room is full of young fans, and when they spot him they shout greetings and 
reach out to shake his hand. Roberts stiffens slightly and speeds up, climbing 
the stairs to the balcony in search of the band and his meal. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would be the result of too much MTV," he says of the commotion he's 
caused downstairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts is a friendly, dryly witty man, but he seems utterly uncomfortable 
with the attention that comes to pop music performers in the age of music 
television. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, I used to relish the anonymity of coming to America, because we 
weren't as well-known and it was nice to get a respite," he had said earlier. 
"But of course part and parcel of the anonymity was a lack of record sales . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 "I like writing music and recording music . . . and that costs a lot of money. 
So for me the annoyances of being that heavily saturated into the public eye is 
more than compensated for by the fact that I know that I can go and make 
records. Because that's really a treat, and that's not something that I could 
have ever hoped to be able to do on my own."

TRI-CITIES WATER DISTRICT PR PUSH IS MAKING WAVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For decades, a small, little-known agency worked quietly to deliver water to a 
small group of South County communities without fanfare. Until now. 
</P>
<P>
 No longer content with its obscurity, the Tri-Cities Municipal Water District 
recently launched a full-scale, $100,000 publicity campaign, put a Washington 
lobbyist on a $4,000 monthly retainer and began an intense local promotion. 
</P>
<P>
 The object of this public relations effort is the district's new and unusual 
arrangement with the Marine Corps. Although still in the environmental study 
stage, the agreement would allow civilians to share Camp Pendleton's 
underground water supply and provide South County with a new source of water 
and a basin for storage in emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 While most South County officials laud the project, Tri-Cities has found that 
its new notoriety has sparked criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 Many South County officials look at the publicity campaign -- $31,000 was 
spent on it last month alone -- as a thinly disguised ploy to buy the district 
a future. Tri-Cities is one of four water districts that the Orange County 
Grand Jury has targeted for consolidation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This project with the Marines is simply a Tri-Cities survival kit," said Dana 
Point Councilman Mike Eggers. "They're just trying to save their necks." 
</P>
<P>
 William C. Mecham, the water district board president, counters that the board 
is only doing what it was elected to do by the public: deliver water to South 
County as cheaply as possible. With water prices skyrocketing, long-ignored 
underground water has become a new valuable resource for districts around the 
state, Mecham said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every penny we will spend will be reimbursed to us in the form of water," 
said Mecham, a property management executive who was a San Clemente councilman 
for nine years. "We are spending money because this is a project that needs to 
be in the public eye with facts, not innuendo or misinformation." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the district's harshest critics comes from within its own five-member 
board. Ray L. Benedicktus, a retired engineer who worked for the giant 
Metropolitan Water District of Southern California for 28 years, has fought 
with his fellow board members to slow down the efforts on the $6-million Camp 
Pendleton project. 
</P>
<P>
 Although still months from being final, the district has spent nearly $94,000 
on the project this year, much of it on recent publicity, Benedicktus said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, this is a valuable project, but it is going to be very expensive and 
there are questions about the water quality," said Benedicktus of Capistrano 
Beach. "We need to slow all the spending down, finish the environmental 
studies, and see what kind of recommendation the grand jury makes. We may not 
be around that much longer." 
</P>
<P>
 But Benedicktus' criticisms go further. He led a long fight to get district 
directors off $500 monthly health benefits although two -- Mecham and Craig 
Strickland -- continue to collect. 
</P>
<P>
 He also maintains that the district has no business spending $4,000 a month to 
keep a lobbyist such as the Washington-based McConnell/Ferguson Group on the 
payroll and should not be paying $75 an hour to part-time administrative 
assistant Julie Froeberg while field employees earn far less. 
</P>
<P>
 Its spending habits make Tri-Cities a district ripe for consolidation, 
Benedicktus said. The district's biggest customer by far is the city of San 
Clemente, which should actually take over the operation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a district run by consultants," Benedicktus said. "Tri-Cities should 
go away. Our operation could easily be run by the city of San Clemente."  
</P>
<P>
 Mecham brands Benedicktus a "malcontent." The district's lobbyist will be 
needed until the Camp Pendleton project -- which took special federal 
legislation -- is finally signed by the Marines, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no doubt we use consultants, we may even use them more than we 
should," Mecham said. "But part of that is attempting to find the right 
organization that works for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Until recent months, Tri-Cities quietly helped deliver water to a small group 
of water districts serving communities at the southern tip of the county, 
including San Clemente, Capistrano Beach in Dana Point and the San Onofre 
nuclear plant. The district was formed in 1959 by vote of a then-small group of 
South County residents who needed a new supplier to bring imported water to an 
area that was outgrowing the capacity of its local wells. 
</P>
<P>
 To bring new water south, the district built a series of pipelines linking a 
major water line near the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station to South County. 
Later, the district added two reservoirs designed to store 60 million gallons 
of water. 
</P>
<P>
 But several recent events have put the future of Tri-Cities in jeopardy. Most 
importantly, at the same time that water rates are skyrocketing, state budget 
cuts have tightened funds, a double whammy that has prompted a new push for 
consolidation of all small special districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Tri-Cities is a wholesale district that acts as a "middleman" in the water 
delivery system, buying water from one district and selling to other districts. 
And that makes it a prime consolidation target, in the eyes of many officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The existence of Tri-Cities adds a layer of costs to water customers, some 
officials say. Plus, Tri-Cities has long finished its construction phase and 
its current role has shifted largely to maintaining its equipment and pipelines 
and charging "pass through" costs to its retail customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a real question whether Tri-Cities is as vital as it was when it was 
created," said Bill Meadows, manager of the Capistrano Beach County Water 
District, which buys water from Tri-Cities. "Once a district has fulfilled its 
mission, as Tri-Cities has, shouldn't it be dissolved or reduced in scope? . . 
. If it's possible to lower water rates by reducing the responsibilities of 
Tri-Cities, that should be seriously looked at." 
</P>
<P>
 Mecham and another board member, Jim Lawson, dismiss these criticisms as 
"politics," power plays sparked by a scramble among all small districts in 
South County to survive the consolidation drive. The Camp Pendleton project, 
which the district has spent five years assembling, should not be put in danger 
over in-fighting, Lawson said.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's all it is, politics . . . and the consolidation issue," Lawson said. 
"If consolidation proves to have its advantages and someone can demonstrate it 
saves dollars and cents, so be it. But it should not jeopardize a long-term 
source of water. That's really shortsighted." Tri-Cities Municipal Water

SERVICE OR NUISANCE?; COMPLAINTS PROMPT SANTA ANA TO CONSIDER LIMITING YARD 
SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Margarita Navarro tended a heap of worn blouses and baby clothes, old kitchen 
utensils and a washing machine scattered across her tiny front yard Saturday -- 
items she hoped would bring in a few extra dollars to make ends meet and help 
care for a sick son. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm old. It's not easy for me to find work. I need this," said Navarro, 63, 
who had netted $6 by lunchtime from the steady trickle of neighbors who perused 
her wares. "These are all old things, of very little value. But the people who 
come to buy here also don't have much money." 
</P>
<P>
 On any given weekend, residents throughout Santa Ana's poorest neighborhoods 
load front yards, driveways and empty parking lots with racks of clothing and a 
mishmash of appliances, furniture, tires and televisions. 
</P>
<P>
 For some, such as Navarro, the yard sales are an occasional practice that 
serves neighborhood shoppers who don't have cars to get to swap meets or cannot 
afford the prices of even secondhand stores. Other residents have turned the 
sales into thriving, weekly enterprises as they buy new and used goods and 
resell them for profit. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials and neighborhood association activists complain that the garage 
sales are unsightly junk fests that create traffic jams and are unfair to those 
who seek out commercial licenses or pay to sell their goods at swap meets. 
</P>
<P>
 Code enforcement officials say the situation is so out of control they can't 
possibly enforce existing city law, which allows only two garage sales at any 
address each year. So Monday night, the City Council will consider a revised 
ordinance: one that allows yard sales just four weekends a year, twice in May 
and twice in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members and neighborhood association activists have overwhelmingly 
welcomed the move, which they say would clean up the city and channel business 
activity back where it belongs -- into regulated commercial areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up in the city and I just want it to look clean," said Councilman Ted 
R. Moreno, who initiated the discussion of a stricter garage sale ordinance 
about 10 months ago. "I got tired of just seeing people throw their clothes 
around. When they started doing it as a business, I said, 'This is getting to 
be too much.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The city's current ordinance was adopted in 1990, limiting sales to two a year 
and restricting goods to those of a "household nature."  
</P>
<P>
 But city officials say it has proved too cumbersome to enforce. While code 
enforcement officers generated a list in 1993 of almost 1,000 addresses that 
had met their two-sale limit, only 10 citations were issued. With more than 300 
estimated sales on any given Saturday, city officials said enforcers can't 
possibly track every one, and sales often move from house to house, further 
frustrating efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed ordinance would simplify matters: anyone holding a sale outside 
the four designated weekends could have their goods impounded by the city 
pending a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Other cities have tried similar tactics. In January, La Palma restricted sales 
to two a year and required residents to get permits. And last year, Dana Point 
limited sales to four a year after residents complained about the proliferation 
of signs advertising the events and the annoyance of having to sidestep wares 
piled on neighborhood sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Santa Ana, the anger and frustration over yard sales also highlight a 
festering dispute between established middle-class residents and the burgeoning 
population of newer immigrants, many of whom live far below the poverty line. 
Many longtime residents say the new Santa Ana is not as attractive as the city 
they remember, and they cross their fingers that this and other new laws may 
help restore its former luster.  
</P>
<P>
 An ordinance adopted in January allows the city to slap a $50 fine on anyone 
who hangs laundry so it's visible from the street, or stores anything other 
than lawn furniture on an apartment balcony or patio. The proposed garage sale 
ordinance targets the same perceived "unsightliness." 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, yard sales mean exactly that: You cleaned out what you have and 
traded with your neighbor or whatever. It's not meant to be a residential 
business," said Dave Lopez, a member of the Riverview West Neighborhood Assn., 
who said he feared the neighborhood was looking more and more like "Old 
Tijuana." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's as if somebody goes out there and just throws stuff. It's hanging over 
balconies. It's hanging over trees. Clothes everywhere!" said Betty Biner, an 
Eastside Neighborhood Assn. member who said she counted 26 sales on a stretch 
of Chestnut Avenue last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm ashamed of the area. It looks so bad," said Biner, who has shared a house 
on Chestnut Avenue with her husband, Paul, for 28 years. "It's not just the 
clothes and the yard sales," she said. "It's the music. It's the filth. It's 
the abandoned cars. It's the number of people. It's just too much of a bad 
thing. I hate the weekends because of the noise." 
</P>
<P>
 But other residents insist that any crackdown would affect many hard working, 
honest people who rely on the yard sales to get by. 
</P>
<P>
 At her house on Baker Street, Margarita Navarro said the city's priorities 
confounded her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why are they focusing this attention on us? Why don't they do something about 
the people who constantly sell drugs on this street corner?" she said. "Sure, 
if you're reselling new merchandise you should have a permit, but these are old 
things. If they don't want people to rob, then let us do this. There is no work 
for us. We have to eat." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not easy for us," said Guadalupe Escovedo, 39, who tended a thriving 
sale at her home on McFadden Avenue Saturday. "If we spend $5 on something we 
no longer need, we want to get $1 back." 
</P>
<P>
 Escovedo said she only tries to sell things a few times a year, and would 
gladly get a permit from the city if it were required. But to restrict the 
sales to four specific weekends would be a hardship for those who can't afford 
to shop any other way. The competition among sales on those days would be too 
fierce, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe 10% of the people in this city are complaining. But 90% are not, 
because they need our service," said Felipe Medina, 19, who helped with 
Escovedo's garage sale Saturday. "By putting on a yard sale, we are offering a 
service to the area." 
</P>
<P>
 Alicia Munroy, 25, said the city ordinance would hurt her family. On Saturday, 
she walked from Escovedo's yard with two cooking pots and four blouses, all for 
$4. In even a second-hand store, one blouse would cost that much, she said, and 
she has no car to get to a swap meet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things are very difficult for us economically," said Marta Rincon, who pushed 
a shopping cart down McFadden Avenue filled with bags of children's clothes 
purchased at three garage sales. The outings are regular Saturday and Sunday 
affairs for her, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other weekend sales are more commercial. In a parking lot in the 800 block of 
First Street, Cesar Castaneda was selling hundreds of pots and pans Saturday 
from an old yellow truck. Some of his offerings were new, others dented. A 
crowd of people clamored onto the truck and peered inside. 
</P>
<P>
 The interested buyers included Miguel Miranda, 57, who makes a living 
purchasing wares from Santa Ana yard sales and vendors such as Castaneda. He 
resells the items at a swap meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Miranda said the proposed ordinance would ruin him. "It goes against 
humanity," he said "We do this out of necessity. It's an honest living." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say they will consider alternative proposals, such as allowing 
the sales on one weekend every three months, rather than two weekends each in 
May and October, and there is a provision written into the ordinance that would 
roll the date to the next weekend in event of rain. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Dunams, the city's coordinator for community preservation, sought to 
rally residents around the proposed law last week at an Eastside Neighborhood 
Assn. meeting. Dunams said it was the only way to clean up their city.

D.A. TO PROPOSE DUAL-JURY TRIALS IN WOODS SLAYING; COURTS: ADVOCATES SAY 
CONCEPT SAVES TIME, MONEY. CRITICS POINT OUT PROBLEMS WITH LOGISTICS, CHANCE 
FOR LEGAL ERRORS THAT COULD HARM PROSECUTION'S MURDER CASE. 
</P>

<P>
 The prosecutor in the slaying of a San Clemente teen-ager will make the 
unusual request Monday of seeking not one but two dual-jury murder trials, a 
procedure that gained recent attention in the Los Angeles trials of Erik and 
Lyle Menendez. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the complicated scenario -- played out only a handful of times before in 
Orange County -- two separate juries consider the fate of different defendants 
in the same trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Gary Paer said he will request the two dual-jury trials for 
four San Clemente youths charged with murder and other felony counts in the 
slaying of Steve Woods, who died after being pierced through the head with a 
paint-roller rod last October. A fifth defendant, 20-year-old Juan Enriquez 
Alcocer, would have his own murder trial in part because his case has moved 
more quickly through the judicial system. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of the defendants are set for arraignment Monday in Superior Court in 
Santa Ana. At that time, Paer, who prosecuted a dual-jury murder trial in 1992, 
said he intends to make his request. A judge's approval would mean three 
separate trials, instead of five. 
</P>
<P>
 While dual juries pose considerable logistical challenges, especially in 
courtrooms designed for only one jury, Paer said the unusual procedure spares 
expense and repeated court appearances for witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a way to resolve the case in a way that is convenient for the witnesses, 
and actually cuts down on court time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen J. Biskar, a deputy public defender representing one of the defendants 
in the Woods case, said he and other defense lawyers involved are considering 
the request. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really see the harm in it," said Biskar, who represented a client in 
a dual-jury trial several years ago. "It's just somewhat awkward at times." 
</P>
<P>
 Facing the prospect of dual-jury trials are defendants Saul Penuelas, 18; his 
brother, Hector Penuelas, 17; Julio Perez Bonilla, 17; and Rogelio Vasquez 
Solis, 17, each charged with murder, conspiracy, assault and other counts in 
Woods' death. 
</P>
<P>
 Another defendant, Arturo Villalobos, 20, has already pleaded guilty to 
voluntary manslaughter in Woods' killing, with the possibility of an additional 
penalty for alleged gang involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods, 17, was a passenger in a vehicle pelted by rocks, beer cans, paint 
rollers and other items as it attempted to leave a beach parking lot seven 
months ago. He was speared through the head with a paint roller rod during the 
barrage and later died. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's investigators testified that Woods and his friends said they were 
trying to flee the beach parking lot and avoid a fight with the defendants. But 
the defendants contend they were provoked by one of Woods' friends and began 
throwing items in self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Dual-jury trials are more common in Los Angeles County, and officials say they 
have only occurred about three times in Orange County. Some attribute the 
rarity to a shortage of large courtrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's basically two trials going on simultaneously," said Municipal Court 
Judge Gary P. Ryan, who presided as a Superior Court judge in a 1992 dual-jury 
murder case. 
</P>
<P>
 The procedure, Ryan said, involved a lot of extra work. He left court tired 
each day, but it worked well and saved about two weeks of valuable court time 
by eliminating the need for a second trial, the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some who have been through dual-jury trials, however, said they'd rather not 
repeat the experience. And local judges have rejected dual-jury proposals in at 
least two recent murder cases involving multiple defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 David A. Zimmerman, a defense lawyer involved in what was apparently the 
county's first dual-jury trial in 1990, called the process a "logistical 
nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
 In his case, Zimmerman said, one jury sat in the jury box while the the other 
sat in the front rows of the courtroom, with the two juries switching places 
throughout the trial. But that posed problems in gauging the jurors' reaction 
to evidence and relating to them as he presented his case, the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zimmerman said he has told several local judges: "If you can do anything else 
to avoid it, do it, because you're going to be miserable." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense lawyers who have been through dual-jury trials say there's also a 
greater risk of mistakes that could cause a mistrial in one or both trials, 
because of potential problems with jury instructions, inadmissible evidence and 
other issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to be very careful in terms of what is being said to make sure you 
don't cross any line that affects the other trial inadvertently," said Ed Hall, 
a defense lawyer who represented a defendant in the 1992 dual-jury trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the outset, there can be substantial cost savings," he continued. "But if 
there's some type of mix-up, that's all for naught." 
</P>
<P>
 The dual-jury proposals can help to deal with complicated court rules that 
prohibit use of a confession by one defendant to implicate a co-defendant. To 
avoid separate trials, judges can allow lawyers to delete or "sanitize" 
allegations in a confession about co-defendants. Then one jury can hear the 
case for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 But in some cases, statements are too riddled with allegations about 
co-defendants to be "sanitized" effectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Paer said that if he were to sanitize lengthy statements made by the 
defendants in the Woods case -- evidence that is crucial to his case -- he'd be 
left with "three or four lines." 
</P>
<P>
 At times when testimony can only be heard by one jury, the other jury leaves 
the room. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the challenges, lawyers and judges say the procedure can work well. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a large courtroom, so it worked out fine," said Thomas Avdeef, a 
former deputy district attorney who prosecuted the 1990 dual-jury case 
involving a Garden Grove drive-by gang shooting that killed two people, 
including a 4-year-old boy.

HOMELESS ENJOY GOOD LIFE FOR A DAY AT COLLEGE OUTREACH; VOLUNTEERISM: 
CO-SPONSORED BY NEWPORT-MESA CHRISTIAN CENTER, THIRD ANNUAL 'FAMILY FEST' 
PROVIDED HAIRCUTS, SHOWERS, NEW CLOTHES, A WARM MEAL AND COMPANIONSHIP FOR 
ABOUT 200 APPRECIATIVE PEOPLE.

 Marny Rees hunkered down to the table, lifting her cast-encased leg onto a 
chair so a Southern California College student could paint it with a rose and a 
heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Enjoying the colorful balloons and the Christian rock music, Rees, 33, said 
spending her Saturday at the college's Family Fest for the homeless was a 
much-needed respite from the streets of Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're letting people like us know that someone is looking out for us," said 
Rees, who has been homeless about three years and who just spent a week in the 
hospital after a car struck her. "I've had people spit on me in the streets. 
The people here care." 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 homeless people, from elderly people to young families, came to this 
small college Saturday for showers, new clothes, haircuts, a warm meal and 
companionship. It was the third time the college has teamed up with the 
neighboring Newport-Mesa Christian Center to provide a day of outreach to the 
homeless people of Costa Mesa and Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 "We say, 'Bring yourself or your family and join our family. Let's have a 
block party,' " said Teri Silveira, the director of the college's outreach 
ministries.  
</P>
<P>
 Flyers went out to Orange County shelters advertising the services that would 
be provided. Then, Saturday morning, vans from the church and the college 
picked up homeless people at different collection points, including parks and 
shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 Once on the well-manicured lawns of the college, each person was given a 
ticket which was marked off at each station -- showers in the student locker 
rooms, hair trimming by student volunteers on the gymnasium floor, choosing 
from racks of clothes separated by gender and size, and finally, lunch in the 
cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
 James Everett, who lost his job and apartment in February, got some added 
help. Volunteers said they would help try to scare up two used tires for his 
car. He and his wife have been living in a Santa Ana shelter, but his new 
temporary job with a soda maker that he hopes will get him back on his feet is 
in Buena Park. The tires weren't up to the trek. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel Ruiz, 22, a senior at Southern California College, said helping people 
like Everett is exciting, and gives students the experience they can draw on 
later in creating their own outreach programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This gives you the satisfaction of knowing you're helping out a fellow 
brother," the native of El Paso said. "I come from a tough background. Finances 
were hard, so I know how nice it is to get a helping hand."

OLDE-TIME CULTURAL FAIRE; ANNUAL UCI FESTIVAL FEATURES FOOD, DRINK AND MEDIEVAL

 At "Celebrate UCI" Saturday, all roads led to the Wayzgoose Medieval Faire, an 
outdoor party which was really more a 1990s free-for-all than festival from the 
Middle Ages. 
</P>
<P>
 Bungee-jumping, sumo wrestling, food booths and rock 'n' roll all went on 
simultaneously at the fair in Aldrich Park, the centerpiece of an all-day open 
house that was expected to draw more than 18,000 people to the UC Irvine 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's for getting together and seeing what everyone's all about," said Carolyn 
Fong, 19, a sophomore psychology major from Moraga. "This gives more spirit to 
the campus, which can be quiet since we don't have things like football." 
</P>
<P>
 The warm, hazy spring day started with a 5-K "Zot Trot" run, continued with 
campus tours and environmental displays in honor of Earth Day at Gateway Plaza, 
and finished with the 24th annual fair, which is billed as UC Irvine's oldest 
tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Historically, the wayzgoose originated in a medieval printers union," said 
Randy Lewis, an associate dean of students. "They used to have an apprentice 
fair called Wayzgoose. A couple of students picked it up in the early 1970s as 
an idea for a festival." 
</P>
<P>
 But it has evolved into a way to feature the variety and diversity of the 
campus, said sophomore Rosie Tepos. More than 100 student, faculty and staff 
organizations operate a variety of booths throughout the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Food has become one of the fair's highlights with spring rolls, enchiladas, 
shish kebabs, Korean barbecue and Navajo tacos, a variation of the traditional 
Mexican taco but with a thicker, flat tortilla, among the offerings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a party and a good advertisement for people who are coming to see the 
school," said Tepos, 19, from Covina. "Everyone gets out and joins together. 
It's a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Fun, not historical accuracy nor tradition, was what brought 9-year-old Kai 
Hally-Rosendahl to the fair. After one session at the bungee-jump exhibit, he 
got back in line for more. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sort of feels like you're in a dream," said Hally-Rosendahl, a student at 
Irvine's Turtle Rock Elementary School, of his bungee experience. 
</P>
<P>
 UC Irvine's fraternities and sororities were out in force, taking part in a 
mini-songfest from the stage in the middle of the park, as well as operating 
food and drink booths featuring such concoctions as nonalcoholic "mocktails," 
which resemble pina coladas and strawberry daiquiris. 
</P>
<P>
 "This supports our scholarship and philanthropic activities -- if we make a 
profit," said Allison Burns, 20, a junior engineering major. 
</P>
<P>
 For a medieval flair, the county's chapter of the Society for Creative 
Anachronism exhibited members' colorful, handmade costumes in a booth complete 
with shields, armor, swords and masks. After dressing up for combat, society 
members squared off in mock battle at the center of an impromptu ring. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try and re-create the medieval times when the idea of craftsmanship and 
the idea of chivalry were still alive," said Bob Morris, 35, of Anaheim, the 
chapter's president and "baron." 
</P>
<P>
 "Unlike most sports of today, it's all based on the honor system. If someone 
scores a blow on you, you acknowledge it."

SERVICES PENDING FOR SAN JUAN MATRIARCH EVELYNE LOBO VILLEGAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICIA DI RADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Services will be held this week for Evelyne Marie Lobo Villegas, a Juaneno who 
was crowned the "Matriarch of San Juan Capistrano" two years ago. She died 
Friday at age 69 after suffering a stroke.  
</P>
<P>
 A descendant of a family that lived in the area before the arrival of the 
Spaniards in 1769, Villegas was one of eight children born to John Edward and 
Esperanza Lobo. Her brother was Clarence Lobo, the chief of the Juaneno Indian 
Band who died in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 As matriarch, an honorary title bestowed for life by the San Juan Capistrano 
Historical Society, Villegas for the past three years led the traditional 
procession of children with town "Patriarch" Paul Arbiso, 97, to signal the 
first sighting of the returning swallows in San Juan Capistrano in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Though she was not the oldest woman of Native American descent in San Juan 
Capistrano, Villegas was selected by the historical society for her dedication 
to Juaneno causes and to the community.  
</P>
<P>
 Villegas lived in the same house her family has owned for seven generations in 
the Los Rios section of San Juan Capistrano, which is considered the oldest 
continuously inhabited community in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "She personifies the Juaneno Indian pride," said San Juan Capistrano 
Councilman Gil Jones, who had known Villegas for 15 years. "She's one of the 
reasons we have a historic district" in San Juan Capistrano, he said, referring 
to her work to preserve historic adobes and traditional homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members said she suffered the stroke on April 6, while she was giving a 
presentation on Juaneno life to a group of children. She remained unconscious 
at Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo until her death. 
</P>
<P>
 Villegas spent her entire life in San Juan Capistrano and worked as a 
schoolteacher for the Capistrano Unified School District for 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's ironic and almost appropriate that she was doing what she loved most, 
teaching, when she fell ill," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 Villegas had three children and five grandchildren, with another grandchild on 
the way, family members said. Intensely proud of her heritage and her city, 
Villegas helped anthropologists research the Juaneno tribe's obscure language 
by providing old family writings she had kept since childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of Villegas' efforts, the Lord's Prayer was recited in the ancient 
language, Acagchemem, in Mission San Juan Capistrano in 1992 -- believed to be 
the first time it had been recited in that tongue since the mission was built 
in 1776. 
</P>
<P>
 Villegas' daughter, Valerie A. Cordes, said her mother enjoyed being around 
children and telling them about her Juaneno background. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was proud of what she was," said Cordes, 37. "She accepted everybody the 
way they were, and she would never try to hide who she was."  
</P>
<P>
 Jones said Villegas meant so much to the community that the city is likely to 
memorialize her officially. 
</P>
<P>
 Villegas is survived by her husband of 49 years, Salvador, 73, and their 
children Joseph, Valerie and Mark. She is also survived by brothers Robert Lobo 
and Harley (Wick) Lobo, and sisters Marguerite Lobo and Viola Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 A vigil for Villegas will be held at 7:30 p.m. Tuesday in the Serra Chapel at 
Mission San Juan Capistrano, and the funeral will be at 10 a.m. Wednesday in 
the same chapel. She will be buried in the old mission cemetery off Ortega 
Highway, where services will be held at 11 a.m. Thursday.

POLITICS '94: A BEHIND-THE-SCENES LOOK AT ORANGE COUNTY'S POLITICAL LIFE ; GOP 
STALWART GUS OWEN APPEARS TO BE CLINTON'S MAN FOR COMMERCE POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Clinton calling: Orange County businessman Gus Owen, chairman of the 
conservative Lincoln Club, worked hard during the 1992 presidential election to 
maintain his GOP credentials while his wife, developer Kathryn Thompson, was 
being branded a turncoat for helping lead the Republicans for Clinton movement. 
</P>
<P>
 It now looks as if Owen weathered the political storm. Not only is he still a 
member of the inner circle of Republican bigwigs, but he's also A-OK with at 
least one high-ranking Democrat. Word is that Owen is about to be asked by 
President Clinton to fill one of the Republican vacancies on the six-member 
Interstate Commerce Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Owen is not confirming he is under consideration. But Republican 
insiders say Owen's appointment is a fait accompli. The President wants him, he 
has passed his background check and Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole is expected 
to give his approval. 
</P>

 Newport Ross: Residents of Newport Beach and other tony haunts in the coastal 
35th Senate District shouldn't be surprised if they start seeing a husky figure 
who looks remarkably like inland Assemblyman Ross Johnson (R-Placentia). 
</P>
<P>
 One of the worst-kept secrets among Republicans in the state Capitol is that 
Johnson, the former Assembly GOP leader and occasional country and western 
crooner, is seriously eyeing the state Senate seat that will be vacated later 
this year by Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), who is running unopposed for a 
spot on the County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons for Johnson to look west are simple. First, he will have to leave 
the Assembly in 1996 because of term limits. What's more, the inland region he 
represents already has a well-established Republican holding the area's Senate 
seat -- John R. Lewis (R-Orange). 
</P>
<P>
 Like any good politician, Johnson is keeping mum on his intentions. 
"Assemblyman Johnson's primary focus this year is doing the job he was elected 
to do," said Susie Swatt, the assemblyman's chief of staff. "His second focus 
is running for reelection to the Assembly. That's enough to worry about right 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 If Johnson does run for Bergeson's seat, it could set up a battle of the 
Republican titans. Assemblywoman Doris Allen (R-Cypress) is expected to jump in 
and Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) has already announced his intent 
to seek the Senate post. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 What endorsement? Orange County supervisorial candidate Linda 
Moulton-Patterson recently sent a letter to West Orange County Municipal Court 
Judge Dan C. Dutcher, demanding that he remove her name from his campaign 
materials. Dutcher said Moulton-Patterson had initially given him her OK. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Internal warfare: The upstart group of moderate Republicans who recently 
banded together to take on the conservative majority of the Orange County's GOP 
central committee have run afoul of party chieftains. 
</P>
<P>
 GOP Chairman Thomas A. Fuentes dispatched a letter to the Orange County 
Republican Majority Coalition, asking the moderate group to "cease and desist" 
from using the word Republican in its moniker. Fuentes explained that the 
California Elections Code specifies that the name cannot be used without a 
charter from the state and local Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Ishimatsu, chairman of the new group, contends Fuentes has the law all 
wrong. The name can be used, he argued, if his organization doesn't raise funds 
in the name of the Republican Party. Although his group is collecting political 
funds, it is not trying to confuse donors into thinking they're giving to the 
party itself, Ishimatsu said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ishimatsu also said the organization, which is running nearly two dozen 
candidates for the 42 open slots on the central committee in the June 7 
election, will not be bullied by conservatives into changing its name. "They 
have done this to other moderate Republican groups," Ishimatsu said. "They're 
trying to prohibit moderates from participating in the party. This is their way 
of increasing the hassle factor." 
</P>
<P>
 Fuentes was unavailable for comment, but Jo Ellen Allen, the GOP central 
committee's first vice president, said the party is talking to its lawyers 
about possible legal action. "If they use the name Republican, the voters 
assume it has to do with the Republican Party," she said. "That's against the 
law." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Back-patting: In the 70th Assembly District race, Republican candidate Marilyn 
Brewer has been endorsed by former Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater, who calls 
Orange County his "second home." One of her rivals in the GOP primary, Tom 
Reinecke, won the backing of former Irvine city councilman Art Bloomer, who 
left Irvine last year to pursue business interests in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 69th Assembly District primary, Republican Martin Ageson has won 
endorsements from Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach) and County 
Supervisor Roger R. Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates in the District 2 county supervisorial race also have picked up new 
endorsements. Huntington Beach Mayor Moulton-Patterson won the backing of the 
Assn. of Orange County Deputy Sheriffs. Meanwhile, Haydee V. Tillotson 
announced the support of Richard L. Gann, president of Paul Gann's Citizens 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 46th Congressional District, where six Democrats have lined up to take 
on Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), the California AFL-CIO has decided 
to endorse Democrat Mike Farber. 
</P>

 On good behavior: Orange County businessman and Republican fund-raiser George 
L. Argyros made a $13,000 New Year's Eve contribution to Democratic Assembly 
Speaker Willie Brown for his work last year on legislation aimed at easing the 
financial strain on California businesses. So will Argyros give again? "It 
depends on how he behaves," Argyros said. UPCOMING EVENTS

O.C. BURGLARY SUSPECT A '3RD-STRIKE' CANDIDATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 27-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of burglary Saturday after police 
said he smashed through a glass door of Blockbuster Video and grabbed some 
video equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Luther Adam Bell of Garden Grove also was being held on 
parole violations that could make him a "third-strike" candidate for more 
prison time if convicted. California law now mandates lengthy prison terms for 
people convicted of three felonies. 
</P>
<P>
 An Anaheim police task force had been watching the store at 10524 Valley View 
Street because of a series of Blockbuster break-ins.

TWO STANTON WOMEN HOSPITALIZED AFTER DRUG OVERDOSES, POLICE SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 69-year-old woman and her ailing 34-year-old grandniece were hospitalized 
Saturday after they were found unconscious and barely breathing from apparent 
drug overdoses, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Sheriff's Department had only sketchy information about the 
Stanton women and did not release their names. The women were taken to Anaheim 
General Hospital and West Anaheim Medical Center for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Lt. Jay Mendez said investigators are trying to determine whether 
the overdoses were a murder-suicide attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the son of the elderly woman visited their westside condominium near 
Katella Avenue and Knott Street shortly before 5 p.m. and discovered the 
unconscious family members. Mendez said the younger woman suffered from 
cerebral palsy.

WOMAN DISABLES CAR, THWARTING CARJACKER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 69-year-old woman confronted by a carjacker quickly disabled the ignition 
before abandoning the car to him, police said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 A teen-ager, armed with a handgun, approached the woman about 9 p.m. Friday in 
the parking lot of the Park West Apartments complex on the 3800 block of 
Parkview Lane and demanded her Chrysler New Yorker, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, whose name was not released, turned on a device that prevented the 
car's ignition from working, Irvine Police Sgt. Jeff Kermode said. She ran from 
the car as the would-be carjacker tried to start it. 
</P>
<P>
 When it wouldn't, he ran, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence obtained at the scene led them to a 16-year-old who lives in Santa 
Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth, whose name was not released because he is a juvenile, was booked at 
Orange County Juvenile Hall on suspicion of carjacking, police said.

DANA POINT DRIVER DYING OF HEART ATTACK SIDESWIPES CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 39-year-old Dana Point man died after he apparently had a heart attack while 
driving and then sideswiped an oncoming car before smashing into a wall, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred at 7:15 p.m. Friday when Donald C. Crimmings was driving 
his 1991 Ford Probe southbound in the 400 block of Cliff Drive.Police said his 
car veered across a double yellow line into northbound traffic and sideswiped a 
BMW. 
</P>
<P>
 Crimmings' car continued to veer left until it hit a brick retaining wall on 
the opposite side of the road, Laguna Beach Police Sgt. Mike Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors who heard the collision ran to help Crimmings, but found that he was 
not breathing, Hall said. A police officer arrived at the scene and gave 
Crimmings cardiopulmonary resuscitation until paramedics arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Crimmings was taken to South Coast Medical Center, where he was pronounced 
dead on arrival, police said.  
</P>
<P>
 Investigators at the Orange County coroner's office said Crimmings died of 
cardiac arrhythmia due to a heart condition.

BOATS TO PARADE IN MEMORY OF CAPTAIN WHO SAVED OTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A boat parade will be held Monday in Newport Harbor in memory of a well-known 
local boat captain at a marine assistance company. 
</P>
<P>
 David (Woody) Pollak, 34, died last week in a water-skiing accident two miles 
off Crystal Cove, authorities said.Efforts to save his life were similar to 
rescues Pollak himself had participated in with his firm, Costa Mesa-based 
Vessel Assist. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, recreational boaters and well-wishers are invited to gather from 
4:30 to 5:45 p.m. at Woody's Wharf restaurant, 2318 W. Newport Blvd., Orange 
County Sheriff's Deputy Gary Tinoco said.  
</P>
<P>
 An honor guard of law enforcement vessels will meet at 5:50 p.m. in front of 
the Newport Harbor patrol office, Tinoco said. The honor guard will include 
boats from the Sheriff's Department at Newport Harbor and Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department office at Avalon Bay on Santa Catalina Island. 
</P>
<P>
 Boaters from Vessel Assist will meet with recreational boaters and head out to 
sea behind the honor guard at 6:25 p.m., Tinoco said. The funeral service is 
scheduled to start at 6:50 p.m. and end at sunset. 
</P>
<P>
 Last August, when two Marine Corps helicopters collided near Santa Catalina 
Island, Pollak helped rescue four surviving crew members, leaving his own boat 
to take over another rescue vessel where survivors were receiving medical aid.

LONG BEACH GRAND PRIX; THREE YEARS LATER, THINGS LOOKING UP; AUTO RACING: IN 
APRIL OF 1991, TRACY WAS WONDERING IF HE HAD AN INDY CAR FUTURE. NOW HE'S WITH 
PENSKE AND BACK ON THE POLE. 
</P>

<P>
 Three years ago, Paul Tracy was a disconsolate 22-year-old sitting on a curb 
in the paddock at the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach. The engine had blown in 
a car his father had leased for Tracy to drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought my career was over before it really started," Tracy recalled. "It 
had taken all the money my dad could spare to get a car from Dale Coyne for one 
race, and now my opportunity to show what I could do was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was afraid it was time to go home and start working in the construction 
business. I thought I was out of options as far as racing was concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Tracy is back in Long Beach, on the pole as defending champion in the 
20th Long Beach Grand Prix, one of three drivers on Roger Penske's powerful 
Marlboro team who were the fastest qualifiers Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy's 108.450-m.p.h. lap earned him his second consecutive pole this season, 
edging teammates Al Unser Jr. (108.407) and Emerson Fittipaldi (108.308). All 
broke Nigel Mansell's year-old record of 108.198. Mansell, in the fastest 
non-Marlboro car, qualified at 108.173. 
</P>
<P>
 So what happened on that April day in 1991? 
</P>
<P>
 Penske came riding from the pits on a bicycle and stopped to tell Tracy that 
he had done a good job under the circumstances. Later, Penske sent word to 
Tracy to stop by the Marlboro trailer. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when I really felt bad; I was sure he was sending for me because I'd 
done something wrong," Tracy said. "I thought maybe I'd cut off one of his 
drivers, something like that. My instant reaction was that I was in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 What Penske, the most successful car owner in Indy car history, wanted was to 
find out Tracy's plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I told him I was talking with a couple of low-budget teams about the 
(Indy) 500 only, he told me not to do it, that it might do me more harm than 
good. He said if I would stay away from Indy, he might have something for me. 
He said to stay home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was home (in Toronto) when he called. He said to come to Indy the day after 
qualifying. When I got there, he asked me if I was willing to test drive for 
him and run the 1992 Indy 500 if all went well. He had the test contract 
already filled out. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he had to have the decision right there. I said, 'Where's the pen?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Penske made an announcement of Tracy's signing the week after the 500 at 
Milwaukee. The next day, Tracy was testing at Mid-Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 When Tracy got his first chance in a race, at Michigan, he crashed on the 
third lap and suffered a broken leg. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lying in the hospital turned out to be a learning experience for me. I lost 
30 pounds, for one thing. I was out eight weeks and when I came back, I had a 
better feeling for the whole deal. I had found out that testing, no matter how 
much you do, is not the same as racing. And I had realized that an Indy car was 
a whole different thing from what I had driven before." 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy had driven in the American Racing Series, now Indy Lights, for three 
years, winning the championship in 1990 as well as the race at Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Roger told me he wanted me back in time to race at Nazareth (Pa.). I finished 
seventh there and then tested all winter for the '92 season. He told me I 
should race at Phoenix to get ready for Indy." 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy finished fourth at Phoenix but lasted only half the race at Indy before 
his engine went out. He didn't realize it at the time, but an incident occurred 
at Indianapolis that would accelerate his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Mears, a four-time winner of the 500 driving Penske cars, suffered a 
wrist injury in a crash during practice and although he raced several more 
times, the wrist did not heal properly. When Mears suddenly retired, Tracy, the 
test driver, became the No. 2 Penske driver as Fittipaldi's teammate for 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 After an electrical problem at Australia and a crash while leading at Phoenix, 
Tracy came to Long Beach and scored his first Indy car victory. He gave an 
indication of what was to come when he started second and accelerated past 
pole-sitter Mansell down Shoreline Drive to take the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took a while for that win to settle in," Tracy said. "I knew the team was 
capable, and inside I knew that I was capable, but I also knew that I had made 
a few mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 Once he had his first victory, Tracy wasted no time in winning some more. He 
won at Cleveland, Toronto, Elkhart Lake (Wis.) and Laguna Seca -- all on road 
courses or temporary circuits. He led more laps for the series than anyone 
else. His five victories equaled the total of series champion Mansell. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the 1994 season started, Tracy said he hoped to improve on his 
finishing record. Although he won five races, he failed to finish in seven 
others, which left him in third place in the season standings behind Mansell 
and Fittipaldi. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy's emergence from near obscurity was a second example of Penske's eye for 
hidden talent. He had discovered Mears, who won 29 races for him in 15 seasons, 
while the two were riding together on a motorcycle tour in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 This season for Tracy began as a copy of last year's. Again he failed to 
finish in Australia because of an electrical problem and again he crashed while 
leading at Phoenix. This time, however, it was not his fault as he was trapped 
by an accident involving Hiro Matsushita and Teo Fabi. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was about six car lengths behind Hiro when they tangled, and I had no place 
to go. I had taken my steering wheel off and was about to climb out when all of 
sudden (Jacques) Villeneuve smashed into Hiro's car and knocked his gearbox 
into the tub of my car." 
</P>
<P>
 The car was damaged so badly it could not be repaired, so a new tub was flown 
from the Penske shops in Poole, England, to Long Beach for today's race. It 
arrived Monday and the Penske crew built a complete car before the track opened 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a lot of teething problems, like we always do with a new car, and we 
didn't have much time to get it ready," Tracy said. "We had no time for 
shakedown laps except for Friday during qualifications. It was a constant 
struggle all week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was able to take the settings from Al and Emmo's cars to get mine right. 
That's one of the values of a three-car team -- being able to share what each 
other learns. Without their help, we would never have found all our problems in 
time for Saturday's qualifying session." 
</P>
<P>
 Now that he has the fastest lap ever run on the nine-turn, 1.59-mile Long 
Beach street circuit, Tracy said he plans to scale back his speed for today's 
105-lap race. 
</P>
<P>
 "With 30 cars on the track, it will become a tactical race." he said. "We will 
be lapping cars in the first 20 or 30 laps. It is going to be very competitive. 
I would like to win it as slowly as possible." The Lineup 03,05,21,10 No.

JIM MURRAY: HE HELD COURT WITH KINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY

<TEXT>
<P>
 If it were baseball, he would have been known as "Old Reliable." 
</P>
<P>
 If he had been in movies, he wouldn't have been the star, he would have been 
the star's best friend.  
</P>
<P>
 In football, he would have done the blocking. In basketball, he'd set the 
pick. In the Old West, he'd be the sidekick. 
</P>
<P>
 He was as easy to overlook as a doorman. He was the kind of guy who would have 
batted .298 or .301 every year and driven in 95 runs but would have been in an 
outfield with Mays or Mantle. In football, he'd catch all the passes over the 
middle but someone else would get the bomb. He did what he did steadily, 
dependably, predictably, but not flamboyantly. The sort who, when his career 
was looked back on, they would say, "Wow! He did that? I didn't realize!" 
</P>
<P>
 On the ice, he seldom made a mistake or busted up his own team's play. Dave 
Taylor on skates was like Joe DiMaggio in center field. When the ball came 
down, so to speak, he was under it. He was where he was supposed to be.  
</P>
<P>
 You get a measure of Dave Taylor when you know that he played that fast and 
furious game 17 years -- and remained on the same club the whole time. Only the 
great ones do that. You don't trade the super values. Only a handful of greats 
stay untouchable -- Musial, Gehrig, DiMag -- and Taylor was one of them.  
</P>
<P>
 His job on the Los Angeles Kings was to go into the corners and dig out the 
puck and deliver it to the club's cleanup hitters. For years, this was Marcel 
Dionne. Then, for a few years, it was Wayne Gretzky.  
</P>
<P>
 Not that that's all Taylor did. What he did along the way was drill in 431 
goals -- 47 one season -- serve up 638 assists and break up enough opposition 
power plays to get a broken nose, some new front teeth, an arthroscoped knee or 
two and some cerebral bleeding. Hockey is not for the squeamish.  
</P>
<P>
 Other sports measure their glamorous units in terms of the Four Horsemen, the 
Dream Backfield, the Gashouse Gang. In hockey, it's the scoring lines -- center 
and two wing men -- that get the glory. Some famous ones were the Punch Line of 
Toe Blake, Elmer Lach and Maurice Richard with the '45 Canadiens and the 
Dynamite Line of Dit Clapper, Cooney Weiland and Dutch Gainor of the early-day 
Bruins.  
</P>
<P>
 The Kings' trio of the late '70s and early '80s was so overwhelming that the 
club held a contest to find a nickname. The Triple Crown line was adjudged the 
most suitable. With the speedy Dionne at center and Taylor and Charlie Simmer 
at the wings, the line scored 161 goals and 352 points -- goals plus assists -- 
in 1981 and laid waste to the league. It should have been called the Red Light 
Line.  
</P>
<P>
 You measure success in the NHL by a yardstick of 400 lifetime goals, 600 
assists and 1,000 games played. Taylor qualifies in each category. He has had a 
productive career. He won every award the game has to give except the Lady 
Byng, given annually to the player who displays the most sportsmanship.  
</P>
<P>
 "I miss out on that by the second game of the season," Taylor says, laughing. 
"They don't give that to guys who get 148 penalty minutes a year." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it is also the job of the sidekick to suck up the fouls for the 
star player. Taylor used to post 130 minutes in penalties, Dionne 22-42.  
</P>
<P>
 It has not been without its price. Going into the corners with the likes of 
the Broad Street Bullies -- the Philadelphia Flyers of the '70s -- was like 
walking through Central Park at midnight wearing a Rolex. Dave Taylor's knees 
are so banged up he not only can tell when it's going to rain, he can tell when 
the fog is going to roll in.  
</P>
<P>
 Concussion is one of the dread words in the language. It's usually associated 
with sacked quarterbacks or KOd boxers. But hockey is a game in which angry men 
are allowed to carry sticks. Slamming an opponent into plate glass is 
acceptable, even encouraged, behavior. They didn't even wear helmets in this 
game till one guy didn't get up one night in Minneapolis.  
</P>
<P>
 You can deal with knees and teeth and elbows, but headaches and dizziness are 
less easily dismissed. No one has ever devised a crutch for the brain. The mind 
is a terrible thing to waste all right -- particularly on the end of a hockey 
stick too.  
</P>
<P>
 So Dave Taylor, after 17 years, is skating off into the sunset. He has never 
played less than his best.  
</P>
<P>
 "I took the check," he agrees. "I went into the boards." 
</P>
<P>
 His conduct was exemplary, his achievements monumental. He conquered a chronic 
stutter as determinedly as he perfected his wrist shot.  
</P>
<P>
 The game needed its Great One and its Flying Frenchman, but it needed its 
custom Taylor too. When things would go wrong, Dave Taylor would be standing 
there with a wrench. He was hockey's version of the indispensables -- Gehrig, 
Enos Slaughter, Gil Hodges. 
</P>
<P>
 Class is an overworked word in our business. Not when it's applied to Dave 
Taylor.

DUCKS FILL THEIR FIRST SCRAPBOOK WITH SNAPSHOTS, RECORDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 These are the moments that made a season. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Opening night. Celebration costs $480,000. Game isn't worth two cents. Detroit 
7, Mighty Ducks 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Sean Hill scores the historic first goal in the second period when a rebound 
caroms out to the right point and he slaps it home. 
</P>
<P>
 Goalie Ron Tugnutt raises his arms high five nights later after beating 
Edmonton for the franchise's first victory. (Five months later, he does the 
same thing in a Montreal uniform when he beats the Ducks 10 days after they 
trade him.) 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Yake shares a top hat full of candy from Michael Eisner with his 
teammates, the day after Yake's Oct. 19 hat trick helps upset the New York 
Rangers at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was one game, but it built confidence that we can compete," Stu Grimson 
remembered. "We knew we were capable of more. Our level of expectations rose." 
</P>
<P>
 A six-game losing streak includes a loss to lowly Ottawa on Oct. 25. But the 
streak proves to be the longest all season. 
</P>
<P>
 The first and second losses to San Jose.  
</P>
<P>
 Tugnutt stops 120 of 124 shots (and Guy Hebert 33 of 34) as the Ducks go 4-0 
on a trip through western Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Ron Wilson can't suppress a grin when he emerges from the dressing room 
after the fourth victory on Nov. 24. "Break up the Mighty Ducks!" 
</P>
<P>
 The third and fourth losses to San Jose on consecutive days in November.  
</P>
<P>
 Anatoli Semenov leaves the ice bent over and holding his arm in agony after 
Grimson's accidental hit dislocates Semenov's left elbow on Dec. 7. The team's 
leading scorer with 24 points, Semenov never regains his best form and scores 
only six more points all season. 
</P>
<P>
 Jarrod Skalde, a youngster fresh from the minors to replace Semenov, knocks in 
a rebound for the overtime game-winner against St. Louis in his first game. 
</P>
<P>
 Hebert makes 31 saves in the same game to beat his old team, St. Louis, and 
his old buddy, goalie Curtis Joseph. 
</P>
<P>
 Hebert looks up at the Maple Leaf Gardens scoreboard as his teammates slap him 
on the mask after his 38 saves shut out Toronto, 1-0, in another team first on 
Dec. 15. Tim Sweeney scores the only goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson cracks up after the exhausted Ducks suddenly look like the Edmonton 
Oilers of the '80s and score a club-record seven goals -- four in the second 
period -- in a 7-5 victory at Winnipeg. 
</P>
<P>
 Tugnutt shuts out the New York Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
 Consecutive losses at Florida and Tampa Bay run the Ducks' record against 
expansion teams to 0-9. 
</P>
<P>
 Ducks say goodby to historic Chicago Stadium, closing at season's end, with a 
6-2 victory on Jan. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Another loss to San Jose.  
</P>
<P>
 The New York Rangers, looking for revenge, lose again at The Pond of Anaheim. 
The Ducks sweep the season series from the team that finishes with the best 
record in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
 Don McSween is given a controversial five-minute major and a game misconduct 
for high-sticking against Wayne Gretzky, and the Kings break a scoreless tie 
with two power-play goals. "They said he was bleeding on the gum," Wilson says 
afterward. "Give me a break!" 
</P>
<P>
 Hebert shuts out Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky takes offense after the Ducks call him a whiner and has a hand in 
every goal in a 5-3 Kings' victory Feb. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine days later, Tugnutt leaves the ice as the morning skate begins to hear 
he's been traded to Montreal for Stephan Lebeau. "I've lost a partner," Hebert 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst loss yet to the Sharks, 6-0.  
</P>
<P>
 Playoff hopes plummet. "Going into the game, we were looking at it as a 
life-or-death thing," forward Garry Valk says. "There are 17 games left. We're 
not written off yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Turns out they are. San Jose loses only five of its final 18 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Three games in a row, the Ducks don't score a goal, setting a club record with 
a scoreless streak of 200 minutes 26 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Corkum breaks it against Chicago on March 11 when he picks off a pass to 
get out on a shorthanded breakaway, pulls up, fakes, and beats Ed Belfour. 
</P>
<P>
 Ducks finally beat one of the other California teams, ending an 0 for 10 
streak with a victory over the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 Pandemonium on the bench. Grimson scores his first goal of the season March 
22. He last scored Dec. 31, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Corkum is helped off the ice at Philadelphia on March 27, his standout season 
ended after a skate blade severs a tendon in his right foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Lebeau, taking a page from Gretzky's playbook, uses goalie Kelly Hrudey's leg 
to bank a shot into the net as Ducks beat the Kings for the second time. 
</P>
<P>
 Ducks get one shot in the first period at Calgary, set a club low with 12 in a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Grimson strikes again, injuring Lebeau with a check meant for an Edmonton 
player on April 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Last road game of the season. Ducks set an NHL expansion record with their 
19th road victory, beating Vancouver without Corkum, Yake, Lebeau, Shaun Van 
Allen or Todd Ewen. Team clinches fourth place, ahead of the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Sacco scores his 19th goal -- and 15th of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 A 2-1 loss to Vancouver at home Wednesday ends the first season, and the 
sweaters come off until September.

THE NHL; EPILOGUE; THE KINGS AND MIGHTY DUCKS HAVE AT LEAST ONE THING IN COMMON 
-- THEY ARE TWO OF THE 10 TEAMS THAT MANAGED NOT TO QUALIFY FOR THE STANLEY CUP 
PLAYOFFS. YET THE ASSESSMENT OF THEIR SEASONS SAYS A LOT ABOUT THE TEAMS -- ONE 
THAT SURPASSES ALL EXPECTATIONS, AND ANOTHER THAT LIVED UP TO NONE.; MIGHTY 
DUCKS; THEY HAD TO CLIMB A MATTERHORN, BUT THEY WERE A REAL NHL TEAM

<P>
 They overcame their name. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mighty Ducks.  
</P>
<P>
 Even club President Tony Tavares was once "adamantly opposed to it." But the 
players' performances helped stop the jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 "That came quick, as soon as we made our first swing through the teams," 
captain Troy Loney said. "After that, there wasn't too much joking. You didn't 
hear the Duck quacks." 
</P>
<P>
 They overcame having seven months to go from not having uniforms, players, 
season-ticket holders, radio and TV deals -- or even pucks -- to starting their 
first NHL season. 
</P>
<P>
 They overcame a roster that was ranked last in the NHL in talent. 
</P>
<P>
 And they overcame having to appear in a parade of Disney parades, command 
performances that gave NHL veterans a new perspective on their importance in 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm standing below Chip and I was kind of waving," right wing Todd Ewen 
remembered. "And then I realized the kids were waving at Chip -- and Chip's a 
small-time character in the Disney portfolio." 
</P>
<P>
 But at the end of its first season, the new Anaheim NHL team could look back 
on these accomplishments: 
</P>
<P>
 -- It finished with a 33-46-5 record, contended for the playoffs and, along 
with the Florida Panthers, set an expansion record for victories. Other 
highlights included a 19-20-3 road record and a 10-4-1 record in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It led the NHL in merchandise sales with its Duck-and-crossbones logo. At 
the team's two local stores alone, the Ducks sold 12,000 jerseys at $75-$180 
apiece and 50,000 $10 plastic duck calls. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It sold out 27 of 41 home games, including the last 25, and filled The Pond 
of Anaheim to 98.9% of its season capacity. Scoff at the pregame entertainment 
all you will, the stands were full. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can take exception to some of the things we do -- and I certainly do -- 
but the vast majority of the crowd is entertained," Tavares said. "I'm not 
going to get hung up on a purist view that we shouldn't be doing any of this. . 
. . The 33 victories speak to what we do on the ice." 
</P>
<P>
 Why did the Ducks' first season go so well that their chief disappointment was 
not making the playoffs? 
</P>
<P>
 It had to do with smart hires, from the top down to the players: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tavares, a driven, no-nonsense boss who speaks his mind -- even if it means 
ticking off Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
 -- General Manager Jack Ferreira, a respected veteran hockey executive with an 
extra needling motivation to prove the San Jose Sharks wrong for firing him in 
a front-office shake-up after their first season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ron Wilson, a creative rookie coach who handled his team like a veteran and 
managed to get outstanding performances from 17 players. 
</P>
<P>
 Off the ice, the organization managed to strike a balance with the mammoth 
Walt Disney Co. -- leaning on the entertainment conglomerate that owns the team 
for many of its non-hockey hires and taking advantage of its entertainment and 
marketing expertise, while maintaining enough separation to keep Mickey and 
Donald out of the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney Chairman Michael Eisner showed he knows enough to know what he doesn't 
know. Although he's intensely interested in the team and is lobbying the NHL to 
settle ties with a shootout, he didn't make any trades or involve himself in 
day-to-day hockey operations. 
</P>
<P>
 After the first 20 games, the Ducks were 5-13-2. Then came a 4-0 trip against 
Vancouver, Edmonton, Calgary and Winnipeg. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that point I knew we'd be all right," Wilson said. "But after every loss, 
I still worried that we might never win another game. I'd think, 'It's over. 
The bubble's burst.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Starting with that trip, they went 28-32-3 the rest of the way. Here's how it 
was done: GOALTENDING 
</P>
<P>
 Eight NHL teams finished with goals-against averages of less than 3.00 and 
save percentages of more than .900. The Ducks were one. 
</P>
<P>
 More than anything, this is why the Ducks and Panthers were better in their 
first years than other recent expansion teams. This time, the expansion 
guidelines allowed existing teams to protect only one goalie instead of two. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida got John Vanbiesbrouck, and the Ducks got two young, talented former 
backups, Guy Hebert and Ron Tugnutt. They were a tag team until Tugnutt was 
traded in February. Then Mikhail Shtalenkov, a Russian drafted last June, 
replaced Tugnutt. 
</P>
<P>
 Hebert finished with a 20-27-3 record and a 2.83 goals-against average. 
COACHING 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, a Vancouver assistant last season, had never been a head coach except 
for an interim stint in the minors. But Ferreira picked him, and Wilson, 38, 
proved to be a perfect fit, designing a defensive approach to keep the Ducks in 
games, managing to create a positive atmosphere in what has often been a dreary 
situation, and sustaining a balance between demanding intensity from his 
inexperienced players and putting debilitating pressure on them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's always had this team upbeat. He always had this team believing 
in themselves," Ferreira said. CRUCIAL PERFORMANCES 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Corkum had never scored more than six goals or had more than 10 points in 
an NHL season. He finished with 51 points, including 23 goals, despite sitting 
out the final eight games because of injury. . . . Terry Yake fell a goal short 
of matching his career high of 22, but he got the team's first hat trick in the 
sixth game of the season, an upset of the New York Rangers at Madison Square 
Garden. . . . Garry Valk was plucked from Vancouver in the waiver draft and 
became the Ducks' third-leading scorer with 45 points. . . . Joe Sacco had a 
career-high 19 goals, Tim Sweeney a career-high 18. INTANGIBLES 
</P>
<P>
 Working hard can be a cliche in hockey. A team wins and the players say, "We 
worked hard." They lose and it's, "We didn't work hard enough." But a team with 
as little skill as the Ducks had to finish its checks to equalize things. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think coming in, my concerns were just that we wouldn't be competitive," 
left wing Stu Grimson said. "You hear you'll be blown out night after night. . 
. . But my fears and apprehensions were quashed the first week when I saw how 
hard-working this bunch was." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferreira saw leadership -- from Loney, the captain, and alternates Grimson, 
Ewen and Ladouceur -- as one of the differences between the Ducks and his 
first-year San Jose team, dominated by youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one single thing that pleases me most is the way we competed all year," 
Ferreira said. "It shows a lot about the character of the guys in the locker 
room." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So, Year 1 is done. The Ducks could add a lot of talent next season by signing 
Paul Kariya and Valeri Karpov, two 1993 draft choices, and the No. 2 overall 
pick they will select in June. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say so many players perform above expectations the first year, then 
reality sets in," Tavares said. "So many teams go through a sophomore jinx. 
That's something we're striving to avoid." A MIGHTY EFFORT 
</P>
<P>
 Here is how the Mighty Ducks stacked up against other recent first-year 
expansion teams: 
</P>
<P>
 * Florida Panthers (1993-94): 33-34-17 
</P>
<P>
 * Mighty Ducks (1993-94): 33-46-5 
</P>
<P>
 * Tampa Bay Lightning (1992-93): 23-54-7 
</P>
<P>
 * San Jose Sharks (1991-92): 17-58-5 
</P>
<P>
 * Ottawa Senators (1992-93): 10-70-4 
</P>
<P>
 TAKING A BITE 
</P>
<P>
 Duck General Manager Jack Ferreira had something to prove after being fired as 
San Jose's general manager in a front-office power play in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks' 33 victories reaffirmed his ability, but he got no measure of 
revenge. The Ducks were 0-6 against the Sharks, and their 6-0 loss March 6 all 
but killed their playoff hopes.  
</P>
<P>
 So will Ferreira be pulling for the Sharks in the playoffs? 
</P>
<P>
 "There are enough players still there that I certainly wish them well, but 
players only," Ferreira said. 
</P>
<P>
 TOON IN 
</P>
<P>
 One of the best things about the Ducks was the animated opening of games on 
television, with music from Wagner (and "Apocalypse Now") and a squadron 
assault on a beleaguered opposing goaltender. Crank up the volume. And don't 
forget the Tinkerbell touch after goals. 
</P>
<P>

THE NHL; EPILOGUE; THE KINGS AND MIGHTY DUCKS HAVE AT LEAST ONE THING IN COMMON 
-- THEY ARE TWO OF THE 10 TEAMS THAT MANAGED NOT TO QUALIFY FOR THE STANLEY CUP 
PLAYOFFS. YET THE ASSESSMENT OF THEIR SEASONS SAYS A LOT ABOUT THE TEAMS -- ONE 
THAT SURPASSES ALL EXPECTATIONS, AND ANOTHER THAT LIVED UP TO NONE.; KINGS; 
BLAME GOES FROM TOP TO BOTTOM FOR GOING FROM TOP TO BOTTOM

<P>
 A collapse often starts with little things that go unnoticed, the gradual 
fraying of an organization behind the scenes. It's almost undetectable until 
the elements accumulate and the situation whirls out of control.  
</P>
<P>
 What was arguably the most disappointing season in the Kings' history 
mercifully ended. After creating great expectations by reaching the Stanley Cup 
finals in June, the Kings embarrassed themselves on and off the ice this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 They became the first team in 24 years to miss the playoffs after playing in 
the finals the previous season. The drop-off in the standings, at 27-45-12, 
from last season was 22 points and they finished 16 points out of a playoff 
spot and five points behind their neighbors, the expansion Mighty Ducks. They 
won nine of 42 road games. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Barry Melrose accepted responsibility a little too late, long after the 
season had slipped away. Club management never publicly admitted it had made 
mistakes. Owner Bruce McNall pointed a finger at himself, but either wouldn't 
or couldn't make drastic changes. The players talked a good game, but their 
words never turned into results. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, everyone spent the season assigning blame. Melrose, General Manager 
Nick Beverley and President Roy Mlakar had private disputes and their 
philosophical differences spilled out into public view in December. The wounds 
never healed. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the team's dirty laundry was aired once more earlier this month in a 
Toronto newspaper. An unidentified King executive blamed Wayne Gretzky for the 
horrible season, saying he had prevented McNall from firing Melrose. The 
article embarrassed and angered Gretzky and his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 It was another typical miscue in a long season of missteps. Somehow, all the 
wrong elements came together, created an unsettled atmosphere and ultimately 
led to the disastrous season. MANAGEMENT 
</P>
<P>
 Former General Manager Rogie Vachon was ridiculed during his tenure for a 
variety of reasons. But Vachon looked like a visionary compared to the 
Mlakar-Beverley regime.  
</P>
<P>
 Vachon could actually come out on the winning end of trades, getting Tomas 
Sandstrom and Tony Granato for Bernie Nicholls, Corey Millen for Randy Gilhen 
and Mike Donnelly for Mikko Makela. 
</P>
<P>
 This management team got burned almost every time it went to market. The Paul 
Coffey-Jimmy Carson fiasco was the worst. But Beverley gave Millen to New 
Jersey for a fifth-round draft choice in June and Millen scored 50 points for 
the Devils, which would have put him sixth among the Kings in scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bob Kudelski trade in late 1992 continued to haunt both Beverley and 
Melrose. Kudelski scored 40 goals and 70 points for two teams this season and 
showed that Melrose should have had more patience and flexibility with him, and 
that Beverley should have got more than two journeymen for him. 
</P>
<P>
 At the trading deadline, the Kings could have made a dramatic move, but stood 
still while other teams, notably the New York Rangers and Chicago Blackhawks, 
made deals to help themselves.  
</P>
<P>
 The Kings and Beverley never seemed an ideal fit. He lacked the strong 
personality to deal with those both above and below him in the organizational 
structure. In two seasons, the players remember him addressing the team once.  
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the Kings' problems extend far beyond Los Angeles. Their 
minor-league team in Phoenix has failed to make the playoffs the last three 
seasons in the International Hockey League, which is a direct reflection of the 
organization's player personnel and scouting departments. THE COACH 
</P>
<P>
 Cocky. Stubborn. Autocratic. 
</P>
<P>
 Those qualities may have helped Melrose lead the Kings to the finals last 
spring, but this season they had something to do with the team's collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 In two seasons, Melrose has shown the ability to coach well in short spurts. 
Last season, the Kings played well the first three months, the final month and 
in the playoffs. It's hard to tell if Melrose is hockey's answer to Billy 
Martin, a quick-fix coach, or if the Kings would have played for anybody. 
</P>
<P>
 But Melrose has shown distressing signs of being like another baseball man, 
former Angel manager Doug Rader. Rader liked hard workers like Dave Gallagher 
as opposed to talented players like Devon White. 
</P>
<P>
 Melrose watered down the Kings' talent with too many grinders. Many hockey 
observers wonder whether Phil Crowe, Gary Shuchuk and Doug Houda even belong in 
the NHL. Warren Rychel slipped a notch this season, but Melrose refused to 
admit it. 
</P>
<P>
 He mishandled Sandstrom and Shawn McEachern, who were traded to Pittsburgh for 
Marty McSorley. Earlier, he dwelt on McSorley's and Millen's absence and got no 
help from the front office until McNall reacquired McSorley. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Melrose, the Kings were predictable. Their power play hardly varied in 
execution. They gave up an incredible number of shots night after night, a 
staggering season total of 3,046, an average of 36.2 a game. Melrose said it 
didn't matter, a hollow claim. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings were patient with his predecessor, Tom Webster. Melrose has the Cup 
finals as a line on his resume, but it will have to be determined whether last 
season was smoke and mirrors and if this season was the real Melrose. THE 
PLAYERS 
</P>
<P>
 A hockey player finds it easier to escape in Los Angeles than in Toronto, 
Montreal or Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings could underachieve in relative anonymity. Gretzky was the exception 
as he won his 10th NHL scoring title with 130 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Several Kings were well off their totals of last season. Left wing Luc 
Robitaille dropped 19 goals and 39 points, down to 44 goals and 86 points. 
Robitaille, who was minus 20, scored five of his goals after the Kings had been 
eliminated from the playoffs and went 14 games without one during one stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of stuff happened this year that can't ever happen again if we want to 
keep a winning franchise," Robitaille said. 
</P>
<P>
 Right wing Tony Granato, although hampered by a chronic back injury, scored 
only seven goals and 21 points. Last season, he had 37 goals and 82 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "As hard as it will be to forget, I'll try and learn from this," he said. "I 
have a lot to prove to myself and everybody else."  
</P>
<P>
 Donnelly was down eight goals and 27 points from last season. Defenseman Rob 
Blake had career highs of 20 goals and 68 points, but has not yet become the 
Norris Trophy contender that Melrose projected. Young defenseman Alexei Zhitnik 
was erratic and defenseman Darryl Sydor lost about 10 pounds during the season 
and found himself getting manhandled. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings' defense didn't improve and their offense was nowhere near last 
season's. Robitaille claimed they were playing not to make mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some guys were playing well at some times," he said. "We just never put it 
together as a team. I wish I knew why." THE NADIR 
</P>
<P>
 The low point of the season had to be on March 9 against the Chicago 
Blackhawks at the Forum. Coach Barry Melrose called the Kings "a team of fat 
cats that doesn't want to pay the price." Between periods, owner Bruce McNall 
-- who was paying the price -- yelled at the team to "Hit somebody!" And the 
crowd chanted "Refund! Refund!" 
</P>
<P>
 NO SAVIOR 
</P>
<P>
 Marty McSorley went from using an illegal stick in the Stanley Cup finals to a 
salary squabble that led to his exile to Pittsburgh before the season for Shawn 
McEachern. But with the team in desperate need of a lift, McSorley was 
reacquired from the Penguins for McEachern and Tomas Sandstrom. He scored a 
goal in his first game, but the Kings lost -- and they continued losing. If 
things weren't bad enough, McSorley underwent abdominal surgery after the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 BAD NUMBERS 
</P>
<P>
 * In November and December, the Kings went 8-15-1. 
</P>
<P>
 * In February and March, they went 6-15-4. 
</P>
<P>
 * There was a nine-game winless streak (0-6-3) from Feb. 2-28. 
</P>
<P>
 * They had a 10-game losing streak on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 * The longest winning streak was three games -- but they accomplished that 
twice. 
</P>
<P>
 BIG TALK 
</P>
<P>
 General Manager Nick Beverley on Dec. 18, after Coach Barry Melrose said the 
Kings needed bigger players: 
</P>
<P>
 "How are we going to win games? That's what we need to worry about instead of 
casting aspersions toward players who are working hard, just because their 
stature is not considered up to his standards."

THE NHL; STANLEY CUP PLAYOFF PREVIEW; FLAMES ROLLING BUT RIVALS STAGGERING

<P>
 The defending Stanley Cup champion Montreal Canadiens wobbled to the finish 
line, the Boston Bruins limped home without Ray Bourque and Cam Neely, and the 
Vancouver Canucks barely finished above .500. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the Calgary Flames, who went 10-3-2 to end the regular season, appear 
primed for postseason play, which began Saturday with one series and moves into 
full swing today. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-month chase promises to be as wild as it was last spring, when no 
division winner made it past the second round and all four semifinalists had 
finished third in their divisions. Conference seedings have replaced divisional 
rankings, but some traditional rivalries will be renewed. 
</P>
<P>
 Division winners were seeded first and second in each conference. The 
higher-seeded team has home-ice advantage in each series. WESTERN CONFERENCE 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit (1) vs. San Jose (8) -- Don't laugh, but many observers pick the 
first-time-in-the-playoffs Sharks, the only sub-.500 team, at 33-35-16, invited 
to this party. They have two key ingredients for postseason success: a hot 
goalie, Arturs Irbe, and a sound defense. The line of Johan Garpenlov, Sergei 
Makarov and Igor Larionov shares the offensive burden with the Ray 
Whitney-Jamie Baker-Pat Falloon trio and right wing Ulf Dahlen. Although the 
Red Wings (46-30-8) won the Central Division title and scored a league-high 356 
goals, they seem vulnerable because of their soft defense and Bob Essensa's 
dubious goaltending. They must dictate a fast tempo and make sure Sergei 
Fedorov, the scoring race runner-up with 120 points, gets loose. 
</P>
<P>
 Calgary (2) vs. Vancouver (7) -- The Canucks dreaded this matchup, fearing the 
Flames' size and offense. Calgary (42-29-13) is deep at center with playmaker 
Mikael Nylander, Robert Reichel (40 goals), German Titov (27) and Joe 
Nieuwendyk (36). Goalie Mike Vernon, who played on the Flames' 1989 Stanley 
Cup-winning team, had a solid season for the Pacific Division champions. Assets 
for the Canucks (41-40-3) are Pavel Bure, who led the NHL with 60 goals, Trevor 
Linden (32) and a rugged defense. But they lack a dominant center. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto (3) vs. Chicago (6) -- Look for a physical series between these 
Central Division rivals, two of the league's original six teams. Both like to 
hit and grind. The Maple Leafs (43-29-12) faltered when defenseman Dave Ellett 
separated his shoulder and goalie Felix Potvin slumped. The Blackhawks 
(39-36-9) got a third straight 100-point season from Jeremy Roenick and 31 
goals from Joe Murphy. Goalie Ed Belfour was stalwart, as always, posting a 
2.67 goals-against average. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas (4) vs. St. Louis (5) -- The Stars (42-29-13) were a success in their 
first season in Texas. Mike Modano, no longer afraid to play in traffic around 
the net, scored 50 goals. The Blues (40-33-11) gained finesse in deals that 
brought them Petr Nedved, Peter Stastny and Steve Duchesne, but they lost grit 
in trading Bob Bassen, Garth Butcher and Ron Sutter. Brendan Shanahan (52 
goals) and Brett Hull (57) lead an explosive offense, but the Blues' defense is 
shaky. Goalie Curtis Joseph faced 2,382 shots, more than seven other teams 
faced, and had a .911 save percentage. The Blues hope he's not exhausted. 
EASTERN CONFERENCE 
</P>
<P>
 New York Rangers (1) vs. New York Islanders (8) -- Mike Keenan coached the 
Rangers (52-24-8) to the Atlantic Division and overall point titles; the 
Islanders (36-36-12) squeezed into the playoffs on the next-to-last day of the 
season. That disparity might melt in the emotional heat of their rivalry. The 
Islanders finished with a 5-1-3 surge as Ron Hextall (4-0-2 in his last six 
games) regained his old Flyer form. Pierre Turgeon (38 goals), Steve Thomas 
(42) and Benoit Hogue (36) trigger a peppy offense. The Rangers have no 
weaknesses, but Mark Messier went from Feb. 18 to April 10 without a goal and 
isn't his usual forceful self. Brian Leetch and Sergei Zubov lead a mobile 
defense that diligently protects Mike Richter, who recorded a league-high 42 
victories. The Islanders won the season series, 2-1-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh (2) vs. Washington (7) -- Mario Lemieux played five of the last six 
games but isn't in top shape for the playoff grind. Still, the Penguins 
(44-27-13) have Kevin Stevens, who gave them 41 goals and lots of muscle, and 
the leadership of Ron Francis and Joe Mullen. The Capitals were 19-12-6 after 
Jim Schoenfeld replaced Terry Murray as coach and 39-35-10 overall. Center Joe 
Juneau, who totaled 13 points in 11 games after being acquired from Boston, and 
Dmitri Khristich (29 goals) are their scoring threats. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey (3) vs. Buffalo (6) -- The NHL's two top defensive teams meet in 
this series. The Devils (47-25-12) set franchise records for victories and 
points -- and compiled a 2.59 team goals-against average -- thanks to rookie 
goalie Martin Brodeur, who had a 2.40 average and .915 save percentage. Norris 
Trophy candidate Scott Stevens heads a solid defense. The offense is balanced, 
with 14 players who hit double figures in goals. Dominik Hasek's stellar 
goaltending kept the Sabres (43-32-9) competitive despite a pop-gun offense. He 
led the NHL with a 1.95 average and .930 save percentage. Buffalo's 2.57 team 
average led the league. However, Hasek has only seven games' postseason 
experience, and he must prove he can handle playoff pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston (4) vs. Montreal (5) -- Another original-six matchup. The Bruins 
(42-28-13) got Bourque back from a knee sprain, and they desperately need his 
quarterbacking on the power play. Center Adam Oates (32 goals, 112 points) had 
another superb season, and rookie Bryan Smolinski scored 31 goals, but the 
offense is thin without 50-goal scorer Neely, who is idled by a knee injury. 
The Canadiens (41-29-14) ended with a 3-6-2 thud, and their hopes rest on 
goalie Patrick Roy's repeating last spring's Cup heroics. Vincent Damphousse 
(40 goals, 91 points) was their only consistent scorer in a season that tested 
Coach Jacques Demers' patience and vast coaching knowledge. Stanley Cup

FERREIRA, WILSON PLAN BUILDING PROJECT OVER THE SUMMER; HOCKEY: THE LIST OF 
THINGS TO DO INCLUDES ELEVATING THE TALENT LEVEL OF THE TEAM.

<P>
 What's next? Where do the Mighty Ducks go from here? To the playoffs next 
season? To the Pacific Division cellar? Or somewhere between again? 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks tied the Florida Panthers for the most victories by an NHL expansion 
team, were playoff contenders in March, made a killing on duck calls and 
punched up a dreary pro sports scene in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 They also missed the playoffs, were swept, 6-0, by San Jose, won only 13 of 41 
games at home and failed to sign Paul Kariya. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the framework, good and bad, from which the Ducks will build their 
1994-95 season. 
</P>
<P>
 It could be a boffo sequel, although General Manager Jack Ferreira refuses to 
relax. 
</P>
<P>
 "The second year is always the toughest," he said. "Some guys get complacent. 
We can't sneak up on people." 
</P>
<P>
 With that in mind, Ferreira will soon intensify contract talks with Kariya and 
two other unsigned draft picks, Valeri Karpov and Nikolai Tsulygin. 
</P>
<P>
 Kariya, who will play for Canada in the World Championships later this month 
in Italy, attended his first Duck game last week in Vancouver and was present 
for the season finale, Wednesday against the Canucks at The Pond of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferreira said he's close to signing Karpov and mentioned Tsulygin's name that 
day to reporters more times than in the past six months. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not kidding anybody," Ferreira said. "We've got to elevate our skill 
level. Some of the answers are already in the organization. We want to have a 
good draft and explore the free-agent market. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to get a little quicker and to get two or three more young prospects 
in the organization . . . and get the Kariyas and Karpovs signed." 
</P>
<P>
 If they can't sign Kariya -- and Ferreira has said he's worried Kariya might 
play in Europe next season -- here are other options. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks acquired forward Maxim Bets, 20, in the deal that sent veteran 
defenseman Alexei Kasatonov to St. Louis on March 21. Bets had 116 points (46 
goals and 70 assists) in juniors for the Spokane Chiefs of the Western Hockey 
League this past season. 
</P>
<P>
 They also signed Mike Maneluk, 20, of WHL's Brandon Wheat Kings on Jan. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maneluk (dominated) the Western Hockey League," said Pierre Gauthier, Duck 
assistant general manager. "He's a pure goal-corer with a lot of speed." 
</P>
<P>
 There are rumors that Florida, which has the No. 1 pick in the June draft, 
will select junior defenseman Ed Jovanovski, leaving high-scoring Czech forward 
Radek Bonk, 18, available to the Ducks, who have the second pick. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever happens in the off-season, don't expect the Ducks to swap their 
tight-checking style for a more wide-open game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to improve our overall speed, get more mobile on defense," Ferreira 
said. "But we're not going to do it and sacrifice size. You get Kariya and 
Karpov in, and you get smaller. You don't want to get too small." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't expect any changes in goal. Guy Hebert and Mikhail Shtalenkov kept the 
Ducks' goals-against average less than 3.00, one of the league's best. Ferreira 
liked Hebert and Shtalenkov so much, he traded Ron Tugnutt to Montreal for 
forward Stephan Lebeau on Feb. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question we started in the right direction," said Hebert, who was 
in goal for 20 of the Ducks' 33 victories. 
</P>
<P>
 "It puts a little pressure on the coaching staff now. Every guy will come back 
with a lot more enthusiasm. And there are a lot of new guys ready to jump on 
the bandwagon. The new guys are going to come in, and that's going to help us 
in the long run." 
</P>
<P>
 When the season began, Ron Wilson wondered what the future held for him in his 
first NHL head coaching position. Friends cautioned Wilson about coaching an 
expansion team, pointing out the obvious difficulties associated with getting a 
new team off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Take it, they said, and it might be your last NHL job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope it is," Wilson said. "I hope I'm here 10 years from now." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson and assistants Tim Army and Al Sims drummed one simple notion into the 
players' minds throughout the season: play hard. 
</P>
<P>
 It was often the only way to keep up with more skilled teams. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks' skill level will no doubt rise with the addition of Kariya and 
Karpov and the continued development of top scorers Terry Yake (52 points) and 
Bob Corkum (51). But count on Wilson continuing to hammer on their work ethic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found out hard work almost makes up for a lack of talent," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine a better combination of grit and skill, because that's what the Ducks 
have in mind for the future. You can expect the most dramatic changes among 
their centers and wings. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Yake, more internal competition will make the Ducks better. 
</P>
<P>
 "If somebody (new) beats someone else out (during training camp) that makes 
for an improved team," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yake hopes he'll better his 52-point total, which he called a disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I bought a lot of (video) editing equipment, and I want to spend the summer 
assessing my game," he said. "The bottom line is I want to make an improvement. 
I want to get 80 points, 100 points next season." 
</P>
<P>
 And then there are the stumbling blocks Yake said cost the Ducks a playoff 
berth -- 21 one-goal losses, an 0-6 series record against the Sharks and a 
14-26-2 home record (including a neutral site victory over Dallas in Phoenix). 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, we learn from our mistakes," he said. "We need to win more of the 
one-goal games. We've got to find our way around that. We've got to find our 
way around San Jose. We can't lose six games to anyone. The difference was 
going 0-6 against San Jose." 
</P>
<P>
 There's no way to gloss over the Ducks' shortcomings this past season, only a 
chance next season to smooth out the rough spots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Next year, we're going to look at, No. 1, making the playoffs and not just 
coming in eighth," Yake said. "It will be more about getting into a better spot 
in the playoffs, like fifth or sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 "The expectations are going to be higher next year."

GOLF / DAN HAFNER; TWILIGHT YEARS FOR THE SPORT'S BIGGEST NAMES

<P>
 In the '60s and '70s, if Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus or Gary Player didn't 
win the tournament, it was an upset. 
</P>
<P>
 In the '80s, Palmer started the threesome's domination of the Senior PGA Tour. 
The others followed. Will the '90s finally mark the end of the terrific trio? 
</P>
<P>
 Player, who will be 59 in November, is enthusiastic about still being active 
at the turn of the century. Nicklaus, 54, is not so encouraged by his game. He 
has always said that if he finds he can't compete on the regular tour, he will 
confine his golf to an occasional senior event. He has missed the cut in his 
last six tournaments with the juniors. And Palmer is downright discouraged, at 
least temporarily. He is just not playing well. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer, who hasn't won since 1988, will be 65 in September. It was the 
Latrobe, Pa., slasher who carried golf into the realm of major sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Hard on his heels came Nicklaus, who became recognized as the greatest golfer 
of all time. 
</P>
<P>
 And Player, a winner all over the world for more than 40 years, set a record 
that may never be equaled. He won tournaments in 27 consecutive years. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Nicklaus and Player figure to be around for several years. Palmer, 
recently named the recipient of the PGA's distinguished-service award, expects 
to come bouncing back soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "A month ago, I was really hitting the ball," Palmer said. "At Ojai I opened 
with a 67, then everything went haywire. It will come back." 
</P>
<P>
 But, if it doesn't, Palmer, despite the pleas of his fans, probably won't keep 
on playing. He has been talking recently of cutting back. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicklaus is hoping new equipment might help him. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're building me a new driver and I'll get it next week," he said. "It 
should solve my problem. But for now, I'm planning on taking Barbara on a 
two-week vacation. It will be the first time. Never before have we been off by 
ourselves for more than three or four days at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't be playing until the Memorial (at his Muirfield course in Dublin, 
Ohio, in late May) and by that time, I hope to have my problem solved. I know 
it will happen, I just don't know when." 
</P>
<P>
 Player, who was laughed at years ago for his faith in physical fitness, won at 
Lexington, Ky., last September and earned $360,000 last year on the senior 
tour. Now almost all golfers, especially the seniors, have physical fitness 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I can continue to win until I'm 64 or 65," the South African star 
said. "I have such a good short game that I figure I have a shot to win every 
week. It's a little tougher out there, but I can still compete. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not about to stick around like some punch-drunk fighter. When I don't 
have a chance to win, I'll know it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then, I'll only play a few super-senior events and maybe I can win one of 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Nicklaus won as recently as January, finishing first in the senior portion of 
the Mercedes Championships at La Costa, the first event of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 That victory, Nicklaus' seventh on the senior tour, gave the trio 185 
victories on the two major golf tours. 
</P>
<P>
 They played together in a tournament for the first time this year in the PGA 
Seniors' Championship here this weekend, each as a previous winner. Palmer, 
continuing in his slump, shot 77-79 -- 156 and failed to make the 36-hole cut. 
Despite advancing age, it may be too soon to count some of them out. Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
 In the days when professional golfers were struggling to earn money and 
recognition, two of the best were Southern California brothers, Olin and Mortie 
Dutra. Wilshire Country Club now honors the pair with their two-man team 
championship. Low gross honors went to Bob Warburton and James Agate with a 135 
total for 36 holes. Derek Patao hit an eight-iron for a hole-in-one on the 
135-yard seventh. . . . Celebrities for this year's Padua Village Golf Classic, 
the 12th annual at Red Hill Country Club in Rancho Cucamonga April 25, are Walt 
Zembriski, Ann Meyers-Drysdale, Charlie Pasarell, Pat Haden and Jim Murray. . . 
In 1964, when he won the first of his six PGA Seniors' championships, Sam Snead 
was a mere 51. Nine years later, just before his 60th birthday, Snead won by an 
incredible 15 shots, posting a 20-under-par 268.

THE NBA / MARK HEISLER; PLAYING OR COACHING, BIG GUYS ARE TOUGH TO GET 
</P>

<P>
 Coach Earvin, the legacy: Now that it's officially a 15-game tour, all the 
Lakers can do is try to make the best of Magic Johnson's month. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it disappointing? 
</P>
<P>
 Believe that. Everyone was excited. Now everyone feels let down. 
</P>
<P>
 Was it worth it? 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Buss gambled and lost, so there's no use talking about how good it would 
have been. If you're inclined, you could say, "Nice try." 
</P>
<P>
 Is there an up side? 
</P>
<P>
 There will be if the Lakers can hire another big guy to raise everyone's 
spirits. Big guys are hard to recruit, however, and command kings' ransoms. If 
they call Rick Pitino, his response won't be, "Me? Really? I'll be right out!" 
</P>
<P>
 It will be, "I've got the Hornets on the other line. How about 10 years at $25 
million and a say in personnel?" 
</P>
<P>
 What's the down side? 
</P>
<P>
 The big guys might turn them down, leaving them to install another rookie, who 
will either be a genius or get eaten up by the players and the expectations as 
Randy Pfund was. Then they'll waste another season or two. WHERE HAVE ALL THE 
FLOWERS GONE? 
</P>
<P>
 The league has never had more bad teams, even in an expansion year. The Dallas 
Mavericks have a chance to become the first team to post back-to-back 70-loss 
seasons. Before them, it had been done only twice. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight teams won't win 30 games. Only one of them entered in the last expansion 
of 1988 and 1989. The rest bumbled their way to the bottom, some on age, most 
on merit. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting from the bottom: 
</P>
<P>
 DALLAS MAVERICKS -- When the owner starts getting rid of everyone so he can 
bring back his original coach, who already proved to be a pain there and 
everywhere he went afterward, you glimpse the dimensions of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what's happening in Big D, where Donald Carter, the 
well-meaning-but-a-tad-confused owner, sacked personnel director Rick Sund, 
booted General Manager Norm Sonju upstairs, might yet ax all-world-disaster 
Coach Quinn Buckner. . .and wants to bring back Dick Motta. 
</P>
<P>
 Motta is an old-school, bad-tempered tyrant who couldn't handle young players 
10 years ago when they weren't half the head cases they are now. He doesn't 
want to be the new general manager, but might consider coaching. Lucky them. 
</P>
<P>
 MILWAUKEE BUCKS -- They outsmarted people with an aging roster for years, then 
fell like a dead tree in a hurricane. Mike Dunleavy, who has the brains and the 
necessary long-term deal, backed up the truck, but he's only starting. 
</P>
<P>
 MINNESOTA TIMBERWOLVES -- A mismanagement clinic, featuring poor choices in 
coaches, starting with strung-out Bill Musselman, leading to Mr. Nice Guy, 
Sidney Lowe, whom temperamental young stars Christian Laettner and Isaiah Rider 
trample daily. Owners Marv Wolfensen and Harvey Ratner incurred a $75-million 
cost overrun on a $50-million arena -- maybe they didn't need that health club? 
-- making the final tab $125 million and a debt that has them threatening to 
move. David Stern is trying to keep it together, but everyone in the Twin 
Cities has had a bellyful of the Timberwolves. 
</P>
<P>
 DETROIT PISTONS -- Marketing skill kept people coming, and they can't bear to 
actually tear it down and rebuild. With Isiah Thomas moving upstairs, maybe 
they can make Bill Laimbeer coach as a public-relations move. 
</P>
<P>
 WASHINGTON BULLETS -- If it wasn't for bad luck, they wouldn't have any luck 
at all. Despite five consecutive lottery appearances, they haven't drafted 
better than fifth. The last time they were in the top three was 1968, when they 
took Wes Unseld, now the coach who's about to be booted upstairs. 
</P>
<P>
 PHILADELPHIA 76ERS -- Years of owner Harold Katz's madcap deals and drafts -- 
remember Kenny Payne over Vlade Divac? -- cost them players such as Brad 
Daugherty and Charles Barkley and cast them into the lottery until 1995 at 
least. 
</P>
<P>
 SACRAMENTO KINGS -- Like the Bullets, they've assembled some good young 
players but need to get lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 CLIPPERS -- Another lost season. This team could at least have finished strong 
after ending the Danny Manning distraction. Instead, it quit dead in its 
tracks. Management bought another two years by trading for 34-year-old 
Dominique Wilkins, but even if 'Nique and Ron Harper sign, are they in the 
playoffs? Who in the West can they beat out? What happens in two years? 
</P>
<P>
 Of such vision are losers institutionalized. VOTE FOR ME OR ELSE. . . 
</P>
<P>
 Dikembe Mutombo speaks five languages, but the Nugget center must have missed 
a word or two of English, such as modesty . 
</P>
<P>
 Because he plays in the NBA, where the rule is "I'd be more modest if I wasn't 
so great," we'll forgive him this one. 
</P>
<P>
 Reward . 
</P>
<P>
 This is something one earns with superior performance, rather than by asking 
for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign . 
</P>
<P>
 This is a process wherein one persuades others with logic and sentiment, 
rather than threatening them. 
</P>
<P>
 Mutombo, an otherwise nice young man, now refers to himself as "a great 
defensive player" and demands to be enshrined as the NBA's defender of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 He leads the league in blocked shots, is praised by rival coaches such as 
Seattle's George Karl ("He must block seven a game against us") and even 
endorsed by a competitor, Hakeem Olajuwon ("He's got my vote"). 
</P>
<P>
 To Mutombo, that makes it unanimous. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there is no doubt in my mind, I have to win that thing," he said. "I 
deserve it. If I don't get it, I will tell the league to kiss my rear end. I 
will tell the media and the press. I don't know what else should I do to tell 
them I deserve the reward." 
</P>
<P>
 I can't think of anything. HE FEELS ANOTHER BOOK COMING ON 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Riley's New York Knicks continue to swing from naught to juggernaut, 
losing eight of 12, winning 15 in a row, losing four of five. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley says it's that old menmotum.  
</P>
<P>
 "You won't find it in your dictionary," he says. "It's the reverse of 
momentum. You can never feel when menmotum will grab you around the throat 
because it just keeps subtly cropping up. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the last few games we'd won, we hadn't played as well as we could. When 
you tell guys they're doing something wrong while they're winning, they roll 
their eyes. But when you lose, they listen." 
</P>
<P>
 For those who prefer explanations in words found in the dictionary, try this: 
The Knicks overachieved for a month with a fantastic defensive effort and a 
weak schedule (NBA streaks usually start with an opportunity granted by the 
schedule to build momentum). Upon returning to earth, they missed the injured 
John Starks. How would a team averaging 96 points not miss a 19-point scorer? 
FACES AND FIGURES 
</P>
<P>
 OK, it was me: Ken Norman, who left the Clippers as a free agent, was so hated 
in Milwaukee, he tried to talk the Clippers into dealing for him. "I'm a much 
better player than I displayed, and I'm a much better leader than I displayed. 
I'm somewhat embarrassed about the season. In fact, it's the biggest 
disappointment in my life, the way the season has gone for me." . . .Orlando 
Magic players donned special T-shirts and did what Shaquille O'Neal called "the 
young guns' tribal dance" to celebrate making the playoffs for the first time. 
Said Jeff Turner: "The tribal dance was my signal to leave." Magic players then 
carried Coach Brian Hill off the floor. Said Dennis Scott: "We did that for B. 
You can open the paper and see where Don Nelson or some coach with a 
prestigious name should be our coach, but we know Brian is the only coach for 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 Magic Johnson on Chris Webber, whom he befriended when Webber was an 
eighth-grader: "The players are so different now. I was just hearing the other 
day Chris Webber was complaining about Don Nelson. I was thinking to myself, 
'What do you want?' I've always thought of Don Nelson as a player's coach. He 
lets you run. He lets you shoot. What more do you want? And Nellie's a good guy 
too. I just don't understand." Webber then went for 25 points, 10 rebounds and 
nine assists against the Lakers, proving that while youth may be inscrutable, 
it must also be served. 
</P>
<P>
 NBA types are advising Purdue's Glenn Robinson to declare for the draft -- 
whether he leaves school or not. He's guaranteed to be the top pick this year. 
Next year, he could conceivably go No. 2, behind Rasheed Wallace, or could get 
hurt and lose some value.... Ricky Pierce, the closest thing the Seattle 
SuperSonics have to a go-to guy, is back after having a spur shaved off the top 
of his left foot. However, Gary Payton and Kendall Gill blossomed with 
additional minutes and Karl must now find time for four guards.... Coach Phil 
Jackson said he had thought his Chicago Bulls would win 49 games this season. 
With a 3-1 finish, they will equal last season's 57. 
</P>
<P>
 Askia Jones of Kansas State, the son of former 76er Wali Jones, was MVP at the 
Portsmouth, Va., tournament, the first of the pre-draft camps. The rest of the 
all-tournament team: Melvin Booker, Missouri; Lawrence Funderburke, Ohio State; 
Brooks Thompson, Oklahoma State, Dickey Simpkins, Providence; Travis Ford, 
Kentucky; Kendrick Warren, Virginia Commonwealth. Portsmouth leads to 
invitations to the Phoenix camp in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota broadcaster Kevin McHale, a passionate Democrat, on turning down an 
invitation to meet President Bill Clinton: "I've had my experience with those 
Presidential things. We (the Boston Celtics) went to the White House after we 
won in 1984. It was about 150 degrees in the Rose Garden. (Ronald) Reagan came 
out and he mumbled something. Then he butchered (John) Havlicek's name. That 
was it for me."

BASEBALL / ROSS NEWHAN; BLUE JAYS EVOKE FOND MEMORIES OF '70S FOR TENACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It will be 20 years in October since a team last won the third of three 
consecutive World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 Gene Tenace was a catcher-first baseman on the Oakland A's of 1972-74. Now he 
is the bench coach for the Toronto Blue Jays, who have won two consecutive 
World Series.  
</P>
<P>
 As a link between the teams and eras of a sport in which dynasties are now 
measured in months, Tenace said there were many similarities.  
</P>
<P>
 "It starts with talent," he said. "There is a lot of talent on this team, as 
there was with the A's. There is also a similarity in dedication, pride and 
willingness to sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once a team is used to winning, that's it. There's no second place. You can 
see it in the work habits here." 
</P>
<P>
 What people were first apt to see with the A's were the facial adornments that 
prompted the nickname of "Mustache Gang." Even more memorable was their 
penchant for fighting among themselves and with owner Charles Finley.  
</P>
<P>
 "Finley was the Steinbrenner of that era," Tenace said, referring to the New 
York Yankees' owner. 
</P>
<P>
 "It might have been part of his motive, but we were driven to prove we could 
overcome the obstacles he put in front of us. It was a team of character and 
characters, but what happened in the clubhouse didn't affect what happened on 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of self-pride. We were battling for survival on a daily 
basis. There were no multiyear contracts then, no job security under Finley." 
</P>
<P>
 The feuding tended to overshadow the talent -- until the final out of the 
World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd give the A's an edge in pitching, but this club is better offensively," 
Tenace said of the Blue Jays. "It has more speed and power. 
</P>
<P>
 "The A's had to execute different things to win, but the Blue Jays also do a 
good job of execution." 
</P>
<P>
 Position by position, Tenace gave Toronto the edge at first base (John Olerud 
over Tenace and Mike Epstein), second base (Roberto Alomar over Dick Green), 
center field (Devon White over Billy North) and designated hitter (Paul Molitor 
over Deron Johnson). 
</P>
<P>
 He gave Oakland the edge at shortstop (Bert Campaneris over Manny Lee, Tony 
Fernandez and talented but unproven rookie Alex Gonzalez), third base (Sal 
Bando over Kelly Gruber and Ed Sprague) and left field (Joe Rudi over a 
revolving door that rookie Carlos Delgado is about to close). 
</P>
<P>
 He also gave the A's a slight edge at catcher (Tenace and Ray Fosse over Pat 
Borders), called right field (Joe Carter and Reggie Jackson) a tossup and said 
the A's clearly had the edge in pitching depth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oakland rotation included Ken Holtzman, Catfish Hunter, Vida Blue and John 
Odom. The bullpen featured Rollie Fingers, Paul Lindblad, Darold Knowles and 
Bob Locker. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blue Jays are bidding for a fourth consecutive division title in the 
competitive American League East with a rotation of Juan Guzman, Dave Stewart, 
Pat Hentgen and Al Leiter. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Stottlemyre has moved into the closer role, replacing Duane Ward, 
expected to be sidelined another three weeks because of biceps tendinitis. 
</P>
<P>
 The A's won two of their three World Series titles with Dick Williams as 
manager, the third under Alvin Dark, but Tenace said: 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't matter who the manager was because the players knew what they 
wanted to accomplish. We had outstanding pitching and defense and good hitting. 
We just had to stay focused and not get distracted by the owner." 
</P>
<P>
 There are no distractions from the corporate ownership of the Blue Jays or a 
front office that annually proves it will do whatever necessary to return to 
the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anytime you win back to back, beating quality teams like Atlanta and 
Philadelphia in the process, you're doing something right," Tenace said.  
</P>
<P>
 Tenace also cited manager Cito Gaston and said he deserves more credit for the 
consistency of his leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whoever managed the A's had the leverage because there weren't any multiyear 
contracts," Tenace said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That isn't true anymore, but Cito does a great job handling the players and 
getting the most out of what he has to work with. There's mutual respect. He 
can be firm if he has to be, but the players know they won't be ripped in the 
press." 
</P>
<P>
 Tenace, who was also a part-time player with the St. Louis Cardinals when they 
won the 1982 World Series, hopes to make it 6-0 in Fall Classics, adding 
another ring to his collection. 
</P>
<P>
 "Darn right," he said. "I like jewelry." BEST YET? 
</P>
<P>
 The feeling among the Blue Jays is that their everyday lineup could be the 
most powerful yet, with rookies Delgado and Gonzalez filling positions that had 
frequently forced management to make mid- or late-season moves. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaston calls them "the best rookies to come through the organization since 
Tony Fernandez (in 1983)," and said other clubs have to be envious at Toronto's 
ability to fill its needs from within or without. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's Toronto," he said. "Don't rebuild, just reload." 
</P>
<P>
 Delgado, in particular, is off to a smashing start with six home runs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not surprised," Carter said. "He's the real thing. I knew that two years 
ago when I first saw him at 18. It was like, 'Wow!' " 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't matter if he hits it to left, right or center. He's an 
equal-opportunity hitter." 
</P>
<P>
 Molitor concurred.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's no such thing as a sure deal, but he comes pretty close," Molitor 
said. "Offensively, it seems obvious he's a player with big things in store." 
TRIMMING THE FAT 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Pendleton, the Atlanta Braves' third baseman, was saying last week that 
he has been rebuffed twice in attempts to get a contract extension and suspects 
he will be playing for another team in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Pendleton also says he has shed 20 pounds. Apparently, he doesn't want to put 
up with the barrage of overweight rips that accompanied his .148 average 
through May 4 last season, after which he batted .299 and finished at .272 with 
17 homers and 84 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always been a slow starter," Pendleton said. "My weight didn't have 
anything to do with it, and it (ticked) me off that people said it did. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the same time, I was definitely . . . overweight. I think that after 
playing in two World Series my body just gave out on me. I was too exhausted to 
do the off-season work I normally do going into last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm also a junk-food idiot with a body that tends to retain everything I eat. 
I changed my diet this winter, brought our strength coach in from Denver to 
work with me, and spent three straight weeks in the gym, working three to five 
hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like a new person, and it's great to have people say how well I look, 
although it's still tough to drive through a McDonald's with the kids and not 
share their French fries." THE CHALLENGE 
</P>
<P>
 The Braves celebrated the 20th anniversary of Hank Aaron's 715th home run with 
a pregame ceremony Wednesday night, after which Fred McGriff, the major league 
home run leader over the last five years, provided an appropriate postscript 
with a 12th-inning homer to beat the San Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 McGriff began the season with 174 homers in the last five seasons and a 
seven-year total of 228, but it is unlikely he can catch Aaron, since at 30 he 
would have to play until he's 44, averaging 35 homers a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Gonzalez provides yet another measure of the magnitude of Aaron's 
accomplishment. The Texas Ranger outfielder, with 123 homers through Thursday, 
was 13 ahead of Aaron at 24, but he must average 40 a year, playing until he's 
39, to surpass 715. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez has hit 43 and 46 in the last two years, but even in an era of 
diluted pitching it seems improbable he can maintain that for another 15 years 
-- or would even choose to play that long. 
</P>
<P>
 He is already set for life -- as would seem to be his grandchildren's 
grandchildren -- with a $45-million-plus contract. JUST THE FACTS 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing on a business panel in New York the other day, Bill Giles, president 
of the Philadelphia Phillies, said the 28 major league teams would lose $100 
million this year and that at least three -- San Diego, Montreal and Milwaukee 
-- might have to move if the clubs fail to get a salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Giles offered no documentation and Executive Director Don Fehr of the players' 
union, still waiting for owners' representative Richard Ravitch to get 
collective bargaining off to a substantive start, said of Giles' projection: 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no idea what he's talking about and I'm tired of these allegations 
without the underlying data." NAMES AND NUMBERS 
</P>
<P>
 * Smoking: Philadelphia catcher Darren Daulton is off to the best start of his 
career with a .423 average, 13 runs batted in and four home runs through eight 
games, all after hitting no home runs in spring training. 
</P>
<P>
 * Add Phillies: Tommy Greene, 16-4 last year, has been put on the disabled 
list because of a shoulder ailment reminiscent of the mysterious tenderness 
that limited him to 12 starts and a 3-3 record in 1992. Shawn Boskie, obtained 
recently from the Chicago Cubs, will replace Greene as today's starter against 
the Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
 * Junk Bonds: Reflecting on his .233 average through Thursday, Barry Bonds 
said: "I'm just trying to duplicate last year too quickly, pushing too hard. 
I've just got to relax and go back to basics. It's tough right now, putting all 
that pressure on myself." 
</P>
<P>
 * Turning a Page: There is a void in the 1994 bookcase. Economic 
considerations have prompted the Elias Sports Bureau and Simon & Schuster to 
stop publication of "The Elias Baseball Analyst," the most imaginative and 
informative of the many statistical books, after nine editions. "Hopefully, 
it's just a hiatus," Elias general manager Seymour Siwoff said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dr. Howe: Seven drug-related suspensions have apparently made Steve Howe 
something of an authority on addictions. Howe, the former Dodger and now New 
York Yankee reliever who has not been talking to reporters, made an exception 
to that policy the other day to lambaste Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda for saying 
that Darryl Strawberry's problem is a weakness, not a disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Howe accused Lasorda of being a hypocrite in that he won't acknowledge his own 
addiction to food. "He has to judge others to feel better about himself," Howe 
said of Lasorda. "He's weak. The big problem we all have in facing up to our 
problems is denial. I see a man who's in denial, not Straw. Straw has gone in 
for treatment." 
</P>
<P>
 * A Passing: The death of Odem (Lou) Dials, at 90 in Modesto the other day, 
attracted little notice. Dials deserved more. He came off the sandlots of Los 
Angeles to earn an engineering degree from Cal in 1927, go on to star in the 
Negro leagues for more than 12 years, scout for several organizations in the 
'60s and '70s, and make countless appearances at schools and card shows 
throughout Southern California until his death.  
</P>
<P>
 * Ringing It Up: In the type of career seldom seen in corporate baseball these 
days, Tommie Ferguson has gone from bat boy with the Boston Braves to equipment 
manager with the Milwaukee Braves to traveling secretary with the Angels to 
vice president of the Milwaukee Brewers to semi-retirement on Cape Cod and now, 
in Orange County, a scout with the Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson has experienced various rewards in his 50 years in baseball, the 
sweetest being five World Series and league championship rings, the fifth -- 
emblematic of the Phillies' National League pennant of last year -- arriving 
the other day.  
</P>
<P>
 "One for each finger," the proud Ferguson said.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; DESHIELDS' THIGH NOT GETTING BETTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Delino DeShields is doing exercises to strengthen his left quadriceps, but it 
doesn't appear to be getting any better. It is a condition he first suffered at 
the age of 10, and one he says recurs periodically, leaving his leg weak. It 
affects him at bat and in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just something I have to get through," DeShields said. "It's the kind of 
injury where I can still play, but it's affecting me. I haven't exercised all 
my options (in treatment) yet." 
</P>
<P>
 DeShields, who is batting .184, said his weakened leg is the reason for his 
slow start, not adjusting to a new team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have a problem with being with the Dodgers or with the trade, I know 
I can help this team but I'm not physically able to do that right now," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Darren Dreifort wears No. 37, the number he wore during his three years at 
Wichita State, but that wasn't his number of choice when he arrived at college. 
"I asked for No. 24, not knowing that it was my manager's number," Dreifort 
said. "So I said, 'Oh, sorry,' and took whatever number they had." 
</P>
<P>
 Dreifort gave up five hits and the winning run in two-plus innings Saturday 
night, but catcher Mike Piazza said Dreifort's sinker was moving well. "We 
mixed in a few sliders but it was mostly sinkers," Piazza said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Raul Mondesi says he works out with weights only about twice a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hardly ever run, my legs are just naturally big," Mondesi, 23, said. "When 
I signed in 1988 I was skinny, but my legs were still big. Then I started 
eating good food at the camp (the Dodgers' camp in the Dominican Republic) and 
my arms started filling out. But my legs are natural; God gave that to me. " 
</P>
<P>
 Mondesi once ate 22 slices of pizza in his rookie season at Great Falls, a 
feat that he is still kidded about. "I was hungry," he says. "I still eat a 
lot, but not quite that much." 
</P>
<P>

 Tom Candiotti will try for his third complete-game victory when he faces Steve 
Cooke today in the final game of the series. The last time a Dodger started the 
season with three complete games was Fernando Valenzuela, who pitched five to 
start the 1981 season. MARYANN HUDSON

ANGELS; GRIEF-STRICKEN FLORA UNABLE TO PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Second baseman Kevin Flora, still struggling emotionally with the death of his 
wife, has been unable to play the last four games with triple-A Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 Flora, whose wife, MaryAnn, was killed April 22, 1993 in a car accident, 
missed most of last season while trying to recover from the trauma. He rejoined 
the Angels this spring, and only once did he struggle, asking to be removed 
from the starting lineup the first game of spring training. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, after playing the first three games this season at Vancouver, Flora again 
is having difficulties. The Angels have offered assistance and told him that 
they will support him if he desires a leave of absence. 
</P>
<P>
 "The concern remains with Kevin Flora," said Tim Mead, Angel assistant general 
manager. "The club continues to have confidence in him, and at the same time, 
remains here to help him in any manner appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the time comes that he can't handle things on his own, we'll be there to 
help, just like we are now." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Blue Jay designated hitter Paul Molitor has been involved in some zany games 
in his career, but the Angels' 14-13 victory Friday -- overcoming a 13-6 
ninth-inning deficit -- might have been the topper. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my 16 years," Molitor said, "I've never seen anything like it. It was kind 
of a helpless feeling sitting here and watching it. I guess now I know what the 
Phillies felt like in last year's World Series." 
</P>
<P>
 The Blue Jays were trailing the Phillies, 14-9, the eighth inning of Game 4 of 
last year's World Series, before winning, 15-14. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The comeback equaled the greatest in Angel history, but center fielder Chad 
Curtis doubts any will top the game he played for Cochise Community College 
against Douglas in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were down by 16 in the seventh inning," Curtis said, "and won, 17-16. But 
if you ask me, (Friday's game) was still more dramatic." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Angel left fielder Dwight Smith has been officially welcomed to Southern 
California. He had the wheels stolen on his truck one night, and Friday night, 
someone tried to break into his sports car. 
</P>
<P>
 Teammate Bo Jackson presented Smith with "The Club" before Saturday's game. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Magrane, who pitched 4 2/3 innings Friday night in his first 
rehabilitation assignment at Class-A Lake Elsinore, reported no pain or 
discomfort. Really, he had only one complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to catch the (Angels' comeback) on the radio," Magrane said, "and 
believe me, I wish I was there. The radio doesn't do it justice. 
</P>
<P>
 "But my elbow feels good. It's almost like I wonder if something is wrong, it 
feels too good. They must have cleaned a lot of garbage in there." BOB

MIKE PENNER: STADIUM HAS NEW LOOK, BUT OLD TEAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U nconventional wisdom of the day . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Stadium: There's no Big A in the Big A any more, so what are we 
supposed to call the place? The Fixer-Upper In Anaheim? The Arrowhead Dump? 
Berlin 1945? Another Reason for the Rams to Move? Where Anaheim Stadium was 
once sterile and unappealing, it is now junky and unappealing, proving that 
Mother Nature either has no flair for interior decoration -- or can't finish 
the job as contracted. Anaheim needs a new stadium like the Angels need a new 
pitching staff, but for the time being, it appears we're stuck with Uncle Leo's 
rec room -- with the big-screen TV shoved behind the left-field fence, draped 
with tacky vinyl banners bearing the corporate logos of Angel sponsors. No 
wonder the Blue Jays can't hold a lead here. They look around, they get too 
depressed. 
</P>
<P>
 The hole in left field: Pre-earthquake, this was a standard reference to the 
Angel defense (please see Luis Polonia, Chili Davis). Post-earthquake, you have 
to look higher for the proper meaning, to the upper deck, which appears to have 
been chomped by a rampaging T-Rex. "Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, the 
Angels welcome you to Jurassic Park . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Angels 14, Blue Jays 13: The last time the Angels pulled off a ninth-inning 
rally as big as this, they went to the playoffs, but if you're looking for 
omens, don't get carried away. The Angels' starting pitchers that year, 1986, 
were named Witt, McCaskill, Sutton and Candelaria. 
</P>
<P>
 Duane Ward: The Blue Jays' most valuable player in 1994, if I was just to take 
a wild stab. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Myers: He stood in there before the Angel home opener, he waited for 
Wayne Gretzky to fire, and he made the grab, a slick glove save. Reportedly, 
the Kings had a scout in the stands and a contract has been drawn up. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Anderson: The Angels desperately need him to make it, but not as 
desperately as the writers covering the Angels do. Good delivery, smooth 
follow-through, a lot of movement on his fast one -- the kid has all the tools. 
We're talking first team All-Interview here, no question. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Junior Felix Award:" Junior's gone, but his spirit lives on in a doctored 
can of shaving cream bearing his name, a trophy bestowed upon individual Angel 
players after committing what is deemed to be the bonehead play of the day. 
Strangely, Anderson got it after pitching eight shutout innings as an emergency 
replacement for Mark Langston last Sunday. Anderson attempts to explain: "They 
gave it to me for saying, 'Mark Who?' But I never said it." Again, this is 
keeping in the spirit of Junior Felix. "What about that fly ball in the fifth 
inning, Junior?" "I never saw it."  
</P>
<P>
 Dante Bichette: On pace to hit 108 home runs and drive in 270 runs this 
season. Wonder how Dave Parker's doing? 
</P>
<P>
 Haywood Jeffires: The Rams look over the middle, crank up $3.9 million for 
three years, throw reasonably deep while maintaining fiscal restraint . . . and 
it's . . . it's . . . dropped by Jeffires. Now what? At the moment, Chris 
Miller's two top-ranking targets are named Flipper Anderson and Nate Lewis. At 
the No. 5 slot in next Sunday's draft, the Rams are advised that wide receivers 
Charles Johnson of Colorado and Johnnie Morton of USC should be available. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce McNall: A lawsuit a day. Alongside the NHL roundup, newspapers will soon 
be running the daily McNall Litigation Roundup. In the meantime, McNall's 
$275,000 Rolls-Royce thank-you gift to Gretzky continues to be the buzz of the 
league. The latest joke: "McNall left another present for Gretzky in the glove 
compartment. A payment book." 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Wilson: He deserves coach-of-the-year consideration, but as Mighty Ducks 
General Manager Jack Ferreira concedes, the field is loaded. "Ron was 
outstanding," Ferreira says, "but a lot of guys did great jobs this year -- 
(Florida's Roger) Neilson, (New Jersey's Jacques) Lemaire, (Buffalo's John) 
Muckler. It's a tough one to call." To say nothing of San Jose's Kevin 
Constantine, right? Right? Ferreira said nothing, to be sure, biting his 
tongue, face reddening until another question could be asked. Two years ago, 
Ferreira was fired as San Jose's general manager, a wound that continues to cut 
deep. "There are enough (original) players still there that I certainly wish 
them well," Ferreira says of the Sharks' first dip into the Stanley Cup 
playoffs. "But players only." 
</P>
<P>
 The Fighting Ducks: Incredible stat for fans of Stu Grimson and Todd Ewen to 
ponder: The Ducks did not receive a single instigating penalty all season. 
Also, the Ducks were the league's third-lowest penalized team in 1993-94. In 
fact, by season's end, the biggest goons at Duck home games could be found on 
the overhead scoreboard -- that lovable cartoon in which two brawling Goofys 
crack each other over the head with hockey sticks, the same move that earned 
Tony Granato a 15-game suspension. Lots of laughs for the entire family. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Evert: These are twisted times when a failed quarterback is moved to 
attack a talk-show host who likens him to one of the greatest champions and 
most tenacious competitors the world of sport has ever known. If Jim Rome truly 
wanted to get under his guest's skin, really needle him, all he had to say was, 
"Welcome to the show, Jim Everett."

BUTCHER WANTS TO TAKE THE BULL BY HORNS AGAIN; ANGELS: RIGHT-HANDER WHO GIVES 
UP FOUR EARNED RUNS IN A THIRD OF AN INNING VOWS TO BECOME MORE AGGRESSIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was one of the sentences Angel Manager Buck Rodgers thought he would never 
say, along with "Pass the piano," and "Please cut off my leg." 
</P>
<P>
 But there he was, sitting in his office after the Angels lost to Toronto, 5-4, 
Saturday night at Anaheim Stadium. His mouth was moving and the words coming 
out were, "Mike Butcher just needs to be more aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Butcher more aggressive? After all, this is a guy who once during his 
high school football career challenged the other team -- the entire other team 
-- to fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has to start going after hitters with his fastball," Rodgers said. "He has 
to start trusting his fastball again. He has too good of an arm to be in this 
predicament. He threw all breaking balls tonight, maybe two or three 
fastballs." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers called for Butcher in the seventh inning Saturday night with the score 
tied, 4-4, after Bob Patterson had walked Alex Gonzalez and struck out the next 
two batters. Butcher walked Paul Molitor and Joe Carter to load the bases and 
then John Olerud drove in the winning run with a check swing single to 
shortstop off Craig Lefferts. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday night, Butcher got one out while giving up five hits and four runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Butcher, who was originally destined to be the Angels' closer out of the 
bullpen, has made five appearances this year and three of the runners he's 
inherited have scored. His earned-run average is 9.82. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's true, I just have to be more aggressive," Butcher said. "I feel that's 
my only problem right now. I'm trying to nibble and that's just not the kind of 
pitcher I am. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's weird. I know I have good stuff but I just seem to have lost my 
confidence. I can't be afraid to get hit. I have to go right after guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Butcher had a horrible spring training -- his ERA was 14.81 and opponents hit 
.442 against him -- but he says that was not really the source of his lost 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Spring training is just a place to go to work," Butcher said. "There's no 
crowd, the games are meaningless and it's absolutely no fun. There's no 
motivation other than to work on pitching well and by that I mean throwing 
curves and sliders for strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 "But nobody ever took a ring home from spring training." 
</P>
<P>
 So when did the man who used to strike fear and then strike them out turn into 
a timid pitcher? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not easy to trace it to an exact moment or anything like that," he said. 
"It just sort of gradually came about. I had a long talk with Mark Langston 
during the game and he told me that the same thing happened to him in 1990 and 
that he could see it happening to me. It's really nice to have that sort of 
advice from a player you respect. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just trying to work the corners and that's not me. I mean I can throw 
strikes there, but I need to start going after guys. I need to start trusting 
my fastball again, start believing again. I can't be afraid to get hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, in a funny way, the last two days have been very bad for me in a 
good way. I'm going to be aggressive again. I'm going to change right now."

 Six Mighty Ducks and one King -- goalie Robb Stauber -- will play for the 
United States at ice hockey's World Championships in Italy beginning next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Americans will be coached by the Ducks' Ron Wilson, who said Saturday that 
Duck goalie Guy Hebert, defensemen Sean Hill and Don McSween and forwards John 
Lilley, Joe Sacco and Tim Sweeney will be in Italy for the tournament April 
25-May 8.Stauber is the only King on the team because left wing Mike Donnelly 
decided not to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson will be assisted by Duck assistant Tim Army. 
</P>
<P>
 Several King players -- left wing Luc Robitaille and defensemen Darryl Sydor 
and Rob Blake -- will play for Canada, as is unsigned Duck draft pick Paul 
Kariya. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings' Jari Kurri will play for Finland and defenseman Alexei Zhitnik is 
to play for Russia, as might Duck goalie Mikhail Shtalenkov. 
</P>
<P>
 Duck center Patrik Carnback said he will play for Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said the U.S. team faces an uphill battle. "A lot of these teams are 
still together from the Olympics," he said. "We get about 2 1/2 hours of 
practice together before our first game." ROBYN NORWOOD

LONG BEACH GRAND PRIX; NOTES; RIBIERO STEALS SCENE IN PRO-CELEBRITY RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Brian Redman certainly made it interesting, but could an old-time pro beat a 
young charger? 
</P>
<P>
 Not Saturday in the pro-celebrity race at the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily for Alfonso Ribiero, though, the race went only 10 laps. Two more and 
"The Fresh Prince of Bel Air" co-star would have learned what it's like to run 
second in a car race. 
</P>
<P>
 As it was, he led wire to wire, beating out fellow actor-celebrity Sean Astin. 
Redman, one of four pro drivers who started 30 seconds after the 13 
celebrities, finished third but had the leaders in sight at the finish. All 
competitors drove similarly prepared Toyota Celicas. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Manuel Fangio II, a still-active pro driver who taught the celebs at an 
impromptu clinic after smoking them in Friday's qualifying session, never was a 
factor after suffering an early flat tire. 
</P>
<P>
 Ribiero might have had a tougher race had actor Mark-Paul Gosselaar not been 
caught in an accident while running a strong second. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was unfortunate for Mark-Paul -- someone came along and wiped him out," 
Ribiero said. "That happened behind me and kind of stretched out the field. 
That was the thing that gave me an opportunity to run by myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Ribiero managed to startle himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "One time, coming out of Turn 4, I almost caught the wall," he said. "That was 
scary. I'm running all by myself and almost crash. That would have been pretty 
stupid." 
</P>
<P>
 Finishing behind Redman were drag racer Cruz Pedregon and former Raider 
quarterback Ken Stabler. 
</P>
<P>
 Clay Regazzoni, who won the Long Beach Grand Prix when it was a Formula One 
race in 1976 and was left a paraplegic after a crash here in 1980, had car 
problems and finished far behind the leaders. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 David Donohue of Malvern, Pa., son of the late Indianapolis 500 champion Mark 
Donohue, scored his first professional victory in the other race, the Supercar 
event for sedans. 
</P>
<P>
 Donohue, driving a BMW M-5 and chasing a leading Shawn Hendricks in a Nissan 
300, caught him late in the race at the hairpin leading into the main straight. 
Caught him and drove right into him, in fact. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I really intended to do was stay in his mirrors a little bit, keep him 
looking behind him," Donohue said. "It must have been a dirty track or 
something because my car just didn't stop. I punched him in the rear end and 
spun him, completely unintentionally." 
</P>
<P>
 Donohue continued while Hendricks, of Piedmont, S.C., was busy pointing his 
car in the right direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was pretty hot at the time," Hendricks said. "But David was back there and 
he was able to come off the corners a lot better than I was. I just wasn't 
expecting him to close that fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Farrell of Manassas, Va., was third in a Mazda RX-7. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Redman -- who won the first Grand Prix of Long Beach, a Formula 5000 race in 
1975 -- said he hardly recognized the place. 
</P>
<P>
 "The course is really completely different," he said. "Parts of the main 
straight are the same, but that's all. You're busy racing and all, but it 
struck me how it's all changed so. It's not just the layout of the track but 
the skyline, the beautiful buildings. Before, it was all old-peoples' homes." 
</P>
<P>
 Once warmed up, Redman couldn't help but deliver an old-timer's history 
lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 "You look at the (team) transporters today," he said. "Twenty years ago, 
people brought (the race cars) in the back of pickup trucks and we had a crew 
of three. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was born 30 years too soon. (In his day), there was no money in racing. You 
earned $1,000 a race. And the cars were dangerous. Either they caught fire all 
the time or were crashing all the time or were breaking all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, there's a lot of money -- and it's not particularly dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Is Danny Sullivan one of your favorite drivers? Eddie Cheever? Scott Brayton? 
</P>
<P>
 Don't look for them here this weekend. All three have lost their rides and are 
not running the Indy car circuit this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Other prominent drivers not competing here this weekend include cousins Jeff 
and John Andretti, Roberto Guerrero and Lyn St. James.

A LEGEND CALLED LA GAZELLE?; OLYMPIC CHAMPION MARIE-JOSE PEREC FLEES FRANCE'S 
FRENZY TO BECOME A SPRINTER FOR THE AGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although the press back home in Paris has not been kind to her in recent 
months, Marie-Jose Perec sat in the stands after a workout last week at UCLA's 
Drake Stadium and intently read a French sports daily. As often is the case -- 
too often, she thinks -- there was an article about her, La Gazelle . 
</P>
<P>
 While she had been in her new surroundings too briefly for the author to 
report on Perec's progress on the track, he concentrated instead on her other 
activities since arriving two weeks ago to set up an apartment in Westwood -- 
running errands and shopping. The fascination in France with her everyday life 
fascinates her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not Madonna," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She is, however, one of France's most prominent sports personalities, the 
country's only track and field gold medalist at the 1992 Summer Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the reasons she left France was to escape her fame, which, according to 
her agent, Tom Sturak of Topanga Canyon, made it difficult for her to stroll 
along a boulevard, visit a museum, rest at a sidewalk cafe or dine in a 
restaurant -- the enticements of living in Paris -- without being disturbed by 
well-meaning but intrusive fans. Sturak said she would not have that problem in 
Los Angeles, where track stars, he assured her, are among the dimmest in the 
galaxy. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for Sturak, she has a sense of humor because, while walking toward 
Drake Stadium for her first workout, she was stopped by two young men who asked 
for her autograph. When they informed her they were UCLA students from France, 
she laughed and signed. 
</P>
<P>
 Running away from her public, she told Sturak, is less important to her than 
running toward the destiny she has chosen for herself, which is the primary 
reason she chose to come to Westwood and work with the accomplished young 
coach, John Smith. Other Olympic champions he has coached include Steve Lewis, 
Kevin Young and Quincy Watts. 
</P>
<P>
 "She doesn't speak much English, and I don't speak much French," Sturak said. 
"But she has made it very clear that she wants to leave a mark on this sport 
beyond winning a gold medal." 
</P>
<P>
 She will begin that quest with a small step, running a relay leg in today's 
Mt. San Antonio College Relays at Walnut that she is treating more as an 
opportunity to introduce herself to Southern California track and field fans 
than as serious competition. She, however, is very serious about this season 
and, she said through an interpreter in an interview last week, is determined 
to prove that she is still the world's best in her specialty, the 400 meters. 
</P>
<P>
 And then, predicted Smith, her new coach, she will go on to conquer the 
400-meter hurdles and the 200 and -- who knows? -- maybe even the 100. 
</P>
<P>
 Perec, 25, had no such illusions of grandeur as a child on Basse-Terre, one of 
two Caribbean islands consolidating to form the French territory of Guadaloupe. 
A French coach discovered her there almost 10 years ago in a 200-meter race, 
announcing afterward that her time qualified her for France's national 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did not even know what that was," she said. "I hardly knew what the Olympic 
Games were." 
</P>
<P>
 Four years later, she was competing in them, reaching the quarterfinals in the 
200 at Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
 Realizing that she had a bright future in the sport, she resigned herself not 
only to the Parisian climate, remaining there to train instead of returning to 
Guadaloupe for the winters, but also to a more disciplined approach to 
training. She also focused on the 400 meters, a more natural distance for a 
runner with her tall, lean frame -- she's 5 feet 11 3/4, 132 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 She began to work in November, 1990, with one of France's best coaches, the 
no-nonsense Jacques Piasenta, and nine months later became a world champion. 
The next year, she won the Olympic gold medal, boldly proclaiming that her time 
at Barcelona, 48.83 seconds, was the fastest ever run by a woman without the 
assistance of performance-enhancing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 La Gazelle owned Paris. She appeared on virtually every magazine cover and 
looked as if she belonged in the clothes she modeled for Paco Rabbane and 
Claude Montana. She even began to take courses so that she could design her 
own. 
</P>
<P>
 But as she became more self-assured off the track, she became more independent 
on it. She and Piasenta clashed last year, primarily over her decision to run 
the 200 in the World Championships at Stuttgart, Germany, instead of the 400. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, to try the 200 was a challenge," she said. "A lot of people thought 
it was stupid. But if you don't try new things in life, you don't get anything 
out of it. I have no regrets." 
</P>
<P>
 When she finished fourth, some among the French press criticized her for not 
listening to Piasenta. She lashed back at them for not putting enough emphasis 
in their reports on her hamstring injury, which she believed prevented her from 
performing better. In a stormy news conference at Stuttgart, she told them they 
should spend more time gathering facts instead of pictures of her derriere. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, that was the only part of her anatomy they would see as she turned her 
back on them. 
</P>
<P>
 The same went for Piasenta. They had their final argument before last winter's 
European indoor championships at Paris. He insisted that she compete, but she 
refused because she did not feel she was in top form and did not want to run 
poorly in front of a home crowd. Before she could fire him, he quit. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a super coach, but athletes have to obey everything he says," she said. 
"He is kind of a dictator. I'm OK with following rules, but I want to talk to a 
coach and tell him how I'm feeling. That is why I came to John Smith. He 
listens to what the athletes have to say." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith initially resisted, telling her that he would coach her during the 
winter but that she should remain with Piasenta during the rest of the year. 
But when it became obvious that her split with Piasenta was irreparable, Smith 
invited her to Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 So now, Marie-Jose is Mary Jo. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she speaks little English, she understands much of what is being 
spoken around her, and she laughs often at the banter among the other athletes 
in Smith's global village, which includes such Olympians as Dennis Mitchell and 
Young from the United States and John Regis and Tony Jarrett of Great Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the group of athletes I was training with in France, there was so much 
jealousy," she said. "I think the athletes there hate each other. When I see 
Mitchell and Regis running together here, I am amazed. It makes them better 
because they can learn from each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said Perec will fit in nicely. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a free spirit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if she could become the best athlete he has ever coached, Smith said, 
"She could be one of the best anyone has ever coached. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's got a chance to go to another level, to be up there in the 
stratosphere. She could be up there with Carl Lewis and Jackie Joyner-Kersee 
and Edwin Moses and Heike Drechsler. That's how I want her to think of herself, 
and I think that's where she wants to go." 
</P>
<P>
 For this year, Perec said she would be satisfied with regaining the No. 1 
ranking that she had in the 400 meters in 1991 and '92. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to be No. 1," she said. "I have to prove that I can leave France and 
still be No. 1." 
</P>
<P>
 When it was suggested that her critics in France might like to see her fail in 
the United States, she smiled and said, "I hope not, for them." 
</P>
<P>
 She did not have to add that she believes they will be disappointed.

LATVIAN GUARD MIGLINIEKS COMMITS TO PLAY BASKETBALL AT UC IRVINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Raimonds Miglinieks, a highly recruited 6-foot-3 point guard from Riverside 
City College, has signed a letter of intent to play at UC Irvine, Riverside 
Coach Bob Schermerhorn said Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Miglinieks, 23, is from Latvia and served two years in the Soviet Red Army.He 
was being recruited by Cal, Seton Hall and Arkansas as well as Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 He soon could be joined at Irvine by Maz Trakh, an assistant to Schermerhorn 
at Riverside. Trakh, brother of former Brea-Olinda Coach Mark Trakh, would fill 
the position opened when Irvine Coach Rod Baker failed to renew the contract of 
assistant Rob Orellana. 
</P>
<P>
 Miglinieks was the Orange Empire Conference player of the year last season and 
also an all-state selection. In two seasons at Riverside, he set a school 
career assist record with 828 and averaged 13 points. Riverside advanced to the 
State semifinals both seasons Miglinieks played there. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the best player I ever coached, and the great thing about him is that he 
makes the other players on the court so much better," Schermerhorn said. "And 
he has absolutely no ego. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a lot of his decision had to do with location. He's developed a lot 
of friends in the area after coming here and knowing absolutely no one." JOHN 
WEYLER

IRVINE VALLEY'S MULLIGAN STABLE AFTER SUFFERING A MILD STROKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill Mulligan, who suffered a mild stroke as a result of surgery, was in 
stable condition Saturday, according to a spokeswoman at St. Joseph Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Mulligan, men's basketball coach at Irvine Valley College and former UC Irvine 
men's coach, entered the hospital Wednesday for graft surgery on an artery in 
his neck that was about 90% blocked, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mulligan, 64, said he had a similar operation 10 years ago and suffered a mild 
stroke then as well. He said Wednesday's 4 1/2-hour surgery went well, but he 
suffered the stroke while in recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "His speech is really good," said Mulligan's wife, Dorothy. "He's very bright 
and alert." 
</P>
<P>
 The stroke affected movement and feeling in his right arm and leg. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm starting therapy (today)," Mulligan said. "The doctors think I'm going to 
recover fine. My leg seems to be pretty good, and they are really happy with 
the movement I have in my hand." 
</P>
<P>
 Mulligan started his college coaching career in 1966 at Riverside, where he 
stayed for nine seasons. He then went to Saddleback from 1975 to 1980. He then 
moved on to UCI, where he was 163-156 from 1980 until he retired in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Mulligan came out of retirement to help start the Irvine Valley program in 
1992. Mulligan has led the Lasers to the playoffs in their first two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't wait to get back to coaching," Mulligan said. STEVE KRESAL

MONTGOMERY RECYCLES HIS ACT AT WESTMINSTER; BASEBALL: HIGH SCHOOL PITCHER DOES 
NOT THROW IN THE TOWEL AFTER HEARING SOME DISCOURAGING WORDS AT FOUNTAIN 
VALLEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most sophomores would have been content to be the starting shortstop and a 
part-time pitcher for Fountain Valley, one of the better baseball programs in 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kent Montgomery didn't want to play shortstop and he didn't want to be a 
relief pitcher. He wanted to start and he didn't feel like waiting until his 
senior season to find out if he could do it. 
</P>
<P>
 So after the season, Montgomery asked his coach, Ron La Ruffa, who could not 
be reached for comment on the matter, what he had in mind for him next season. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he had a lot of arms and that I'd probably only pitch two or three 
innings at a time," Montgomery said. "And then he said something I'll never 
forget. He said, 'The other guys will start, you'll come in and pick up the 
trash.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Then and there, Montgomery knew his days at Fountain Valley were over. 
Initially, he attended Fountain Valley so he could play with his brother Rich, 
who had set career records for runs batted in and hits at the school during his 
three-year career that ended last year. 
</P>
<P>
 So after the school year, Montgomery and his family moved out of their rented 
apartment in the Fountain Valley district and back into their own house in the 
Westminster district. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know some people look at Westminster as some sort of ghetto school, so I 
also wanted to come over here and make this a competitive school," Montgomery 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, it appears Montgomery made the right move. Through Westminster's first 
17 games, he is 6-2 with a 2.67 ERA. In 54 innings, he has walked only eight 
and struck out 19. 
</P>
<P>
 He has already thrown twice as many innings as last year, when he went 2-0 
with three saves. 
</P>
<P>
 Westminster Coach Brian Batesole said Montgomery is the main reason his team 
is 10-7 and vying for its first playoff berth in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's meant a heck of a lot to us," he said. "It doesn't take a genius to see 
he's won six games and we've only won 10." 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery is also contributing at the plate. He's batting only .250, but is 
third on the team in RBIs (eight) and second in runs scored (11). 
</P>
<P>
 Batesole didn't know before the season how Montgomery might contribute, or if 
he would contribute at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had heard we might get him during the summer, but you hear things like that 
a lot," Batesole said. "Once I saw him that first day of school, I said, 'OK, 
great.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Batesole didn't know what he had until practice began. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew we were going to use him as a pitcher, but we weren't sure what 
role," Batesole said. "I didn't see him all winter, so I didn't know how he was 
coming along." 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery was coming along fine, thanks mainly to La Quinta assistant coach 
Jimmy Doyle, who coached Montgomery's winter team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kent is such a smart pitcher," Doyle said. "He goes out and scouts the other 
team he plays. That's something you don't see in high school. He loves the game 
and he really knows it." 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery said: "I learned a changeup from Jimmy and I improved my curve ball 
and my slider."  
</P>
<P>
 With a fastball that barely hits the 80 m.p.h.-mark, Montgomery needs all four 
pitches working to be effective. Except for Tuesday's 5-4 loss to Servite in 
which he allowed a season-high four earned runs, Montgomery usually has every 
pitch at his disposal. 
</P>
<P>
 'He's just always around the plate and always ahead in the count," Batesole 
said. "He gets his curve over for strikes and another key is that he's able to 
spot his fastball." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Montgomery: "Because I don't throw that hard, I have less margin for 
error than most hard throwers. But I also know that not many high school 
pitchers throw as many pitches as me." 
</P>
<P>
 But Montgomery said his fastball will occasionally surprise people. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I get a lot of adrenaline going I can get it up there pretty good," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery had that adrenaline going out of control in his first Sunset League 
start, which happened to come against his old team, Fountain Valley. Though he 
beat his former team, 4-3, he got off to a rocky start, allowing three runs, 
all unearned, in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a tough start, but I looked over to the Fountain Valley bench and knew 
that I'd rather be here fighting back than not getting the opportunity at all," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery proved his Fountain Valley victory was no fluke when he came back 
in his next start to beat Edison, 3-2, in nine innings. He walked one and 
struck out four in going the distance. 
</P>
<P>
 Not bad for a trash man.

FIRE AND EARTHQUAKE VICTIMS BRING THEIR DAMAGED PLATES AND PORCELAIN TO FOSTER 
ART RESTORATION IN COSTA MESA. A COMPLETE, SEAMLESS RESTORATION IS THE GOAL OF 
THE EXPERTS WHO WORK ON PRICELESS HEIRLOOMS AS WELL AS DISNEY FIGURINES.; 
PICKING UP THE PIECES 
</P>

<P>
 A few days after the Jan. 17 earthquake, Sy Sussman of Newport Beach was left 
holding the bag. Inside the bag, in pieces, was his 150-year-old Queen Louise 
gold-overlay plate from Austria, valued at $1,700. 
</P>
<P>
 Sussman's ruined plate was not the only broken treasure to arrive that day on 
the doorstep of Foster Art Restoration. Hundreds of art objects, heirlooms, 
figurines and paintings have been brought to the Costa Mesa offices since the 
Northridge tremor -- all shattered, torn, crunched or otherwise laid to waste 
by the quake, and all of them in the hands of owners, like Sussman, who look 
with hope and trust to the artists who make their treasures whole again. 
</P>
<P>
 A complete, seamless restoration is the goal of the 10 Foster artists, whether 
the project is a $20,000 Sergio Bustamente papier-mache elephant or a $25 
Disneyland statuette. Since the autumn brush fires and the earthquake, the 
number of pieces brought to the studio has increased 30%, creating a four-month 
backlog. 
</P>
<P>
 The sentimental value of many of these objects, recovered amid destruction of 
all else familiar, is immeasurable, said John D. Foster, the company founder. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, Angela, who serves as the firm's president, recalled a woman who 
recently brought in an ordinary ceramic saltcellar. "When I saw it, I told her 
it wasn't worth repairing. She said, 'Oh yes it is' and told me that it was the 
only thing she'd found in the ashes of her mother's home" after the Laguna 
Beach fire. 
</P>
<P>
 When Michael Bean searched the ashes of his Laguna Beach home in October, he 
found only a broken platter, a damaged amber brooch and a couple of Christmas 
ornaments. Because the platter and brooch had been given to his wife, Marianne, 
by her two grandmothers, he took them to Foster to see if they could be 
restored and given to her for Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Apparently the fire was so hot it had reglazed the platter and changed the 
colors on the pieces," said Bean, 48. "There was no way Foster could make it 
look exactly right. When he called me before Christmas and said it's all ready, 
he was so apologetic. It looked fine, but he was so upset that he couldn't put 
the colors back the way they were. He wouldn't accept any payment for it, even 
though I think he worked on it on and off for a month." 
</P>
<P>
 His wife cried when he presented her with the heirlooms, said Bean, who now 
lives in Newport Beach. "It made us think that even through disaster, there's 
rebirth." 
</P>
<P>
 The 38-year-old company is one of the nation's largest commercial art 
restorers and repairs materials ranging from bronze to marble to crystal. 
Manufacturers of porcelain collectibles such as Lladro and Boehm recommend 
Foster Art Restoration to their customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the earthquake, the Fosters were busy. "Children, maids and pets 
are our biggest moneymakers," said Foster's son, John C., in reference to the 
day-to-day breakage of art pieces. "We're thinking of putting them on 
commission for us." 
</P>
<P>
 The company's craftspeople are so skilled that they have even repaired museum 
pieces, said Larry Vescera, office manager. For example, people have thrown 
away expensive porcelain figurines that have shattered, not believing repair is 
possible. In fact, Vescera said, senior artist Angela Hittesdorf not only can 
repair them but can even duplicate legs and arms that have turned to dust. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest problem is people who've tried to do the repairs themselves," 
Vescera said. "We get pieces that have really been through the mill. We have to 
boil the pieces to get the customer's glue out, and then do the repair." 
</P>
<P>
 Because many customers had dozens of art objects break during the earthquake, 
the Fosters have requested that only six pieces per customer be brought in for 
repair during any three-month period. All pieces that will ultimately be 
repaired are logged into the Foster computer, however, and that total now 
stands at 10,000, the younger Foster said. This is despite the fact that the 
company does no advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleanor Cox, 83, of Westwood, whose Mexican tree of life candelabrum broke in 
the Northridge quake, is among the firm's cheerleaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "They do beautiful work. I've had things mended by European craftsmen, but Mr. 
Foster is the best," she said. "He's very businesslike and knows what he's 
doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Cox's pottery candelabrum is at Foster Art for the second time. Last year it 
was repaired after her dog sideswiped a table and broke it. The earthquake 
broke it again -- but in different places. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things you like, you don't mind paying for," said Cox, who will pay $85 for 
the repair. 
</P>
<P>
 At the West Los Angeles home of Myron Du Bow, the quake broke an ornate 
English tea service and a pair of 2 1/2-foot-tall Chinese vases. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were reduced to about 20 or 30 pieces each," Du Bow said. "My wife had 
heard of Foster's because she does interior design work. Well, we brought the 
vases down there in two plastic bags, and they came back not only perfect but 
you can't even tell where they fixed them. It was worth the trip." 
</P>
<P>
 The minimum charge at Foster is $65, although repairs of fine art pieces, most 
of which are insured, can total $5,000. The average fee is $100.  
</P>
<P>
 On May 15, the Fosters will open their first mall outlet, called Pick Up the 
Pieces, in Fashion Island. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're networking with art restorers around the country, licensing them to use 
our processes and technology," said the younger Foster, 32, adding that 
especially difficult pieces will be shipped to the Costa Mesa facility. 
Licensees are also being lined up for stores in Beverly Hills, La Jolla, Palm 
Desert and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Over his decades of art restoration, the elder Foster has invented and 
patented several techniques and formulas, including a porcelain polishing 
technique and a way to repair acrylic. His latest invention -- perfect for 
earthquake country -- is Ankor-All, a reusable adhesive that secures vases and 
other treasures to flat surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Another process was used to restore Sussman's 19th-Century Austrian plate. 
After reassembling the pieces, the older Foster used a synthetic porcelain to 
hide the seams. Then he used a powdered form of gold leaf in a process that 
blended into the damaged gold overlay. 
</P>
<P>
 For other pottery repair, a special glaze hides the seams -- and makes 
customers shake their heads in amazement. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got the plate back, I couldn't even find the breaks, even though I 
know where it was broken," Sussman said. "It looks good, and I can appreciate 
it again."

 Architect David Ming-Li Lowe is one of the few Southern Californians who's 
actually looking forward to the Big One. With his three-story West Los Angeles 
home and office resting on gargantuan springs, he expects to gently rock his 
way through it. 
</P>
<P>
 When he began building in 1991, Lowe installed 17 shock-absorbing devices, 
called base isolators, between the structure and the foundation. Six corners 
are supported by a visco-damper base isolator (a cylinder within a cylinder, 
separated by a viscous substance) the size of a two-drawer file cabinet. These 
units, and 11 smaller ones, all function like automobile shock absorbers, 
lessening the effects of the shaking. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Northridge quake, the home withstood the initial jolt, then 
experienced a slight rocking motion as the temblor continued. "The nearby 
veterans hospital had 40 up-and-down movements in the critical first 12 
seconds, but I felt only the first one," he recalls. "Here, it was like a 
Richter 5 instead of a 6.8." Damage was minimal, confined mostly to garage 
walls connected to the foundation. Aftershocks have been barely noticeable. 
</P>
<P>
 An architecture professor at L.A. City College, Lowe, 61, became interested 
eight years ago in leaving a lasting legacy and, given his surroundings, 
focused on ways to mitigate the impact of the Big One. Through a Culver City 
engineering firm, he learned of base isolators made by GERB Vibration Control 
Systems in Germany. These particular units have been used in Europe since 1907; 
in large commercial buildings -- opera houses, hotels and nuclear reactors -- 
they absorb ground movement caused, in part, by the region's heavily developed 
infrastructure. In L.A., where City Hall is scheduled to be retrofitted with a 
base isolator system, experts agree that base isolation can be useful. "If you 
have a hospital or emergency operation center," says John F. Hall, a civil 
engineering professor at Caltech, "isolation works well here." 
</P>
<P>
 Lowe's is believed to be the first home in America built on visco-damper base 
isolators. Because of the cost, the average homeowner may want to investigate 
other structural-strengthening measures before investing $500 to $1,500 per 
base isolator. Installation for a house like Lowe's 4,700-square-foot structure 
runs $20,000 to $25,000 -- "about the cost of a nice bathroom," he points out. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from its giant shock absorbers, Lowe's house is unique in other 
respects. Concerned about the depletion of the world's forests, Lowe used steel 
as the major structural framework. For energy efficiency, he chose interlocking 
Bally galvanized sheet-metal refrigeration panels (they have an R-35 rating) to 
sheath the first floor and end walls; a refrigeration door also serves as the 
front entry. 
</P>
<P>
 On the two upper floors of the house, Lowe hung Kalwall panels (Fiberglas 
insulation sandwiched in plastic) because they also save energy and resemble 
Shoji screens. "The great thing about these wall panels is that they look 
finished inside and out the moment you hang them. This minimizes the number of 
tradesmen needed and cuts your costs," Lowe says. Other striking features 
include the exposed gusset plates and diagonal bracing. 
</P>
<P>
 In the future, Lowe hopes to smooth the way for more people to design with 
earthquakes in mind: "I'm working on a redundant synergistic system that can 
take out not only the main horizontal and vertical motions but will also modify 
the rocking motion as well." Perhaps just in time for the Big One.

 Museums around the world employ conservators to care for prized collections, 
and many of their techniques can be adapted for personal home collections. 
Deborah Silguero, an independent conservation technician currently advising the 
Pacific Asia Museum, the Huntington Library and Art Collections and the San 
Diego Museum of Art, shopped stores such as Home Depot and Orchard Supply 
Hardware for the household seismic conservation materials shown here.Most cost 
less than $5. 
</P>
<P>
 For extremely valuable objects, however, Silguero suggests seeking assistance 
from a professional. Conservation departments at museums will often supply the 
names of conservation technicians and installers. Conservation consulting runs 
between $75 and $100 an hour; installation is $35 to $45 per hour. Says 
Silguero: "Even though we don't like to think about earthquakes, a lot of 
people sleep better knowing that their collections are secured. And it's a 
onetime expense."

TAFT HIGH TIES FOR 1ST IN NATIONAL SUPER QUIZ; DECATHLON: THE WOODLAND HILLS 
TEAM EARNS A PERFECT SCORE. IT IS A STRONG CONTENDER FOR THE OVERALL TITLE. 
</P>

<P>
 A nine-student team from Taft High School in Woodland Hills won another trophy 
for California and the Los Angeles Unified School District on Saturday, earning 
a perfect score in the national Academic Decathlon's Super Quiz. 
</P>
<P>
 Taft tied a team representing Massachusetts for first place in the 
high-stakes, game-show style quiz, the only decathlon event open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Although their Super Quiz marks do not ensure that the Woodland Hills students 
will win the 13th annual academic contest, they mean the team is a strong 
contender. Scores in the event's other nine tests will not be released until 
this morning's awards banquet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't have asked for a better outcome," said Andrew Salter, 17, as he 
hugged his parents after the quiz. "We have a very good chance of winning." 
</P>
<P>
 Taft defeated teams from San Antonio, Tex., and Chicago, Ill., which the 
California contenders believed to be their biggest threats. Those schools took 
second and third place, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 The Massachusetts team from Acton-Boxborough Regional High School in Acton, 
was not considered one of the top four teams going into the competition, based 
on its scores in state competition. Massachusetts team members hugged each 
other and squealed after their victory was announced, expressing as much 
surprise as pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew we were a good team, but we never suspected we could actually pull 
off a perfect score in Super Quiz," said Massachusetts team member Ravi 
Nanavati, 17. "It's possible that we can win the whole thing, but I don't know 
how likely that is." 
</P>
<P>
 The Taft team won the national title in 1989 and last year placed second 
nationally. The Woodland Hills school has won the California decathlon three 
times in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Super Quiz is the last and most intense of the decathlon's events. Each 
team sent one student at a time onto a gymnasium floor at Essex Community 
College to answer five oral questions, each worth 200 points. Scores are posted 
after each question for the student's teammates, parents and competitors to 
see. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's theme, "The Documents of Freedom," tested students' knowledge of 
excerpts from 19 documents, including the Gettysburg Address, the Camp David 
Accord and the May 16, 1989, declaration of the students who revolted in 
China's Tian An Men Square.  
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, students representing 41 states and the District of Columbia each 
wrote a 60-minute essay, gave a four-minute prepared speech, a two-minute 
impromptu speech and submitted to a seven-minute interview with a panel of 
judges. Then, before Saturday's quiz, they took written tests in math, fine 
arts, economics, science, literature and social studies. The Taft group was the 
last team to enter the gym for the quiz, using the precious few minutes 
following their final test for last-ditch study efforts or a chance to pace off 
the last-minute jitters. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Taft students walked into the building for their final event in the 
months-long process of studying and competing, 18-year-old Sheldon Peregrino 
paused, adjusted his necktie and took a deep breath. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here we go," he said and strode through the door. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Once down on the floor, hundreds of hours of preparation and countless 
practice run-throughs took over. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheldon was the second student in the hot seat. Neither he nor Chris Huie, 17, 
the student just before him, had missed a question. 
</P>
<P>
 "Which document states that every person has the right to own property?" the 
moderator asked. "One, the Magna Carta; two, the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights; three, the Great Law of Peace; four, the May 16 Declaration, or five, 
Pericles' Funeral Oration." 
</P>
<P>
 For each question, there was a painful, few seconds' delay between the time 
correct answers were announced and the time scores were projected onto a movie 
screen. Some students saved their teammates the agony of waiting, like the 
teen-agers from Mesa, Ariz., who waved a good-luck stuffed bull in the air when 
they knew a teammate had answered correctly. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most of his teammates, Sheldon gave no indication of his standing, 
preferring to wait and let the team see for themselves. The correct answer was 
No. 2, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the team would soon learn 
that Sheldon knew it.

 After every correct answer, supporters in the gym grandstands whooped and 
howled their team's name. No group, including the team from the host state of 
New Jersey, had as much enthusiasm as the 68-person entourage that accompanied 
the Taft team. 
</P>
<P>
 In their signature red "GO TAFT!" sweat shirts -- which debuted last year 
during the Los Angeles district's competition and reprised at the state 
competition in Stockton last month -- parents, school administrators and 
district officials took over the center grandstands, letting everyone know that 
they were undaunted by the 2,700-mile distance. 
</P>

<P>
 After the victory, as the students made plans to build bonfires with their 
study aids and party through the last months of their senior year, Emily Sears 
Vaughn rejoiced with the other parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, like her 17-year-old son, Sage, she gave thanks that Academic Decathlon 
1993-1994 was finished. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so proud and I'm so relieved," she said. "Now they can go back to being 
normal, impossible teen-agers." 
</P>
<P>
 Also competing for Taft were: Daniel Berdichevsky, 17; Michael Michrowski, 17; 
Rebecca Rissman, 17; Kimberly Shapiro, 16; and the team's only junior, Stephen 
Shaw, 16.

MOTORIST KILLED IN CRASH IS IDENTIFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police have identified a motorist who was killed Friday in a head-on collision 
on Lassen Street as Mohibullah Helmandi 27, of Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Helmandi may have been trying to control a nosebleed when his car veered to 
the wrong side of the street and struck a pickup truck in the 18500 block of 
Lassen Street, said Officer Ralph Kemptner of the Los Angeles Police 
Department's Valley Traffic Division. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the truck, Jeffrey Ault, 33, of Sepulveda, was not seriously 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are still investigating the accident.

LEGEND FLYING HIGH; AVIATION: PILOTS FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY MAKE MEMORIAL 
FLIGHT TO HONOR THE LATE GEN. J.H. 'JIMMY' DOOLITTLE, WHO LED 1942 BOMBING RUN 
ON TOKYO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For Col. Jack Sims, this was the mission that mattered the most. 
</P>
<P>
 As a surviving member of the Tokyo Raiders, Sims came from Naples, Fla., to 
the Van Nuys Airport for a memorial flight to honor the late Gen. J.H. "Jimmy" 
Doolittle, who led the daring 1942 bombing run on Tokyo that marked the first 
American victory against the Japanese in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a twinkle in his eye and you'd follow him to hell and back again," 
Sims, 75, said of Doolittle. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Sims and several of his former comrades began the first leg of a 
statewide air tour in World War II vintage planes. The tour will culminate 
today when a wreath of flowers for Doolittle is dropped from bomb bay doors 
over the sea near Pebble Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 A tough street kid who grew up in Los Angeles, Doolittle died last September 
at the age of 96 in that seaside town. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's mass departure from Van Nuys Airport's new Petersen Aviation 
Terminal featured B-25 Mitchell bombers, P-51 Mustang fighter planes, F-18s, 
F-16s and other war birds. The flight drew aviation buffs from as far away as 
Minneapolis and as close as Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jimmy Doolittle's been my hero since I was knee-high to a pup," said Terry 
Terrell, 70, of Newport Beach, who thundered out of the airport as a co-pilot 
on a silver B-25 nicknamed "Pacific Princess." 
</P>
<P>
 A 20-year-old co-pilot fresh out of flight school when he joined Doolittle's 
Raiders, Sims saw the event, which began Friday, as an opportunity to reflect 
on the changes in aviation since the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Vintage aircraft stood alongside state-of-the art corporate jets such as 
Gulfstream IIs, IIIs and Hawker HS 125-700s, which operate out of the Petersen 
Aviation Terminal. The terminal also includes five hangars, an observation 
tower, and pilot and patron lounges. 
</P>
<P>
 But while their aircraft may be outdated, Sims, a retired Air Force colonel, 
believes no technology exists to replace the spirit of the men who risked their 
lives in Doolittle's famous bombing run, which was chronicled in the 1944 movie 
"Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo." 
</P>
<P>
 With their planes capable of holding only enough fuel for a one-way trip, 
Doolittle's crew set off knowing their only hope of survival was reaching the 
friendly shores of China after dropping their bombs on Japan. Seven of the 80 
crewmen on that mission died, some executed by the Japanese, and Sims himself 
ran out of fuel and bailed out over China. 
</P>
<P>
 Their sacrifice in delivering the war to Tokyo crushed Japanese morale and 
inspired Americans then and continues to inspire aviation and military history 
buffs today. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anyone will equal Doolittle's stature," Sims said. "He was a 
spunky little guy."

FACE BEHIND THE STATISTICS; FEWER YOUNG BICYCLISTS HURT IN '94, BUT JUAN 
PEDROZA AMONG INJURED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIVIEN LOU CHEN and MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ignoring his mother's warning, 10-year-old Juan Pedroza slipped out of his 
North Hollywood home one evening in January and, wearing no helmet, rode away 
on his bicycle to a friend's house. 
</P>
<P>
 As he returned home, he was struck by a car while trying to cross Oxnard 
Street at Lankershim Boulevard. One of the vehicle's wheels crushed his head, 
leaving the boy with a fractured skull and serious brain damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan's mother, Patricia Rodriguez, said she was well aware of the new law that 
requires children under 18 to wear helmets while riding bicycles on public 
streets and trails. She even forbade her son from biking because he did not 
have protective head gear. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did not let him ride the bike because he had no helmet," Rodriguez, 26, 
said. "We could not afford a helmet." 
</P>
<P>
 With a hard shell on, she added, "at least his head wouldn't have been 
damaged. That is the worst part of his injuries." 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Fernando Valley and citywide, the number of youngsters seriously 
injured or killed while bike riding is down compared with this same time last 
year. But authorities are unsure whether the new law has been a factor. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers are issuing only verbal or written warnings to violators, and some 
say it is much too early to tell what kind of effect the legislation is having. 
Police computer records do not indicate whether an injured or killed bicyclist 
was wearing a helmet. 
</P>
<P>
 In the three months since the law went into effect Jan. 1, two serious 
injuries and no deaths have been reported in the San Fernando Valley involving 
youths on bicycles. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a slight decrease from 1993 figures, when there were four serious 
injuries and no fatalities for the same period. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can do anything you want with the stats," said Sgt. Paul Modrell of the 
Los Angeles Police Department's Valley Traffic Division. "To me, the difference 
between two and four is an insignificant number." 
</P>
<P>
 Citywide, the margin is wider. There have been six serious injuries and no 
deaths of youngsters on bicycles so far in 1994, according to the LAPD's 
Traffic Analysis Unit. Last year, 11 minors had been seriously hurt on bikes 
and two, both 9-year-olds, were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 The state helmet law has a one-year grace period in which violators are only 
issued a warning by police. In 1995, officers will begin issuing citations and 
fines of up to $25 per offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Barrows, a spokesman for the California Coalition for Children's Safety 
and Health and an early supporter of the legislation, said his group needed a 
year to inform the public about the law before it goes into full effect, and to 
set up programs for getting helmets into the hands of low-income families like 
Juan's. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the fines collected from violators will go to safety programs and to 
loans and grants that help families buy helmets. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrows said his office in Sacramento could have referred Juan's family to 
local agencies willing to donate helmets. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A helmet may have lessened the injuries Juan received in the hit-and-run 
accident Jan. 28, said Detective Jim Mann of the LAPD's Valley Traffic 
Division. But, he added, "it's hard to say." 
</P>
<P>
 Police are still looking for the driver of the car -- possibly a blue or black 
Buick sedan -- that struck the boy and dragged his small red bicycle a couple 
of blocks away from the accident scene. He also suffered a broken hip, foot and 
leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles say he is walking again, but will 
never regain full strength on the left side of his body. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's slowly rehabilitating," Rodriguez said. "At least the worst is over. But 
he has not accepted what happened to him. He keeps saying, 'Why did I go out 
that day?' "

EARTHQUAKE MEMORIES SAVED FOR THE FUTURE; VIDEO: BROWNIE TROOP AND OTHERS 
RELIVE FEARS AND LIGHTER MOMENTS THAT CAME LATER. THE TAPE WILL BE INCLUDED IN 
A TIME CAPSULE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Girl Scout Troop 385 has a message for earthquake victims of the future: It's 
OK to be scared. 
</P>
<P>
 Squirming in their seats and nervously twisting locks of hair, the band of 
eight girls from Canyon Country on Saturday gazed into a video camera and 
recorded their tales of the Northridge earthquake for a time capsule that could 
reach future residents of the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 One by one, each girl related in her own way how frightened she were when the 
quake hit. Some, like 7-year-old Samantha Connor, spoke so softly they could 
barely be heard. Others, like 8-year-old Lyssa Adams, gushed the words like 
rapidly deflating balloons. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the earthquake, we had glass everywhere and 10 gallons of water 
everywhere and my dad came to get me and we ran outside and it stopped," Adams 
said to the camera, which was set up by King Videocable in a Valencia 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, part of the city of Santa Clarita's second annual Emergency Expo, 
in the River Oaks Shopping Center, collected earthquake testimony from 
residents from throughout the Santa Clarita Valley. City officials said the 
videotape will be placed in a time capsule next year, on the anniversary of the 
Jan. 17 temblor, and be opened at some undetermined date. 
</P>
<P>
 Troop leader Lillian Shaw wanted to include her Brownies in the time capsule 
videotape for therapeutic, as well as historic, reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lost three girls out of our troop because of the earthquake," said Shaw, 
whose troop contains 24 girls. "One whose trailer was destroyed, and we had two 
others whose parents decided to pack up and move. They just couldn't handle 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Shaw has encouraged her girls to talk about the incident, but no 
effort reproduced the same sense of candid fear as Saturday's videotaping. One 
of those tales came from Jennifer Shaw, Lillian's 7-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt scared during the earthquake because I was in my bed during the whole 
thing," said Jennifer. Fortunately, a net holding her stuffed animals above her 
bed caught a glass frame that would have crashed onto her when it was dislodged 
by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really glad to be here," she said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 But the girls were nearly upstaged by Omer Murray, a 52-year-old Newhall 
resident who recalled the confusion of being on a treadmill in a gym away from 
home when the quake struck. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know if the room was still moving or not because when you get off a 
treadmill your sense of balance is still off," Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray's neighbor encountered an even worse surprise. When he asked how Murray 
was, Murray's wife replied, "He's gone." She meant Murray was at the gym, but 
the neighbor took it that Murray had perished in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Murray pulled into the driveway, shocking the already battered nerves of 
his neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here's the ghost driving up, in effect," Murray said, tongue in cheek. 
</P>
<P>
 Brownie troop leader Shaw hopes future quake victims find the videotape 
reassuring, proving that children and adults can survive a major temblor with 
their sense of humor intact. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe if kids see it coming from other kids, it will help in the future," 
Shaw said.

5 ACCUSED OF ATTEMPTING TO SMUGGLE GOODS INTO JAIL; CRIME: TWO INMATES AT THE 
PITCHESS FACILITY ARE ALSO CHARGED IN THE ALLEGED EFFORT TO SNEAK IN CIGARETTES 
AND OTHER ITEMS.

 Sheriff's deputies arrested five men Saturday as they allegedly tried to 
smuggle 240 packs of cigarettes, 11 butane lighters and two boxes of colored 
pencils used for tattooing into the Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho county jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Two inmates were also charged with participating in the smuggling ring, 
deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on tips from inside and outside the jail, Los Angeles County sheriff's 
deputies had worked since February to foil what they said was a contraband 
smuggling ring by setting up several observations posts. The operation was 
known as "Knight Moves." 
</P>
<P>
 "Occasionally, inmates are caught with cigarettes. But to have an amount this 
big . . . attempted to be brought in is unusual," said Deputy Angie McLaughlin. 
"Normally, you don't see that large of an amount going into a jail facility." 
</P>
<P>
 Bail was set at $10,000 each for the five men. All seven people are charged 
with criminal conspiracy to enter a jail facility for the purpose of illegal 
communication or to smuggle in contraband. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday night, deputies stationed at one of the observation posts saw a gray 
and black car carrying the men pull up to the facility's property boundary, 
McLaughlin said. Two men wearing dark clothing and backpacks -- later 
identified as Leo Parra, 44, and Daniel Lemons, 25, both of Wilmington -- got 
out of the car, McLaughlin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parra and Lemons were arrested shortly after 1 a.m. as they walked on the 
ridge line near the facility, carrying 240 packs of cigarettes, lighters and 
boxes of colored pencils, officials said. The cigarettes and lighters would 
have probably been sold to other inmates at inflated prices, McLaughlin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, inmates Jon Brecht, 30, and Gary Diess, 47, were waiting in back of 
a jail barracks and were seen by investigators placing a white towel in a 
window as a signal, officials said. Both men were in jail on narcotics charges, 
McLaughlin said.  
</P>
<P>
 One of them has been identified by deputies as being a leader of the smuggling 
ring. The other was found with $700 on him -- far more than the $40 inmates are 
allowed to have at one time, McLaughlin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities captured the three other suspects after they left the jail by car. 
They are Gilbert Galaz, 20, of San Pedro; Ronnie Nunez, 19, of Wilmington, and 
Joseph Rodriguez, 19, of Lakewood.

TRUSTEE'S OFFICE BECOMING A DEBTORS' HAVEN; BANKRUPTCY: TIGHT BUDGETS, CRUSHING 
WORKLOAD MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO UNCOVER HIDDEN ASSETS. ONE OFFICIAL TELLS 
CREDITORS THEY ARE BASICALLY ON THEIR OWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most hearings in the U.S. bankruptcy trustee's office here--a Spartan assembly 
room where debtors without assets go to plead their cases--are dispatched in 
minutes. But a recent session took a remarkable turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of upholding the debtor's statement that he had no money, bankruptcy 
trustee Charles Daff bore down, demanding amplification where simple "yes" or 
"no" answers usually suffice. After an hourlong examination, he refused to 
approve the business owner's request to be relieved of his obligation to repay 
debts of more than $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Daff said he suspected that some assets might have gone unreported--perhaps 
had even been hidden away intentionally in anticipation of the bankruptcy 
filing. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in a 15-minute discourse, he told the 40 or so assembled creditors that 
they should not expect much help from the bankruptcy system. If they wanted to 
recover the money they said they were owed, he told them, they should pool 
their remaining resources, hire a lawyer or an accountant who specializes in 
finding hidden funds, and conduct their own search. 
</P>
<P>
 Daff acknowledged that trustees are supposed to be the people's watchdog to 
ensure that debtors' claims of insolvency are truthful. But there often is 
little they can do, he said, to prevent abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 The main reasons, Daff and others in the bankruptcy system say, are the 
courts' crushing workload and tight budgets that leave judges and trustees 
little choice but to close cases as quickly and economically as possible. As a 
result, creditors seeking payment find that they are pretty much on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message we got was that the system isn't going to help us and certainly 
isn't going to punish" the debtor, said Debby L. Zajac of Long Beach, one of 
the creditors at the hearing over which Daff was presiding. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are all mad as hell," she said, "but most of us just don't have any money 
left to hire an attorney." 
</P>
<P>
 The three federal bankruptcy judges assigned to Orange County received 14,030 
new cases last year. For the three previous years, the system had handled more 
than 40,000 cases. Their main assistants are the trustees--eight of them for 
the entire county. Hearing schedules require each trustee to handle as many as 
2,100 cases a year--an average of 175 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, the trustees--private lawyers who specialize in administering 
debtors' estates--have little financial incentive to pursue complicated cases 
in which they suspect fraud. They are paid a flat $45 fee for each so-called 
no-asset filing. If they choose to search for hidden assets, they are entitled 
to keep 3% of whatever they recover. Meanwhile, they must foot all the bills 
themselves. If they recover nothing, they are paid nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 As Daff explained during his speech to creditors, his office is certainly 
willing to help, but he has no resources to tackle a case on his own. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of pressure from the U.S. trustee's office to go after frauds 
when we see them, but the paradox is that private trustees don't get paid for 
doing that," said Robert Mosier, a Costa Mesa lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Mosier recently withdrew from the trustee panel in Orange County. "The reality 
is that, unless the creditors come in and point out the fraud and then track 
down the money, you just can't do it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other trustees, bankruptcy lawyers and judges uphold Daff's position that 
creditors in Orange County who want to recover funds from a debtor intent on 
not paying will likely have to organize and do their own hunting. 
</P>
<P>
 That Daff even questioned a debtor's claim to have no assets may have been 
largely because that particular hearing drew a large and vocal contingent of 
angry creditors, bankruptcy professionals said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We work fundamentally on an honor system," said Marcy J.K. Tiffany, chief 
U.S. trustee for the Central District, which includes Orange, Los Angeles, 
Riverside and San Bernardino counties and is the busiest in the nation, with 
98,000 cases filed last year. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, using the bankruptcy system as a haven is "incredibly easy," 
Tiffany said, for scam artists and unscrupulous business operators who take 
clients' money, use it for lavish corporate trappings or personal belongings, 
then file for bankruptcy protection when the customers begin complaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "How many no-asset cases really involve a debtor with no assets?" Tiffany 
asked in a moment of introspection during a recent interview. "We have 
absolutely no way of knowing." And at the rate the government pays trustees "we 
just can't afford to find out."  
</P>
<P>
 Tiffany estimates that 20% of the bankruptcy filings in the Central District 
last year were legitimate efforts by individuals or businesses to regain their 
financial footing. The rest, she said, were efforts to use bankruptcy to halt 
legitimate foreclosures and evictions, block civil litigation and sometimes to 
seek shelter from civil or criminal investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent case, for example, the Federal Trade Commission sued and reached a 
settlement with a Sacramento-area man, William Moreland, who was marketing 
gold-mine interests by phone.Moreland agreed to shut down and to reimburse 
investors fully after FTC agents accused him of selling securities illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 But the ink had barely dried on the settlement papers when Moreland filed for 
bankruptcy protection, effectively canceling out the reimbursement agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 The FTC went to bankruptcy court and again argued its case--but to no avail. 
The court ruled that the bankruptcy filing was not fraudulent and relieved 
Moreland of the obligation to honor the settlement and repay investors. 
</P>
<P>
 The bankruptcy court system is clogged, Tiffany said, mainly because of 
efforts to avoid liability. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers who handle bankruptcy cases don't deny that there is a problem, but 
some of them maintain that getting a debtor into bankruptcy court provides 
creditors with more--not less--control of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, the number of scams is up. It's the recession--the time is ripe for 
people to be taken advantage of," said Ronald Rus, whose Irvine firm, Rus, 
Miliband, Williams & Smith, specializes in representing trustees and creditors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing people have to understand is that you are better off if a bad guy 
does file bankruptcy. That puts him under the jurisdiction of the court and 
gives you an opportunity to see if there is anything to collect to pay the 
creditors. That's the real issue in bankruptcy," Rus said. "Are there assets to 
collect?" 
</P>
<P>
 But that's just where the system is most likely to break down today, said 
Newport Beach lawyer Theodor Albert, a member of the trustee panel in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're attempting to achieve two perhaps opposite goals," he said. "We have to 
deal with a massive volume of filings, and we are trying to be more efficient 
with quicker and less expensive resolution of cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it is our priority in society to catch every single culprit," he said, 
"then we have to alter the compensation so someone has the incentive to do 
that. With what we have now, some crooks will make it through the net." 
</P>
<P>
 That's what Daff said in his impromptu civics lecture. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have people here who have lost substantial sums of money," he said. "But 
does the debtor have assets that we can trace and recover, through litigation 
and hours and hours of expensive work by accountants?" 
</P>
<P>
 Pointing out that he is not an government employee, Daff explained that he 
takes such cases only on contingency. "I could go broke" spending much time on 
a case, he said, so "any creditors that want to participate with me, that want 
to discuss sharing the costs . . . are welcome." 
</P>
<P>
 The creditors have the right to hire private counsel and file claims with the 
bankruptcy court in an effort to recover hidden assets, Daff said, but that 
rarely occurs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Typically what happens in these cases," Daff said, "is that if I get 50 
people together, everybody with substantial losses, everybody says, ' I can't 
afford another dollar, ' and we all leave the room and nothing happens. 
Truthfully. It goes on and on." And it is the creditors, not the debtor or the 
trustee, who suffer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point in his plea, Daff stopped and looked down at a recorder taping 
his speech: "I've said too much already." 
</P>
<P>
 But Tiffany and others who work with the bankruptcy court say that Daff's 
comments could be a wake-up call. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes the system is blind to everything but the protection of the 
debtor," Tiffany said. "That causes the courts to hesitate too long to take 
control." 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Albert said: "I think Chuck Daff's point is well taken. . . . All he 
was saying is that the trustee is not a policeman. Nobody is paying his salary. 
He is a civil litigant, just like the creditors, and he has to make a case 
pencil out financially. 
</P>
<P>
 "The creditors who already are in the soup have a lot more incentive than the 
trustee to invest money in chasing down assets." Bankruptcies Still High

JAMES FLANIGAN: CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE THAT TOBACCO CAUSES REVENUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After hearings in which members of Congress last week vilified top executives 
of tobacco companies as engaging in "an enterprise that is sure to kill some of 
our children," the stocks of most cigarette companies rose -- including that of 
industry leader Philip Morris by $2 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the paradox continues: Thirty years after the Surgeon General said that 
smoking causes lung cancer, cigarettes are still a strong worldwide industry, 
in which U.S. companies alone have sales of $50 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 And cigarettes won't be banned now, although last week's hearings by a 
Congressional subcommittee on health were part of a long-term process that will 
increase regulation and ultimately cause the cigarette business to diminish. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the Food and Drug Administration may not even get 
jurisdiction over cigarettes. The paradox there is that if FDA declared 
nicotine to be a drug, it would be forced to approve cigarettes as safe and 
effective or ban them altogether. And nobody wants a total prohibition of 
smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 Why not? Because banning cigarettes would create an illegal market approaching 
$100 billion a year in the United States alone. That's no exaggeration. 
</P>
<P>
 Figure it this way: There are 50 million U.S. smokers today and half of them 
would quit rather than smoke illegally. But that would leave 25 million 
two-pack-a-day smokers at, say, $5 a pack because contraband costs more. That 
would add up to $91.3 billion a year, an illegal industry far bigger than 
cocaine is today. 
</P>
<P>
 So cigarettes will remain a legal business, but with more regulation. 
"Addicted smokers can continue to smoke but not harm their fellow citizens, so 
smoking should be kept out of all public places; and we can do more to keep 
them away from kids by enforcing prohibitions on sales to minors," says Rep. 
Henry Waxman, (D-Los Angeles) who chaired last week's hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street still finds tobacco stocks attractive, but for other reasons. 
"They're undervalued given the strength of their food businesses and their 
potential in international markets," says analyst Sally Schaadt of Fourteen 
Research, an adviser to institutional investors. 
</P>
<P>
 She's referring to the fact that Philip Morris and RJR Nabisco, which together 
control 75% of the U.S. cigarette market, also own valuable food companies. But 
because RJR's Nabisco (Oreos, Life Savers) and Philip Morris' General Foods and 
Kraft divisions (Post cereals, Jell-O, Kraft cheeses, Oscar Mayer meats) are 
overshadowed by fears about tobacco, the stock market doesn't give their owners 
the premium it accords other food companies, such as H.J. Heinz. 
</P>
<P>
 That's one reason both tobacco companies are considering setting up their food 
divisions with a separately trading stock. Based on the ratio of price to 
earnings that the stock market accords other food companies, such separate 
firms theoretically could add 40% to 60% to the total value of RJR and Philip 
Morris. 
</P>
<P>
 Vast international markets are just opening up in Russia, Eastern Europe, 
China and India. But U.S. operations, thanks partly to the tobacco companies' 
highly efficient manufacturing and distribution, have always returned three to 
four times the profit of international operations. 
</P>
<P>
 And the domestic business faces a future of increasing restrictions. Professor 
Mark Kleiman of Harvard University, an expert in drug regulation, puts 
cigarettes in context: "We regulate lots of drugs on different levels, from 
total prohibition for heroin, to morphine for medicinal use, to prescriptions 
for Valium, down to aspirin, alcohol, nicotine and caffeine. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can increase the restrictions on nicotine," Kleiman adds. 
</P>
<P>
 New legal troubles will arise for tobacco companies. Congress last week 
demanded that the companies provide reports of research they've conducted on 
smoking's injurious effects. Reluctantly, the executives promised to comply. 
</P>
<P>
 Such information will arouse class action lawsuits alleging that the companies 
failed to disclose product dangers -- even though cigarette packs for decades 
have stated that smoking causes lung cancer and heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The tobacco companies have faced and won "364 lawsuits since 1954," observes 
veteran analyst John Maxwell of Wheat First Butcher & Singer in Richmond, Va. 
"More won't bother them," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But this time it's different. Regulation develops slowly but inexorably as 
medical knowledge grows and attitudes change. The American people used to spit 
in the street and tolerate occasional cholera in the drinking water. Now they 
don't. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly with cigarettes, the accumulation of lawsuits and pressures from 
insurers, smoking bans at work and anti-smoking ad campaigns will erode the 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a long build-up before the ban on asbestos," observes Professor 
Lawrence Fischer of Michigan State University's Toxicology Institute. But 
ultimately it was found to be a danger to the public health and banned. 
</P>
<P>
 But cigarettes are not proven guilty, tobacco executives protested last week. 
They even denied that nicotine is addictive because people quit smoking. But 
that's disingenuous. "So what," retorts drug expert Kleiman, "17 million people 
have kicked cocaine, but it's still addictive." 
</P>
<P>
 Executive denial sparked anger among Congressmen, who questioned how the 
business people could live with themselves. The answer is that money leads to 
convenient rationalization, but there's no need to make scapegoats of 
executives on that score. Thousands of pension and mutual and trust funds have 
invested billions of dollars in tobacco stocks; the $25-billion buyout of RJR 
was a zenith of the 1980s bull market. Many ordinary people have benefited from 
tobacco profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, many states and now President Clinton and Congress want to tax 
cigarettes to pay for schools and health care and other good things. We scorn 
smokers but want to live off them at the same time; there's hypocrisy enough to 
go round. 
</P>
<P>
 But now we're moving on. A political decision has been made that the cost to 
the public health of cigarette smoking outweighs the protests of the industry. 
The coming of regulation will be inexorable. And, raucous as they seemed, last 
week's hearings were an important part of that process.

CLICK-TO-NAVIGATE IS THE KEY TO CD-ROM. COMPTON'S NEW MEDIA CLAIMS IT INVENTED 
THE TECHNOLOGY. DOES THAT MAKE ITS CARLSBAD TEAM A BAND OF MULTIMEDIA BULLIES 
OR THE; MOTHERS OF INVENTION? 
</P>

 The patent, engraved on a gold plate mounted on polished wood, hangs on the 
wall at the headquarters of Compton's New Media, an unapologetically displayed 
as trophy from one of the young multimedia industry's most tumultuous -- and 
still unresolved -- episodes. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm has not yet tried to enforce this virtual license to print money. 
And, with a chastened U.S. Patent Office threatening to overturn the patent, 
the specter of Compton's as a wicked monopolist stifling innovation among 
multimedia fledglings may ultimately prove overblown. 
</P>
<P>
 But the story of how the small company that created the first interactive 
encyclopedia came to be viewed as an industry villain has already become part 
of multimedia lore, providing insight into the growing pains of the 
much-celebrated medium. 
</P>
<P>
 What Compton's does next, as it ponders whether to appeal last month's initial 
reversal of the patent, may change the balance of power in an industry where no 
one has yet gained a fixed ascendance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Luke has prevailed, and the force was initially with us," says Philip Dodds, 
executive director of the Annapolis, Md.-based Interactive Multimedia Assn. 
"The question is, will the empire strike back?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A small army of companies is hoping to strike it rich -- or richer -- in the 
burgeoning business of multimedia, the catch-all term for interactive computer 
software, video games and various pieces of the information superhighway that 
may eventually ferry digital news, entertainment, education and shopping 
opportunities to television sets across America.  
</P>
<P>
 So when Compton's announced last fall that it had won the right to charge 
license fees for the use of a search-and-retrieve technology, which serves as 
the foundation of nearly all such products, a lot of people were pretty upset. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of them proposed a public burning of the CD-ROM discs that Compton's 
publishes and distributes. Others simply vowed to take the firm to court. 
Norman Bastin, Compton's free-wheeling executive vice president -- who bleaches 
his hair and likes to sing on stage at the firm's frequent trade show parties 
-- received hate mail and threats of physical violence. 
</P>
<P>
 At the core of the dispute is a feeling among other pioneers in the field that 
Compton's was trying to steal the credit for, as the firm's promotional video 
boasts, "creating multimedia" -- and of doing it with technology that 
competitors compare to a book publisher trying to claim patents on ink and 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an emotional issue," says Peter Black, a Los Angeles-based CD-ROM 
developer whose products Compton's has distributed. "Very few people in this 
industry are making money. The only thing you can walk home with at night is 
the assertion that you're one of the founders, that you're a part of history." 
</P>
<P>
 Bastin, who helped found the firm's new-media division and is named as one of 
the inventors on the patent, is alternately defensive and defiant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never wanted to be a toll road on the information highway, like everybody 
said," he insists. "All I wanted was to be an AM-PM Mini-Mart off an exit 
somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, to the taunt that Compton's is striving to become the Microsoft of 
multimedia -- the ultimate insult in the software industry, where Microsoft is 
viewed as a bully -- he says with a shrug, "Microsoft is a very profitable 
company."  
</P>
<P>
 CD-ROM software, the medium on which Compton's so far has sold nearly 3 
million copies of its electronic encyclopedia, comes on shiny, five-inch discs 
that are played on a drive hooked up to a personal computer or a machine 
connected to a television set. Like music compact discs, they cannot be 
recorded over (hence the ROM, for "read-only memory"). In addition to sound, 
they hold pictures, video and text -- about 400 times the data that can fit on 
a typical floppy disk. 
</P>
<P>
 When Compton's first managed to squeeze the 26 volumes of its encyclopedia 
onto a CD-ROM in 1989, it was considered a remarkable feat. ABC's "Good Morning 
America," Compton's Chicago-based CEO Stanley Frank likes to remember that did 
a live feed on the product's introduction. The three years and $8.5 million 
that went into it suddenly seemed worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
 Then owned by Encyclopaedia Britannica -- which gave away the paper version of 
Compton's as a bonus for the kids to families who invested in the higher-brow 
Britannica -- Compton's went on to break new ground in distribution of CD-ROMs, 
supplying capital to help other developers finish their products and persuading 
retail outlets to carry them. 
</P>
<P>
 Compton's now boasts the largest market share in the fast-growing industry. 
With sales doubling to more than $60 million last year, it has published more 
than 40 titles of its own and distributes 150 other programs from 22 
publishers. To keep its maze of offices in Carlsbad from bursting at the seams, 
the firm just leased 30,000 square feet of space next-door. 
</P>
<P>
 Even its most vocal critics give Compton's credit for helping nurture 
multimedia in the early days. But the patent remains a sticking point. 
</P>
<P>
 Patent No. 5,241,671 covers a commonly used way of storing and retrieving text 
linked to images on a CD-ROM. For example, when you click on the entry 
"Kennedy, John F." in the multimedia menu of the encyclopedia, the 35th U.S. 
President's image appears in a window on your computer screen. "Ask not what 
your country can do for you . . . " he begins, in a recording of his 1961 
inaugural address. 
</P>
<P>
 Another click brings up the text of an article chronicling Kennedy's life. A 
click on the camera icon next to the heading "Weds Long Island Beauty" conjures 
up Jacqueline Kennedy in a bouffant hairdo, with John Jr. and Caroline on her 
lap. Choose the highlighted "See also Cuba" at the end of a passage on 1962 
events and you are transported to the Cuba heading and the start of a similar 
set of permutations. 
</P>
<P>
 The ease with which one can browse through related topics -- and the vivid 
animation and images that could not be found in a stack of books -- have 
propelled annual sales of Compton's and its main electronic encyclopedia 
competitors, Grolier's and Microsoft's Encarta, far beyond those of the paper 
variety. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last year, the technology has led to a 54% explosion -- to 8,100 -- 
in the number of CD-ROM titles published, from children's games to mail-order 
catalogues to interactive pornography. A sampling of titles: "Dinosaur 
Adventure," "Multimedia Mozart" and the Bible. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a complex process to compress the video, come up with interesting content 
and make it all work together. But, says Tom Lopez, who heads the CD-ROM 
publishing firm Mammoth Micro Productions in Seattle, the part of the process 
Compton's has patented is "not rocket science."  
</P>
<P>
 "You click on a horse, you have a description of the horse. Or you click the 
word horse and you get a picture," Lopez says. "That's what I would consider to 
be pretty obvious." 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of Compton's announcement of the patent award, Lopez and dozens of 
others in the multimedia industry claimed to know about tons of "prior art" -- 
products that used the patented technology before Compton's did. The Patent 
Office was attacked as being stuck in the past, incapable of assessing 
high-tech patent cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet no one came forward to submit any prior art to the agency after its new 
commissioner, Bruce Lehman, took the unusual step of ordering the claim 
re-examined. When the office tentatively reversed its decision last month, 
issuing a preliminary rejection of the patent's 41 claims, the reversal was 
based on a textbook description of the well-known computer program Hypercard, 
which the examiner said predated Compton's "SmarTrieve" system.  
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly didn't see a lot of letters coming across my desk saying, 'Here, 
Commissioner, here's a bunch of stuff I know.' I think our customers could help 
us out a little more than they do," Lehman says.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The issue is a structural one, he says. Software patent disputes often end up 
in court, and inventors would rather save their best shots for the judge. To 
encourage third-party participation, Lehman has drafted legislation to make the 
patent application process public, without the strict secrecy in which it now 
takes place.  
</P>
<P>
 Whether the ruling invalidating Compton's patent will be appealed is up to 
Tribune Co., the Chicago media conglomerate that bought the firm from 
Britannica last summer for $57 million -- a price some analysts believe was 
inflated by the assumed value of the patent. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan was to use the patent to encourage publishers to sign distribution 
agreements with Compton's. Those who didn't sign would pay a 3% royalty on 
sales of their products. Those that did sign would get a better deal.  
</P>
<P>
 Tribune spokesman Robert Carr says no decision on an appeal has been made. 
"Heads are getting together, but there has been no consensus," he says.  
</P>
<P>
 Patent attorneys and industry observers expect Compton's to appeal at least 
some of the claims. While it's no fun to be perceived as the industry bully, it 
hasn't generally been known to hurt business. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Bove, who is developing a CD-ROM of his own on San Francisco's 
Haight-Ashbury district and says he may approach Compton's about distributing 
it, takes a pragmatic outlook. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're a company to reckon with, whether you like what they did or not," 
Bove says. "I think they were foolish for trying to have an overly broad 
patent, but as for their bad-boy image -- there are a helluva lot of people in 
this industry who play hardball." 
</P>
<P>
 Some industry observers say the outpouring of wrath against Compton's had more 
to do with resentment over the power it wields in distribution channels than 
the prospect of paying a small royalty fee. And even Compton's harshest 
detractors consider the firm one of their own compared to the media and 
software giants that have recently begun to crash their turf. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing stiff competition from the real "Microsoft of multimedia" -- Microsoft 
itself -- and others, Bastin is trying to move beyond the patent dispute and 
focus on the task of taking Compton's from its reference-book roots into the 
area of interactive entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, Compton's recently announced a joint venture with Warner Bros., 
producing a CD-ROM on the life of John Lennon. (Bastin says Lennon's son, Sean, 
convinced Yoko Ono it was a good idea.) A prototype includes a video clip of 
Lennon playing "Imagine" at his home in New York and another of the Beatles 
performing "Shake It Up" for Queen Elizabeth II. It also allows the user to 
click through a gallery of photographs. 
</P>
<P>
 A new line of audio CD-ROMs, which play music in a compact disc player and 
images on a computer, is planned. The firm recently hired William Perrault, 
former vice president of marketing for Columbia TriStar Home Video, to head its 
entertainment marketing efforts. And last week, Bastin threw a party at the New 
Media Expo conference in Los Angeles to introduce a CD-ROM about the band 
Heart. The group showed up in person to play a set. 
</P>
<P>
 To help himself look forward, Bastin has vowed not to mention the word patent 
. Yet he can't help stumbling over claiming another "first" as he describes the 
company's plans to produce a coffee table book from digital images in a CD-ROM, 
based on the television show "Babylon 5." 
</P>
<P>
 Rephrasing, he says with a sigh, "Let's just say I don't know of any other 
book that's been done like this before." Multimedia Market Leader 
</P>
<P>
 Compton's New Media, one of the pioneers in interactive multimedia, is now the 
industry's largest company. But the Carlsbad firm's claim to have patented the 
key to creating multimedia software has not won it many firends in the 
fledgling field.

CABLE'S DYNAMIC DUO THE ENVY OF THE INDUSTRY; TELECOMMUNICATIONS: THE 
WELL-LIKED FATHER-SON TEAM OF RALPH AND BRIAN ROBERTS IS CREDITED WITH 
POSITIONING COMCAST FOR THE FUTURE. TODAY THE COMPANY IS AT A CROSSROADS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Brian L. Roberts started the hard way in the cable TV business, climbing poles 
to string cable for new subscribers' homes. He admits now that he had "trouble 
carrying the ladder. I was too weak. I was too skinny." 
</P>
<P>
 As the boss's son, however, he survived that summer job and returned to the 
University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. Competitive by nature, he became 
an All-American squash player. After his 1981 graduation, he returned to 
Comcast Corp. to work his way up a different ladder. In 1990, he was named 
president at the tender age of 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Comcast is the nation's fourth-largest cable TV operator, boasting 2.7 
million subscribers, significant holdings in the cellular telephone industry 
and 1993 cash flow of $606 million. As much for its assets, the company is 
admired for the father-son team at the helm and its graceful preparation of the 
next generation of managers. 
</P>
<P>
 At 74, founder Ralph J. Roberts still controls 78% of the company's voting 
stock. He is wealthy (with a net worth exceeding $400 million, according to 
Forbes magazine) -- but not as rich or famous as media moguls Sumner Redstone, 
John Malone and Ted Turner. No matter. He's the envy of many businessmen 
because he has an heir so eager -- and well-equipped -- to run the company. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last two years, Brian Roberts has championed a series of deals that 
look quite smart, and he is emerging as one of the cable industry's ablest 
executives. During the recent takeover battle for Paramount Communications 
Inc., he showed a flair for shuttle diplomacy as he sought backers for the QVC 
Inc.-led bid. It was Roberts, for example, who first contacted the Newhouse 
family's Advance Publications, which pledged $500 million toward the losing 
cause. 
</P>
<P>
 At 34, he has a knack for spotting new opportunities -- and enlisting his 
father to clinch a deal. At his instigation, Comcast became an early investor 
in Nextel Communications Inc.'s new national wireless network. And it was he 
who initiated a successful effort to recruit MCI Communications as an equal 
partner in that venture four months ago, prompting the stock to soar. In 18 
months, Comcast's stake more than quintupled in value to nearly $1.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 "He and his father have one of the great things going. . . . They have 
complete trust," says Barry Diller, chairman of QVC, in which Comcast is a 
major investor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's worked out better than we ever could have hoped," says blunt-spoken 
Comcast Vice Chairman Julian A. Brodsky, who has served as the company's 
financial wizard since the beginning. "Every so often, Ralph and I have to bite 
our tongues, you know, and hold back, but it's clearly Brian's show." 
</P>

 Despite these successes, Comcast is at a crossroads. The issue: How to be a 
bigger player without relinquishing family control. If it is to move into the 
top tier of cable operators, Wall Street analysts say, Comcast needs a partner 
with deep pockets to upgrade its cable systems or acquire additional systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, it seemed the most likely partner would be a regional 
telephone company. But two big cable-telephone deals have collapsed in the past 
two months, and the short-term value of cable TV systems has dropped in the 
wake of 17% rate rollbacks ordered by the Federal Communications Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, regional phone companies have cooled to cable deals, increasing the 
likelihood that cable firms will again find ways to do business together. 
</P>
<P>
 "The good news is the football team of cable is back together," Brian Roberts 
says with characteristic ebullience.  
</P>
<P>
 Without naming names, he indicates that Comcast is considering various 
alliances, but not the outright sale or spinoff of its cable business. 
</P>
<P>
 A source outside Comcast spins one scenario: A long-distance carrier such as 
AT&T or MCI could invest in Teleport Communications Group -- 20%-owned by 
Comcast -- which operates fiber-optic networks that link businesses in 30 
communities to long-distance carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a deal would enable the long-distance-carrier partner to re-establish 
direct contact with consumers, while funneling telephone expertise and money to 
cable companies as they upgrade their systems for two-way data and voice 
transmissions. (Teleport's other owners include Tele-Communications Inc., 
Continental Cablevision and Cox Enterprises; Time Warner has also announced 
plans to invest.) 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Comcast insists it can ride out the current rate-rollback storm. 
</P>
<P>
 It has about $500 million in cash at its disposal -- the same amount once 
earmarked for QVC's failed bid for Paramount. The company has always tried to 
keep cash on hand so it can maneuver quickly without begging a bank's 
permission.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite the rate rollbacks, Comcast says it won't skimp on capital spending to 
upgrade cable systems, a budget expected to total about $200 million in 1994. 
In the next 18 months, for example, the company expects to begin adding channel 
capacity to its Orange County operations, including the 43-channel Newport 
Beach system. And it will probably begin upgrading its 43-channel Ontario 
system in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, Comcast serves about 250,000 cable TV homes in such California cities 
as Simi Valley, Fontana, Santa Ana, Seal Beach and Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the years, Vice Chairman Brodsky has creatively met the company's 
financing needs, borrowing from insurance companies, forming limited 
partnerships or issuing industrial development bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's never been a project around here that wasn't done because there 
wasn't money to do it -- never," says Brodsky, who helped recruit two younger 
executives to fill his own shoes, though he is vigorous at 60. 
</P>
<P>
 Comcast owes most of its success, however, to its low-key founder, who 
commutes daily to his chairman's office from a farm 55 miles outside town. 
Ralph Roberts came to Philadelphia as a teen-ager and, like his son four 
decades later, graduated from Wharton before serving as a Navy lieutenant 
during World War II. He worked in an advertising agency and at Muzak Corp. 
until joining Pioneer Suspender Co. in 1950. He rose to the chief executive's 
job before deciding to sell the company and form his own venture capital firm 
in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts was a good listener, and his easy demeanor made his office a harbor 
for entrepreneurs spinning their ideas. In 1963, he agreed to buy the cable 
system in Tupelo, Miss., on the condition that the broker, a former Jerrold 
Electronics executive named Daniel Aaron, stay on to run it. Aaron consented, 
and Brodsky, the self-described "young tiger" who had been working as Roberts' 
accountant, asked to join the team. (Aaron retired from Comcast in 1991 but 
remains a director and consultant.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brodsky vividly recalls some of their escapades in Mississippi in the 
mid-1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very strange time for a Jewish guy from the North to be wandering 
around Mississippi at the height of the civil rights movement. I look like an 
agitator. I talk like an agitator. Every cop thought I was an agitator," 
Brodsky says with his big laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Comcast executives moved comfortably enough in Mississippi clubs where 
gambling and drinking went on. And it was in a Meridian club that Roberts 
picked up crucial information on the likely winner of that city's franchise, 
Brodsky recalls, giving rise to the erroneous story that they won a cable 
system at the crap table. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mississippi or Pennsylvania, Roberts "can relate to people marvelously," 
Brodsky explains. "And from a business sense, he has enormous strategic insight 
as to what we should be doing, when. Going into the cable business, when to 
make acquisitions, when to expand." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1971, Comcast broke out of Mississippi with the acquisition of franchises 
in western Pennsylvania; the following year, the company offered shares to the 
public. As young Brian was joining the company at the start of the '80s, 
Comcast had about 200,000 cable subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth of Ralph Roberts' five children, Brian was the only one who wanted 
fiercely to work at Comcast. His father dispatched him to Trenton, N.J., as an 
assistant manager, then to a larger system in Flint, Mich., before bringing him 
home in time to participate in a series of bold corporate moves. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, Comcast offered to buy the much larger Storer Communications' cable 
unit. Although spurned, the firm was soon invited to join a consortium of cable 
companies that bought Group W Cable's systems. In 1988, Comcast got its second 
chance to buy Storer -- by teaming successfully with industry leader TCI in a 
$1.5-billion bid. That same year, Comcast invested in a New Jersey-based 
cellular telephone company. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Comcast passed up the chance to invest heavily in Turner Broadcasting 
Corp. ("a mistake," Ralph Roberts says now), Turner invited young Brian Roberts 
to join his board. 
</P>
<P>
 "For someone his age, I don't know anyone who's had that kind of exposure," 
says Home Box Office Chairman Michael Fuchs, also a Turner director. 
</P>
<P>
 Impressed by the father-son team, some moguls have sent their own children to 
Comcast for advice. Brian Roberts credits his father's courteous, optimistic 
nature for easing the way: "He's never going to put you down. You're entitled 
to youthful enthusiasm and youthful mistakes." By the same token, however, the 
younger Roberts says, "I think I understand this is his company, and it always 
will be." Beneath his father's relaxed demeanor is "a tremendous tenacity and 
will to get (things) done." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Comcast's cellular telephone business is a case in point. Ralph Roberts kept 
his eye on billionaire John Kluge's Philadelphia cellular system -- and pounced 
when it came on the market in 1991. In a single weekend, Comcast agreed to pay 
$1 billion. Comcast has been rewarded with a cellular division that posted a 
40% gain in revenue last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're very smart, and they're wonderful guys," says Gordon Crawford, senior 
vice president of Capital Research Co. in Los Angeles. Capital affiliates own 
more than 8% of Comcast's stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the company has a reputation for driving tough deals. Earlier 
this year, for example, Comcast acquired the remaining 8% of the Philadelphia 
cable system it didn't own by paying $95 a share at a time when Paul Kagan 
Associates valued the company at $114 per share. 
</P>
<P>
 And John Alchin, now Comcast's treasurer, recalls that he didn't lend to 
Comcast when he was a Toronto Dominion banker because Comcast was accustomed to 
negotiating low fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most cable TV operators, Comcast would like to have a bigger investment 
in programming. Other than a small stake in Turner Broadcasting and 11% of E! 
Entertainment Television, Comcast's only significant holding is 15.5% of QVC. 
</P>
<P>
 The QVC venture reflects the highly personal, father-son involvement in any 
Comcast investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph Roberts was an early supporter of QVC founder Joseph M. Segel; he had 
admired Segel's prior venture at Franklin Mint, which sells collectibles 
through upscale advertising. He urged Segel to start an upscale shopping 
network. Comcast invested cash and Roberts called all his friends in the 
industry, urging them to put QVC on their cable systems. 
</P>
<P>
 When Segel decided to leave QVC in 1992, however, it was Brian Roberts who 
embarked on a campaign to recruit former Hollywood executive Barry Diller as 
the new QVC chairman and Comcast's partner in a voting trust. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Roberts says he has no regrets about QVC's wrenching pursuit of 
Paramount, despite the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lost with dignity, if there is such a thing," he says. "I think QVC and 
ourselves both are going to see more opportunities, now that the world knows 
that both companies want to expand into programming jointly." 
</P>
<P>
 In pursuit of such deals, he now travels on the company's 50%-owned Hawker 
jet, which is capable of transatlantic flights to the United Kingdom, where 
Comcast operates three cable and telephone systems. Getting home to 
Philadelphia and his wife and three young children is a priority.  
</P>
<P>
 But his itinerary also includes Washington, where the nation's 
telecommunications policy is being thrashed out. "Brian understands how policy 
is made in Washington, and, unlike a lot of older cable CEOs, he is willing to 
become directly involved in the process," says U.S. Rep. Rick Boucher (D-Va.), 
who advocates more competition between phone companies and cable operators. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has not personalized the fight with Washington as some have," says Larry 
Irving, assistant secretary of commerce for communications and information. "I 
think he's emerged as one of the bright young leaders of that industry. He's 
the next generation." Comcast Corp. At-a-Glance

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M. KRISTOF: SHOULD YOU PAY TO HAVE YOUR MONEY MANAGED? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With new tumult in the stock and bond markets, some investors may be wondering 
whether they could benefit from hiring a professional money manager. 
</P>
<P>
 For some people, professional money management is well worth the price. It 
saves them time and energy and allows them to sleep nights knowing that a 
seasoned and trustworthy pro is negotiating a seemingly treacherous market. 
</P>
<P>
 For others, paying for investment management is a costly mistake, says Martin 
Gruber, chairman of the finance department at the Stern School of Business in 
New York. If you are willing and able to invest sagely on your own, you're 
better off saving the investment management fees, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Where do you fit in? To find out, take this quiz, developed with the help of 
Gruber and Heidi Steiger, a partner at Neuberger & Berman, a New York-based 
investment management firm. 
</P>
<P>
 1. Does your portfolio lack a clear investment strategy for dividing assets 
among stocks, bonds and cash? 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Yes -- -- -- -- -- -- -- No 
</P>
<P>
 2. Are your investment results consistently lower than market averages? In 
other words, if you invest in stocks, do the returns in your portfolio 
consistently lag the returns of the Dow Jones industrial average or the 
Standard & Poor's 500? 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Yes -- -- -- -- -- -- -- No 
</P>
<P>
 3. Are you distracted by worries about stock and bond market fluctuations or 
changes in interest rates? 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Yes -- -- -- -- -- -- -- No 
</P>
<P>
 4. Are you worried that a lack of investment experience is jeopardizing your 
ability to save enough for major financial goals, such as retirement or paying 
college tuition costs for your children? 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Yes -- -- -- -- -- -- -- No 
</P>
<P>
 5. Would having somebody else make these investment decisions cause you to 
worry less about your investments? 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Yes -- -- -- -- -- -- -- No 
</P>
<P>
 6. Do you feel comfortable with the idea of someone else making the day-to-day 
buy and sell decisions for your portfolio? 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Yes -- -- -- -- -- -- -- No 
</P>
<P>
 7. Have you had assets successfully managed by professionals in the past -- 
through mutual funds, bank trust departments, pension funds or professional 
money managers? 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Yes -- -- -- -- -- -- -- No 
</P>
<P>
 8. Does your portfolio's performance suffer because you can't spend enough 
time educating yourself or managing your investments? 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Yes -- -- -- -- -- -- -- No 
</P>
<P>
 9. Do you have a clear understanding of why you own the investments you 
already have? And do you have rational expectations of what these investments 
can do for you? 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Yes -- -- -- -- -- -- -- No 
</P>
<P>
 10. Does the time you spend managing your money prevent you from earning more 
in your occupation? 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Yes -- -- -- -- -- -- -- No 
</P>
<P>
 If you have answered yes to at least six of these questions, seriously 
consider turning your investments over to a professional. Realize, however, 
that there are several ways to do this. The method you choose should depend on 
how much you have to invest, your investment savvy and how much faith you have 
in your financial adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally speaking, if you have less than $100,000 in stocks, bonds and cash, 
your best option is mutual funds. This way you get diversification and 
professional money management at relatively little cost -- you could pay as 
little as 1% of your account value each year in management fees. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If you have between $100,000 and $250,000, consider a "wrap" account. 
Generally offered by brokerage firms, these allow you to select a personal 
money manager who buys a portfolio of stocks and bonds for you. Your broker 
helps you monitor the money manager's performance. If your circumstances change 
or the manager's performance isn't up to snuff, the broker will recommend a 
switch to a new money manager. Wrap account management fees typically range 
from 2.5% to 3% annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who have more than $250,000 to invest can use a professional money 
manager directly. Money managers have the legal, discretionary authority to buy 
and sell securities on your behalf as long as they follow prearranged 
guidelines. The advantage to choosing the money manager over the similar wrap 
account is simple: It's cheaper. Generally speaking, money management fees 
range from 1% to 2% of your annual account value. 
</P>
<P>
 If you choose to hand your investments over to a professional, choose the 
professional carefully. The only thing worse than losing sleep over your 
investments is losing your money to a financial con artist or an unskilled 
adviser.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: HOW THE IRS CAN CHECK UP ON YOU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Q: How does the Internal Revenue Service check up on the buy and sell dates of 
stocks? Can it really know every transaction in the portfolio of every 
taxpayer? M.S.C . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: No, the IRS can't "know" everything, but if they want the information badly 
enough, IRS auditors can turn your stock dealings upside-down to get the 
information they want. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, brokerage houses are required to report all stock sales to the 
agency on what is known as a Form 1099. You receive copies of these reports and 
are required to attach them to your income tax return every time you sell 
shares. The IRS also receives this information, and, thanks to the power of 
computers, routinely cross-checks the data against your tax return to ensure 
you have reported exactly what the brokerage house reported. (Similar forms 
covering interest and dividend payments are completed and filed by brokerages, 
corporations and financial institutions.) 
</P>
<P>
 However, merely reporting the sale of securities on the Form 1099 isn't where 
your obligation as a taxpayer ends. You must also tell the IRS how much money 
you made -- or lost -- in the deal. This computation requires you to state what 
you paid for the shares and calculate your so-called taxable basis in the 
securities. The difference between the basis and the sales price -- if the 
sales price is greater -- is the amount on which you are obligated to pay 
taxes. If the sales price is lower than the taxable basis, you are allowed to 
deduct the difference between the two amounts as a loss. These computations 
must be completed on Schedule D of the tax form and filed with your Form 1040. 
</P>
<P>
 The IRS says it is the obligation of all owners of securities to keep records 
of their holdings, their original costs and any transactions affecting their 
taxable bases in these securities. In most cases, this is where it ends. 
However, if you are one of those lucky individuals selected for an IRS audit, 
you may be required to prove how you arrived at your taxable basis in your 
just-sold securities. If your records can't satisfy the IRS, you could be 
liable for taxes on the full amount of the proceeds from the sale. Postponing 
Exemption on Home Sale Profits 
</P>
<P>
 Q: We bought our house for $90,000 and expect to clear $170,000 after sales 
expenses -- when we sell it. We expect to buy a new house for $150,000. 
Although we are over age 55, we do not want to take advantage of the onetime 
exclusion of $125,000 of profit because we hope to accumulate even more 
tax-exempt profit on the sale of our new house. Can we simply pay taxes on the 
$20,000 difference between the sales price of the old house and the cost of the 
new one and postpone taking advantage of the onetime exclusion? -- C.V.B . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. The strategy you have laid out is perfectly proper and sound. If you 
were to invoke the $125,000 exemption with this sale, you would not be able to 
take full advantage of it because the gain on the sale of your old house is 
just $80,000. The law does not permit you to use just a portion of the 
exemption and save the remainder for a later sale. So whatever portion of the 
exemption you don't use -- in your case it would be $45,000 -- is forever lost. 
The tax advisers we consulted said it was probably better to pay taxes on the 
$20,000 gain that was not reinvested in a new house than to permanently forgo 
use of $45,000 worth of the home sellers' exemption. 
</P>
<P>
 For a more complete explanation of how to handle your gain, consult Internal 
Revenue Service Form 2119. You Can't Hide From Home Sale Taxes 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I have a substantial capital gain position in a home in California in which 
I have resided for about 20 years. I plan to move to Nevada, establish legal 
residence there and then return to California and sell my home. Do I have to 
pay taxes on that gain to the state of California? -- F.D.Y . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: The law requires that when you sell property in California -- no matter 
where you live at the time of the sale -- any taxable gain is subject to 
California state income tax as well as federal taxation.  
</P>
<P>
 California has been taxing real estate sales by out-of-state residents for 
decades, but it is fair to say that some have slipped through unnoticed and 
untaxed because the state Franchise Tax Board has not had a particularly good 
method of policing such sales. However, assessor's offices in most counties in 
the state have begun sharing computerized records of property sales and 
reassessments to help the tax board collect what the state is owed. What the 
'Ex' in 'Ex-Dividend' Means 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I understand that dividends are the amounts some companies pay their 
shareholders every quarter. But what does it mean when a company goes 
"ex-dividend"? * 
</P>
<P>
 P.G . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: "Ex-dividend" defines a period of time during which a dividend is not 
payable to those who buy the stock; it occurs immediately prior to the payment 
of a regular corporate dividend. Here's how it works. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's say that Company XYZ pays dividends for the quarter ending March 31 to 
shareholders of record on March 10. This means that between March 10 and March 
31 the company's shares are ex-dividend, and investors purchasing stock in the 
company during that time are not entitled to dividends on those shares. On the 
other hand, investors selling shares during the ex-dividend interval are still 
entitled to the dividend because they were the owners of record on the date of 
reckoning. Generally, shares actually turn ex-dividend a few days before the 
official shareholder-of-record date to allow trades to clear by the official 
date.

VISTA ON TARGET WITH GUN LOADER; MILITARY: IN ADDITION TO THE ROBOTIC ARTILLERY 
SYSTEM, THE VALENCIA FIRM IS ALSO DEVELOPING A SEE-THROUGH HELMET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For a company that designs and manufactures state-of-the-art weapons systems 
for the military, the name is nicely ambiguous -- Vista Controls Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, there is not much about the small research and development company 
that draws attention to it. Vista would be just another amorphous company 
tucked away among the dozens of nondescript industrial complexes sprinkled in 
the Santa Clarita Valley were it not for the 25-ton armored vehicle belonging 
to the Army parked in the company's warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 An Army self-propelled artillery gun, called the M109H Paladin, was loaned to 
Vista while the company works on a $700,000 Army contract to perfect a system 
that automatically loads the 96-pound 155-mm shells and powder bags fired by 
the weapon. The current loading system requires a soldier to physically lift 
the round from an ammunition rack. The Army is expected to renew the Vista 
contract later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get gawks and stares whenever I drive this thing around here. People stop 
and look, but then get out of the way real quick," said Vista engineer George 
Wiltsey, who is working on this and other projects for the Army. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiltsey and other Vista engineers have been working on this "robotic 
autoloader" since 1991. The Paladin is named after the lead character in the 
1950s television Western "Have Gun Will Travel." 
</P>
<P>
 The artillery project that Vista officials are working on uses a computerized 
prototype to transfer an artillery round from a storage rack to the gun's 
breech and load a powder charge automatically. It enables a Paladin crew to 
fire up to 11 rounds per minute before driving to another position on the 
battlefield. 
</P>
<P>
 The privately owned company, founded in 1985, has 45 employees and had sales 
of $6.5 million in 1993, said Mike Nemecheck, Vista military products marketing 
executive. He declined to reveal earnings for last year but said the company is 
profitable and expects sales to increase to $8 million in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Rambin, who founded the company and is president and CEO, owns more than 
50% of the company and employees own most of the remaining shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, more than 90% of the company's revenues have come from 
military contracts. In addition to contracts it has received from the Army, 
Marines, Navy and NASA, Vista has also been a subcontractor on other defense 
projects for General Dynamics, McDonnell Douglas, Lockheed, Rockwell and other 
defense contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, most of Vista's revenues come from a circuit board designed by the 
company's engineers for use in the Army's new M1A2 Abrams battle tank. The 
board is used in the tank's fire control processor to stabilize the turret and 
120-mm gun, enabling the gunner to fire accurately, while the tank rumbles 
along at 40 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our board is crucial to the tank's shoot-on-the-run ability. We designed the 
board for General Dynamics Land Systems, which built the Abrams tank," said 
Nemecheck. 
</P>
<P>
 Vista's contract with General Dynamics for the board is worth $17.5 million 
and is the company's largest military project to date. The six-year contract 
expires in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Nemecheck, a commander in the Navy Reserve, joined Vista last July, after 
working as a marketing manager for Whittaker Electronics Systems in Simi Valley 
for several years. He admits to being a duck out of water when working on 
high-tech projects for Army armored vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Nemecheck is the executive officer of a reserve unit in Long Beach that 
maintains and repairs Navy ships. In contrast to the state-of-the-art weapons 
systems that Vista is developing for the Army, Nemecheck described his Navy 
Reserve job as a "manager in a very low-tech garage for ships." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really more at home with mechanical things like turbines and pumps, but 
I'm also a salesman who's been around high-tech products," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiltsey is presently supervising a team of Vista engineers who are working on 
a See-Thru Armor Helmet that promises to give the crews of U.S. armored 
vehicles a significant advantage on the battlefield. The helmet, which will 
also have night-vision capability, will give a tank crew member, for instance, 
360-degree vision outside the tank while riding inside. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The helmet, which was demonstrated at an Assn. of the United States Army show 
in Washington last October, uses four small video cameras mounted outside the 
tank. Using computers and other high-tech equipment, the cameras are integrated 
with a helmet that features an opaque screen that can be pulled down in front 
of a soldier's face. 
</P>
<P>
 The soldier "sees through" the tank by viewing outside scenes in color on the 
opaque screen, while still being able to view the tank's control panels in 
front of him. The operator chooses which area he wants to view outside the tank 
simply by turning his head in that direction. Gyros inside the helmet activate 
the outside cameras. Currently, crew members can see what is outside their 
vehicle only by opening a hatch and looking out and exposing themselves to 
enemy fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Vista has no government funding yet for the helmet project and has paid for 
most of its research and development costs, which have totaled about $500,000 
to date, Wiltsey said. Eventually, the company hopes to sell the helmets to the 
military for about $25,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is new technology for an entirely new generation of armored vehicles 
that haven't been built yet. This is an example of what we do best here. We 
integrate existing technology into a defense project designed to work in a very 
specific way," Wiltsey said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Vista avoids projects for exotic weapons systems, which can be 
constraining and money losers for the firm. "As a small company, we're trying 
to carve out a niche with the military. It's a lower-risk effort for us if we 
stick with what we know and do best," Wiltsey said.

GAMING INDUSTRY GETS SCARE AS CASINO STOCKS TAKE BATTERING; GAMBLING: ONE 
MARKET INDEX HAS LOST 25% OF VALUE AND ANOTHER IS DOWN ABOUT 21%. 'IT'S A BLIND 
PANIC,' AN INDUSTRY ANALYST SAYS. 
</P>

<P>
 Recent upsets, which might threaten the gambling industry's smooth expansion, 
and high share prices have sent casino stocks down faster than the broader 
market indices. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a blind panic," where casino stocks are involved, said Jay Pearlstein, a 
Loomis Sayles & Co. analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chicago Board Option Exchange Gaming Index, a price-weighted measure of 15 
casino stocks, has lost more than 25% of its value in the last month. The USA 
Capital Gaming Index, a market-value weighted measure of 18 stocks, hasn't done 
much better. It's down about 21% since March 18. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 6% since March 18 and 
the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index has lost about 5% of its value in the 
same period. 
</P>
<P>
 Gambling stocks were bruised last week when Missouri residents rejected a 
constitutional amendment that would have allowed slot machines on riverboats in 
the state, making investors skittish about the gambling industry's ability to 
expand further. The CBOE Gaming Index fell 6% the day after the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Texas and Florida are seriously considering 
gambling proposals, but the vote in Missouri makes people stop to think whether 
residents in these states and others might not opt to keep gambling out, said 
Marvin Roffman, an independent casino analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened last week made a lot of people say, 'None of these things are a 
slam dunk,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That came on the heels of a March 22 proposal floated by the Clinton 
Administration to impose a 4% tax on casino revenue that would fund welfare 
reform. "The excise tax certainly is a fear," Pearlstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to concerns, the Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating 
possible manipulation of stock prices at Casino Data Systems, Casino Magic 
Corp. and Innovative Gaming Corp. of America in connection with their initial 
public stock sales in 1992 and 1993. The Minneapolis-based underwriters include 
R.J. Steichen & Co., Marche Securities Inc., Equity Securities Trading Co. and 
Summit Investment Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Las Vegas-based Circus Circus Enterprises Inc. also shook investors a bit 
Tuesday, when it told analysts earnings might not meet estimates, Pearlstein 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which owns eight Nevada casinos, said that to develop new 
projects its administrative costs will increase in the first quarter ending 
April 30 to about $6 million from $4 million in the previous three months, 
Pearlstein said. Circus Circus' interest expenses also are up because it has 
started paying down debt on its new Luxor hotel and casino in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 The forecasts prompted analysts to lower earnings estimates. Harold Vogel of 
Merrill Lynch cut his estimate for the first-quarter to between 40 and 42 cents 
a share from 45 cents. In the year-ago quarter Circus Circus had net income of 
37 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
 Competition in some new jurisdictions also is heating up, and cutting into 
profits. President Riverboat Casinos Inc. of St. Louis saw the operating 
revenue at its Biloxi, Miss., gambling hall plunge 40% to $12.9 million in the 
quarter ended Feb. 28 from $21.5 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now there are a lot more players and it's more competitive," said Joe 
Milanowski, director of research at USA Capital Management Group. 
</P>
<P>
 According to some, the bad news was just an excuse to get out of an overvalued 
market segment. The CBOE Gaming Index was quoted at roughly 46 times earnings 
in mid-March, but has since declined to a more modest, but still pricey, 34 
times earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, the price-to-earnings multiple of the S&P Midcap Consumer 
Products Index has been much more stable, falling to 19.5 from about 21 a month 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they were vulnerable at the levels they were at," Milanowski said of 
the gaming stocks. "I don't think you could buy at those levels and make 
money." 
</P>
<P>
 Many gaming companies, however, are estimated to increase their annual 
earnings at rates well above 20% a year through 1995, Milanowski said. "Those 
companies are still fundamentally sound, and we still expect the gaming 
industry to grow geographically," he said.

FLORIDA INSURANCE CHIEF KEEPS HIGH-PROFILE STYLE; POLITICS: TOM GALLAGHER HAS 
ATTRACTED NATIONAL ATTENTION WHILE ANGERING SOME IN THE INDUSTRY. HIS 
VISIBILITY HAS FUELED SPECULATION THAT HE'LL JUMP INTO THE RACE FOR GOVERNOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Tom Gallagher, the state's insurance commissioner and treasurer, thrives on 
adversity. 
</P>
<P>
 He has seen plenty during his six years in office: Hurricane Andrew, insurance 
company collapses and, most recently, a scandal at Metropolitan Life Insurance 
Co. that resulted in a record settlement to policyholders. 
</P>
<P>
 Through it all Gallagher has maintained a high-profile style that has 
attracted national attention. He also has angered some insurers and fueled 
speculation that he'll jump into the race for governor -- one of the nation's 
highest-profile political positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallagher, whose boyish good looks belie his 50 years, maintains he's simply 
watching out for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we find that they're not being treated right, we do something about it," 
he said in a recent interview. "It's just that simple. It's not any big deal. 
It's not like, 'Hey, we're big heroes.' We do what we're hired to do." 
</P>
<P>
 But in this election year, every move Gallagher makes raises questions about 
his political ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallagher, however, said he won't decide on whether to seek the Republican 
gubernatorial nomination until after the legislative session ends in April. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, he is traveling the state pushing for a penny increase to the 
6-cent sales tax to raise money for new prison beds and to pay for other 
crime-fighting measures. 
</P>
<P>
 A tax hike is anathema to most Republicans, but Gallagher maintains it's the 
only way to fulfill the promises politicians are making. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has shown he doesn't mind going right straight at it," said state Sen. 
Curt Kiser, a longtime friend and supporter. "He does what he thinks is right 
and lets the chips fall where they may." 
</P>
<P>
 When Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. agreed earlier this month to pay as much 
as $100 million in fines and refunds for deceptive sales practices, it was the 
latest headline-producing coup for Gallagher. 
</P>
<P>
 His agency's investigation into the sales fraud resulted in the largest 
settlement of its kind with the nation's second-largest life insurer. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the MetLife scandal, Gallagher has attracted attention, though 
some of it wasn't his own creation and not all has been positive. 
</P>
<P>
 When insurance companies wanted to flee the state after Hurricane Andrew left 
$16 billion in insured damages to south Florida in August, 1992, Gallagher 
barred them from doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurers accused him of exceeding his authority, but the strategy worked. It 
gave Gallagher and state lawmakers time to devise a plan to cap the number of 
customers that insurers could cancel and establish a state-created insurance 
plan for people who couldn't find conventional coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, one insurer sued Gallagher and accused him of slandering the company. 
Gallagher had accused Golden Rule Insurance Co. of "bait-and-switch" tactics in 
the sale of its Medicare supplement insurance. A trial is scheduled for 
December in Leon County Circuit Court. 
</P>
<P>
 One potential embarrassment for Gallagher was erased recently when the Florida 
Department of Law Enforcement said it found no evidence of wrongdoing by 
Gallagher or his subordinates, who were accused in 1991 of accepting bribes to 
protect a failing insurer. 
</P>
<P>
 The collapse of International Forum of Florida of Longwood in 1990 had left 
more than 7,000 policyholders with $16 million in unpaid medical bills. Company 
officials lied to regulators about the firm's financial condition, but 
Gallagher said he didn't learn about the problems until the insurer was 
insolvent. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Gallagher reorganized his department. "We started off with some 
rocky roads. We had to change some of the things we did," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some contend Gallagher hasn't done enough to protect consumers, although they 
stop short of criticizing him too sharply. 
</P>
<P>
 "We deserve a better insurance system than we have, and it's time for a 
change," said Karen Gievers, a Miami trial lawyer who is seeking the Democratic 
nomination for insurance commissioner. "I'm not running against him. I want to 
get in there and fix the system." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Wilmington, Del., and the oldest of eight children, Gallagher moved to 
Miami in 1961 to attend the University of Miami, where he earned his degree in 
business administration. He served two years in the Army, including the 
presidential honor guard, before beginning his career in the mortgage insurance 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 He was elected to the Florida House in 1974 and served until 1986 when he made 
his first run for governor. He lost in the GOP primary to Bob Martinez, who 
went on to win the general election. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, Martinez appointed Gallagher to head the state agency that regulates 
doctors, engineers and other professionals. In 1988, Gallagher was elected 
insurance commissioner and treasurer. He was reelected in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first things he did after election to the $94,040-a-year job was 
redecorate his Capitol offices in Ralph Lauren wallpaper. (Gallagher's net 
worth exceeded $1 million in 1992, mostly from real estate investments.) 
</P>
<P>
 If he runs for governor, Gallagher, who is divorced, expects his marital 
status to be an issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't thought about it as much, I'm sure, as my opponents have," he said. 
"I'm sure they say, 'Oh man, I just can't wait to have an opportunity to use 
Gallagher being single against him.' If they're going to make it an issue, they 
can make it an issue. You are what you are." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallagher would face a GOP field filled with Miami businessman Jeb Bush, son 
of the former president; former state Senate president Ander Crenshaw; 
Secretary of State Jim Smith; Tallahassee trial lawyer Ken Connor and a handful 
of lesser-known candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner will face Democratic Gov. Lawton Chiles.

BLOOD, BITTERNESS AND THE BALLOT; AMID UNENDING VIOLENCE, POLITICAL CHAOS AND 
VOTER CONFUSION, NELSON MANDELA AND FREDERIK DE KLERK CAMPAIGN FOR THE 
PRESIDENCY, AND A NEW SOUTH AFRICA

 The sky is cloudless and the summer sun is scorching. Thousands of blacks have 
packed a soccer stadium in Maokeng, a dusty sprawl of matchbox homes and 
tin-roofed shanties. Beside the field, a crowd is squashed inside a chain-link 
fence, and crying children are passed back over a sea of heads to safety. Other 
people hang on trees and fences, or cling to lampposts. The rickety stands are 
jammed, and above them on the roof, dozens of youths are doing the toyi-toyi, 
the stomping, high-kicking dance of liberation. Suddenly, half the tin roof 
rips and collapses, dumping shrieking dancers onto the people and benches 
below. Wailing ambulances and honking trucks soon carry 30 bruised and bloodied 
people to the hospital. The survivors simply move onto the other half of the 
roof and the frenzied war dance continues. 
</P>
<P>
 Then pandemonium sweeps the stadium. Nelson Mandela is approaching! The next 
president! Perched in the back of a pickup truck, the legendary leader of the 
African National Congress waves and grins as the ecstatic mob surges around his 
feet. Their hands reach up, hoping for a touch; one grizzled, gray-haired man 
appears to weep at the sight. "He is like a god," the man says before he is 
swept away in the crush of the crowd. As Mandela mounts the stage, they wave 
their fists and roar in delight. Amandla! Power! 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela tells of his last visit to this township outside Kroonstad in January, 
1952. "I collided with a young boy on his bicycle, a white boy, with my car. He 
wasn't hurt, but I stopped my car. A drunk police sergeant, a white man, came 
up." He switches from English to Afrikaans for the punch-line. "He said, 
'Kaffir, I'm gonna make you shit!' I said, 'Sergeant, when I do that, I don't 
need instructions from a drunken white sergeant.' I was expecting to be 
assaulted, the coward that I am. But it seemed to deflate him. And that made me 
braver." A broad grin crinkles his face as wild cheers and laughter echo across 
the township. 
</P>
<P>
 Another day, another rally, this one halfway across the country: President 
Frederik W. de Klerk also rides a pickup into a raggedy soccer stadium, his 
bald head glinting in the sun. He's in Postdene, a mixed-race township outside 
Kimberley. Many mixed-race voters are sympathetic to De Klerk's ruling National 
Party, if only because they fear they will suffer under black rule. Unlike 
Mandela, De Klerk has no raised stage, no portable toilets, no giant banners, 
no tall banks of booming speakers. His voice is tinny, rasping through small 
speakers set on the small truck's hood. The crowd, perhaps a few hundred 
people, is wary, surly, nervous. A few hold small flags, but the president is 
met in stony silence. His security men are jittery. Something is wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, chaos. Several dozen blacks with ANC posters run across the field 
straight for De Klerk. They rip down a National Party banner, then grab and 
shred posters and paper flags. A wild shoving match ensues beside the truck. A 
plainclothes cop grabs a protester's shirt and yanks a knife away. "Don't touch 
me," the man screams. De Klerk scowls as hecklers drown him out with ANC 
chants. A hail of stones and wadded-up paper fills the air and something hits 
the president under his left ear. He flinches, more in surprise than pain, but 
bravely stays erect behind a tight circle of bodyguards as the truck lurches 
away. "Goodby, De Klerk, goodby!" jeers the laughing crowd. "Away, De Klerk, 
away!" 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, armored vehicles rumble in with flak-jacketed riot police 
clutching assault rifles. The crowd scatters, pounding De Klerk's motorcade 
with their fists and pelting photographers with stones. Police deploy outside 
the township entrance with snarling dogs and huge coils of razor wire. A black 
organizer for the aborted rally is terrified to go home. "I'm not safe there," 
he says, pleading for a place to sleep, a place to hide. De Klerk tells the 
press afterward, "We will not cringe, we will not run away." Later, an aide 
scouts the site of the day's final rally in a nearby black township. He comes 
back breathless. A white man, the son of a local National Party leader, has 
emptied a pistol into another mob of stone-throwing protesters, killing a black 
woman. De Klerk cancels the rally. 
</P>
<P>
 With South Africa's First Free Elections Only Days Away, the country is a 
tense, tenuous place, unsure whether it is headed for war or peace. The past is 
riven with hate, suffering and the bitter divisions of apartheid. The present 
is filled with violence, intimidation and fear. And the future is a dream of 
multiracial democracy. When balloting starts April 26, the black majority will 
vote and run their own country for the first time since Dutch merchant Jan van 
Riebeeck built the initial white settlement at Cape Town in 1652 and started a 
legacy of harsh white rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the official, enforced segregation of races has ended, South Africa 
remains a land of separate and unequal societies. The 5.1 million whites 
dominate 30.6 million blacks, 3.4 million "Colored," or mixed race, and 1 
million Indians. Under apartheid, blacks were denied citizenship, decent 
schooling or health care. Millions were confined to squalid reservations called 
homelands. The rest lived in townships, usually sprawling slums and 
smoke-filled shantytowns with no electricity, running water or paved roads. 
Most blacks still live in those appalling conditions. Nearly half have no 
formal job, and cannot read or write. Black incomes are barely one-tenth those 
of whites. Black infant mortality is eight times that of whites. One in 20 
black children dies before age 5.  
</P>
<P>
 In November, a typhoid epidemic affected more than 1,500 blacks in the 
squatter camp of Botleng. Less than an hour from downtown Johannesburg, Botleng 
has no sewage system, simply buckets that are dumped on rotting garbage heaps. 
The roads are ankle-deep in mire and muck. Drinking water comes from rusty 
street taps or muddy puddles. Two miles away stands the posh white town of 
Delmas, with manicured lawns, tree-shaded streets and BMWs. It also has a 
hospital that refused to admit typhoid-stricken black children, shipping them 
to another medical facility 20 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 But profound change is coming. The government is beginning to return land to 
blacks who were removed at gunpoint from their farms and dumped in desolate 
areas because their property was a "black spot" in "white areas." Schools and 
neighborhoods are slowly, reluctantly, opening their doors. State media is no 
longer the government mouthpiece. And most important, history is about to be 
reversed. The whites who have ruled with racial tyranny are about to hand power 
over to blacks who were mostly in prison or in exile only four years ago. Even 
more astonishing, the ANC and the National Party, black and white, are 
delivering black liberation through a "negotiated revolution," not all-out war. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela is virtually certain to win and win big. ANC polls show a solid base 
of 55%, but the vote could go much higher. For the 16 million to 18 million 
blacks who are expected to cast ballots for the first time, the election is not 
about who offers the best housing or fiscal policies. The largest poll ever 
done here -- sponsored by the Matla Trust, the nation's largest voter-education 
group -- was clear on that much. "What was the most important reason to vote? 
Freedom!" says poll director Susan Booysen, analyzing the results of interviews 
with more than 8,000 people. "Freedom was more important than jobs, better 
government, or a better life." 
</P>
<P>
 The hard part, of course, comes after the voting. Except for race, little here 
is black and white. Just as communism suppressed ethnic tensions in Eastern 
Europe for 40 odd years, apartheid overshadowed other animosities here. The new 
South Africa promises to be a pressure cooker of racial, ethnic and political 
tensions, with schisms between black and white, rich and poor, urban and rural 
and, of course, black and black. Bitter grievances between the two largest 
tribes, the Zulus and Xhosas, over issues of land, cattle, power and politics, 
have fueled a savage spiral of violence over the last four years. So have 
battles between rival groups of Zulus. Rogue police officials, seeking to 
weaken the ANC, have contributed to the carnage. At least 15,000 people -- 
nearly all of them black -- have been burned, shot or hacked to death since 
1990. The murder rate in what Mandela calls the world's most violent country is 
10 times that of America. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only certainty about the situation is that the system of apartheid will 
go," says Colin Eglin, a leader of the tiny Democratic Party. "The uncertainty 
is what kind of system will be put in its place." 
</P>
<P>
 Minefields already abound. A low-intensity civil war is raging between ANC 
supporters and their rivals in the Inkatha Freedom Party in Zulu strongholds of 
Natal province. More than 290 people were killed and hundreds wounded there 
last month, a sad new record that forced the government to declare a 
province-wide state of emergency. The powerful Zulu leader, Chief Mangosuthu G. 
Buthelezi, who heads both Inkatha and the KwaZulu homeland, wants greater local 
autonomy. Prickly and petulant, he has sworn to boycott the elections, ignore 
the constitution and fight an ANC-dominated regime. 
</P>
<P>
 So has a motley alliance of rabid white racists. It is easy to ridicule 
blustering bullies and buffoons like Eugene Terre'Blanche (headline writers 
call him E.T.), head of the neo-fascist Afrikaner Resistance Movement, and 
their belligerent demands for a secessionist white state. It's not so easy to 
ignore their threats to wreck the election and sabotage the new black-led 
government. Their claim of 60,000 ready-to-fight supporters is absurd, but a 
handful of dedicated terrorists can create havoc. Witness Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 And many blacks fear the consequences of unfulfilled political promises. 
Mandela is partly to blame. Although he routinely warns against "exaggerated 
expectations," he also vows that "each and every person would be entitled to 
housing like the whites have now." At each rally, he dutifully repeats the 
ANC's ambitious platform: to build 1 million homes, to create 2.5 million jobs, 
to provide electric power for 2.5 million homes, to guarantee 10 years of free 
schooling and free health care for children and much, much more. 
</P>
<P>
 Laudable goals, of course. But realistic? Not any time soon. "For us to turn 
the country around, it will take decades and decades," warns Tokyo Sexwale, a 
regional ANC leader. Olga Chauke, a young black woman who runs voter education 
workshops in the western Transvaal, agrees. "People think after the election, 
they'll get big houses and a Mercedes-Benz. And people believe that! I blame 
the politicians. They lie to the people." 
</P>
<P>
 Several scenarios are possible after democracy finally dawns in the world's 
most racially polarized country. The first, discussed endlessly in the press 
and nervously at dinner parties, is apocalypse. It goes like this: Backed by 
white army officers, right-wing terror squads sabotage power stations, bomb 
factories and assassinate black leaders. The bloodletting in Natal erupts into 
wholesale slaughter. Angry young blacks riot in the cities and leafy white 
suburbs, seeking new homes, cars and revenge. Wealthy whites flee, the civil 
service crumbles, foreign investors stay home and Africa's largest and 
strongest economy collapses. 
</P>
<P>
 The next scenario is less pessimistic. The ANC wins a landslide, taking 
two-thirds of the vote. They run roughshod over political foes in the so-called 
government of national unity. Security forces crack down on black and white 
extremists, jailing thousands without trial and declaring a state of emergency. 
The Communist Party, the ANC's longtime partner, asserts itself with a 
vengeance, and the government nationalizes mines, banks and factories. After 
four decades of oppressive rule by the white National Party, authoritarian 
blacks in the ANC take charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet another version is more hopeful. Pride and exhilaration sweep the land 
after a huge election turnout. Vote-related violence is localized and doesn't 
derail the May 10 inauguration. President Mandela's pleas for racial tolerance 
and peace are respected. Security forces stay loyal, and white extremists are 
marginalized into small hate groups, like the Ku Klux Klan. A majority of Zulus 
vote ANC, and turmoil subsides in Natal. A Constitutional Court keeps the new 
rulers in check. Foreign investors, governments and international agencies pump 
in billions to show support. The first McDonald's opens.  
</P>
<P>
 The last scenario, or some version of it, seems the most probable. Time and 
time again since De Klerk released Mandela from 27 years in prison in 1990, 
launching the nation on the bloodstained path to democracy, South Africa has 
teetered on the brink of catastrophe -- and turned back. The country is 
resilient and the center has held. It may take generations, as it has in 
America, for hate-filled minds to change, for decent schools and jobs programs 
to take hold, and for real opportunities to emerge. And as in America, bitter 
battles lie ahead in small towns and local school boards. But barring an 
unforeseen disaster, the birth of the new South Africa stands a good chance of 
succeeding. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in a glittering tuxedo, with a thin mustache and a fast patter, Aubrey 
Welsch is teaching South Africa how to vote. Welsch hosts a new Saturday night 
TV quiz show called "It's Your Vote!" It offers "fabulous prizes," a catchy 
jingle and Jessica, the ever-smiling assistant in a black sequined minidress. 
Mike, a plumber, is the contestant tonight. The first question: How many people 
are allowed to enter a voting booth? Mike ponders the possible answers (no 
limit, one or three), and the prizes (a refrigerator, microwave or video game 
gadget) before venturing "one." 
</P>
<P>
 Then come more questions about voting procedures. Finally, Welsch turns to 
five "voters" from the studio audience. Each must mark a ballot on whether they 
think Mike's answers are correct. "It's a secret vote," Welsch says, then turns 
to the camera. "That's right, folks, the vote is totally secret. So Mike won't 
know who voted for him. But he has to accept the vote. And it'll be the same in 
the elections. Your vote will be totally secret. And whichever party wins, 
everyone has to accept it. That's democracy!"  
</P>
<P>
 Television otherwise plays a small role in this election -- political ads have 
been banned so rich parties can't dominate the airwaves. And most of the 100 or 
so other voter education programs are more mundane. Unions, churches, factories 
and non-governmental groups hold mock elections and training sessions to teach 
people to vote who have never voted before. It's a critical task. Experts fear 
that millions of votes may be accidentally invalidated, undermining the 
legitimacy of the final tally and the authority of the new government. Many of 
the uneducated rural voters may be too frightened, or too confused, to mark the 
ballot correctly.  
</P>
<P>
 It's easy to see why. South Africa's first free elections are not simple. Some 
26 parties are running. The ballot for the 400-seat National Assembly alone 
will be longer than a newspaper page. Each of the nine new provinces will have 
a separate second ballot for their provincial assemblies. Many of the parties 
are brand-new and virtually unknown, and one is so poor its phones were 
recently disconnected for lack of payment. But under a system of proportional 
representation, any party could win a seat or two. And any party that wins 5% 
of the total vote will be guaranteed a place in the Cabinet of the new 
government of national unity. Win 20% and you get to be a deputy president. 
Fabulous prizes! 
</P>
<P>
 The Independent Electoral Commission is in charge. The 16-member panel must 
certify if the election is "substantially free and fair," a term that clearly 
covers a lot of ground. The chairman, Judge Johann Kriegler, outlined the 
still-evolving election plans over lunch recently. Up to 300,000 workers and 
monitors will be assigned to 9,000 polling stations. Another 1,800 United 
Nations monitors, plus more than 1,000 international observers, will watch for 
trouble and fraud. Countless volunteers are coming from colleges, churches and 
peace groups around the world. So are 10 chartered jumbo jets loaded with 80 
million ballots being printed in England, enough so no polling station runs 
out. Officials say no single South African printing company could ensure 
production, delivery or security for such a large order. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most countries, South Africa has prepared no voters' roll, so the 22.7 
million eligible voters can go to any polling station anywhere in the country. 
Voters' hands will be dipped in ink that shows under ultraviolet light to 
ensure no one votes twice. The voting itself will take three days. To maintain 
security, the army and police have canceled leaves and called up reservists. 
Virtually every police officer and soldier in the country will be assigned to 
guard against intimidation at the polls or to ride shotgun when the sealed 
ballot boxes are moved overnight to local jail cells or bank vaults. The boxes 
will finally go to 90,000 "enumerators" at 1,091 counting posts -- one for 
every 10 polling stations -- so no one will know how a single community voted. 
"We fear reprisals," Kriegler says. "We've told people 'your vote is secret.' 
What if we then announce you're the only ANC village in, say, an Inkatha zone?" 
</P>
<P>
 The same fear has led the electoral commission to ban exit polls, even by 
foreign TV networks. "We've told people, 'No one can ever know how you voted 
and your vote is secret,"' he says. "And then you come out of your voting 
station and there's a man, a white man at that, with a foreign accent, asking 
for whom you voted. We'd be a laughingstock given all the promises we made."  
</P>
<P>
 Tom Lodge, a political scientist at the University of the Witwatersrand in 
Johannesburg, takes a caustic view of all this. If the ANC meets its goal of 
winning 67% of the vote, Lodge notes, it will have the legal majority in 
Parliament. It could then rewrite the current interim constitution without 
considering the concerns of smaller parties, among other things. Lodge finds 
that prospect worrisome: "Remember, the ANC is a relatively recent convert to 
liberal democracy." 
</P>
<P>
 But so are nervous whites like Cornelis Serfontein, a lanky 48-year-old farmer 
in the right-wing stronghold of Potchefstroom. Like many of the 3 million 
Afrikaners, descendants of the early Dutch and French pioneers, he is caught in 
a dilemma. He has lived his entire life in a land where white power, prestige 
and privilege were guaranteed. He served 15 years as local vice chairman of the 
National Party, presiding during the most brutal years of the apartheid era. 
But, like his country, he has changed. He resigned his party post recently, and 
his story pours out of him with passion and pain. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more enlightened Afrikaner is caught between the right-wing forces," 
Serfontein says. "And if you move to the left, you're in danger. If I stand up 
today in Afrikaner company and say I am leaning toward the ANC, I'm totally cut 
off and isolated. And my children are intimidated. You must look after your 
family. We have nowhere to go. Make no mistake. We're born and bred South 
Africans." 
</P>
<P>
 He pauses, then adds, "The National Party has had no opposition since 1948. 
There was a lot of corruption. We can't argue that away. We always say look at 
corruption in the rest of black Africa. But the corruption here was only more 
refined. It's unreal what we have done to our country." He grows quiet as 
several whites pass on the street, then resumes. "I can say I probably won't 
vote for the ANC. But I can see in the future, when I see how they run the 
economy, then I might. I want to see a better standard of living for 
everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps 3,000 people attend the Feb. 2 kickoff of the national Party campaign. 
They fill the hangar-like hall at the World Trade Center outside Johannesburg, 
where the interim constitution was adopted and signed last December after 
exhausting, exciting round-the-clock talks. Tonight, however, the hall has all 
the thrill of a physics lecture. Delegates and party workers sit stiffly at 
long tables, quietly waiting for something to start. Several hundred mixed-race 
supporters pack the back of the hall. But the majority of the non-revelers are 
the red-faced, overfed Afrikaners that the party has long attracted. A six-man, 
all-white brass band blares "When the Saints Go Marching In." 
</P>
<P>
 A black preacher suddenly takes the stage. "Viva De Klerk! Viva!" he shouts 
several times, thrusting his fist into the air. The audience looks nervous -- 
"viva" is a standard ANC chant. A few shout back, but the chants are stillborn. 
Still, it is nothing to what follows. The band pulls out new sheet music, and 
lyrics flash on giant screens at the front of the hall. And then it begins, an 
excruciating attempt in the name of national unity to sing "Nkosi Sikelel'i 
Afrika," the call-and-response hymn that has become Africa's chief liberation 
anthem. Sung at every ANC rally, it is a haunting tune that thunders out of 
stadiums and echoes across the townships. Every black schoolchild knows the 
words. Here, the audience struggles to read the Xhosa words on the oversized 
cue cards and follow a tune that the band, clearly unfamiliar with the music, 
tries to play with a polka beat. 
</P>
<P>
 Later I mention this incident with a laugh to one of De Klerk's advisers. He 
sighs. "People are in shock," he says. "You have to remember Afrikaners come 
from a religious culture where public dancing was frowned upon. They're staid, 
conservative, very disciplined and organized. And they're uncomfortable with 
all this public stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Jan Bosman, another aide, agrees. "The National Party is more used to City 
Hall meetings, with all the people sitting down, all very dressed up and 
polite," he says. "You started with a prayer, had a long-winded address by the 
president, then tea and cookies. All very formal and polite. And, of course, 
all white." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course. And that's the problem. First elected in 1948, the National Party 
invented and institutionalized apartheid and used every power of a police 
state, including torture and murder, to enforce its dictums. It still has all 
the powers of the state -- cars, phones, police and the like. But it can't hope 
to win enough votes to become a respectable opposition party unless it can 
appeal to the people who have the most reason to resent them -- blacks. Polls 
show black support for De Klerk in the low single digits. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, De Klerk's uphill campaign is more interesting in some ways than 
Mandela's. As a fourth-generation Afrikaner politician, De Klerk is member of a 
family that was partly responsible for the horrors of apartheid. No one 
expected him to be different. The young lawyer went to Parliament in 1972 and 
quickly joined the verkrampte, or hard-line wing of the party. As education 
minister in the mid-1980s, he never publicly questioned the policy of providing 
only substandard schools for blacks. To this day, he has never said apartheid 
was wrong, only that it didn't work and he's sorry for the misery it caused. 
</P>
<P>
 But De Klerk's nobler side began to show after his party narrowly elected him 
president in August, 1989. "Our goal is a totally changed South Africa," he 
said when he took office. Six months later, he released Mandela from prison, 
legalized the ANC and other black opposition parties and began official 
desegregation. The uncertain march from apartheid to democracy had begun. The 
next few years saw tortuous on-again, off-again negotiations between the ANC, 
the government and 24 other parties. The result has been not only the new 
constitution, but a black-dominated transitional executive council that has 
become a virtual shadow government. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, De Klerk, 58, remains far more popular than his party. So he tells 
voters that he heads the "new National Party." There's a new slogan ("We've 
made the change!"), a new logo and flag (the pastel design was reviewed by 
traditional black witch doctors) and a new message of atonement. They even 
hired spin doctors, Lowe Bell Communications, whose London-based directors have 
advised leaders from Margaret Thatcher to Billy Graham. The consultants studied 
election returns from other African countries. They commissioned focus groups, 
opinion surveys, heavy media buys and tracking polls.  
</P>
<P>
 The results? A majority of blacks think the party is still all white and still 
in favor of apartheid. And something else. "There was a perception that De 
Klerk lived in an ivory tower, that he was strait-laced, that he had no 
understanding or concern for the way poor people lived," says Chris Fismer, a 
senior aide. "It was not true, but that was the perception." 
</P>
<P>
 Enter a new De Klerk, clad in polo shirts instead of suits, and ever willing 
to pose with tribal robes, spears and shields. At a seaside lunch of grilled 
lobsters at Lambert's Bay, aides huddle as the relaxed, open-collar candidate 
drinks a glass of red wine and smokes a Lexington cigarette. The aides decide 
that he should sit on a rough-hewn log, with his back to the white-capped 
ocean, for a news conference. "Make him look like a man of the people, all that 
stuff," one says. I ask if it really matters, given the party's other problems. 
"Most people don't care," he replies with a laugh. "We could put him up against 
a skull and crossbones and people wouldn't care." 
</P>
<P>
 But De Klerk cares. "There's a request for a photo opportunity," he says after 
the news conference. "Does it still exist?" The photographers, of course, say 
yes. So De Klerk strides to the water's edge. He dips his hand in the surf and 
stares pensively out to sea. After a moment, he slowly turns and walks down the 
lonely sand. The cameras click furiously. "Enough?" he asks. It is reminiscent 
of the famous photo of Richard Nixon walking the beach in his wingtips. 
</P>
<P>
 De Klerk has taken several tips from Nixon's handbook. He appeals to the 
"silent majority" in his speeches, isn't above packing his crowds with 
government workers and plainclothes security men and is running a law-and-order 
campaign. He demonizes the ANC as "secretly controlled by Communists, militants 
and extremists" dedicated to using violence. It's a tricky strategy. For one 
thing, De Klerk has spent the last four years trying to convince terrified 
whites that Mandela and the ANC can be trusted. The other problem is he's at 
least partly right: angry black protesters try to disrupt nearly every township 
rally he holds. He's been spit on, shoved and shouted down. 
</P>
<P>
 I join De Klerk as he barnstorms a dozen forlorn farming and fishing towns in 
a desolate, wind-swept area of the Western Cape. South Africa is almost twice 
the size of Texas, and here the landscape has the same rolling hills, dusty 
plains and vast emptiness with two-lane blacktops stretching to the horizon. 
Mixed-race voters predominate, and polls show many are undecided. So at each 
stop, De Klerk fans fears of blacks and Communists, then promises that he will 
stand up to the ANC. "They burn houses and destroy schools," he says. "They are 
the breakers. We are the builders." And at nearly each stop, young ANC 
protesters oblige by ruining his rallies. 
</P>
<P>
 The first stop is in Atlantis, built on empty sand dunes 18 years ago for 
mixed-race families forced out of Cape Town by the mad social engineers of 
apartheid. About 40 ANC protesters chant and boo as De Klerk shouts to be heard 
inside a small hall. "I think it's a disgrace he wants to enter this town," 
complains Rachel Visser, a local ANC activist. "They forced us to live here. We 
don't have money for food, our schools don't have books and now the factories 
are closing. And he wants our vote." 
</P>
<P>
 But Diane Cupido, a 29-year-old unemployed woman, proudly holds a De Klerk 
poster nearby. "The reason I support the National Party is blacks want to take 
revenge," she says. "They all went to prison and now they want revenge." 
</P>
<P>
 By the fourth stop, at a street rally in tiny Vredenburg, dozens of blacks 
have gathered to dance and shout. Beefy security men lock arms to try to hold 
them back. "Go to hell, De Klerk," the mob chants, drowning out his speech. 
Finally, they rush his sound truck. An armored personnel carrier quickly 
rumbles up and an all-white squad of riot police jumps out with shotguns, 
assault rifles and tear gas. The crowd eyes them nervously as De Klerk's BMW 
drives off. 
</P>
<P>
 Then shouts echo up the street. A police van in the convoy has clipped a 
protester, then sideswiped a photographer's car. The driver never stopped. An 
angry crowd quickly surrounds the black hit-and-run victim. "They've killed 
him! They've killed him!" one woman shouts hysterically. Pushing closer, I can 
see the man on his back, but he's talking and in no obvious discomfort. An 
ambulance quickly carts him off. Both sides, it seems, are satisfied. The local 
ANC gets a martyr, another black victim of white brutality. And De Klerk gets 
another picture in the paper of dangerous ANC intimidation.  
</P>
<P>
 ANC strategy, in contrast, seems simple: blame others for the violence, rein 
in its hooligans and convince voters, and the world, that it is ready to govern 
a nation of 40 million people with a giant economy and an untested 
constitution. "We must behave as people who are fit to govern," Mandela told a 
recent rally in Kimberly, "people who have a sense of responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 So the ANC uses advertisements and rallies to underscore the message that the 
former revolutionary movement and guerrilla army is, indeed, prepared. Each 
week, it runs full-page newspaper ads with detailed plans to build schools, 
homes and communities. Stanley Greenberg oversees the ANC polls and 
communication strategy when he isn't working for his other chief client, 
President Clinton. I ask whether voters read the ads. "It's reinforcing that 
they have a plan to address problems," he says. "It's not in the details. It's 
in the belief that the plan is there." 
</P>
<P>
 Just as Clinton peddled copies of his campaign's economic plan, the ANC urges 
people to send for the party's manifesto, called "A Better Life for All." And 
just as Clinton used "town meetings," Mandela conducts regular "people's 
forums" to answer questions about everything from police brutality to crumbling 
hospitals. His bodyguards were trained by U.S. State Department security 
agents, but no American presidential candidate ever got the frenzied, adoring, 
star-struck crowds that Mandela routinely draws. This election, after all, is 
their own liberation.  
</P>
<P>
 A rally in Ikageng, in the western Transvaal, is typical. The whole township 
turns out, not just to see him, but to celebrate. Thousands of people line 
rooftops, cling to lampposts and stand shoulder-to-shoulder along the dirt 
roads. Drum majorettes, in white satin and gold braid, march to thumping drums 
and blaring trumpets. Teen-agers dance to a reggae band. Women ululate and sing 
praises to Mandela. Former guerrillas, and at least one tiny toddler, proudly 
wear camouflage fatigues. The crowd spills out of the packed stands and surges 
past the hapless guards, shoving and shouting in cathartic glee. Euphoria fills 
the air.  
</P>
<P>
 But as often happens, it fizzles when Mandela speaks. He's stiff, wooden, and 
prone to lecturing the audience. He drones on about crime, reading a long list 
of statistics -- so many dead since 1984, so many murders a day, so many 
robberies, so many gun licenses issued and so on. Then onto collective 
bargaining, a breakdown of the education budget, pension reform and the new 
Constitutional Court. He speaks in English, which some Tswana-speakers clearly 
don't understand. People soon begin drifting out. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, at 75, Mandela has a regal bearing and unflappable dignity. He is trim 
and fit, although he wears a hearing aid and special socks for a circulation 
problem. But unlike De Klerk, image is no problem. At one rally, women draped a 
purple blanket on his shoulders and gave him a padded rocking chair. He 
arranged the robe so it hung over one shoulder and wrapped around his waist. He 
sat in the chair, as erect as on a throne, the very picture of the royal Thembu 
chief he was raised to be. 
</P>
<P>
 He enjoys recounting those early years. Helicoptering into tiny Mqekezweni, he 
takes reporters into a round grass hut with a floor of smeared cow dung where 
he had lived as a child. Outside, he says with a grin, "It was here I made my 
first love to a young lady. So you can see how important this area is for me." 
</P>
<P>
 He talks, too, of his long, lonely years as a political prisoner: of learning 
of the death of his mother, Nosekeni, in 1968, and his eldest son, Thembi, in a 
car crash a year later. He was forbidden to attend the funerals. "I was deeply 
hurt that I could not pay my last respects to either my mother or my son. I 
could not share my pain with anyone," he says during a visit to his former cell 
at Robben Island. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all the memories are bad. He has built a four-bedroom vacation house 
modeled exactly on the prison warder's home he occupied during his last two 
years of incarceration. And he still rises at dawn, exercises and makes his bed 
as he did in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The stern authority and paternal presence that saw him through prison are 
visible on the campaign trail. He publicly rebukes his staff for mismanaging 
campaign events. And he is furious that De Klerk and the National Party claim 
credit for ending apartheid. "The people are shunning the National Party like 
lepers, which they are," he says angrily at Zambela, another township. "They 
are still a racist party that clings in one way or another to the policies of 
racial discrimination." And later, he mocks De Klerk for complaining about the 
hecklers. "South Africa has got robust politics and sissies should not address 
political meetings."  
</P>
<P>
 But Mandela also can be a loose cannon. In recent weeks, he has said that 
right-wing whites would be able to vote for a self-ruled state. Then he said it 
wasn't certain that an ANC leader -- him, in other words -- must be president. 
Finally he told Dutch TV he might resign after a year as president and let a 
younger man finish the next four years. Each time, his aides quickly 
backpedaled and described his recorded comments as a joke, a misunderstanding 
or a misquote. 
</P>
<P>
 As president, Mandela will inherit staggering social and economic problems. 
Life for many South Africans has grown worse since he was released from jail. A 
culture of criminal violence rages in the townships. Black schooling has 
virtually collapsed. The economy is mired in the longest and deepest recession 
in decades. And the new democracy will be a fractious collection of competing 
interest groups. Young, aggressive politicians will be on the make in the new 
national and provincial assemblies. Some of Mandela's strongest supporters -- 
the Communists, trade unions, even his estranged and militant wife, Winnie -- 
may become albatrosses once he's in power. 
</P>
<P>
 How will he manage? Post-colonial Africa is littered with the shattered dreams 
and ruined economies left by charismatic, nationalist heroes who were unable to 
rule. To avoid their fate, Mandela must steer a careful course between black 
expectations and white fears, between revolutionary zeal and government abuses. 
His closest aides, people like ANC Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa, 41, and 
party chairman Thabo Mbeki, 51, will play a key role. The challenge is immense, 
but there are many reasons for hope. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the end, Mandela's hectic campaign schedule shows how miraculous this 
election is. On most days, he skips the wealthy white enclaves, with their 
Mercedeses and back-yard swimming pools, that have always run South Africa. 
Instead, he heads for the wretched townships, the miserable mining camps and 
sad squatter settlements -- neglected, impoverished, often unmarked, and always 
out of sight of the white minority. 
</P>
<P>
 And when the unmistakable gray-haired figure arrives, with his beaming smile 
and infectious enthusiasm, he's greeted as a martyr, a hero, a symbol of 
freedom and leader of liberation. His aura and appeal are almost religious. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela obviously agrees. "All of you, without exception, are my flesh and 
blood," he tells a crowd at one recent rally. "Your aspirations are my 
aspirations. Your victory is my victory." The cheers are deafening.

RIDE 'EM, CHARRO; A NEW GENERATION PERFECTS THE MEXICAN ART OF CHARRERIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES ROSE , Los Angeles-based filmmaker/photographer Thomas R. Dey is 
working on a documentary titled Charros. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is considered a supreme test of man's dominance over animals, yet it is 
more an interplay of style and beauty than of strength and speed, as much 
equestrian ballet as rodeo. At lienzos (arenas) across the American Southwest, 
including regular weekend meetings at the Pico Rivera Sports Arena and the 
Riverside Charros arena in Colton, hundreds take part in charreria , a popular 
performance sport that embodies 500 years of Mexican horsemanship, tradition 
and pride.  
</P>
<P>
 Similar to rodeo, it is a contest of specific skills: Two or more teams of at 
least 15 charros compete in suertes (events) such as individual horse reining, 
bull and bronc riding and team roping. Using a complex body of rules, judges 
evaluate charros on details such as the perfection of a lasso throw or whether 
the charro remembers to slap the steer on the backside before felling it with a 
twist of the tail. Even the costume -- sombrero, chaps, boots, vest, handwoven 
belt, jacket, shirt with upright collar, snug pants and tie -- is painstakingly 
evaluated. Any imperfection, such as wearing bright colors or forgetting one's 
chaps, can lower a score. 
</P>
<P>
 At a charreada in Cuyama in Santa Barbara County, the announcer competes with 
the banda music spilling from a platform above the bleachers. " Que lastima " 
(What a pity!), he cries whenever a charro fails. But when a charro does lasso 
the legs of a wild mare or perform some other feat successfully, the audience 
cheers, the music grows triumphant and youths twirl matracas , wooden 
noisemakers that click festively.

 "I like watching because I can remember our roots," says Angelia Arias, a 
native of Zacatecas who has lived in California for five years. "It's a way to 
'be' in Mexico, because we don't feel at home in the United States."  
</P>
<P>
 "This is what we love," explains 18-year-old Isabel Rodriguez, a member of an 
escaramuza team called Espuela de Oro. The all-female, vibrantly clad 
escaramuzas do not compete for points but perform complicated equestrian drills 
between suertes . "It's like a family thing, it keeps us away from the street," 
says Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel Gonzales Jr., a 32-year-old Mexican-born charro from the team Rancho 
Grande, learned the sport from his father. Now Gonzales is teaching charro 
skills to his own two sons. "My kids are U.S. citizens, but I would like them 
to know a little bit about their ancestry and heritage," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, however, charreria has come under attack from animal rights 
activists who claim that two of the suertes are abusive. During these events, 
participants on foot or on horseback throw a lasso and attempt to fell a wild 
mare by ensnaring its forelegs. A bill to make these two events illegal was 
recently introduced in the state Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 The charros, however, refuse to bend to the demands of groups they feel have 
no understanding of the charreria tradition, which began in the Mexican 
countryside as a way of celebrating ranching skills. "Anybody who knows about 
animals knows that that's not cruel," says Gonzales. "That's ranch work. That's 
part of life." JAMES ROSE

<P>
 Once upon a time, I had the luck to open a piece of junk mail that changed the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 Not your world, maybe, but mine, though even I didn't know it at the time. At 
the time, all I knew was that I was about to become a $27.95 sucker, thanks to 
an irredeemably cheesy appeal that began: 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Friend, 
</P>
<P>
 As you may already know, we have been doing some work relating to people who 
have the same last name as you do. Finally, after months of work, my new book, 
"The Amazing Story of the Tonellis in America," is ready for printing, and you 
are in it! 
</P>
<P>
 We have spent a great deal of effort and thousands of dollars . . . and have 
located almost every Tonelli family in the United States. My new book features 
this valuable and extensive directory of Tonellis living in America. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Due to the uniqueness of the Tonelli name and the small Tonelli population in 
the U.S., it is economically impossible to produce extra copies after our 
scheduled publishing date. This is the first edition of the book, and it is 
certain to be quite a rare and valuable acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe this is the only book of its kind in the entire world, and you will 
want to have your own copy. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Would you fall for that? Look, I knew I was making an idiotic mail-order 
acquisition -- it was practically a Thighmaster. And when the burgundy 
leatherette-bound, gold-embossed volume arrived, it was bad, but no worse than 
I expected -- with a spurious Tonelli coat of arms (crossed goats over a bed of 
linguini), some very generic advice on how to hang yourself from your family 
tree and, the only part I cared about, the complete directory of Tonellis in 
America. 
</P>
<P>
 Amazing. A Tonelli in Texas! A Tonelli named Abner! And, to my chagrin, only 
two Dr. Tonellis in the whole frigging country. It went on and on that way, 
page after page -- roughly 350 Tonelli households in 22 states, a thousand or 
so individuals, .002% of the American population, give or take. The book listed 
only names and addresses, but for some reason I was spellbound; reading it had 
the same effect as staring at a map: uncompromisingly quotidian at first but 
capable of sucking you into a dream state. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in fact, for months after, the giddy-dread sensation of reading the 
junk-mail book lurked in my thoughts, undigested, unabsorbed, floating to the 
fore at odd times. Once, while riding through New England, I flashed on the 
memory that a great many Tonellis were listed in Massachusetts. There in the 
front seat, intoxicated by velocity, a vagrant urge seized me: Wouldn't it be 
something to get a car and, using the junk-mail book as my guide, drive around 
the country to shake the hand of every Tonelli in America? I saw myself 
steering confidently up to the grassy borders of countless anonymous suburban 
tracts, leaving the engine on, hopping out, ringing the bell and extending a 
paw of kinship past the half-opened storm door to the astonished resident. (" 
You're who? Wait -- let me get the camcorder !" ) Then I'd race back to my 
wheels and peel out to my next visitation. Crazy! The obvious impediments to 
such a spree -- -I hated driving, plus the trip would require a luxurious 
amount of time and money -- didn't occur to me because I knew I'd never 
actually do it.  
</P>
<P>
 Until, of course, I did it. 
</P>
<P>
 "C'mon, I have to hug you if you're a Tonelli," says Denise, wife of Rick 
Tonelli, who's not home from his auto-repair shop yet. I have just made my way 
down a country lane near Lithonia, Ga., and turned in at a rustic-looking 
mailbox bearing my last name. Funny to see it way out here, within sight of 
Stone Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 Denise is effusive and bubbly, just the opposite of Rick, who comes home and 
tells me, once we're settled in the living room, "See, I'm just the opposite of 
you. I've never been interested in my family history." 
</P>
<P>
 "And I don't understand that," Denise says. "I'm a Heinz 57 -- Jewish-German 
is my strongest suit -- but if I was Italian, I would want to know so much . 
Like his mother's father; he came over here and moved to Mississippi . To be a 
farmer ! Trying to speak English with an Italian-Southern accent . I mean !"  
</P>
<P>
 Rick Tonelli's a friendly but taciturn guy, born in Connecticut. His father 
died at 46, when Rick was 16, which had been the last time Rick saw either 
Connecticut or any of his extended family there. But a few years ago, Rick was 
approaching 46 as his son, Craig, was about to turn 16. And Rick started to 
feel the similarities. So. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "So we went on a trip to Connecticut to see my father's brother, my uncle," 
Rick says. "We call him Lolly, but his name's Alexander. Usually, we'd go to 
the beach for our vacation. But I really wanted to see my uncle. And it was our 
best vacation ever." 
</P>
<P>
 "We were worried that Craig might rather have gone to the beach," Denise says. 
"These were people Craig and I had never met. But I knew how much it meant to 
Rick, and I would have crawled on broken glass to make that trip." 
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed so funny," Rick says, "Because we had never been around any 
Tonellis, and we pull up to my uncle's house, and there are the cars, with 
plates that say 'TONEL-1' and 'TONEL-2.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to understand," Denise says, "on that trip we heard all these things 
that Rick never knew, and he sat there for two days and listened to his Uncle 
Lolly tell stories about the old days, and Rick laughed and cried at the same 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 Rick squirms at the mention of crying. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah," he says offhandedly. "It was a good trip." 
</P>
<P>
 "And we were in stitches for two days," Denise says. "And I cried and Rick 
cried -- " 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah," he says, heading her off at the pass, "this uncle of mine is so cool. 
Anyway, we drove to their town up there, got a motel room, and then we called 
my uncle and said we were coming by. And when he heard about the motel, he went 
crazy. 'Whaddya mean, you're in a motel, we have all this room.' Now I hardly 
knew these people. But the second night, we stayed with them. We even slept in 
their room." 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, God, remember?" says Denise. "The rosaries?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, I have a great family." 
</P>
<P>
 "You're lucky," Denise says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, I can't complain. And our son also loved it." 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," Denise says, "he's very proud." 
</P>
<P>
 Rick shrugs. "He's more interested in family and that stuff than I am." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's proud," Denise says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," Rick allows, "I am too." 
</P>
<P>
 Craig comes in from his job at a convenience store. He's a gregarious kid of 
the New South, baseball cap on backward, about to join the Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
 I ask, "Do you come across many Italian kids at school or anywhere?" 
</P>
<P>
 He shakes his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "How about Brent?" Denise says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah," says Craig, " He is. He's my real good friend, too. But I just don't 
think of him as being Italian ." Then he grins and turns his cap around, and on 
the front it says "Italy." 
</P>
<P>
 I get to the parking lot (Chip and Dale section, row 9) early and ride the 
monorail to the Magic Kingdom's gate, where Ed Tonelli, a Disney World janitor, 
and I have agreed to meet. But where is he? Wait a second. There's a 
three-foot-tall employee in a jumpsuit walking my way. Please, let this be Ed. 
Imagine, a midget Tonelli. Nope, there he goes. 
</P>
<P>
 I've never been to Disney World. When I called from New York to ask Ed if he'd 
show me around, he agreed in a second but had a request: "Bring me some 
provolone," he said. "I buy it down here, and it tastes like plastic." 
</P>
<P>
 So I'm feeling like a latter-day immigrant, standing outside the gates to the 
Magic Kingdom with a chunk of stinking cheese in my bag. An hour later, I'm 
still hanging, so I call Ed's apartment from a pay phone, and he answers. Could 
I really have failed to spot the only man in Disney World in a green "M*A*S*H" 
T-shirt and shades? OK, so he's on his way back, but I'm pissed, until I see 
this jolly little guy in oversized, impenetrable black goggles striding toward 
me. Gotta be Ed. I'm happier already. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother brought me down here to visit for the first time about nine years 
ago," he tells me. We're in a theme restaurant just inside the gate, having a 
big breakfast: "Daisy Duck's eggs." "We got hold of one of those cheap package 
deals. And when I got here, the magic hit me. I got impregnated by that pixie 
dust. I came back to visit every year after that. Well, some years I missed, 
but then other years I came twice. I always knew this was my place down here." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, at 37, Ed made the big leap: He applied for a job at Disney World and 
got one. Back home in Connecticut, he'd roamed from security-guard job to 
dishwasher job to janitor job. "I took sick days all the time. I had the worst 
attendance record ever. And here, as of now, I've got 19 months of perfect 
attendance. I'll never go back to Bridgeport again, not for a funeral or a 
wedding, not even my own. It's part of my past." 
</P>
<P>
 Now breakfast's out of the way, and he's ready to begin the grand tour. We 
head first to Splash Mountain, which is dear to Ed's heart since part of his 
duties involve scrubbing the big plastic logs that carry customers down the 
mountain. (He also cleans one men's bathroom, which he includes on my tour, and 
a ladies' bathroom and a baby-changing room, which he does not.) 
</P>
<P>
 We wait in line, then climb side by side into our bobbing log; in the darkness 
of the mountain's innards, I hear Ed laughing at every one of the robot 
animals' jokes, even though he's heard them a thousand times by now. Slowly, 
we're rising to the peak of the ride's big dramatic drop, but instead of 
gripping the rail with all his might -- like me -- Ed throws his arms up in the 
air and braves the final, splashy 50-foot plunge no-hands.  
</P>
<P>
 We travel through some kind of pirate thing, then zoom over to Epcot, and all 
I remember there is a ride through the history of the world as narrated by 
Walter Cronkite and a walk through a series of pavilions devoted to foreign 
countries. "Here, let's go this way," Ed says, stepping from Norway into 
Mexico. "I want to take you through Italy." 
</P>
<P>
 In a Georgian-looking building, something called "The American Adventure" is 
about to begin. A crew of collegiate weenies dressed in colonial and antebellum 
costumes starts to croon: "This is my country, land of my birth. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, Ed," I suggest after about 12 seconds, "why don't we skip this and go 
somewhere we can talk?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No, we have to stay for this," he says urgently. "This is really beneficial. 
I know you think it's a drag. But since we're cutting it short" -- I'd already 
told him, three hours tops for the whole tour -- "I don't want you to miss the 
best parts." 
</P>
<P>
 The show isn't as bad as I expected. It's a lot worse. It's hard to understand 
the point of making robot actors so lifelike that they're almost human when 
it's so cheap and easy to use humans in the first place. I'm squirming through 
a half-hour of the Ben Franklin robot and the Mark Twain robot tossing prefab 
homespun one-liners back and forth; if I hear the words "freedom" and "liberty" 
once more I might strangle poor Ed, I think. In the darkness, as the final 
crescendo of platitude-swapping cranks to life, I scribble in my notebook, " 
This is f - - - ing inane! " 
</P>
<P>
 I'm carving in the exclamation point when Ed turns to me and says, "Doesn't 
that make you proud to be an American?" I'm so torn -- between thinking that 
Ed's gone a little goofy on Disney World and thinking that his quest to find a 
hometown he can love makes him the wisest man I know -- that all I can do is 
nod. 
</P>
<P>
 Before I went on the road, I sent a four-page questionnaire to every Tonelli 
household in the mail-order book and then some, 450 in all. "As you'll see," I 
wrote in the cover letter, "I'm asking the questions you'd expect -- about how 
you live, your jobs, your eating and social habits, and how much (if at all) 
you feel your Italian background in your daily life."  
</P>
<P>
 I got back more than 200 questionnaires, hired professionals to crunch the 
numbers, and here are some highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 Only a little more than half (53.3%) of the Tonelli Nation is of full Italian 
ancestry. As it turns out, I could use lots of my interviews as research for a 
book about German Americans. Of respondents under 30 years of age, almost 
three-quarters have only one Italian parent. 
</P>
<P>
 Most responding Tonellis (52.3%) are the grandchildren of immigrants. And most 
Tonelli ancestors came from north-central Italy, above Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 Most (57.4%) did not marry someone of Italian ancestry. Of course, since many 
of them are not of full Italian ancestry themselves, their choice of mate 
doesn't even represent intermarriage. Sociologists say that endogamy -- 
marriage to someone of your own group -- is the most important indicator of 
strong ethnic identity. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty percent of Tonellis speak a few words of Italian, 24.1% speak none at 
all and 16.6% speak it fluently. 
</P>
<P>
 Most (72.9%) thought "The Godfather" was the best of the Godfather movies; 
8.5% voted for "II" and only 2.5% went for "III." (Scary to note that 2.5% of 
Tonellis are insane.) 
</P>
<P>
 When Tonellis serve tomato sauce, 67.3% make it themselves, 27.6% open a jar, 
and 4.5% do both. About 80% of Northeasterners make it themselves, compared 
with 42.1% of Westerners. And 75.5% of Tonellis of Italian-only ancestry go 
homemade, compared with 58.1% of those of mixed ancestry. 
</P>
<P>
 Because I don't really trust myself around numbers, I commissioned Dr. Richard 
D. Alba, a professor of sociology at the State University of New York, Albany, 
and a respected authority on ethnicity, to analyze the Tonelli Nation census. 
In the "near future," he wrote, the fourth generation will begin to define the 
majority of Tonellis in America, "an important transition, because the fourth 
generation has little or no contact with the immigrants and thus is missing a 
set of experiences that can help to sustain a strong ethnic identity." 
</P>
<P>
 Even now, according to Dr. Alba, "the ethnic dynamics visible in the 
demographic data for the Tonellis lend themselves to a 'soft' form of 
ethnicity. . . . Signs of ethnicity tend to be muted and to be kinds that, like 
food, can be appreciated by, or at least do not give offense to, those who do 
not share one's background." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, we Tonellis have never been less Italian than we are right 
now, and we'll never be even this Italian ever again. The "us" and "them" 
mentality goes, but with it goes the idea that anything more meaningful than 
macaroni holds us together. And that's true not just for Tonellis but for all 
Italian Americans, and I'm sure for every other kind of hyphenated American, 
too. You're going to miss us Tonellis when we're gone. You're going to wish you 
had been nicer to us when you had the chance. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm in a living room in Escondido, just outside San Diego, listening to a 
burly, thick-fingered exterminator play a delicate, lyrical, sentimental melody 
on his piano. He composed it, and his wife and I applaud when he finishes. Then 
Beatrice and Mike Tonelli and I sit at the kitchen table. 
</P>
<P>
 BEATRICE: I came out here from the Bronx on vacation when I was 18, with my 
mom. We took the train from New York, came to San Diego and stayed at Mike's 
parents' house -- my aunt and uncle's. And Mike and I met and fell in love, and 
I went back home and told my father I was moving to California, and we got 
married. Married for 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
 ME: Was anybody upset about it? 
</P>
<P>
 BEATRICE: Oh, we had a lot of . . . your parents more than mine. 
</P>
<P>
 MIKE: My dad, he was all against it. My parents didn't want us in their house 
at all . 
</P>
<P>
 ME: How exactly did it happen? 
</P>
<P>
 MIKE: When they came out to visit, my dad told me to show my cousin around 
town. So I did. And we fell in love. 
</P>
<P>
 ME: But didn't it occur to you that there would be trouble? 
</P>
<P>
 MIKE: Sure it did. 
</P>
<P>
 BEATRICE: Yeah, it did, but it didn't stop us. 
</P>
<P>
 ME: How did your father find out? 
</P>
<P>
 MIKE: He caught me writing her a letter. He grabbed it and read it, and, oh 
boy, was he mad. Sheee. Plus, she started crying at the train when they left, 
so my dad and mother and her mother kinda went, "Well, what's goin' on here ?" 
My dad told me, "You can't marry your sister ." I said, "She's not my sister," 
but he said, "She might as well be, she's my brother's daughter." Then my dad 
said, "Oh, she's not gonna come back and marry you anyway. You have nothing to 
offer." And I was so tired of hearing that from him -- "She's got a good 
education and good job out there, she's not coming" -- so I said, "What do you 
mean, Dad? What about this? (Re-enacting the nonverbal part of their exchange, 
Mike looks down at his lap, so I do, too, and then we're both staring at his 
crotch, which is pumping up and down on the chair.) Oooh, he almost sent me 
flying. " You talkin' about my brother's daughter ?!" I said, "Yeah, I got 
plenty to offer, Dad." He was really pissed.  
</P>
<P>
 ME: How did you break the news? 
</P>
<P>
 BEATRICE: On the train home, I told my mother that we had fallen in love and I 
wanted to come back to California. 
</P>
<P>
 ME: Was she mad? 
</P>
<P>
 BEATRICE: I'll tell you, my mom was upset when I was going out with this 
Puerto Rican guy. She grabbed a kitchen knife and told him, "Your name is on 
this. If I see you with my daughter again, this is going right through you." So 
she wasn't that radical about Mike. 
</P>
<P>
 MIKE: She said she wouldn't have married me if the priest back there hadn't 
OK'd it. 
</P>
<P>
 BEATRICE: Well, I had to be married in church. 
</P>
<P>
 MIKE: But I didn't think the priest would OK it. 
</P>
<P>
 BEATRICE: Fooled you, ha-ha. 
</P>
<P>
 MIKE: And a year later, my father said it was the best thing that ever 
happened to me. And at the time they had told me they'd rather see me marry a 
black person. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike and Bea saw a geneticist before they married, and he gave them the OK to 
have kids. They have two daughters, Ginette, who's 16, and Sabrina, 12. 
</P>
<P>
 As I'm packing to go, Mike says, "Yeah, Italian is the only nationality there 
is. And if there were more of us, this would be a better country. I only wish I 
was pure Italian. My mother's German. I don't even tell people I'm half 
German." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, as I'm walking out the door, Beatrice says, "Oh wait -- did I tell you 
both my dad's parents were Tonellis?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Mine too!" says Mike. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman at the Frontier Airlines office in Fairbanks, Alaska, suggests I get 
to the airport an hour early, even though the departure area is an office the 
size of a restroom and the plane is parked right outside the door. They just 
want you to get in a full hour of dread before you take off. A minute before we 
board, a Pizza Hut guy rushes into the office. "Hey, you barely made it," says 
a man who takes delivery of one large pizza. I assume he's going to eat it on 
the flight, but instead he belts it into the seat next to his. I knew Allakaket 
was out there , but until I witnessed how you get a pizza delivered, I had no 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
 I hate these little airplanes. I hate any plane where you can sit in the tail 
and still read the dials on the dashboard. As soon as we're high, I open my 
eyes and see black land, white snow, frozen lakes and rivers, and miles of 
jagged mountaintops -- no roads, no buildings, nothing human. After 15 minutes, 
we run out of land, too, and the rest of the hour it's solid white outside. We 
start our descent, and I can't see anything down there. We hit the ground, and 
I still can't see anything. Wait -- there's a barn. A few log cabins almost 
totally buried in snow. Some people on snowmobiles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who are you waiting for?" an Indian woman asks me. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stanford Tonelli," I say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stan's out running his dogs. I'm Annie. Come with me." At this point I would 
normally think to ask, " Annie who ?" but instead I grab my bags, climb behind 
her on the snowmobile saddle, and off we zoom over a path of solid, bumpy snow 
that winds past the scattering of log cabins that makes up the village of 
Allakaket, population about 200 Athabascan Indians. I'd have a million 
impressions to report now were it not that all my concentration is in my knees 
and ankles, which are squeezing dents into the snowmobile, trying to keep me 
from bouncing off into the void. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months back, Stan had been the first Tonelli to call in response to the 
questionnaire. He had some weird news to report: "I'm not really a Tonelli. I 
don't know if my father was Mexican or Italian or whatever, but he fought in 
the South Pacific during World War II and got malaria. Now, this is more or 
less how I understand the story from my second cousin. Anyway, he almost died 
from the malaria, except an Italian corpsman named Tonelli saved his life. And 
my father was so grateful he changed his name to Tonelli. I don't know if it's 
true, but that's what they tell me." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford said he was born in Northern California in 1957, and his dad took off 
when Stan was small, leaving Stan's mother to raise their three sons alone. I 
asked how he ended up in Alaska, and he said, "I had trouble dealing with 
people. No. I didn't have trouble. I just don't like people. I like peace and 
quiet."  
</P>
<P>
 Despite the shadowy circumstances by which he acquired the Tonelli name, he 
welcomes my visit. 
</P>
<P>
 My corner of Stan and Annie's one-room cabin is homey and A-OK, near the wood 
stove, with a curtain around the bed, a reading lamp and several small toys 
(the bed belongs to 8-year-old Justin). The whole cabin is maybe 20 by 20 and 
also holds Stan and Annie's big bed, a sofa, a kitchen table, some chairs, 
cabinets, the stove, two TVs, a Nintendo and VCR, and a deep freeze. 
</P>
<P>
 Once I'm settled in, Annie and I go outside to wait for Stan. On their little 
piece of Alaska, there's an outhouse, a shed and an oil drum, around which, 
half buried by snow, I can make out a few disconnected animal heads, forelegs 
and tails, and some scraps of gray fur -- spare parts. Improbably, there's also 
a street light.  
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly the profound Alaska silence is broken by weird noises, something 
between barking and screaming bloody murder. I look down the path, away from 
the village, and see these dogs, smaller and scrappier than I pictured, 
dragging a sleigh through the snow, and standing heroically at the helm is 
Stanford: Tonelli of the North. 
</P>
<P>
 Stan and I say our hellos and how-was-the-trips and all that. He's a lean, 
quiet, good-looking guy, mid-30s. He asks if I saw any caribou herds as I flew 
in, and I say no, but the truth is that it never occurred to me to look.  
</P>
<P>
 After Justin comes home and we polish off a meatloaf, Stan's friend and 
neighbor Philip drops by, and we men crack a half-gallon of Canadian Mist. The 
whole idea of my being here amuses Philip, I can tell. When the subject turns 
to New York, he asks, "Hey, Bill, tell me -- did you ever sit in on a Mafia 
meeting?" 
</P>
<P>
 Justin wants to go to the high school basketball game tonight, so the three of 
us pile on Stan's snowmobile and we're off. Stan deposits us at the gym, and 
Justin immediately disappears with his school buddies, leaving me alone on the 
bleachers, the object, I suddenly realize, of sizable curiosity. One little 
kid, maybe 4 years old, stops dead in her tracks, astonished, when she sees me, 
then she cracks up laughing. Another one races by, touches my hand and keeps 
running. It's like I'm suddenly on the wrong end of a National Geographic TV 
special. 
</P>
<P>
 The basketball game ends, and Justin and I go outside to wait for Stan. The 
darkness deepens; my thoughts, naturally, run to calamity: What if Stan forgot 
us? In my mind, it's "McCabe and Mrs. Miller" time; one false step, and you're 
permafrost. So I pull Justin out of his group of buddies and tell him we're 
going to a house maybe 50 yards away to call Stanford at home. Like any kid, 
he's willing to go along obediently with whatever foolishness an adult 
suggests. We walk maybe 20 steps into the night when I look down at him, and it 
hits me like an electric shock: I grabbed the wrong kid.  
</P>
<P>
 Well, look, I've known him for all of three hours at this point. Plus he's 
bundled up in a hat that covers half his face. Plus, to my eyes these 
Athabascans look more alike that not. I see it all in a flash: Millions of 
miles from home and reliable legal counsel, in the middle of the most alien 
environment I've ever known, I have just kidnaped a small boy. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, as it turns out I did not grab the wrong kid. We make it to a telephone, 
call Stan, and he comes to fetch us straightaway. As we pull up to the cabin, I 
notice that the street lamp is broken. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, Stan," I say, "your light's out." 
</P>
<P>
 "I know," he says nonchalantly as he dismounts. "I shot it." 
</P>
<P>
 What next? When I settle down to sleep, from outside the curtain around my bed 
Stan says, "Uh, Bill, if you hear any noise during the night and it's a bear, 
the gun's over here." Got it, Stan. If I hear a bear, I'll shoot myself. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, Stan remembers he has something he wanted to show me. His mother 
recently sent him photocopies of long, handwritten letters from a woman in San 
Diego, the histories of three Mexican-American sisters born between 1878 and 
1900. One of them, Adelaide Rodriguez, took as her third husband a man named 
Arthur R. Ybarra. Their son Jerome was Stan's father. In the course of the 
letters, without explanation, Jerome's last name changes from Ybarra to 
Tonelli. It's a weird document, but it's all Stan has to explain who his 
mysterious father was, who Stan himself might be. I think that the main reason 
Stan invited me up here was that he thought I might have some clues to share. 
But I don't, except for a few pages I tore out of the San Diego phone book, the 
pages that list column after column of Ybarras. So I hand them over. 
</P>
<P>
 A little later, we decide to ride up to Graveyard Lake, to see about getting 
some ducks or maybe a moose. As we walk past his dogs, Stan points to one and 
says, "I'm gonna have to kill him." 
</P>
<P>
 "Gee, how come?" I ask. 
</P>
<P>
 "He isn't working hard enough pulling the sled. He isn't giving 100%. He's not 
worth the food I'm feeding him." 
</P>
<P>
 "Why doesn't he work harder?" I ask. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," Stan replies. "Bloodlines." 
</P>
<P>
 On the corridor wall of my cheap Des Moines motel there's a faded "Lounge" 
sign pointing down a shadowy flight of stairs. At the bottom of the steps, I 
find a door, and behind it there's a room with a jukebox and two pool tables; 
it's like somebody turned his grandparents' basement into a cocktail lounge. 
There's a gorgeous, sassy Ethiopian bartender, obviously on very familiar terms 
with her cast of regulars: Gary, the 50-ish wise guy; Chester, the mild and 
laconic, prematurely bald guy; Donna, the spry, silver-haired grandmother in 
peppy sportswear. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm the silent, unknown presence at the end of the bar until two more women 
come in, and one of them, feeling frisky, puts some Patsy Cline on the box and 
asks me to dance. "Sure," I say, and before long somebody asks why I'm in town, 
and I tell the truth. It strikes everybody funny for about a minute. Then a 
noisy group enters, including a woman named Janet whom everyone seems to know. 
</P>
<P>
 Chester leans over from the next stool and tells me, "That's Janet Tonelli." 
</P>
<P>
 My dance partner extends an invitation to see Mt. Rushmore. 
</P>
<P>
 "You should go," Chester says. "You can see George Tonelli." 
</P>
<P>
 Now somebody is at the jukebox, and "All Shook Up" comes on. 
</P>
<P>
 " Elvis Tonelli ," Chester announces. 
</P>
<P>
 It's still dark when I leave Des Moines for Anamosa, Iowa, where Bob Tonelli 
pays the price for his crime. I have already met Bob's half-sister Carmella, in 
a federal prison camp in Texas (cocaine); his cousin Mike, who also did time at 
Anamosa (armed robbery), and another cousin, Albert, Mike's brother, who went 
to prison for willful injury. When I introduced myself to Bob's elderly father, 
Charlie, I told him I was going to see his son in prison. "Yeah, get him out of 
there," the old man told me. "He's a good boy." 
</P>
<P>
 To get to the narrow, airless conference room where Bob will tell his tale, I 
pass through two grim sets of barred thresholds. "As I remember it, it happened 
at approximately 11:15, 11:30 at night," Bob begins. "I laid him down on the 
floor to change his diaper, and I went into the other room to get the diaper 
and baby wipes. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came back, he had pooped on the floor, so I cleaned him up and cleaned 
the poop. Then I tossed him onto the -- the papers say I hurled him, that was 
his mother's mother's word. I wouldn't so much say that I hurled him, but I 
tossed him on the couch. By no means did I mean for this to happen. I can't 
really tell you how much force was involved, but he hit an ashtray. He hit his 
head on an ashtray. Then he got up, and he walked around the room once, and 
then he fell down and went into convulsions. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I called 911. Then I called his mother, who was my girlfriend at the 
time. And I tried to get him to breathe. He was breathing, but he was breathing 
hard, and he, uh. . . . I was trying to give him CPR. His mother got there, and 
she called the ambulance. She had to look up the number in the phone book.  
</P>
<P>
 "And then, the ambulance got there and took him to the hospital. She called me 
from the hospital and said, 'Did he hit his head?' And I said, 'Yeah.' Then she 
said, 'Well, he's in a coma.' He went on for a day and half. She called and 
said, 'He moves, he opens his eyes when I call his name.' 
</P>
<P>
 "But then the day after that, the sheriff showed up at my house, and he said 
the baby had just died. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I could change things, I'd rather I was dead than that little child. I 
wake up at night . . . sweating. . . . I guess you'd have to go through it 
yourself. But it's bad thoughts, bad dreams. Bad dreams. Oh . . . I don't know. 
. . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Silence. 
</P>
<P>
 Since I first learned of Bob, I'd been looking forward, in a blackish way, to 
meeting the most notorious Tonelli in the world. Now here I am, having just 
encouraged a soft-voiced, visibly shaken 22-year-old to describe the bleakest 
moment any living being can imagine. I feel sick, and we still have a few 
minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
 I ask, "What would you be doing if none of this had happened?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd probably be in my own apartment," he says, "close enough to my dad's 
house so I could go over there to visit him." 
</P>
<P>
 Heading east from Anamosa, only one thing occurs to me: Tough times make tight 
families.  
</P>
<P>
 Do I or do I not pay a visit to Alexander Tonelli in Connecticut? On the one 
hand, by now I've had enough Tonellis. I want it to be over. On the other hand, 
Alexander is the uncle to whom Rick Tonelli of Lithonia, Ga., paid that 
emotionally charged visit a few years back. 
</P>
<P>
 I pull off the highway and call, and he's home and sounding hesitant. But if I 
hurry. . . . I zoom over and into the driveway, which is just as Rick described 
it, two cars sticking out of the garage, "TONEL-1" and "TONEL-2." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, Rick called me on the phone and said they were going to take a trip, 
and I said, 'Well, come on up,' " Alexander, Uncle Lolly, says. He's 78, a 
retired gun-stock maker, sitting in his dining room. "And he was tickled pink 
when he got here. I hadn't talked to him or seen him for 30 years, since his 
father died. In fact, he had to say his name twice on the phone; it caught me 
off-balance. I wasn't expecting him. And then he came over, and we reminisced, 
and he met all my kids and their families -- I've got seven grandchildren -- 
and he met so many people in such a little bit of time. We took him to see the 
house where he used to live. He was only about 6 years old when they moved. His 
father, my brother, moved away right after our mother died. He said, 'Well, I 
don't have anybody here. . . .' " 
</P>
<P>
 I ask him, "What do you think the trip meant to Rick?" 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a good question. But there really isn't much I can tell you," he says 
with a shrug. "It was a pretty short stay." 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, that's how it went for two solid months on the road with the Tonelli 
Nation. 
</P>
<P>
 I know it was just a trip in a car, meeting ordinary people, but it feels like 
a miracle happened to me. I met more Tonellis than I ever thought I'd meet, in 
more places than I ever thought I'd see. To be honest, all that traveling 
unhinged me, like an out-of-body experience, but I learned a lot, too. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, let's get it over with. Here's what I learned: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There really are Tonellis all over America. 
</P>
<P>
 Which, granted, I already had cause to believe, but now I know.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They really were happy to see me. 
</P>
<P>
 I know, partly because it's flattering to be the object of someone's curiosity 
for any reason. But my visits touched something genuine in these people, I 
could tell, some desire to connect with history or blood or experience. Their 
imaginations, like mine, were stirred by the vast mystery that there could be 
so many of us, in so many different forms. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But they really don't think much about their ancestry. 
</P>
<P>
 The tie has been severed; no aspect of their lives speaks to their sense of 
themselves as creatures of history. They (or somebody before them) made a 
crucial transfer. They stepped out of the story of their blood and into that of 
their country. They're Americans , and that's why their ancestors came here in 
the first place, I guess. Those brave old greaseballs in the great beyond 
should be happy; they wouldn't be able to recognize or even speak to their own 
flesh and blood. 
</P>
<P>
 The thought that comes to mind is that histories end in America -- that for 
America to succeed, ethnic identity has to go out the window. This country 
isn't dedicated to blood or even to shared memories, it's dedicated to a 
proposition. The bonds of family and kinship, which have proved their savage 
power since before history started , have to be dissolved for this country to 
succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 So, do you see how America happened? It's like algebra: 
</P>
<P>
 Ethnicity equals history 
</P>
<P>
 History equals memory. 
</P>
<P>
 America equals amnesia. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's what's amazing about the story of the Tonelli family in America: 
For the good of mankind, we had to try to obliterate centuries' worth of memory 
in just two or three generations. And we did it. We forgot so well, we don't 
even remember forgetting. Now we're fit to live nowhere but here. 
</P>
<P>
 That's probably what's amazing about your family, too. (Go ahead, say it -- 
Ich bin ein Tonelli !) 
</P>
<P>
 So, that's all of it, my only true story. I drove 12,000 miles in two months 
without killing anybody! As I met Tonellis, I felt as though I could claim 
them, and as I claimed Tonellis, I claimed America, too. Everything finally all 
came together. It really was a hell of a trip.

DUO BRING PERSONALITIES TO BEAR ON O.C. BASE ISSUE; POLITICS: BUCK JOHNS IS 
BRASH AND GEORGE ARGYROS IS PRIVATE -- BUT NEITHER LIKES LOSING. BOTH WANT NEW 
AIRPORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEBE MARTINEZ, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 William Buck Johns and George L. Argyros are in different leagues, but 
together they epitomize the social, political and business worlds of Newport 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Johns, a native Arkansan with a high-pitched twang, once turned his tennis 
court into a reception hall for then-Vice President Dan Quayle. The event came 
to symbolize the maturation of his belief that business deals slide perfectly 
into the world of politics, like hand in glove. 
</P>
<P>
 Argyros, grandson of Greek immigrants who became a tycoon, considers former 
President Richard M. Nixon his good friend. The former owner of AirCal and the 
Seattle Mariners baseball team, he manages his numerous companies and 
investments while mastering the global issues of the day, sometimes by 
telephone from the deck of his 100-foot yacht as he sails the world. 
</P>
<P>
 One is wealthy, the other wealthier. One is a powerbroker, the other is power. 
</P>
<P>
 And neither likes to lose. 
</P>
<P>
 Now this combination of raw energy and political might has thrust itself on 
the Orange County political scene in an extraordinary way. Frustrated with how 
local politicians have handled the expected closure of El Toro Marine Corps Air 
Station, the two men -- both key members of the politically influential Lincoln 
Club -- are asking county voters to support a proposed November ballot 
initiative that would require that the base be converted into a commercial 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Some airport backers worry that the measure is premature and that a defeat at 
the polls could mean the end of their dream for a commercial airport at El 
Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 But Johns and Argyros are risk-takers. They call it leadership. And the 
thought of losing does not intimidate them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine recent presidential candidate H. Ross Perot on a good day with a smile 
on his face and normal-sized ears and you are seeing and hearing Buck Johns. 
But don't tell him that; he hates the comparison. 
</P>
<P>
 Johns walks fast, talks fast and is quick with the one-liners. 
</P>
<P>
 When his friends talk about him, they are likely to mimic his Southern accent: 
"Damn it Steiner, we'll circle the wagons for you, but not for the Senate," 
Orange County Supervisor William G. Steiner recalls about the time Johns 
suggested he not seek a state Senate seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner took the advice. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Dana Reed, however, did not. He stayed in the contest despite a 
similar warning from Johns. "You want to be senator and I want to be Pope," 
Reed remembers Johns telling him. "But guess what? I'm not going to be Pope, 
and you're not going to be senator." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Reed, who lost the race to then-Assemblyman John R. Lewis (R-Orange): "He 
has a most disarming demeanor and he does everything with a smile and he does 
everything with a laugh. But he is brutally honest." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who know Johns agree that if he thinks a cause is worth taking on, he 
gives it his fullest commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is someone who says, 'Let's go do it!' And he makes phone calls, he talks 
to people, he buttonholes them at events," said Dick Cheshire, a Chapman 
University vice president who knows Johns through his work in the community, 
ranging from membership on the Orange County Fair Board to his boosterism of 
the Cal State Fullerton athletic program. 
</P>
<P>
 Johns, a former Eagle Scout, is respected for his charm, tenacity and ability 
to juggle multiple interests. One day he is strategizing on El Toro and dealing 
with a local Assembly race, and a few days later he is dining with David Hale, 
the former municipal court judge in Arkansas who has accused President Clinton 
of wrongdoing in the Whitewater controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, where most of the political influence and money lines up 
behind the Republican Party, Johns is in the tight circle of powerbrokers who 
decide which candidates should drop out of certain races. 
</P>
<P>
 It may offend some candidates, but Johns enjoys being right in the middle, 
making deals and would-be kings. 
</P>
<P>
 Politics, Johns said in a recent interview, is the "ultimate game." 
</P>
<P>
 "It provides you access and transcends all the other kinds of barriers," he 
said. "The Rockefellers, who have all the money in the world, where do they go? 
They go to politics." 
</P>
<P>
 Politics is what drew Johns into the land development business. 
</P>
<P>
 He was born into a political family in Paris, Ark., 52 years ago. At one point 
while he was growing up, four of his relatives were on the same ballot seeking 
local political offices. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was not until the 1970s, when he began investing in real estate while 
heading the California operations for an air conditioning company, that his 
political acumen was tested. 
</P>
<P>
 Johns said he would make an investment and then be asked by a partner to talk 
to a local city councilman about a needed zoning change. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I would lean on the politician, and the value (of the land) would go way 
up," Johns said. "And after watching that increase in value, I would say, 'I 
think I'm going to do this. It marriages my avocation with a vocation.' And 
that's when I went into the developing business." 
</P>
<P>
 He made his first million dollars as an air-conditioning executive and 
part-time real estate investor. But by 1980, he decided to strike out on his 
own. 
</P>
<P>
 Johns' first major development project came together in 1983: a 10-acre parcel 
in Moreno Valley that was later sold to the local school district. "Hell of a 
deal," Johns said, smiling as he remembered thinking that day, "I'm going to do 
this again." 
</P>
<P>
 Johns usually teams up with a property owner, who puts up the land, and an 
investor to front the costs of carrying the project through the bureaucratic 
and legal entitlement process handled by Johns' company, Inland Group Inc. All 
of his development projects have occurred in Riverside and San Bernardino 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
 But the merger of his business with his politics has caused critics to 
question his motives on El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 They point to his use of political influence to gain support for a high-speed 
rail line from Anaheim to the former George Air Force Base because it might 
benefit his 85-acre project in nearby Hesperia. He also has property interests 
in Riverside County, where March Air Force Base is scheduled for downsizing. 
</P>
<P>
 "He plays right on the edge. He's a ballsy little guy," one local business 
leader said privately, adding that, to Johns' credit, he does not try to hide 
any self-interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask him about a project and he will tell you about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Johns said he doubts he will ever be involved in any development around El 
Toro Marine Corps Air Station because the Irvine Co. owns most of the land. 
</P>
<P>
 But he is unabashedly honest about his hope that George Air Force Base can 
still be developed, even though the project looks doomed because of local 
political infighting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do I hope to make money in the interest? Yes, I hope to make money in every 
damn thing I do. I mean, I hope to eventually get paid for all my brilliance!" 
Johns said with a huge laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 "Buck will never be a wallflower," businessman Gus Owen said recently of his 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor does Johns shy away from the limelight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been ambushed by Mike Wallace (of '60 Minutes'), you know," Johns 
said. "It was a fascinating deal. . . . It was pretty exciting stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, he threatened a lawsuit because he thought the report about his 
former air-conditioning firm was unfair. But years later, he laughs it off. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the days of working on commission as an air-conditioning salesman, Johns 
has reached state and national political prominence. And he is "having a grand 
time," he said, as he awaits the spring of 1996, when California will become an 
early presidential primary state. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first place a Republican checks in in California is Orange County, and 
the first organization they check in with is the Lincoln Club, and the person 
they check in with there is the program chairman," he said. "And that's me." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While Buck Johns revels on the stage of political theater, George Argyros 
flinches in the footlights of fame. 
</P>
<P>
 Not because he is uncomfortable with the majesty of power -- he is increasing 
his public persona in national and international political affairs -- but 
because he believes that business dealings are confidential and personal 
relationships are no one else's business. 
</P>
<P>
 He will tell you that one of his better days was in the fall of 1992, when his 
name was dropped from Forbes magazine's list of the 400 wealthiest men in the 
nation, after his net worth fell below $265 million. (His estimated net worth 
remains at least $250 million.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I would just as soon not get into it. I didn't want to be on (the list)," 
Argyros said recently. "I would like my private life back, thank you." 
</P>
<P>
 Business and political leaders place Argyros, 57, near the highest 
stratosphere, almost in the same league with Irvine Co. Chairman Donald L. 
Bren, the wealthiest man in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 But they also describe Argyros as a complex man -- not flamboyant but subtle; 
a statesman rather than a hands-on powerbroker; conservative in his business 
dealings but a risk-taker; a shrewd negotiator with a generous heart; and a 
Republican who will not say he has never voted for a Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people on the East Coast tend to type-cast Orange County businessmen 
as being right-wingers who haven't had an original political thought since the 
Hoover Administration. It was very refreshing to meet Mr. Argyros," said 
Richard Fairbanks, managing director of the Center for Strategic and 
International Studies, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank. Argyros is a member 
of its International Counselors board. 
</P>
<P>
 Argyros' story of rags to riches is well-known. Born in Detroit during the 
Great Depression, he grew up in Pasadena where he went to work at the age of 14 
as a box boy at a grocery store. 
</P>
<P>
 He was unsure about his future when he graduated from Chapman College in 
Orange. So, he took out licenses in securities, insurance and real estate, and 
convinced a friend at a bank to lend him $1,200. 
</P>
<P>
 His venture in the residential real estate market ended after his first sale 
because he did not like it. Instead, he bought and sold commercial property and 
eventually developed shopping centers, office buildings and apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 At one time, he was considered one of the largest apartment builders in Orange 
County. But quantity was not what mattered to Argyros. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have never aspired to be large builders of anything," he said. "We would 
rather be quality, profitable, small. We have never had a company brochure, as 
an example. I have a phobia about it, honestly."LAT

A WINDING PATH LED TO HUFFINGTON'S SENATE BID; ELECTION: MULTIMILLIONAIRE SAYS 
HIS POLITICAL AMBITIONS ARE DRIVEN BY A SPIRITUAL CALLING. BUT SOME SEE A 
PARADOX.

<P>
 In his quest to reach out to others, to leave his mark on the world, Michael 
Huffington has thought about being many things. The first-term congressman has 
thought about being a clergyman, a teacher and a filmmaker. 
</P>
<P>
 During his youth, he experienced the discipline of military life in a private 
academy. In a restless career mostly in the oil and gas business, he also 
dabbled in the stock market, real estate and banking. He briefly held a 
high-level job in the Defense Department. 
</P>
<P>
 But after contemplating his life's path in a Greek monastery last year, the 
multimillionaire from Montecito believes he has found his true calling: He 
wants to be a U.S. senator from California. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not a good writer," Huffington said in an interview with The Times. "I 
am not a radio-TV personality. I'm not an actor. I'm not a priest. I'm not a 
teacher. But hopefully, I'm a political leader." 
</P>
<P>
 Though he has settled on his immediate goal, the restlessness is still there. 
A few minutes later he was asked whether he had considered the presidency. 
Huffington said: "If I could be President, obviously, then I would like to be 
President. But I would rather be a U.S. senator than almost anything." 
</P>
<P>
 At 46, Huffington seemingly has come out of nowhere to be regarded as the 
Republican front-runner for the seat held by Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein. 
He is the least known major candidate for office this year in California, taken 
very seriously because of his personal fortune -- estimated at $70 million -- 
and his willingness to spend it on politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Californians know little about him because most of his career has been spent 
working in a privately held family company in Texas. He moved to California to 
run for office only three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Why California? 
</P>
<P>
 "Firstly, I love beauty," said Huffington, who attended Stanford University. 
"This is one of the most beautiful states in the country. I love the weather. 
That's the biggest reason, obviously." 
</P>
<P>
 Because he is so little-known statewide, Huffington has been spending millions 
of his own money on television ads to introduce himself to voters. Huffington 
is a very private man and there is an awkwardness as he presents himself 
publicly. He has a skinny 6-foot-3 frame and a smile that seems a bit stiff, as 
if he was caught in an uncomfortable moment at a cocktail party. Image and 
Reality 
</P>
<P>
 In television ads and in speeches, he presents himself as a regular guy with 
middle-class roots who acquired his huge fortune "with hard work and luck" and 
a mere $1,000 investment, underscoring the potential for individual success 
that makes America great. 
</P>
<P>
 But a different portrait of Huffington emerges from dozens of interviews with 
members of his family, friends and colleagues, as well as hours of interviews 
with him. In this portrait, he is Roy Michael Huffington Jr., the only son of 
one of the richest men in America, the namesake of a father who rose from 
poverty to become one of the legendary oil and gas wildcatters in Texas 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of that wealth was not realized until Huffington was an adult, but there 
was enough as he was growing up to send him to an expensive prep school and the 
finest universities. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout his life, Huffington has been the good son who revered his father, 
followed his school's code of honor, never rebelled in college and then joined 
the family company at his mother's request. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, based largely on money earned from his father's company, Huffington 
owns mansions in Montecito and Washington. He married Arianna Stassinopoulos, a 
best-selling biographer renowned for her social connections as well as her 
quest for New Age spirituality. Barbara Walters and Lucky Roosevelt were 
bridesmaids in their splashy New York wedding paid for by Ann Getty, a 
Manhattan socialite who introduced them. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington spent $5.2 million to win his current office, the congressional 
seat representing Santa Barbara. That works out to $7,123 for each day of his 
two-year term. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington cites this spending as a source of independence, calling himself "a 
political renegade" who does not have to depend on campaign contributions from 
special interests. He describes himself as a political outsider because "I 
don't want to be part of the good old boy network." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet he has been a member of Team California, a group of rich Republicans who 
pool their contributions of $25,000 apiece to have a bigger impact. His 
family's oil business had its own political action committee to gain influence 
and the family's donations helped Huffington land his appointment in the Ronald 
Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington is reticent about his personal fortune. When it is suggested that 
his wealth comes primarily from the success of his father, he is testy. "We 
need to make sure you guys get paid more money so it won't be such a big 
subject," he told a reporter at one point. "I have to tell you that a majority 
of the people, they don't care about it. When I go around walking precincts, 
people don't ask about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington says his political ambitions are driven by a spiritual calling to 
public service. Although his friends believe he is sincere in his spiritual 
quest, some consider it a paradox because most of his adult life has been 
focused on the acquisition of wealth. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of his friends and family also see the aspirations of a son who has spent 
most of his life in the shadow of his father. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a classic oldest son trying to strike out on his own to make his mark," 
said Dan Case, a San Francisco investment banker and a longtime friend. 
"Although he was an extremely good businessman, it would have been difficult 
for him to make the kind of mark that his father did." 
</P>
<P>
 Born Sept. 3, 1947, in Dallas, Michael Huffington spent most of his early 
years living in a three-bedroom, ranch-style house in the Houston suburb of 
Bellaire with a workaholic dad, a homemaker mother and a younger sister. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington rarely got out of line, but when he was 7, his father disciplined 
him for lighting matches indoors. He was taken into the back yard, given a 
bucket and a box of matches. His instructions were to strike a match and then 
drop it in the bucket. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to keeping lighting them until I burned my finger," Huffington said. 
Strict Upbringing 
</P>
<P>
 His father eventually gave the same lesson with tobacco and alcohol. "He said: 
'You want some cigarettes? Here are some cigarettes.' I kept smoking until I 
turned green. Same thing with drinking. We went out, when I was of age, to go 
drink until I was so sick. . . . I don't drink hard alcohol that much because 
of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington heartily endorses the method of discipline. "I think it was very 
clever," he said, and intends to use the same technique, if necessary, with his 
two daughters, ages 2 and 4. 
</P>
<P>
 He remembers his father talking to him at great length about the importance of 
self-sufficiency and education. When Michael was 9, his father left his job as 
a geologist for Humble Oil, the precursor to Exxon, to launch his own oil and 
gas prospecting company. 
</P>
<P>
 At 14, Huffington regarded himself as totally unmotivated -- "I was a couch 
potato. I watched TV all the time" -- so he asked his parents to send him to 
Culver Military Academy in Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
 "Subconsciously, I knew I needed the discipline to excel," Huffington said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Culver, a private school where tuition and fees now run $16,950 a year, 
Huffington worked his way through the ranks to become one of the top student 
military officers. He rowed crew and took pride in strictly adhering to the 
academy's code of honor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I even turned in my roommate for being (five minutes) late to our room," 
Huffington recalled. "And he was higher ranking than I was. But I happened to 
be the officer on duty that night. Two days later, he moved out on me. I don't 
blame him. He was mad at me. The point is, I was abiding by the rules." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as a member of the academy's board of directors, Huffington is a large 
contributor and recently picked the color of limestone of the school's new 
$10-million Huffington Library. 
</P>
<P>
 After Culver, he attended his father's alma mater, Southern Methodist 
University in Dallas, and marched with the ROTC. Stanford, which had rejected 
him because of insufficient grades, admitted him in 1966 when he reapplied. 
</P>
<P>
 At Stanford, Huffington spent four years rowing crew and pursuing a double 
degree program in engineering and economics. He also recalls his first 
realization that he wanted to enter politics and become a U.S. senator. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet his tenure at Stanford was marked by an extraordinary indifference to the 
greatest political and social upheaval of his time. 
</P>
<P>
 During those years, 1966 to 1970, Stanford erupted in student anti-war 
protests. The ROTC office was firebombed. Hundreds of students occupied 
buildings, thousands boycotted classes and an estimated 80% of the student body 
attended one demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
 None of this made a strong impression on Huffington. He describes his position 
on the Vietnam War this way: "I was basically neutral. But I think while I was 
there, I was probably for it." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the prospect of military service, he said: "I was fully prepared to 
serve had I been inducted." He does not recall other feelings one way or the 
other. Roots of Success 
</P>
<P>
 During his first four years in college, he had a student deferment. In April 
of his fifth year, his draft number was called and Huffington went to an 
induction center in Houston for his physical exam. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in great shape. I rowed crew and I'd been a swimmer and I thought for 
sure I'd be able to make it," Huffington said. "And, lo and behold, they took a 
look at my eyes and they said, 'Forget it. What are you even doing here?' " 
</P>
<P>
 He failed his physical exam on April 13, 1970, and soon was classified "not 
qualified for military service," records show. He said he does not know how bad 
his eyesight was then or is today. He wears hard contact lenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington remembers joining the Young Republicans and sitting at a card table 
on the Stanford campus to promote Reagan's first bid for the presidency in 
1968. "I liked the guy. He seemed optimistic. I am a very optimistic person." 
</P>
<P>
 He spent that August in Washington answering phones and running errands for 
Houston's congressman, a former oilman and friend of his father's named George 
Bush. He remembers it as a time of inspiration. "I thought of it as a very 
ethical, good place to go," Huffington said. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington and his roommate, Bob Fink, were elected to two of the four 
positions as co-presidents of the senior class. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mike was basically this incredible straight shooter," said Fink, now a 
psychiatrist in Washington state. "It was like he was in his middle age. He did 
not rebel at all. He did not smoke dope. . . . He had his mind made up to where 
he was going. He was going to enter the oil business. It was clear he came from 
money and was going to have money." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington recalls trying marijuana "once or twice," not at Stanford but 
during his 20s in Houston. "I remember trying it and not liking it." 
</P>
<P>
 From Stanford, Huffington went to Harvard Business School where his studies 
kept him too busy to be concerned about politics. "Then Watergate came along. I 
was somewhat disillusioned. And then, I forgot about running. I just figured on 
being a businessman." 
</P>
<P>
 In his Senate campaign, Huffington is running as a successful businessman who 
can apply his experience to cut government spending. He often portrays himself 
as a self-made entrepreneur who parlayed a small investment into a fortune. 
"That's what's great about America. You can start with $1,000 and you can end 
up making something." 
</P>
<P>
 But the record of Huffington's 18-year business career presents a less clear 
picture of unblemished bootstrap success. Only four of those years were spent 
outside his father's firm, and those jobs resulted from school connections or 
family ties. 
</P>
<P>
 His career began in 1972 at the First National Bank of Chicago, where he 
followed his best friend at Harvard University, L.E. Simmons, into the 
corporate finance office. His two-year stint at the bank led to the break he 
highlights in his political speeches. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1974, Simmons' older brother, Matt, was approached by a London-based 
merchant bank to set up a Houston affiliate that would provide financial advice 
to companies working in the oil fields. Matt Simmons said he invited Huffington 
to join him because Huffington's father was a well-respected oilman. "He 
brought us a lot of credibility," Matt Simmons said. "Neither of us were from 
Houston. We needed all of the help we could get." 
</P>
<P>
 The London bank put up most of the money, but the Simmons brothers and 
Huffington kicked in $1,000 each. This is the $1,000 investment Huffington 
refers to when he talks about his business success. 
</P>
<P>
 About two years later, however, Huffington and the Simmons brothers bought out 
the bank's share for nearly $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Around that point in time, Mike realized it wasn't his cup of tea and he 
wanted to join the family firm," Matt Simmons said. 
</P>
<P>
 His departure in 1976 was marked by strained negotiations. Huffington filed a 
lawsuit, and Matt Simmons said the brothers eventually purchased his shares for 
about $700,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's just say it was a lot of money," Huffington said. "And, it allowed me 
the opportunity to buy some stock in my father's business." It also permitted 
the young bachelor to buy a three-story, 5,667-square-foot Houston townhouse 
with an elevator. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington said he joined the family business because "my mom came to me and 
said: 'Look Michael. You're dad is stretched. . . . He needs to talk to 
somebody. He needs somebody with financial business sense.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next 14 years, Huffington helped direct a company that struck it rich 
while he was still in graduate school. He said his tight-fisted influence and 
financial acumen helped put the company in a position where it fetched an 
estimated $600 million when it was sold in 1990. But his critics challenge his 
contribution to the family business, saying he was involved in a couple of bad 
deals that cost the company millions and left a group of furious bankers who 
claimed that he failed to live up to his word. 
</P>
<P>
 His father's business, Roy M. Huffington Inc. or Huffco, hit the jackpot in 
1971 when it sank an exploratory well that tapped a huge natural gas reserve on 
Kalimantan Island in Indonesia. It was the kind of strike that elevated Roy 
Huffington, a geologist with a Harvard Ph.D., into the pantheon of Houston 
wildcatters. 
</P>
<P>
 But it took years for Roy Huffington to stitch together the financing needed 
to develop the fields, build a gas liquefying plant in the Indonesian jungle 
and line up ocean tankers to haul the gas to Japanese buyers. Family Business 
Role 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Huffington joined Huffco a year before the first tanker eased out of 
Bontang Bay, Indonesia, with a gas shipment bound for Japan. "There was no 
revenue from our overseas operations during the first couple of years I was 
there," he said. "If things had not gone well, we could have been a complete 
bust." 
</P>
<P>
 With his MBA and banking experience, Michael Huffington spent most of his time 
at Huffco focused on the company's finances. He said he never saw himself as an 
oilman like his father, but rather as a financial manager in an oil and gas 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 The project that most captured his imagination was a decade-long accumulation 
of property in downtown Houston. Huffington secretly directed the operation 
through intermediaries so property owners would not inflate their prices. 
Ultimately, Huffco assembled the equivalent of 11 city blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 He dreamed about building a self-contained residential community with 
restaurants, shops and movie houses. "If I had never wanted to go into 
politics, I would have stayed with it and done that." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington believes his most significant role was that of family tightwad. He 
argued for paying off debt rather than starting ventures -- a voice that proved 
prophetic when oil prices tumbled in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 "His job was to keep down our debts and he did an excellent job at that," Roy 
Huffington told The Times. "Mike has always been a fiscal conservative. Even 
when he was a little fellow, he had a piggy bank and saved his money very 
carefully." 
</P>
<P>
 Roy Huffington also credits his son with bringing talented financial managers 
to the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside of Huffco's inner circle, Michael Huffington sometimes engendered 
hostility, as might be expected for a boss' son who quickly rises to become 
vice chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is the typical rich kid who is playing with his father's money," said 
George Berko, an employee of Huffco's partners in Indonesia. "Almost everything 
he put his hand on failed. He had a refinery and a drilling company that 
failed. The banks ended up holding the bag. He made a lot of promises to the 
banks and ruined his reputation." Some Failed Ventures 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid-1980s, two of Huffco's subsidiaries collapsed. One was the 
Independent Valley Energy Co., a refinery in Bakersfield. The other was Culver 
Drilling Co., designed to dig deep wells in Oklahoma. Michael Huffington had 
arranged the financing for both. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington said he never favored the refinery, but he was gung-ho on Culver 
Drilling Co., which he named after his high school academy. 
</P>
<P>
 When the businesses failed, Huffington left a trail of angry bankers who claim 
that he offered verbal assurances that Huffco would go beyond written 
guarantees and cover losses that amounted to tens of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington denies ever making such promises and said Huffco lost "quite a few 
million" on Culver Drilling too. "In business, you lose some, you gain some." 
</P>
<P>
 Some bankers, who declined to speak on the record, admit they were naive at 
the time and should share the blame. They said they had long provided loans to 
his father on the strength of his word, but few of these oral arrangements had 
been tested because the oil patch was booming. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the resentment against Michael Huffington resulted from his hardheaded 
style. Former employees recall that Huffington insisted that everyone have a 
clean desk at the end of the day and banished smoking and free coffee from the 
office for health reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a lot of people who felt he was very harsh," said Bill Taylor, a 
former employee. "He was harder on me than he had to be. But on a personal 
basis, he was a good friend," Taylor said, giving him ample time off when his 
wife was dying of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert D. Wagner Jr., a commercial banker, recalled: "There are a lot of guys 
around who had run-ins with him during negotiations. Some people have the 
smooth touch and others the bludgeon. He took more the bludgeon approach." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington agrees that he was a tough negotiator but never more abrasive than 
necessary. He says he was under considerable financial pressure in the 
mid-1980s. "I was not sleeping well because I was concerned about the future of 
the firm." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, Huffington said he persuaded his father to sell the family's domestic 
oil exploration subsidiary to a French company. The sale price was not 
disclosed, but Huffington said he found himself flush with cash at age 41. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy Huffington had hoped his son would take the reins of the medium-sized oil 
company and make it "monstrous." But his son had a different idea. He wanted to 
cash out of the family business so he could follow his own dreams -- which 
included moving to California and entering politics. 
</P>
<P>
 The clincher came when President Bush offered to appoint Roy Huffington the 
U.S. ambassador to Austria. The family business, including the property amassed 
in downtown Houston, was sold to Taiwan's Chinese Petroleum Corp. for an 
estimated $600 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale left Roy Huffington, now 76, as one of the richest men in America 
with a fortune estimated by Forbes magazine at $310 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Huffington takes credit for the April, 1990, timing of the sale, which 
he said brought the family top dollar during a period of relatively high oil 
prices. Huffington moved to Montecito with his $70-million slice of the profits 
in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 He purchased a half-interest in Crest Films, a small production company, and 
encouraged its employees to make more feature films instead of documentaries 
and TV ads for big corporations. "The other side of me wants to make movies," 
he said. A Philosophical Side 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, an Episcopalian, says his quest for political office is driven by 
a spiritual calling, a desire to give something back to a country that has 
given him so much. 
</P>
<P>
 According to close friends, Huffington has spent years pondering philosophical 
questions about the meaning of life, his God-given purpose on Earth, and even 
why was he born into a family that became so wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Michael is an extraordinary idealist," said the Rev. James Parks Morton, an 
Episcopal priest at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York who is 
also a close friend and beneficiary of Huffington's charitable giving. "He 
takes all of this extremely seriously. God put him with these resources to do 
something good. He sees political leadership as the most important thing he can 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington often talks of restoring values in America to solve social ills 
ranging from teen-age pregnancy to inner-city violence. But these are not the 
traditional values that have become code words for the religious right. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Huffington is a fiscal conservative, he breaks from his party on 
social issues, favoring abortion rights, gun control and allowing gays in the 
military. The values he talks about are discipline, faith and responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 In many respects, Huffington's spiritual-political quest closely resembles the 
thesis of his wife's book, "The Fourth Instinct: The Call of the Soul." Her 
manifesto, released this month, explores the spiritual rewards of altruism and 
helping the needy. 
</P>
<P>
 Raised in the Presbyterian Church, Huffington was drawn to the popular sermons 
of an Episcopal priest in Houston in the 1980s and soon converted. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffco associate Mike Decker said Huffington frequently sought his thoughts on 
fundamental questions about the existence of God, human potential and what he 
wanted out of life. When Decker wanted to play golf, Huffington would press to 
go to dinner for another deep philosophical discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was so relentless," Decker said. "At first, it was sort of annoying, but 
then it became fascinating." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a paradox in a way," Decker said. "A strong emphasis on material life 
allowed him to get where he is. Yet his material success allowed his 
spiritual-creative side to develop." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington said he sees no inconsistency in his transition from hard-nosed 
businessman to spiritually driven altruist. He said his father "didn't go into 
his business to make money. . . . Nor was it my pursuit. My pursuit was making 
things happen, making things grow. I like to build things. Monopoly was a fun 
game for me." 
</P>
<P>
 He also said that he served widely on civic boards and often "shared what I 
got. I always took people out. I don't recall very often anybody paying for 
dinner. I took people on trips. I tried to be generous." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington says his political ambition comes from years of philosophical 
inquiry and prayer. "I'm absolutely, totally motivated by that," he said. 
"That's why every day I can get up and feel good about life, because I'm giving 
something back." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about what other giving he has done because of his spiritual quest, 
Huffington said: "I've volunteered time and made contributions to lots of 
organizations -- too numerous to even remember." 
</P>
<P>
 But the only times he can recall volunteering his time to help the needy were 
when he raised scholarship money at Stanford and served meals last New Year's 
Eve at two homeless shelters in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 After surfacing briefly at Stanford, Huffington's dormant interest in politics 
revived in Houston when he helped set up phone banks for Bush's first 
presidential campaign in 1980. He attended the Republican National Convention, 
painting signs for youthful demonstrators trying to get Bush picked as Reagan's 
running mate. 
</P>
<P>
 By January, 1984, he had a discussion with then-Vice President Bush and began 
a long search for a political appointment in Washington. To Reagan and Bush 
officials at the White House he indicated his interest in an array of 
high-level jobs in Defense, Interior, State and Treasury, White House records 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to knock on doors and sell myself," Huffington said. His job search 
coincided with a surge in the Huffington family's donations to Republican 
causes, which rose from $27,500 in the 1981-1982 election cycle to $66,000 in 
1983-84 and $95,350 in 1985-86. 
</P>
<P>
 In a note attached to his circulating resume, one White House staffer flagged 
its importance: "He comes from a prominent GOP family and Craig says he is 'big 
in oil and gas.' " 
</P>
<P>
 President Reagan nominated Huffington for assistant secretary of commerce for 
trade administration in September, 1984, but pulled the nomination from the 
Senate a few months later without explanation. Huffington said White House 
officials belatedly learned of a conflict of interest. Huffco routinely sought 
export licenses for its overseas operations from the assistant cmmerce 
secretary for trade administration. Huffington said he never lobbied government 
officials on behalf of Huffco. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later, Huffington landed a job as a deputy assistant secretary of 
defense. This was a lower-level job than his first, short-lived appointment, 
but did not require Senate confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the interim, Huffington met Arianna Stassinopoulos, a native of Greece, on 
a blind date arranged by Getty. The way he tells it, he immediately recognized 
her as his soul mate when he asked her: "What is the most important thing in 
your life?" 
</P>
<P>
 "God," she said, without hesitation. They were married within six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Arianna Huffington, a Cambridge University-educated, best-selling biographer 
of Pablo Picasso and Maria Callas, had been on a spiritual journey of her own 
that took her across hot coals and continents to sample various religions. 
Stint With Pentagon 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the Greek Orthodox Church, her longest spiritual association has 
been with controversial New Age leader John-Roger and his Movement of Spiritual 
Inner Awareness in Santa Monica. Huffington said he has had nothing to do with 
the Los Angeles group, but has not discouraged his wife's affiliation, which 
began 22 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after their honeymoon, Huffington began work as deputy assistant 
secretary of defense for negotiations policy. His principal duty was to review 
Defense Department position papers on conventional arms reductions and defend 
these positions at meetings with the State Department, the CIA and the National 
Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
 His yearlong tour of duty was not particularly satisfying, he said, given the 
tedious progress of arms-control talks in Europe. "The main thing is that I 
wanted to serve in the Administration," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His staff and superiors said Huffington had little understanding of the highly 
technical subjects. Many confessed that they were weary of having inexperienced 
political appointees dumped in their office.

 "This was a favor to George Bush who was a friend to the Huffingtons, but it 
was no favor to the rest of us," said Frank J. Gaffney Jr., who shared an 
office with Huffington and was his immediate supervisor in the final seven 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 "The organization continued to toil away under him and in some cases in spite 
of him," said Gaffney, now director of the Center for Security Policy in 
Washington. "It didn't matter where he was or what he was doing as long as he 
wasn't doing any damage." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington dismissed Gaffney as a contemptuous boss who never tried to find 
out what he was doing. 
</P>
<P>
 Near the end of his Pentagon employment, the Huffingtons had a stillborn son 
five months into the pregnancy. Huffington said he was devastated and went to 
an Episcopal monastery in New York with Decker, his Huffco colleague. The first 
24 hours was spent in total silence, followed by prayer and religious services. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very contemplative thing," Decker said. Huffington emerged three 
days later, talking about the brevity of life and how it was time to fulfill 
his long-postponed desire to move to California and get involved in public 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, 1988, the Huffingtons purchased a $4.3-million, 11,384-square-foot, 
Italian-style villa in the hills of Montecito near Santa Barbara. It was called 
Villa Ruscello. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, he challenged and defeated longtime Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino 
(R-Ventura) in a race that fractured the Santa Barbara County Republican Party. 
To win the seat, Huffington spent a record $5.2 million of his own money, an 
extravagance that stunned his family and longtime associates who knew him as a 
penny pincher. "I was floored when I saw the amounts he was spending," Decker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a couple of months on the job, he said Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas) and 
others began encouraging him to challenge Dianne Feinstein for her Senate seat. 
</P>
<P>
 He was interested, but did not make a commitment until that August when he 
traveled to Greece with Arianna and his two daughters. On the vacation, he 
briefly left his family to enter a Greek Orthodox monastery on Mt. Athos. 
</P>
<P>
 For three days, he spent time "praying and just looking over the sea and 
spending time with the monks," he said. "Psychologically, I was ready to go 
after I came off Mt. Athos."

BREAKING THE PARENT TRAP: HELPING DADS HELP CHILDREN; FAMILIES: RATHER THAN 
LOCK UP FATHERS WHO CAN'T PAY SUPPORT, A WELFARE REFORM PROJECT OFFERS JOB 
TRAINING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH SHOGREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David Misterka is a 23-year-old whose ex-girlfriend became pregnant when she 
was 16. Juan Alamo, 38, is divorcing his wife of 17 years. Shaun Benton is 
fresh from prison after serving time for robbery and hasn't seen his son for 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their differences, they have some things in common. They are absent 
fathers. Their children receive welfare benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 And the government is about to send them the bill, even though they are 
without jobs and say they cannot pay. The government is about to help them do 
that too. 
</P>
<P>
 The men, all from western Massachusetts, are part of a pilot program begun two 
years ago to teach the responsibilities of fatherhood, help develop job skills 
and find lucrative enough employment so fathers can send child support checks 
every two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, dubbed Parents' Fair Share, is one of scores of innovative 
efforts by reformers across the country aimed at decreasing welfare costs by 
making fathers pay up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad the government didn't lock me up but instead put me in this program 
and said: 'You're not alone, we're going to help you help yourself,' " said 
Alamo, who had been earning some money as a private investigator but not 
enough, he said, to help support his three children. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton's vision for revamping the welfare system calls for an 
assortment of new measures to catch up with fathers like Misterka, Alamo and 
Benton -- and the occasional absent mother as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The crackdown on non-custodial parents who fail to support their children is 
immensely popular politically. The President's denouncement of such parents 
during his State of the Union Address met with the loudest cheers of any of his 
proposals that evening. 
</P>
<P>
 The government will "say to absent parents who aren't paying their child 
support: 'If you're not providing for your children, we'll garnish your wages, 
suspend your license, track you across state lines and, if necessary, make some 
of you work off what you owe,' " Clinton said. "People who bring children into 
this world cannot and must not walk away from them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration estimates that it can save $1.4 billion by the 10th year of 
the program. The savings would be achieved primarily by persuading unwed 
fathers to admit paternity while their newborns are still in hospitals -- the 
period when, research shows, they are most likely to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Other savings would be achieved through a nationwide computer network to track 
deadbeat parents, enabling government officials to attach their wages, 
according to Bruce Reed, a presidential adviser and one of the chief architects 
of the President's evolving welfare reform plan. 
</P>
<P>
 While there appears to be widespread support for the crackdown, expensive 
efforts over the last two decades to collect from non-custodial parents have 
not been overwhelmingly successful. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm skeptical. We've spent the last 15 years trying to increase the child 
support for (welfare) families and have had only modest success," said Doug 
Besharov, a welfare specialist at the American Enterprise Institute for Public 
Policy Research, a nonpartisan research center. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of wishful thinking going on. The loudest round of support the 
President got in the State of the Union (Address) was when he talked about 
deadbeat dads because the politicians of both parties think that's the easiest 
target. There's a feeling these guys are no good -- that might be true -- and 
that it's going to be easy to collect -- that's not true," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite marked increases in establishing paternity, child support collections 
from fathers whose children receive welfare benefits have stayed constant or 
increased only gradually in most states. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, state governments collected child support payments from only 832,000, 
or 12%, of the 6.8 million absent parents whose children received Aid for 
Families With Dependent Children. Comparatively, the collection rate in 1988 
was 11%, or about 621,000 of 5.7 million absent parents. Total collections have 
increased, from $1.5 billion to $2.3 billion, over the same period. But the 
welfare rolls have swelled as well. 
</P>
<P>
 A large share of the absent parents are just not able to pay much child 
support, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people think that it's easy to lower welfare costs by using the 
(Internal Revenue Service) to force fathers to pay child support," said Gordon 
Berlin, a senior vice president at the New York-based Manpower Demonstration 
Research Corp., which designed the Parents' Fair Share program. "But most of 
these fathers are not paying taxes because they don't have mainstream jobs. 
These fathers work periodically off the books. The system has few options when 
fathers say they don't have any money." 
</P>
<P>
 Putting them in jail clearly would be counterproductive. The Administration 
believes the answer is to be tough -- and to give them the kind of help 
custodial parents on welfare get: job training and placement. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers and administrators in nine cities experimenting with Parents' Fair 
Share say it is too early to declare conclusively that the program is an 
economic solution to the child support dilemma. But they say they believe that 
initially, large investments in such efforts will pay off in long-term 
increases in child support payments and by encouraging absentee parents to be 
more involved in their children's lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators in states at the cutting edge of implementing in-hospital 
paternity establishment, such as Washington, Virginia and West Virginia, also 
said they have no hard data to prove their programs save welfare money. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I think over the long run it will decrease public assistance -- but not 
100% because a lot of these fathers aren't breadwinners, so they're never going 
to be able to pay," said Martha Hill, director of child support enforcement in 
West Virginia. The state has a new program that established legal paternity for 
more than half the children born out of wedlock last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the fathers in Parents' Fair Share in Springfield -- only a few 
mothers have gone through the program -- say the title "deadbeat dad" is a bum 
rap and argue that people should consider their perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporting themselves and their children at the same time can simply be 
impossible, they argue. Misterka, for instance, said he gave the mother of his 
2-year-old daughter money until he lost his job at an ice cream factory -- even 
though he never wanted to have a child. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't bother me to have to support my daughter, as long as I can still 
pay my own bills," said Misterka, 23, who is no longer involved with the 
mother. "In a way it's fair, but in a way it's not. It's the woman's decision 
to keep the baby or have an abortion. Guys don't have any control." 
</P>
<P>
 Misterka called the system biased against men. The state is demanding back 
child-support payments from him, even though he is out of work, he said, while 
his former girlfriend collects welfare, goes to college classes paid for by the 
state and sends their child to a subsidized day-care center. 
</P>
<P>
 Benton, a high school dropout who served three years in the state penitentiary 
for robbery, agreed: 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hustling for a job, but I've got no . . . high school diploma, no job 
skills. I need a break. I need time off, but my child-support back payments are 
already piling up. I know I need some education, but I need to pay child 
support." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Benton and Misterka, many absent parents are part of the socioeconomic 
group that has seen its real wages decline most rapidly in recent years: men 
without high school educations as well as those with diplomas but no job 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronnie Coleman, 30, is a high school dropout who has never held a job for 
long. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had lots of jobs, but they never last more than six months," he said. 
"They always seem to be dead-end things. The highest salary I've made in three 
years is $7.50 an hour." Parents' Fair Share has raised his hopes higher than 
they've ever been, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They tell me I can get a solid job, a permanent job so I can take care of my 
family," Coleman said as he nervously prepared for an interview one recent 
afternoon. "All I can do is pray." 
</P>
<P>
 Many men in the program said they are providing for their children but not 
through the government. When custodial parents are on welfare, the 
child-support enforcement system collects directly from the non-custodial 
parent and gives the custodial parent $50 a month -- in part to encourage them 
to cooperate in naming and tracking down the other parent. The rest of the 
money is used to offset the welfare payment. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is a lot of incentive for both parents to avoid the system. Some 
absent parents, for instance, say they resent that the government decides how 
much they can afford to pay, while others complain that only a fraction of the 
money they provide reaches their children. Many custodial parents think they 
can get a better deal by collecting the payments themselves and keeping the 
arrangement secret from welfare caseworkers. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Calabrese, who went through the Parents' Fair Share program, said he 
learned about that practice the hard way when he was called into court and told 
that he owed more than $10,000 in child support. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never deadbeated," said Calabrese, 28, who was unemployed when he started 
the program but now works in an auto body shop. "She (the mother of his child) 
was collecting welfare without telling me while I was paying her child 
support." 
</P>
<P>
 Since he began working more than a year and a half ago at a job the program 
helped him get, Calabrese's wages have been attached, his tax refunds have been 
confiscated and his credit has been ruined, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really am fired up about it," Calabrese said, his face flushing with anger. 
"I can see why guys don't want to pay. I never wanted to lose my family. Now 
she stays home, collects welfare and has some guy living with her, while I'm 
out working. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "They forced me to go to that program and get a job," he added. "She should be 
forced to work too." 
</P>
<P>
 Calabrese's case is a success for the system. For more than a year and a half 
he has been paying child support to the government and offsetting the welfare 
payments his ex-wife receives. 
</P>
<P>
 But such successes come at great cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Since its beginning in July, 1992, the Springfield program has cost $910,000. 
By the end of last month, 569 people had participated, 134 were given 
unsubsidized jobs and 78, including Calabrese, were placed in apprenticeships 
in which the program paid half of their salaries for up to four months. 
</P>
<P>
 The program also is credited with getting dozens more absent parents to pay 
child support in an unexpected way: When a judge ordered them to attend the 
program full time for 17 days, they confessed to having jobs and began making 
the payments voluntarily. In Grand Rapids, Mich., another Parents' Fair Share 
site, 14% of the absent parents ordered to participate in the program admitted 
to having jobs and subsequently began paying child support, Berlin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlin, the Administration and welfare administrators around the country 
argued that no welfare reform plan will work unless it is designed to ensure 
that both parents contribute. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the custodial parents who would be forced to work under the 
anticipated Clinton welfare plan are unlikely ever to get jobs that would pay 
enough to lift them out of poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to put together an income stream that has everybody contributing -- 
Mom, the government and Dad too," Berlin said. 
</P>
<P>
 With 30% of all children born out of wedlock, up from 18% in 1980, the system 
must start with early paternity establishment, officials argue. 
</P>
<P>
 By Jan. 1, 1995, all states will be required to have systems that will enable 
fathers to be identified in all hospitals and birthing centers. Such programs 
have been surprisingly effective. In West Virginia, more than half of the unwed 
fathers were identified last year under that state's new paternity program. 
</P>
<P>
 Welfare administrators and child-support enforcement officials like such 
programs because collecting support for welfare children without legal fathers 
is so difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 To be eligible for AFDC, the government requires mothers to name the father so 
they can track him down and order him to pay child support. But many mothers 
claim that they do not know the father's identity -- or they give a false name. 
</P>
<P>
 In South Carolina, in the first 11 months of 1993, for example, 37% of the 
2,840 fathers named were excluded by genetic testing.

RALPH ELLISON, 'INVISIBLE MAN' AUTHOR, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ralph Ellison, whose only novel, "Invisible Man," became not only a dramatic 
cry for racial understanding but a work cherished over four decades for its 
complex yet poignant literary style, died Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellison, whose essays and novel propelled him into the front ranks of 
20th-Century American fiction, died of pancreatic cancer at his home in Harlem, 
said Joe Fox, his editor at Random House, Ellison's publisher. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox said Ellison had been ill for only a short time. Random House had a party 
for him on March 1 to celebrate his 80th birthday and "he was perfectly fine," 
Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
 When "Invisible Man" was published in 1952, its author was a virtually unknown 
history and music student whose influences ranged from Langston Hughes to Mark 
Twain. 
</P>
<P>
 After 16 weeks on the bestseller lists and a National Book Award, Ralph Waldo 
Ellison (he was named after the philosopher-essayist) had become a household 
name among readers, regardless of color. His lone published novel -- he had 
worked on a second but most of the manuscript perished in a fire -- has not 
been out of print since. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics, scholars and readers see it as a convoluted study of a young black 
man who is struggling to affirm and make meaningful his race. He makes war on 
the twin standards of segregation that had forced him out of the mainstream and 
made him feel that he was less than a man. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellison himself was not only a sensitive youth in some conflict with his 
color, but an English scholar fascinated with the literature of his time. 
</P>
<P>
 His contention that American blacks were invisible because they were seen only 
as stereotypes, was couched in the classic, stylistic tumult of T.S. Eliot and 
the psychological myth of James Joyce. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellison found the impetus and strength to respond to the stereotype in the 
popular music of his day, saying years later that blues singer Jimmy Rushing 
"represented, gave voice to, something which was very affirming of Negro life, 
feelings which you couldn't really put into words." 
</P>
<P>
 But it was a Fats Waller lyric that he credited with driving him to focus the 
painful introspection of autobiography that was evidenced in "Invisible Man." 
</P>
<P>
 "What did I do," asked the plaintive refrain, "to be so black and blue?" 
</P>
<P>
 The first lines of "Invisible Man" have become among the best known in 
American literature: 
</P>
<P>
 "I am an invisible man. No, I am not a spook like those who haunted Edgar 
Allan Poe; nor am I one of your Hollywood-movie ectoplasms. I am a man of 
substance, of flesh and bone, fiber and liquids -- and I might even be said to 
possess a mind. I am invisible, understand, simply because people refuse to see 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 The book tells of a young man from the South who journeys to Harlem. 
</P>
<P>
 The nameless narrator finds a symbol of oppression there that Ellison dubbed 
the "Monopolated Light and Power Company." The central character moves from 
sight to blindness, from shadow to sun, as he battles the monolith in a plot 
difficult to summarize because of its personal and literary allusions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Negro (Ellison generally preferred that word to black) protagonist even 
incurs the enmity of his own people while managing to somehow drain power 
(control) from his arch-foe. 
</P>
<P>
 The mysterious journey takes place above ground except for Prologue and 
Epilogue, which occur in the narrator's Underground Chamber near Harlem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who knows," the narrator wonders at the end, "but that on the lower 
frequencies, I speak for you?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Invisible Man" has been called a near-perfect example of the German 
Bildungsroman or a psychological and educational work that both informs and 
entertains. 
</P>
<P>
 "Invisible Man" has been translated into Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, 
French, German, Hebrew, Swedish and Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellison later published two collections of essays and was working on restoring 
his second novel at the time of his death. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike his narrator, Ellison was not a true son of the South. He was born in 
Oklahoma City to a construction worker father who died when he was 3 and raised 
by his mother who did domestic work to support them. But he said he still found 
in that frontier land vestiges of racial prejudice despite the more fluid 
relationships between whites and blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews with such newspapers as the Chicago Tribune, he loved to talk of 
how the city had set up a separate library for blacks but a black minister 
continued to insist on using the main, segregated branch. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials became disgusted and threw great piles of books into an 
abandoned pool hall. As a result, young Ellison found himself with free access 
to the world's greatest minds. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent three years studying classical composition at Alabama's Tuskegee 
Institute and then headed to New York, where, like his protagonist in the 
novel, he became a writer. He came under the guidance of Richard Wright, the 
most prominent black writer of the time. Wright introduced him to "Native Son," 
Wright's early, definitive work of the black experience, while poet Hughes 
introduced Ellison to Andre Malraux, the French essayist and Marxist. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellison said he took the best from both while also falling under the influence 
of Dostoevsky, Conrad, Eliot and Joyce. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright was the first to publish Ellison's writings in a magazine he was then 
editing. 
</P>
<P>
 During World War II, Ellison served in the Merchant Marine and returned ready 
to write a novel about a black American soldier captured by the Germans. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened instead, he said, was that he was obsessed with his existence 
that he saw only as "invisible." The book that came from that dark thought took 
seven years to write. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellison did not live long enough to completely reconstruct his second novel, 
which he said featured the childhood reminiscences of Cleothus, at 300 pounds 
the biggest kid in the first grade. He did publish the two collections of 
essays, "Shadow and Act" in 1964 and "Going to the Territory" in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellison taught and lectured at Yale, Rutgers, New York University, the 
University of Chicago and Bard College in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 His awards included the nation's highest civilian honor -- the Medal of 
Freedom -- and membership in its most prestigious literary organization, the 
American Academy Institute of Arts and Letters. 
</P>
<P>
 In his late years Ellison said he had sought to create works of literary merit 
built on scaffolds of social causes. 
</P>
<P>
 What he perceived as current pessimism among blacks concerned him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the country can afford (it)," Ellison said. "By some strange 
quirk of American fate it is the Afro-American who has sustained the nation's 
optimism. If we can be optimistic down at the bottom of the social pyramid, 
then everyone else can afford to look and say, 'If they still believe, what the 
hell are we complaining about.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Ellison is survived by his wife, Fanny, and a brother. Ellison's Writings

 Excerpts from the writings of Ralph Ellison: 
</P>
<P>
 * "I am an invisible man. No, I am not a spook like those who haunted Edgar 
Allan Poe; nor am I one of your Hollywood-movie ectoplasms. I am a man of 
substance, of flesh and bone, fiber and liquids -- and I might even be said to 
possess a mind. I am invisible, understand, simply because people refuse to see 
me. Like the bodiless heads you see sometimes in circus sideshows, it is as 
though I have been surrounded by mirrors of hard, distorting glass. When they 
approach me they see only my surroundings, themselves, or figments of their 
imagination -- indeed, everything and anything except me." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Opening of "Invisible Man." 
</P>
<P>
 * "In the beginning was not the shadow, but the act, and the province of 
Hollywood is not action, but illusion. Actually, the anti-Negro images of the 
films were (and are) acceptable because of the existence throughout the United 
States of an audience obsessed with an inner psychological need to view Negroes 
as less than men. Thus, psychologically and ethically, these negative images 
constitute justifications for all those acts, legal, emotional, economic and 
political, which we label Jim Crow. The anti-Negro image is thus a ritual 
object of which Hollywood is not the creator, but the manipulator. Its role has 
been that of justifying the widely held myth of Negro unhumanness and 
inferiority by offering entertaining rituals through which that myth could be 
reaffirmed." 
</P>
<P>
 -- From the essay "The Shadow and the Act," Dec. 6, 1949. 
</P>
<P>
 * "In the old days the voice was high and clear and poignantly lyrical. 
Steel-bright in its upper range and, at its best, silky smooth, it was 
possessed of a purity somehow impervious to both the stress of singing above a 
twelve-piece band and the urgency of (Jimmy) Rushing's own blazing fervor. On 
dance nights, when you stood on the rise of the school grounds two blocks to 
the east, you could hear it jetting from the dance hall like a blue flame in 
the dark; now soaring high above the trumpets and trombones, now skimming the 
froth of reeds and rhythm as it called some woman's anguished name -- or

swinging band."

AMID SERB STRIKES, U.N. FORCE SEEKS A RECAST BOSNIA ROLE; BALKANS: BROADEN 
PEACEKEEPERS' POWERS OR PULL OUT ALTOGETHER, OFFICIALS REPORTEDLY URGE. REBELS 
STEP UP GORAZDE POUNDING, AND A BRITISH JET IS SHOT DOWN.

 Humiliated by Serbian rebels who have attacked Bosnian civilians and U.N. 
troops with impunity, officials of the U.N. Protection Force on Saturday 
proclaimed their mission "meaningless" if the Serbs' aggression continues, and 
sources said they are considering pulling out of the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
 After U.N. officials were unable to halt another Serbian onslaught against the 
besieged Muslim enclave of Gorazde, the civilian chief of the peacekeeping 
force reluctantly authorized punitive air strikes. One of two British jets 
answering the call for air strikes was shot down, and no Serbian targets were 
attacked. 
</P>
<P>
 But the mission chief, Yasushi Akashi of Japan, also announced that he is 
appealing to his U.N. superiors for urgent reconsideration of the entire 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Since NATO staged a limited bombing raid against Serbian heavy artillery 
attacking Gorazde last week, angry rebels have overrun much of the 
U.N.-designated safe area, fired on U.N. aircraft and soldiers, taken 
peacekeepers captive and expelled Western journalists. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, a surface-to-air missile fired by Serbian nationalist forces near 
Gorazde downed a British Sea Harrier carrying out a search-and-destroy mission 
against Serbian tank units, reported Maj. Rob Annink, the U.N. spokesman for 
Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot ejected safely into Bosnian government-held territory, but the 
attack on the plane highlighted the recent harassment and menacing of U.N. 
peacekeepers deployed to Bosnia 21 months ago to assist in humanitarian relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, U.N. officials claimed to have arranged a provisional cease-fire for 
all of Bosnia on condition the Serbian rebels release all U.N. hostages and 
that the mission, in return, call off NATO warplanes buzzing the Gorazde 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 Western mediators and U.N. officials were expected to discuss the truce with 
the Serbs today. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 200 U.N. soldiers have been taken captive by the Serbs in retaliation 
for last week's air strikes by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
Movements are restricted for the more than 4,300 peacekeepers deployed in 
Sarajevo, and attacks on U.N. personnel have skyrocketed. 
</P>
<P>
 The British jet downed Saturday was from the British Royal Navy carrier Ark 
Royal on patrol in the Adriatic Sea, a NATO official in Brussels said. It was 
reportedly one of two planes from the ship responding to a U.N. request to 
attack Serbian forces besieging Gorazde late Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "The two aircraft were attempting to conduct a close air support mission (and 
had targeted) a tank reported to have been firing directly into Gorazde," said 
a statement issued by NATO's Southern Command headquarters in Naples, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO officials in Brussels said one of the Sea Harriers was hit near the 
target area and that the pilot managed to eject safely. He was reportedly 
rescued by helicopter and returned to the Ark Royal without serious injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "He suffered only minor scratches," a NATO official said in Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
 The NATO statement noted that neither plane actually fired at the tank. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Saturday, a U.N. plane carrying the mission commander, French Gen. 
Bertrand de Lapresle, was hit by three shots as it landed at Sarajevo's 
airport. A French reconnaissance aircraft was also damaged by gunfire a day 
earlier when it flew over Serb-held positions near Gorazde. 
</P>
<P>
 The deliberate targeting of U.N. aircraft prompted suspension of U.N. air 
traffic and closure of Sarajevo's airport, which already had been closed to 
relief flights as a security precaution. 
</P>
<P>
 Near Gorazde a day earlier, a British special forces officer was killed and 
another wounded when the rebels fired on their clearly marked observation 
vehicle with artillery and small-arms fire. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of a particularly devastating day for the U.N. mission, Akashi 
announced Saturday night that "unless there was serious and manifest intention 
by the Bosnian Serb army, supported by clear action and cooperation on the 
ground, it would be meaningless in the present circumstances for UNPROFOR to 
continue to fulfill its present activities." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. mission chief said he was "urgently reviewing the future role and 
status" of the peacekeeping mission with U.N. Secretary General Boutros 
Boutros-Ghali and that the two would soon approach the Security Council for new 
orders. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. sources said the officials would appeal to the Security Council to either 
empower the mission to use force to protect its troops and endangered civilians 
or to pull it out altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 One source close to the mission command said officials were leaning toward a 
complete pullout of the 33,000 troops deployed throughout the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. commander for Bosnia, British Lt. Gen. Michael Rose, denounced the 
situation as "untenable" after Serbian gunmen killed the British military 
observer near Gorazde on Friday. Rose's appeal to Akashi to order air strikes 
then was turned down. 
</P>
<P>
 The current mission mandate charges the U.N. soldiers in Bosnia with little 
more than escorting relief goods. Some peacekeeping duties have been added with 
the designation of six U.N.-protected safe areas, including Sarajevo. But the 
13,000 soldiers deployed to Bosnia are authorized to use weapons only in 
self-defense, which has prevented them from offering more than symbolic 
protection of embattled Bosnian civilians in the face of heavily armed Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Akashi conceded that the U.N. mission is incapable of fully defending Gorazde, 
saying too few troops are at Rose's disposal and that U.N. officers are unclear 
just what parts of the safe area they are obliged to protect. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials have privately accused Akashi of stubbornly pursuing a failed 
course of diplomacy with the Serbs, who have dragged out peace talks for nearly 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Russia's special envoy to the Balkans, Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaly S. 
Churkin, conceded that the prospects for a peaceful solution looked bleak. 
</P>
<P>
 "It isn't going very well," Churkin told the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug after 
a weeklong endeavor to bring angry Serbs and the Muslim-led government back to 
the negotiating table. On Saturday, Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev 
flew to Belgrade for emergency talks with Serbian officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Buoyed by the international community's reluctance to use force, the Serbian 
rebels have challenged U.N. troops to give up on their mission. The deputy 
military chief, Gen. Milan Gvero, insisted that Rose be replaced before his 
rebels would consider resuming negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian government leaders have warned that U.N. timidity has emboldened the 
Serbs to further aggression and scuttled any hopes of a negotiated solution. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can you talk to the Serbs now, when they think they have defeated all of 
NATO?" asked Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic boasted that Gorazde would be captured 
Saturday, a Belgrade radio station reported. His headquarters had called for 
Gorazde's surrender a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The crisis within the peacekeeping mission has unfolded in tandem with the 
deadly Serbian assault on Gorazde, which government officials warn is on the 
verge of falling. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbian rebels now hold all of the high ground around the city and have 
inflicted terror and bedlam with incessant firing into densely populated 
suburbs and city apartment blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 240 people have been killed since the offensive began March 30, said 
Kris Janowski, spokesman for the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for 
Refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 The refugee agency said that it has no contingency plan for evacuating 
Gorazde's 65,000 residents and refugees because the enclave is surrounded by 
hostile Serbian territory and no other area of Bosnia is prepared to 
accommodate such an influx. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do hope some sort of cease-fire can be worked out, because the fall of 
Gorazde, which is packed with refugees, would cause a humanitarian disaster, 
most likely with tens of thousands of people fleeing in disarray," Janowski 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 While Rose and other U.N. military officials have contended throughout the 
Serbian advance on Gorazde that the rebels are unlikely to conquer the enclave, 
those outside the doomed mission fear that the Serbs have every intention of 
applying their brutal policy of "ethnic cleansing" to the area supposedly under 
U.N. protection. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorazde, Zepa, Srebrenica and Bihac -- all U.N.-designated safe areas -- are 
besieged pockets of Muslim communities surrounded by Serb-held territory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Serbs' long-term strategy is obviously to sweep the enclaves," 
one U.N. official said. "They are not interested in having these little ulcers 
here and there. . . . Gorazde will be a test case. If it falls, the others will 
follow quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 2 million people have already been displaced and more than 200,000 
are dead or missing since Serbian nationalists rebelled against Bosnia's March, 
1992, vote for independence from Yugoslavia.

CLINTON CALLS FOR STEPS TO RID PROJECTS OF GUNS; CRIME: THE PRESIDENT PROPOSES 
USING METAL DETECTORS AND REGULAR FRISKING. A CHICAGO COURT RULING BLOCKS 
SWEEPS IN SEARCH OF WEAPONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In an effort to get guns out of gang-infested public housing projects, 
President Clinton called Saturday for installing metal detectors at the 
entrances to crime-ridden buildings and for regular frisking of people who 
might be carrying weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every law-abiding American, rich or poor, has the right to raise children 
without fear of criminals terrorizing where they live," Clinton said in his 
weekly radio address. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Administration policy on guns in public housing came in response to a 
ruling by a federal judge in Chicago that blocked authorities from conducting 
sweeps of apartments in search of weapons. Such mass searches without probable 
cause violate the Fourth Amendment's ban on unreasonable searches and seizures, 
U.S. District Judge Wayne R. Anderson said in his April 7 ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 But Administration officials said public housing authorities may take a series 
of strict steps to seize weapons without violating the Constitution. They also 
said the vast majority of residents in public housing support stronger 
gun-control measures. 
</P>
<P>
 "The residents have requested these sweeps," Housing and Urban Development 
Secretary Henry G. Cisneros said at a White House briefing Saturday. "They are 
nearly desperate with the conditions as they are." 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros outlined five steps that officials in Chicago and elsewhere can use 
for regaining control of their buildings from gangs and drug dealers: 
</P>
<P>
 * Put armed police and metal detectors at the entrances to buildings. "It is 
essential to get control of the lobbies," Cisneros said. Some buildings in 
Chicago use "rent-a-cops" who are intimidated by armed gang members, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Erect fences around public housing projects. This simple step has cut crime 
by 40% in some cities and put a stop to rampant drug dealing in the projects, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Conduct weapon searches in common areas of the projects, such as grounds and 
stairwells. While the Fourth Amendment generally bars police from entering a 
person's apartment without a warrant, it does not bar them from searching for 
weapons in hallways, stairwells or vacant units. 
</P>
<P>
 * Frisk suspicious-looking individuals for weapons. The Supreme Court has said 
repeatedly that officers can "pat down" a person they believe may be involved 
in a crime to see if the suspect has a gun or knife. 
</P>
<P>
 * Urge tenants to sign consent forms that permit police searches for weapons. 
Cisneros said public housing tenants are required to permit inspections as part 
of maintenance procedures, and they might be willing to permit regular, 
unit-by-unit searches to rid their buildings of drugs and weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "The residents could vote on this. That would be an important factor in a 
court test," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the notion of a majority-mandated consent could pose legal problems. In 
his ruling, Anderson said tenants who favor unit-by-unit inspections cannot 
vote to "suspend their neighbors' rights" against unwanted searches. 
</P>
<P>
 In past decisions, the Supreme Court has upheld searches of a person's home or 
property when the owner consented in advance, but the justices have stressed 
that consent must be voluntary. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Assistant Atty. Gen. William Bryson suggested that public housing 
tenants could be required to permit regular searches of their units as part of 
their lease agreements. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under some circumstances, it can be a condition of the lease," Bryson told 
reporters. "We can square this with the Fourth Amendment. We are dealing with 
an emergency situation." 
</P>
<P>
 In their comments, Administration officials emphasized that they were focusing 
on crime-ridden housing units where gangs have taken control and where 
shootings are routine. 
</P>
<P>
 The new anti-crime steps "would not be appropriate for a senior citizens 
center in Sarasota that hasn't had any crime problems," Bryson said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his radio address, Clinton said crime and violence in public housing 
projects is taking away the basic rights of the children who grow up there. 
</P>
<P>
 "They include the right to go out to the playground and the right to sit by an 
open window, the right to walk to the corner without fear of gunfire, the right 
to go to school safely in the morning and the right to celebrate your 10th 
birthday without coming home to bloodshed and terror," the President said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago has 67 high-rise public housing buildings in a four-mile stretch of 
South State Street, Cisneros said, and gangs have taken control of several 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past week, he said, there were 15 shootings and five deaths in these 
complexes. Young drug dealers, using high-powered rifles from the upper floors, 
pick off their rivals walking below, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The get-tough policies announced Saturday "are targeted to Chicago, but the 
same approach will be available to other communities," Cisneros said.

ARKANSAN PUSHED AS 'GUTSY' CHOICE FOR SUPREME COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Around the White House, some refer to it as the "guts option." Others call it 
crazy. 
</P>
<P>
 At first glance, the decision in question would not appear to merit either 
label, for it involves nominating to the Supreme Court one of the nation's most 
highly esteemed federal judges, a noted legal scholar and writer whose work has 
been praised by admirers ranging from conservative writer William F. Buckley to 
liberal former Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, before becoming a judge, he was engaged in precisely the sort of 
public-interest work that President Clinton values highly. 
</P>
<P>
 There is, however, a big problem. Federal Appeals Court Judge Richard S. 
Arnold comes from Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arnold's credentials are unassailable," a senior White House official said 
Saturday. "But we don't operate in a world without politics." 
</P>
<P>
 As Clinton begins once again to concentrate on filling the court vacancy -- 
after Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) withdrew his name from 
consideration -- Arnold has emerged as one of a small number of leading 
candidates, Administration officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The consideration of Arnold has divided Clinton's advisers between "theorists" 
and "pragmatists," said one senior official. 
</P>
<P>
 The theorists argue that Arnold should not be denied the nomination because of 
an accident of birth. The pragmatists respond that even if it is unfair, this 
is simply not the time. 
</P>
<P>
 One camp contends that a President already besieged by charges of Arkansas 
cronyism -- and facing key tests on important legislation -- can ill afford to 
name a resident of Little Rock to the nation's highest court. "Given the 
climate, it would be a problem," said one leading Clinton adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 The other camp asserts that Arnold would be a sure bet if he came from any 
other state and that Clinton would appear weak and foolish if he were to 
decline to nominate the judge because of what his aides and the President 
himself see as unfair anti-Arkansas prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President cannot fail to appoint him for that reason," said a senior 
aide. "That would just be political weakness." 
</P>
<P>
 However, "that's different from saying he's the choice," the aide continued, 
noting that Clinton could decide the matter on the basis of some other issue. 
</P>
<P>
 That other issue could be the question of diversity. Clinton is under pressure 
to pick a member of a minority group, particularly a Latino, for the court 
vacancy. 
</P>
<P>
 The main Latino candidate, U.S. District Judge Jose A. Cabranes of 
Connecticut, lacks Arnold's scholarly credentials and political experience, but 
many of Clinton's political advisers say they believe that choosing the 
nation's first Latino justice would be a major plus. 
</P>
<P>
 As the debate mounts, Arnold's backers, including some of the nation's most 
prominent judges and lawyers, are waging a quiet campaign to boost his 
prospects, calling the White House and members of the Senate to urge his 
nomination. The effort provides a rare glimpse at the backstage jockeying that 
goes into the making of a high court candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort to "nationalize" Arnold's candidacy, as one architect of the effort 
put it, began last year, when Justice Harry A. Blackmun's resignation was just 
an expectation. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold's friends, including Brennan and federal Appeals Court Judge Patricia 
M. Wald of Washington and former Appellate Judge A. Leon Higginbotham Jr. of 
Philadelphia, put together a special issue of the University of Minnesota Law 
Review as a tribute to Arnold on his 15th anniversary as an appellate judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold's friends now actively circulate the issue, which includes favorable 
reviews of many of his legal opinions. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign has accelerated since Mitchell's withdrawal, with lawyers and 
judges calling senators and urging them to voice support for Arnold. They have 
concentrated particularly on Republicans, hoping to reassure the White House 
that appointing him would not set off a partisan battle. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort has met with some success. Despite Arnold's liberalism, three 
conservative Republicans -- Sens. Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, Connie Mack of 
Florida and Thad Cochran of Mississippi -- have voiced support for him in 
recent days. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had a number of good friends of mine call -- lawyers with great respect 
at the bar who have contacted me," Cochran said. After the calls, Cochran said, 
he called White House officials "to tell them I thought very highly of Judge 
Arnold." 
</P>
<P>
 "If merit and qualifications rule this debate," Cochran added, Arnold should 
have a good chance to "come out on top." 
</P>
<P>
 The jockeying is likely to intensify over the next several days. Clinton would 
like to make the decision before the end of this month, according to White 
House Counsel Lloyd N. Cutler, who told reporters Friday to expect an 
announcement in about two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 That schedule would not preclude the addition of a new candidate to the list 
of those already under consideration, but it would make such a move difficult. 
At a Friday meeting, Clinton asked for "more information" about existing 
candidates but did not express an immediate desire for more names, the senior 
aide said. 
</P>
<P>
 The child of a prominent Texarkana family long active in the law and in 
Democratic politics, Arnold, 58, would seem to possess many of the qualities 
Clinton has said he would like to see in a high court justice: formidable 
intellect, a "big heart" and practical experience of life beyond the federal 
bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold was first in his class at both Yale University and Harvard Law School. 
He served a Supreme Court clerkship with Brennan and practiced law with one of 
Washington's premier firms before returning to his native state. There, in 
addition to his regular practice, he handled public interest cases, 
representing civil rights plaintiffs and the Environmental Defense Fund, among 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 After failing in two attempts to win election to Congress, he became a top 
aide to then-Gov. Dale Bumpers, and subsequently came to Washington for four 
years after Bumpers was elected to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 As a federal judge for 16 years, Arnold has held a series of judicial 
administrative posts, representing the judiciary in its annual budget 
presentations to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 His opinions have a generally liberal cast, particularly on civil rights and 
civil liberties issues. In one of the most notable cases, in 1989, Arnold wrote 
a sweeping order directing Arkansas to redraw its state legislative and 
congressional voting-district lines after finding that existing boundaries had 
prevented the election of blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The case, which led to greatly increased black representation in the state, 
was brought to court during the 1980s by C. Lani Guinier, whom Clinton later 
nominated, then abandoned, for the post of head of the Justice Department's 
civil rights division. 
</P>
<P>
 Among mid-level White House officials, many of whom feel the Administration's 
opponents have used anti-Arkansas sneering to weaken Clinton, support for the 
Arnold option seems to have grown steadily in recent days. Many seem almost 
eager to see the President use the appointment of a clearly well-qualified 
judge to take on his critics. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be the gutsy move," said one White House official who falls into the 
pro-Arnold camp. "It would give the President a chance to show he stands up for 
his friends."

ELECTRIC UTILITIES FACE POWER SHIFT WITH NEW RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Public Utilities Commission is expected to unveil a proposal 
Wednesday that could dramatically change how the state's electric utilities do 
business -- an overhaul that could shift billions of dollars in rate payments 
among residential, small business and industrial customers. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement will easily be the most dramatic moment in a deregulation 
process being watched around the world, as governments attempt to remodel the 
basic role of electric utilities -- fundamentally unchanged for more than a 
century -- largely to promote competition and accommodate new, cheaper 
technologies. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on the approach favored by the commission, residential customers 
could see savings of as much as 30% on their monthly bills, according to one 
estimate. Other scenarios could boost residential rates in California, already 
50% higher than the U.S. average. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, the utilities -- already stressed financially by the state's 
weak economy and other ills -- are concerned that the proposed changes could 
deal them another blow. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists, like most other interested parties, favor change. But they 
worry that the state's much-vaunted support for non-fossil fuel energy and 
environmental protection could be threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are at a moment of enormous opportunity and enormous risk," said Ralph 
Cavanagh, energy program director of the Natural Resources Defense Council, an 
environmental group. "This is the most environmentally and economically 
significant industry in the state of California," Cavanagh said. "The stakes 
are very high here." 
</P>
<P>
 PUC officials, who have been working on their secretive deregulation proposal 
for a year, have declined to reveal details of the plan they will make public 
Wednesday. But commission President Daniel W. Fessler -- who hopes to hold 
hearings on the proposal as early as June -- describes it as a response to 
"very significant changes in the electric service industry that were being felt 
not only in California but in other American states and in a number of other 
countries." 
</P>
<P>
 One big change in the industry has been technical -- particularly, the 
development of what is known as a natural gas combined-cycle turbine. 
</P>
<P>
 "The simple discovery that you could harness a stationary jet engine and use 
that to burn natural gas," Fessler said, has meant that electricity can now 
often be made cheaper -- and in small plants scattered throughout a utilities' 
service territory -- than it can be generated in a utility's big power plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of non-fossil fuels, meanwhile, say that wind power can now compete 
with big central plants. And others argue that energy conservation projects -- 
such as subsidies for superefficient refrigerators -- can be cheaper to mount 
than building generating facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 All this means that one reason big, publicly regulated electric utilities 
existed in the first place -- that they alone could make electricity -- may no 
longer apply. Other, smaller companies can do it now too, and often more 
cheaply. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a challenge to the working assumption that electrical generation was 
a natural monopoly," Fessler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, the basic compact between society and a utility was forged with 
the earliest electric companies to avoid the prospect of tangled, competing 
networks of wires and power plants. The utilities agreed to provide reliable, 
low-cost power in exchange for monopolies on their geographical territories and 
an assured but regulated profit. 
</P>
<P>
 That profit was based on how much electricity the utilities made and sold -- 
with no incentives to conserve or to buy from other sources. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the new economics of power generation, government regulators have 
been struggling to alter that pattern. Wednesday's expected announcement will 
be the PUC's proposal for doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot of very cheap electricity out there right now," said Robert 
Finkelstein, an attorney for Toward Utility Rate Normalization, a San 
Francisco-based consumer group. "One potential impact of restructuring is that 
the commission could tell the utilities: 'Thank you for your efforts in the 
generation business for the last hundred years, but now it's time to capture 
the benefits that we've already seen in the wholesale (electricity) market.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, a robust wholesale market linking utilities with other power 
generators has developed, spurred by deregulation under several recent federal 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
 In turn, lower prices on the wholesale market have attracted the gaze of big 
industrial users of electricity, some of which -- such as aluminum smelters -- 
devote up to a third of their operating budgets to buying power. 
</P>
<P>
 Now these users want to turn the regulatory screw a big notch further, to 
allow them to buy electricity directly from producers -- whether their local 
utility or independent producers -- under a system called retail wheeling. 
</P>
<P>
 This highly contentious proposal has yet to be fully implemented anywhere, but 
the utility industry is obsessed with the looming threat of widespread 
desertion by its business customers. Retail wheeling is one of the range of 
proposals that the PUC has weighed over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 One prospect, known in the industry as the "death spiral," envisions the 
utilities losing their biggest customers to independents, being left only as 
transporters of electricity, much like today's natural gas utilities. 
Industrial customers -- which are much cheaper to serve than the house-to-house 
systems for residential users -- might no longer share the cost of the 
utility's infrastructure, driving up rates to the remaining residential and 
small business customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Another uncertainty is what would happen to investments the utilities have 
made in power plants, which could be "stranded" -- that is, a cost to the 
utility without users to pay for it -- if cheaper power suppliers are allowed 
to compete for retail customers. 
</P>
<P>
 This possibility has prompted environmentalists to join the utilities in 
opposing retail wheeling because that system could favor the cheapest power, 
whether it was generated in an environmentally benign way or not. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, renewable energy producers have reason to worry because their 
electricity is not yet as cost-competitive as its proponents believe, according 
to Edward J. Tirello Jr., a senior utilities analyst with NatWest Securities in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at the new order that's coming," Tirello said recently, "the 
low-cost producer is the producer of choice. It will mean lower rates for 
everyone. But it will also mean one thing: All these higher-cost renewables . . 
. are out the window. When you're running a business on razor-thin margins, you 
can't do that."

U.S. STRUGGLING TO RESTART TALKS FOR BALKAN PEACE 
</P>

 As fighting continued Saturday around the besieged Bosnian town of Gorazde, 
U.S. officials struggled to reignite stalled diplomatic efforts to end the 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 In a telephone conversation early Saturday morning, Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher warned Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev that continued 
Serbian attacks on Gorazde would force the United Nations to respond 
militarily, U.S. officials said. Christopher urged Kozyrev to "use whatever 
influence he had" to defuse the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Kozyrev later flew to Belgrade for emergency talks with Serbian officials in 
an effort to revive the stalled peace talks. Kozyrev's mission, one White House 
official said, "is intended to put pressure on them (the Serbs) to get back to 
the negotiating table." 
</P>
<P>
 Kozyrev's involvement would intensify Russian efforts to defuse the tense 
standoff between the Bosnian Serb forces and the U.N. peacekeepers in Gorazde. 
Russian special envoy Vitaly S. Churkin has been trying without success to 
mediate an end to the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbian officials have looked to Russia as an ally, and Russia has been cooler 
toward Western intervention in the fighting than the United States and Western 
European nations. 
</P>
<P>
 One White House official said the Administration had received indications that 
"some substantive progress" was made Saturday in talks among Churkin, U.S. 
special envoy Charles Redman and representatives of the Bosnian Serbs, the 
United Nations and the Bosnian government. But the official provided no 
specifics. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton met Saturday afternoon with his senior national security 
advisers to discuss the situation after another day of sharp military 
engagement around Gorazde that saw a British warplane shot down over the town. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials acknowledged that they remain uncertain about the motivation of 
the Bosnian Serb forces in pressing their attack against Gorazde; indeed, one 
State Department official said, it is unclear whether the Bosnian Serbs were 
trying to overrun the city or merely send a message of defiance to the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization and the United Nations. "It is not clear it is 
their intention" to take the town, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing on Cable News Network's "Newsmaker Saturday" program, Rep. Lee H. 
Hamilton (D-Ind.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, agreed that 
the Bosnian Serb goals are unclear. "The choices are (either) they are 
maneuvering for a tactical advantage just before the negotiations take full 
speed and go on, or maybe they've just decided that NATO and the United Nations 
are a paper tiger and they've abandoned the idea of negotiations altogether." 
</P>
<P>
 As the fighting around Gorazde has escalated, Clinton has struggled to 
dissuade the Bosnian Serbs of that notion -- without encouraging Bosnian 
Muslims to intensify their own bids to regain lost territory. On Friday, 
Clinton went to unusual lengths in insisting that the NATO actions around 
Gorazde were not intended to place the alliance on the side of the Muslims in 
the bloody civil war. NATO, Clinton declared, is "not trying to change the 
military balance. We need to get the negotiations back on track." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton said that getting the Serbian rebels back to the peace talks would 
likely require more forceful military action than NATO has taken to date. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a bipartisan group of foreign policy experts and former officials 
called for more aggressive military actions to deter the Bosnian Serb 
offensive. In a telegram to Clinton, the Action Council for Peace in the 
Balkans said Clinton's declarations of neutrality "have given a green light for 
Serbian aggression and war crimes to prevail and for genocide to continue." 
</P>
<P>
 The telegram -- whose signatories include Zbigniew Brzezinski and Hodding 
Carter III from the Jimmy Carter Administration as well as Jeane J. Kirkpatrick 
and Frank C. Carlucci from the Ronald Reagan Administration -- called on 
Clinton "to issue a categorical warning to the Bosnian Serbs that they will be 
subject to NATO air action unless the attacks on Gorazde and other besieged 
Bosnian areas are halted."

COLUMN ONE; A GAMBLE TO REFORM THE LAPD; ALTHOUGH SOMEWHAT VAGUE, COMMUNITY 
POLICING IS SLOWLY UNFOLDING. IS IT AN OVERRATED CONCOCTION OR THE NECESSARY 
STEP TOWARD REFORM? SOUTH BUREAU IS THE PROVING GROUND.

<P>
 To Los Angeles neighborhoods where crime has shredded the social order, now 
comes community-based policing -- an idea that is at once disturbingly vague, 
tantalizingly hopeful and eagerly embraced by people with vastly different 
notions of what it entails. 
</P>
<P>
 To Ping Own, a Taiwanese immigrant with an auto service center near Los 
Angeles Harbor, it means clearing out the day laborers who gather on the curb 
outside his business and scare away his customers. To Cleve Freeman, it's using 
the police advisory board he heads to clean up a trio of dilapidated houses 
that have become embroiled in South-Central's drug trade. 
</P>
<P>
 To police officers such as Margaret Mazotta or Keith Thomas, it is a 
near-endless meeting -- convened in parking lots and living rooms, diners and 
doughnut shops -- where residents lay out their concerns and ask for the Los 
Angeles Police Department's help in solving them. 
</P>
<P>
 And to the institution of the LAPD, community-based policing may be the last 
best hope for recapturing the public trust shattered by the beating of Rodney 
G. King, broken again by the response to the 1992 riots, and only recently on 
the mend. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, despite the enormous stakes, community-based policing remains more of an 
ideal than a program. It is slowly unfolding across the city, and in South Los 
Angeles -- where a newly assigned deputy chief publicly introduced his version 
early this year -- it faces its greatest test. It is a work in progress, 
winning accolades despite its vague outlines and encountering resistance from 
some officers who worry that it distracts from the hard business of law 
enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents also are skeptical, unconvinced that the LAPD will recast 
itself in a friendlier image. 
</P>
<P>
 LAPD officials take every opportunity to proclaim that the effort is genuine. 
Although Police Department leaders and law enforcement scholars draw up the 
plans, street cops and residents ultimately will be the ones who carry it out. 
The success or failure of community-based policing in their neighborhoods, 
particularly in South Los Angeles, will decide whether the idea is an overrated 
concoction that leaves Los Angeles even more vulnerable than it is or an 
overdue reform that restores a measure of peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly six years ago, when Edward Dabbs came to the Normandale Recreation 
Center on Halldale Avenue near 224th Street, he found a community program in 
crisis. Gang members from the neighborhood would congregate at the center, 
drinking malt liquor and smoking marijuana around the building. Graffiti 
covered the walls. Broken glass littered the grounds. Frightened residents 
stayed away. In those days, Dabbs had little company and lots of work. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first week here, all I did was paint out graffiti," Dabbs said. "They had 
covered every wall with graffiti, and they were started on the sidewalks." 
</P>
<P>
 Conventional policing had failed the Normandale center. Police responded when 
the center was burglarized or its windows were smashed, but officers can only 
spend so long at a crime scene. When they left, crime crept back inside. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One aim of community-based policing is to approach problems differently, to 
focus on preventing crime rather than simply arresting criminals. In this case, 
that job fell to Margaret Mazotta, a personable, tough, 10-year veteran who 
nimbly juggles two roles -- social worker and street cop. 
</P>
<P>
 As she travels around what the department calls her Basic Car Area -- a long, 
narrow band of Los Angeles that runs from Palos Verdes Drive North to 190th 
Street -- Mazotta pauses to chat with merchants and homeowners. She calls out 
to a minister and drops by a schoolyard to hear how various students are doing. 
Children who know Mazotta come running up to her car when she stops -- they 
know from experience that she is a reliable source of baseball cards and 
balloons. 
</P>
<P>
 But she is not shy about mixing it up either. When during a recent tour of 
duty a call came over the radio about a possible attempted kidnaping, she set 
down her coffee, said a quick goodby to a couple of neighbors and sprinted to 
her car. 
</P>
<P>
 And when she spotted a group of idlers gathering near Ping Own's auto center, 
she did not hesitate to challenge them. One of the men, hurrying to get away, 
darted across the street. She cited him for jaywalking, explaining the 
violation in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am an immigrant too," said Own, his voice tight with frustration, as the 
men shuffled off. "But these men, they scare my customers. They ruin my 
business. That's why I need the Police Department to help, to save my 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with the stubborn problems at the Normandale center, Mazotta blended 
soft touch and stern resolve. She corralled other officers from the Harbor 
Division to increase patrols. She organized anti-graffiti efforts and trash 
cleanups. She took a few of the children at the center under her wing. When she 
enters these days, they come running up to her for advice and a hug. 
</P>
<P>
 Gradually, the center recovered. Once-fearful elderly people now drop by for 
senior programs. On Easter, roughly 300 children scrambled for eggs as a sea of 
parents dressed in their Sunday best looked on. On a recent Tuesday morning, 
the only sounds were of thumping basketballs and a few squeals of laughter from 
tiny children on swings. The walls were clean, not a trace of graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Mazotta's work at the center has solved few crimes and resulted in few 
arrests, the goals of traditional policing. But residents of the neighborhood 
say Mazotta's efforts have given them a community center, made them feel safer 
in their homes and happier in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've taken this park back," Mazotta said. "If we can do that, we've not only 
served the community, we've protected it as well." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As LAPD officials try to develop a coherent plan for community-based policing, 
they sometimes convey the impression of religious leaders struggling to 
remember what was written on the lost tablets of their faith. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1970s, then-Chief Ed Davis founded Neighborhood Watch, a rudimentary 
form of community-based policing, and also something known as the "basic car 
plan." Each of those programs -- distant relatives of the British bobby system 
founded in 1829 -- emphasized crime prevention and stressed community contact 
over arrests and incarceration. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis' approach was de-emphasized by his successor, Daryl F. Gates. Although 
he initiated some community-based efforts, Gates built a Police Department far 
more military in its bearing and its relationship with the community. The 
emphasis shifted to a tougher style of law enforcement. The vestiges of Davis 
and his community-oriented department gradually receded from memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the police beating of King, the Christopher Commission inquiry, the 
riots and the departure of Gates. He was succeeded by Willie L. Williams, an 
enthusiastic proponent of community-based policing who arrived from 
Philadelphia armed with a mandate to return the LAPD to its roots, to the 
programs that Davis pioneered two decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the LAPD's initial efforts to rekindle the spirit of community-based 
policing have been halting. At one point last year, the department sought to 
change the LAPD's fabled slogan, "To protect and to serve," to one police 
leaders thought might be more suited to the new mission. The proposed slogan: 
"To protect and to serve our communities. " 
</P>
<P>
 Some officers chuckled over that suggestion, privately deriding it as a 
cosmetic change that did little to address the challenges of retooling the 
department. Williams withdrew the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 On the streets, meanwhile, community policing was taking shape in the San 
Fernando Valley where, until recently, Deputy Chief Mark A. Kroeker served as 
the top LAPD official. Late last year, Kroeker was transferred to the South 
Bureau -- a sprawling, hard-to-manage area of Los Angeles that encompasses 
scores of neighborhoods from the tidy homes of San Pedro to some tough 
neighborhoods in South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley has its trouble spots, but the police administration views South 
Bureau as a far more difficult challenge. That part of the city is home to the 
city's highest crime rates and the greatest tension between the community and 
the Police Department. As a result, South Bureau is widely seen as the most 
difficult proving ground for community-based policing, the place where it 
either will thrive or perish. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, Williams gave his officers the LAPD's blueprint for community 
policing. Administrative Order No. 10 called for a rejuvenation of Davis' basic 
car plan and a reconstruction of public confidence in the department through 
the creation of police advisory boards. 
</P>
<P>
 A month later, Kroeker took the mission to the streets of South Los Angeles. 
On a warm January morning, Kroeker introduced 30 senior lead officers, the 
front line of the community-based policing effort, whom he described as "some 
of the finest police officers that anyone will ever meet." Men and women of 
varying backgrounds, some of Kroeker's senior lead officers have more than a 
decade on the job, others are newer. But they share a conviction that officers 
can do their jobs better if they work with residents, not against them. 
</P>
<P>
 They project an image -- optimistic, open, accommodating -- that was on 
display at Kroeker's newsconference. With dozens of reporters and curious 
residents looking on and his senior lead officers beaming behind him, Kroeker 
debuted his program at a location rich in symbolism: the intersection of 
Florence and Normandie avenues, site of one of the LAPD's most conspicuous 
failures. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Community-based policing will be a hard sell in some quarters of South Bureau. 
Take, for instance, the modest shopping center at Martin Luther King Boulevard 
and Vermont Avenue, one of many that burned during the riots. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the mall is rebuilt, but the shopkeepers no longer depend on the Police 
Department for their well-being. Once exposed to the street, the mall now is 
surrounded by a forbidding, black fence. The gates close at night. Security 
guards pace the parking lot during the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sense I get from people is that the police are not their friends," Robert 
Munoz, manager of a video store at the mall, said recently. "There's other 
areas where I've seen the police closer to the community. Here, they're trying 
to do it through the papers and through TV, but they need to get out and talk 
to people." 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD's public pronouncements about community policing have barely reached 
these merchants or their patrons. Some shake their heads in puzzlement when 
asked about the idea, some commend the effort but say they have yet to see 
results. Others simply dismiss the department's promises. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the same here as always," said Bruce Fisher, who lives in the 
neighborhood. "If anything, it's worse. . . . They (the police) show no respect 
for us." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent drizzly Saturday afternoon, Officer Keith Thomas got an earful 
from the community he serves. The community he grew up in. The same community 
he lives in today. 
</P>
<P>
 One man told Thomas of a nearby house where a drug dealer peddles crack in the 
afternoons. Another let him know about a local park where young men spend the 
day drinking, gambling and smoking dope. A third complained about a liquor 
store where prostitutes solicit customers. Yet another raised a common fear, 
that of reprisals against those who cooperate with police: "A lot of us are 
worried about gang intimidation," the middle-aged woman said. "If I call you, 
do you have to come to my house?" 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, a gregarious, barrel-chested officer with nine years on the 
department, fielded each concern, offering suggestions, promising that he would 
request patrols and personally check the trouble spots. To the woman afraid of 
retaliation, he pledged understanding and discretion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can call you or, if I come to your house, I won't bring the black-and-white 
(police car), and I won't come in uniform," he said. "I can come and sit on 
your porch, and we'll watch the problem. I look like everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 Already, Thomas has registered a string of successes in his area, a mixture of 
middle-class and run-down neighborhoods that stretch from 79th Street to 108th 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those early victories, however, none is sweeter than what happened at 84th 
Street and Kansas Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 At a small house near that intersection, drug dealers were running a bustling 
business, exchanging crack for cash through a mail slot. Users would smoke the 
drugs in the area around the house, cars would stack up outside, and residents 
of a nearby retirement home were forced to endure threats and indignities -- 
customers would block the sidewalks, forcing wheelchair-bound seniors into the 
street. People got mugged. Car thefts skyrocketed. So did prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
 The intersection had drawn the attention of the local councilman, Mark 
Ridley-Thomas, and when a police advisory board was formed, 84th and Kansas 
topped its list of problem spots. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't just want you to come in and arrest the people with the drugs," 
board President Gloria Jean Howard, a forceful and enthusiastic woman, told 
Thomas. "We want a real resolution, a lasting one." 
</P>
<P>
 Traditional policing offered little hope of achieving that. The house at the 
corner was fortified with a series of iron doors, the outer ones specially 
mounted to resist crowbars. Sentries were often posted on the roof. Officers 
worried that by the time they got inside the building, all the drugs would have 
been disposed of. 
</P>
<P>
 So Thomas took a different tack. He started off by donning street clothes and 
videotaping the scene. He shared that tape with the district attorney's office, 
while Councilman Ridley-Thomas solicited the help of the Falcon unit, an 
innovative, multi-agency group that can confiscate property involved in the 
drug trade. The owners, at first reluctant to oust their trouble-making 
tenants, softened considerably when Falcon officers threatened to seize the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, officers were bringing pressure on the tenants, serving 
warrants and arresting customers. Two weeks ago, the suspects took off, 
flinging their belongings into the alley, at last leaving a community they had 
terrorized for months. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, tow trucks carted off a few abandoned vehicles from the property. 
Building and safety workers boarded up the house. Cleanup crews hauled off the 
garbage while a representative of Ridley-Thomas monitored the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knocked that problem off our list," Officer Thomas told the residents at 
their community meeting. "Now we're on to the next case. Eventually, we'll get 
every one of those things off the list, and we'll work on something else, like 
beautifying our neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 But the press of crime offers little opportunity to bask in victories. As 
Thomas strolled the property last week, a call came in summoning officers to a 
possible break-in a block away. Less than a minute after Thomas was talking to 
a boyhood friend about life in the neighborhood, he and other officers were 
bursting inside someone's home, guns drawn, braced for the worst. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was inside. This time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of community-based policing in its current LAPD incarnation is a 
nascent network of police advisory boards -- panels that the department hopes 
will eventually draw hundreds of volunteers and form the focal point of 
police-community relations. 
</P>
<P>
 The city had a handful of such panels before Williams mandated creation of 
boards in all 18 of the LAPD's geographic divisions in December. But as the 
boards grow in number and stature, they are raising new questions about how and 
by whom the Police Department will be managed. Some politicians, most notably 
Councilman Ridley-Thomas, have raised concerns about the process for selecting 
advisory board members and about a department rule excluding council members 
and their staffs from serving. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD has tried to prevent the boards from becoming politicized. Already, 
it has had to rein in a few. In the Valley, one Neighborhood Watch group used 
its newsletter to criticize a City Council member. The members of that group 
were warned that politics had no place in literature that bore the Police 
Department's seal of approval. 
</P>
<P>
 In the South Bureau, the advisory boards are being encouraged to offer 
guidance and direction. There are limits, certainly, but for the most part they 
have yet to be tested. What happens, some officials wonder quietly, if one of 
the boards directs its local police officers to stop carrying batons? Or to 
revise their shooting policy? 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to push until they say: 'No.' That will tell us what the limit 
is," said Cleve Freeman, 46, a soft-spoken but determined Texas native who 
became president of his police advisory board in January. "We want results. 
We've done enough talking. We need to improve the quality of life in our city." 
</P>
<P>
 Freeman and his colleagues have targeted three houses where graffiti, gangs 
and drugs have taken hold. At a recent meeting of their advisory board, they 
informed their senior lead officer that they wanted action in those areas. In 
return, they pledged to help the department by keeping an eye on the houses and 
by calling in anytime problems arise. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll measure our success by looking back at our goals, those three houses," 
Freeman said. "Did we do everything humanly possible? Did those problems get 
solved? If not, we failed; but if so, we will have made this a better place." 
Reaching Out (BullDog Edition, A24) 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 3, 1993, Police Chief Willie L. Williams released to his officers the 
LAPD's most far-reaching explanation to date on community-based policing. That 
document, Administrative Order No. 10, outlines the LAPD's definition of 
community policing and the chief's most current proposals for implementing it 
citywide. According to the order: 
</P>
<P>
 "Community policing is a guiding philosophy which strengthens the partnership 
between law enforcement and all the people in the communities we serve. It 
draws upon our goals to protect and serve by broadening and strengthening our 
ability to succeed in reducing crime and fear of crime. Through the empowerment 
of our employees and our customers, a true problem-solving partnership can be 
created for the good of all." 
</P>
<P>
 To implement that philosophy, Williams directed his officers to "implement 
change by focusing on three of the most important issues facing the department 
today: 
</P>
<P>
 * Rebuilding our patrol force and rejuvenating the basic car plan; 
</P>
<P>
 * Developing a strategic plan in order to develop goals and strategies for the 
future; 
</P>
<P>
 * Rebuilding public confidence in the Police Department through the 
development of police community councils for all 18 geographic areas."

EXPERT PANEL TO SCRUTINIZE TEST SCORING; SCHOOLS: DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SAYS 
PREVIOUS REPORTS MISSTATED THE EXTENT OF PROBLEMS IN NEW STATEWIDE PROGRAM. BUT 
THE ACCURACY OF THE SAMPLING PROCESS WILL BE STUDIED FURTHER. 
</P>

<P>
 A panel of experts in statistics has been appointed by the state Department of 
Education to look into the procedures used to score tests taken last year by 1 
million students in the first year of the California Learning Assessment 
System. 
</P>
<P>
 The move follows widespread criticism of the accuracy of test results released 
last month and strong reaction to a Times story on April 10 that analyzed the 
test scoring and reported numerous problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The experts will report their findings publicly to the State Board of 
Education in July, Acting Supt. of Public Instruction William D. Dawson said. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is the method used by testing officials to score the exams. To save 
money, only a portion of the tests taken at more than 7,000 schools statewide 
in reading, writing and math were scored. An elaborate sampling process was 
used to select the tests to be scored. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times story examined the sampling process and reported that the test 
results "for hundreds of schools may be wildly inaccurate" and that the state 
violated its guidelines in more than 11,000 cases -- most of them minor -- by 
scoring fewer tests than promised. The story quoted some educational testing 
experts who criticized the state's methodology. 
</P>
<P>
 Dawson said the Times computer analysis misstated the extent of the problems 
because of a misunderstanding between the newspaper and state testing 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The "scoring design" provided to The Times by the state April 5 explained the 
sampling method and, in a sequence of columns titled "number scored per 
school," appeared to report the minimum number of test booklets that should be 
graded at each school to provide statistical validity for the results. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, however, Dawson said the scoring design did not specify how many 
tests should actually be scored at each school. Instead, he said, the document 
was a draft that contained mislabeled columns and should have shown only the 
number of students whose tests should be pulled for possible scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 Testing officials assumed that some of those selected tests would not be 
scored for various reasons -- such as being lost or defaced -- thus shrinking 
the sample, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under that definition, Dawson said, it would not be possible to break any 
guidelines because the Department of Education did not set a minimum number of 
tests to be scored at each school. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerry Shelton, a state consultant who helped design the testing procedure, 
said the assumption was made that at some schools, as many as 20% of the tests 
chosen for possible scoring might not be graded. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a new Times computer analysis, there were 878 instances where the 
sample scored at a particular school was at least 20% smaller than the number 
of tests selected for possible scoring. That is about 4% of the nearly 22,000 
samples drawn from the state's public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel of outside experts who will examine the scoring methods are Lee 
Crombach, professor emeritus at Stanford University; Norm Bradburn, professor 
of business and public policy at the University of Chicago and senior vice 
president for research at National Opinion Research Corp., and Dan Horvitz, 
former president of Research Triangle Institute who is now affiliated with the 
National Institute of Statistical Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
 The April 10 Times article also cited details of instances where extremely 
small sample sizes had been used to give overall test scores for a school. 
There were two schools where a single student's test was used to score the 
entire school. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times computer analysis identified 148 cases where schools were given 
their test results based on samples of fewer than 25% of the exams taken. 
Dawson said Friday that officials are still checking suspicious results and 
that the number of cases with such faulty sample sizes may reach 250 or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Additional tests will be graded at those schools and their overall school 
scores will be revised, Dawson said. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, the state's method for dealing with low sample sizes was to 
publish the margin of error, known as "standard error," for each score at each 
school. A large standard error should serve as a signal that a low sampling 
problem existed at a particular school. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times analysis found 331 instances where the standard error was greater 
than 15 percentage points and 1,511 instances where it was between 10 and 15 
points. Dawson said the state had set no threshold for acceptable error. 
</P>
<P>
 Dawson said those kinds of errors should not occur when tests being taken now 
in schools statewide are graded. The state intends to grade all exams in the 
fourth and eighth grades, and a higher percentage of those taken in the 10th 
grade. Also, new computer instructions will check for low sample sizes and 
prevent them from being used. 
</P>
<P>
 The state chose not to grade all of the tests taken last year in order to save 
money. The California Learning Assessment System, which uses performance-based 
tests and measures students against tough statewide standards, must receive 
funding each year from the state Legislature and is expected to cost $55 
million a year when fully in place. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, some leaders in the Legislature urged the state to slow expansion 
of CLAS into more grades because of the questions about accuracy of the test 
results. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ignorance is forgivable, stupidity is not," said state Sen. Leroy Greene 
(D-Carmichael) of the Senate education panel. "The state Department of 
Education exhibited a high coefficient of stupidity in the way they handled the 
test."

DESPITE UNITY PLEAS, GARAMENDI AND BROWN FEUD HEATS UP; DEMOCRATS: INSURANCE 
COMMISSIONER CONTINUES ATTACKS AT STATE CONVENTION. TREASURER SAYS HER FOCUS IS 
ON DEFEATING WILSON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As state Democratic leaders gathered for the party's annual convention tried 
to patch together a veneer of unity, the increasingly bitter contest between 
the two major candidates for governor flared anew Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 State Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi accused Treasurer Kathleen Brown 
of character flaws, renewing his assertion that she had spent $175,000 in an 
effort to procure in advance questions to be asked at a January candidate 
forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Saying he was motivated in part by a verbal attack on his wife Friday by a 
Brown supporter, Garamendi also told reporters that he was pumping his own 
money into his financially depleted campaign. The insurance commissioner turned 
coy, however, when asked the magnitude of his loan -- he described it only as 
"sufficient to finance a victory." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never been up against an opponent that tried to purchase the test 
questions," he said. "I have never seen a situation such as we are faced with 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Garamendi characterized Brown's campaign as "totally unraveling," her 
forces were playing down his outburst. Campaign manager Clint Reilly, who 
Saturday announced a new management team for the Brown campaign, said Brown's 
focus was on her prospective November opponent, Republican Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our objective in this campaign is not to win the battle, it's to win the 
war," said Reilly, who said Brown had done nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Of Garamendi's charges, he added: "That's a comment, I think, from a candidate 
who's 15 to 20 points behind in the polls after having just spent $1 million on 
television. I expect even worse before the campaign's over." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown leads Garamendi by more than a dozen points in statewide opinion polls. 
</P>
<P>
 The conflict was played out as thousands of delegates met for the party's 
annual convention, which its organizers meant to serve as a continuing 
celebration of the 1992 Democratic victories in California and a rallying point 
for the 1994 elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Luminaries attending the event at the Westin Bonaventure hotel in Los Angeles 
ignored the brewing dispute between Brown and Garamendi, putting their focus on 
Wilson and on the paramount political importance that the Clinton 
Administration has attached to California. 
</P>
<P>
 Vice President Al Gore, the keynote speaker Saturday, told cheering delegates 
that the Democratic Administration in Washington was due credit for the 
economic recovery that he said is taking hold in the state. He also pledged 
that more help is on the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been working mighty hard for California," Gore said. "We will not let 
you down." 
</P>
<P>
 The accusations leveled by Garamendi at Brown center on her actions before a 
January forum sponsored by the California Teachers Assn., which was then 
pondering its endorsement. Garamendi alleges that Brown arranged to receive in 
advance the questions that were to be asked at the forum -- and that in 
exchange she forwarded $175,000 to a political action committee controlled by 
Alice Huffman, the union's political director. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffman has denied giving Brown a list, but Brown has given conflicting 
answers about her knowledge of the issues to be dealt with by the union. 
Huffman has acknowledged giving Brown a series of briefings on education 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, at the convention's women's lunch, Huffman lashed out at 
Garamendi's wife, Patti, threatening that if the candidate did not apologize he 
would be "chopped liver, baby." 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi on Saturday accused Brown of engineering Huffman's statements and 
said that the original episode showed that Brown was "cheating." 
</P>
<P>
 "It has to do with the way in which a campaign and a candidate conduct 
themselves," he said. "It has to do with what a candidate is all about." 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledged that the issue alone was not enough to loft him over Brown by 
the June primary. Brown campaign manager Reilly said he does not consider the 
allegations to be a "significant" element of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Reilly also cast doubt on whether Garamendi's loan would provide enough 
capital to benefit the struggling campaign. The larger question, he added, was 
whether Brown would be forced to spend money to deflect Garamendi's charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue for us is how much money that we would rather spend in the general 
election against Pete Wilson will we have to spend on the primary . . . because 
John is either spending his own money recklessly or making reckless charges," 
Reilly said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi's campaign is in debt, as the candidate acknowledged Saturday, while 
Brown has an estimated $4 million in the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Party Chairman Bill Press continued to insist that the dust-up between Brown 
and Garamendi would have no impact on the party's chances of unseating 
incumbent Wilson. "We are Democrats," he said, in a joking allusion to the 
party's traditional infighting. "We do have some differences. That does not at 
all take away from the overriding sense of unity." 
</P>
<P>
 National Democratic Chairman David Wilhelm told reporters that California is 
at the heart of the party's effort to hold onto congressional seats and win 
statehouses in the midterm elections in November. The Democratic National 
Committee announced this weekend that it has bequeathed $1 million to the state 
party to help finance state campaigns. Another $400,000 was raised by Gore in a 
series of fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the state party plans to spend $8 million to try to maintain its 
political advantage in 1994, Press said. During the last mid-term election, in 
1990, the party's budget was a significantly smaller $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Other candidates on the ballot in November made pitches before the party 
faithful. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Dianne Feinstein spoke via tape from Washington, ticking off promises she 
had kept to voters and asking for aid in beating back a prospective challenge 
from Republican Rep. Michael Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need your help," she said, and then characterized the Texas-born Huffington 
as a carpetbagger: "I'm running against a man who came to California in 1989."

ACTIVISTS TALLY THE EFFECT OF S. AFRICA SANCTIONS; ECONOMICS: THE AUTHORS OF 
DIVESTITURE SEE ELECTION AS CULMINATION OF THEIR EFFORTS. BUT THEY NOW APPEAL 
FOR REINVESTMENT.

 The death toll from pre-election violence in South Africa had reached into the 
hundreds early this month, and an accord between Zulu nationalists and the 
African National Congress seemed more elusive than ever. From his vantage point 
in Phoenix, where he lives in retirement, the Rev. Leon H. Sullivan was viewing 
the turmoil with dismay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I keep remembering that our main objective was to end the apartheid system 
and get South African blacks the opportunity to vote," he said one day 
recently. "But I have mixed emotions when I see the violence. I did not expect 
this cleavage between the Zulus and the ANC to continue once it got to the 
point where apartheid had ended. 
</P>
<P>
 "But," he concluded, "I still have no question about what I worked for." 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan is one of the grand old men of the campaign to end South African 
apartheid through economic pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 A member of the General Motors board in 1971, he made corporate history by 
challenging the company's management via a shareholder appeal to sell off -- 
divest -- its South African operations. In 1987, as the author of the "Sullivan 
Principles," which bound U.S. corporations doing business in South Africa to 
promote racial equality and provide greater advancement opportunities for black 
employees there, he was banned from visiting the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the sanction campaign has effectively ended -- ANC President Nelson 
Mandela called for a lifting of foreign restrictions last September -- and its 
fruits will be on display next week with the country's first multiracial 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
 With that in mind, Sullivan and other leaders of the campaign are assessing 
its role in the changes in South Africa and its effect on the country's future 
course. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, they regard their achievement with unalloyed pride. 
</P>
<P>
 "The campaign could not have been more successful: It accomplished exactly 
what we set out to accomplish," said Randall Robinson, who heads TransAfrica, a 
leading anti-apartheid campaigner. Many note that few other grass-roots 
campaigns have ever produced the kind of mass consciousness-raising among U.S. 
voters that the sanction drive did. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 U.S. localities imposed their own sanctions, refusing to do 
business with companies that had South African connections -- a trend that 
helped push Congress to enact federal sanctions in 1986 over a Ronald Reagan 
veto. 
</P>
<P>
 Recalcitrant corporations found themselves shunned by important institutional 
investors and pressured by freshly politicized shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 Scores of major corporations chose to avert public censure by withdrawing from 
South Africa altogether. Those remaining as signatories of the Sullivan 
Principles committed themselves to raising the living standards of their 
nonwhite employees through education and training programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "No company wanted to be identified with apartheid -- that wasn't the 
argument," said William Moses of the Investor Responsibility Research Center, 
"but it was how best to address it. They would say that if they stayed, they 
could provide jobs and benefits, push the envelope from within. The Sullivan 
Principles didn't fundamentally change South Africa or the way black South 
Africans lived, but it fundamentally changed the lives of those touched by the 
programs of their employers." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there is little question that overall the sanctions have damaged the 
South African economy, at least for the near term, and thus rendered it less 
able to provide the job growth necessary to satisfy black workers' expectations 
of a better lifestyle. That could exacerbate the social tensions already 
manifesting themselves in sectional violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation revives the longstanding debate over whether sanctions were the 
proper -- or the best -- tool with which to influence South African politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question is, what did you hope to achieve?" said Herman Nickel, an 
opponent of sanctions who was U.S. ambassador to South Africa in 1982-86 and 
now is a consultant to a group called Global Business Access. "Is the economic 
damage caused sufficiently offset by the political gains?" 
</P>
<P>
 Nickel maintains that the demands of economic growth in the country were 
already forcing white businesses to bring blacks into the system as workers and 
even managers. In time that would have led to the political changes wrought by 
the political accord reached last year by Mandela and President Frederik W. de 
Klerk. 
</P>
<P>
 "All this you're seeing now would have happened even without sanctions," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-apartheid activists sharply disagree. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no evidence that economic growth would have changed anything in South 
Africa," said Jennifer Davis, a native South African who is executive director 
of the New York-based Africa Fund. "The 1960s were years of tremendous economic 
expansion and also years of the intensification of repression." 
</P>
<P>
 Others, such as Robinson of TransAfrica, believe that the sanctions were 
indispensable in forcing South African whites to confront the costs of 
apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
 "We began the sanctions effort in the 1960s, and all that time the apologists 
for apartheid argued that they would not work," he said. "Meanwhile, the 
apartheid system got stronger and more Draconian. It was after the sanctions 
reached full bite and South African whites began to pay a real price for the 
system that it began to crumble. I think (the sanctions) changed fundamentally 
the cost-benefit calculus in a way that caused De Klerk to come to the table 
and to release Nelson Mandela" from prison in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1986 U.S. federal sanctions barred the export of most products to South 
Africa and the import of such commodities as fruits and vegetables and raw 
steel. 
</P>
<P>
 But blood had already been drawn. South African business people and many 
analysts agree that the single most damaging blow to the country was the drying 
up of international capital after 1985, when Chase Manhattan Bank refused to 
renew its $30 million in short-term loans in the country and said it would 
engage in no new lending. 
</P>
<P>
 Other U.S. banks, which had about $4.2 billion in loans outstanding to South 
African institutions, followed suit. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the banks took a tough stand, it became clear to the South African 
community that business couldn't go on as usual," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's estimates of the total cost to the South African economy from foreign 
divestiture range from $10 billion to $50 billon, much of that measured in 
higher capital expenses, higher consumer prices and the cost of illicitly 
circumventing trade embargoes. 
</P>
<P>
 But circumvent they did. Some estimates say the value of clandestine South 
African imports and exports equaled the value of overt, non-embargoed trade in 
most years during the sanction period. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil and other raw materials continued to come into the country, albeit at 
higher prices. And even in such staunch anti-apartheid African countries as 
Ivory Coast, one could find cans of Coca-Cola labeled in Afrikaans in the late 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the fact that the campaign's economic burden often fell on black as 
well as white citizens, its leaders say it always involved a delicate balancing 
of short-term pain and long-term goals. Others maintain that the root of South 
Africa's economic troubles is not the sanctions but the political system that 
provoked them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The basic cause of damage to the South African economy was apartheid," said 
Dumisani Kumalo, a South African who is project director for the Africa Fund. 
"If you're a country of 40 million people and you're only harnessing the 
energies of 5 million, you're not running the economy at full speed. It took 
millions of dollars to create these separate systems. The economy was overtaxed 
to fund a system that's now discredited." 
</P>
<P>
 One important element in the success of the campaign in the United States was 
its grass-roots nature -- not unusual for a domestic political movement but 
rare for an effort to influence foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Its organizers made a deliberate decision to start not in Washington but among 
the municipal and state councils of the U.S. heartland. 
</P>
<P>
 "The South African government had spent millions buying access to senators and 
congressmen," Kumalo said. "So it was difficult for us to do anything in 
Washington. But at the state and city level, there was an even playing field." 
</P>
<P>
 The resulting proliferation of local anti-apartheid initiatives was "quite 
extraordinary," Moses said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least 179 local entities decided to have local sanctions," a response 
unique in its scale, he said. "The South Africa issue really caught fire. Last 
summer we were still finding new sanctions on the books." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of these regulations hit companies in their pocketbooks by barring those 
with South African ties from receiving local government contracts, forcing 
corporations large and small to choose between doing business with South Africa 
or with, say, the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of companies felt it was better to keep their business closer to home," 
Moses said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most detailed was that of Los Angeles, which barred companies that 
had even the most trivial or remote connections with South Africa from doing 
business with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea was to give them a message about how the city fathers and mothers 
felt about South Africa," said George Wolfberg, a financial analyst in the city 
administrative office who administered the program. "Literally thousands of 
companies had to sign an affidavit that they were not doing business with South 
Africa in any way." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, of course, what South Africa needs is reinvestment. Many of the old 
campaign's leaders are now turning their attention toward how to re-inject U.S. 
capital into the country in order to promote socially responsible corporate 
behavior in the post-apartheid era. 
</P>
<P>
 Since July, 1991, when President George Bush ended a five-year ban on new U.S. 
investments in South Africa, 45 companies have entered or returned to that 
market, according to the Investor Responsibility Research Center. Some have 
repurchased affiliates that they had parked with local investors for the period 
of divestiture. The number of U.S. companies now operating there is 152; in 
1986, when the sanctions went into effect, there were 267, according to the 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 Most analysts agree that South Africa cannot make the transition to 
post-apartheid democracy without such an infusion of outside capital. 
</P>
<P>
 "The challenges ahead are more daunting than the ones we've overcome so far," 
Robinson said. "Before, it didn't matter that 7 million of 22 million blacks 
were living in self-erected shacks or that the education system was spending 
five to 10 times less to prepare black students than white ones. Now it does 
matter. But the money to correct this is not in South Africa." 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan himself has drafted a new set of principles for incoming investors, 
binding them to promote equal opportunity, management training, the support of 
black businesses and other idealistic goals. U.S. Investment 
</P>
<P>
 ANC President Nelson Mandela called for a lifting of foreign restrictions last 
September, and the number of American companies doing business there is on the 
rebound.

MANDELA COURTS ZULU VOTE IN TOUR OF NATAL; SOUTH AFRICA: ANC LEADER PROMISES 
BETTER CONDITIONS IN STRIFE-TORN REGION. HE ALSO PAYS HOMAGE TO KING GOODWILL 
ZWELITHINI, AN ALLY OF HIS ZULU ARCHRIVAL.

<P>
 Nelson Mandela hit the road Saturday for an important six-day campaign tour, 
hopping across the strife-torn Natal province to woo voters with praise for the 
Zulu king and promises of better houses and more jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The African National Congress president, looking fit and rested, led 10,000 
supporters on a hilltop here in a song of praise for the Zulu monarch, Goodwill 
Zwelithini, a political ally of Mandela's archrival, Zulu Chief Mangosuthu 
Gatsha Buthelezi. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is not just my leader, he's my king," Mandela declared, speaking beneath a 
banner reading: "ANC -- A Better Life for All." To loud cheers, he added, "We 
are his subjects." 
</P>
<P>
 The forays into Umlazi and Ezakheni were part of a high-profile effort by the 
ANC to persuade Zulus that the party has deep respect for the traditional Zulu 
monarch, despite sharp differences with Buthelezi, the king's uncle and leader 
of the Inkatha Freedom Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Those differences between the ANC and Inkatha have been largely responsible 
for the attacks and counterattacks that have claimed 20,000 lives in the last 
10 years in Natal province, including 200 in the last two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Talks between Buthelezi and the ANC have reached what appears to be an 
insurmountable impasse. And Buthelezi's decision to boycott the election unless 
the ANC and government grant autonomy for the KwaZulu homeland has made more 
bloodshed on the election days likely.

 Inkatha claims that the ANC is anti-Zulu, an allegation Mandela has tried to 
refute with repeated promises that an ANC government would give the Zulu 
monarchy greater powers and privileges as well as a secure place in the 
country's new constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, King Zwelithini met with Archbishop Desmond Tutu and other church 
leaders and appealed to his subjects to stop the killings in the province. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Mandela, speaking in the Umlazi stadium where ANC and Inkatha 
supporters clashed just a few weeks ago, welcomed the king's statement, saying: 
"It befits a man who belongs to one of the most illustrious royal houses. When 
he does something good for our nation, we are all behind him." 
</P>
<P>
 The large turnouts at the rallies Saturday were a reminder that Mandela, 
although he is from the Xhosa ethnic group, and the ANC have strong support 
among Zulus in Natal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to vote, and I'm going to vote for Mandela -- nobody else," said 
Eric Gumede, 25, a teacher from Umlazi who is on strike against Buthelezi's 
education administration in KwaZulu. 
</P>
<P>
 After the election, Gumede said, he is confident that an ANC government will 
be running the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mandela isn't saying he'll fight only for blacks," Gumede said. "He says 
he'll fight for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela began the day by climbing atop his Mercedes-Benz in the tiny township 
of Lamontville, south of Durban, where he was mobbed by nearly 2,000 residents 
who lined the streets and scaled billboards and trees to catch a glimpse of 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very happy indeed to come and greet you," he said, speaking in both Zulu 
and English. "Although I am 75 years old, and will be 76 next July, whenever I 
am among you I feel like a young man of 30. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are the people who inspire me every day of my life," he added, to loud 
cheers and chants of "ANC! ANC! ANC!" 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, the crowds were strongly pro-ANC. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and election monitors kept a low profile, and no incidents of violence 
were reported. 
</P>
<P>
 "Inkatha says the Zulus must not vote, but we are going to vote no matter what 
they say," said Nompomelela Nzukane, a 29-year-old teacher in Lamontville. "It 
may take time, but the ANC is going to bring us free education and better 
schools in KwaZulu." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, President Frederik W. de Klerk chastised the ANC, saying he doubted 
that it would be able to deliver on promises of reconstruction and development 
with a program based on "Mickey Mouse economics." 
</P>
<P>
 De Klerk was cheered often during his speech in an auditorium south of 
Johannesburg by the crowd of 4,000, most of whom were mixed-race Colored. Many 
Coloreds share De Klerk's fear of a powerful ANC government and have sided with 
the president's National Party in the election. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the ANC is expected to win the election, with perhaps 55% of the 
vote, polls also indicate that the National Party may collect 25%, enough to 
make De Klerk a deputy president. 
</P>
<P>
 De Klerk repeated his claim that the National Party's economic policies are in 
line with successful countries elsewhere in the world. And he claimed credit 
for building schools and clinics throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ANC has, under the guise of democracy, through their aggression, brought 
misery to millions of black and brown South Africans," he said.

 U.S. and allied jet fighters resumed patrols over northern Iraq after a 
one-day halt in the wake of Thursday's downing of two American helicopters by 
U.S. warplanes, the Pentagon said. The U.S. European Command ordered the 
protective flights resumed on a reduced schedule over a "no fly" zone north of 
the 36th Parallel. The zone was imposed after the 1991 Persian Gulf War by the 
allies to protect Kurds in northern Iraq.

U.N. AIRLIFTS AID SUPPLIES TO TERRORIZED RWANDANS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The United Nations flew in food and medicine for thousands of famished 
Rwandans hiding out from bloodthirsty mobs Saturday as the last European 
soldiers prepared to leave the devastated capital. 
</P>
<P>
 The army and rebels battling for control of Kigali agreed to make the airport 
a neutral zone so that supplies could be brought in, said Dr. Abdul Kabia, 
director of the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 Mortar duels between army and rebel troops sprayed the tarmac with shrapnel 
Friday. The airport and Kigali were quiet overnight, but a 30-minute gun battle 
broke out downtown in the afternoon, Kabia said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 800 Belgian paratroopers left by Friday night, and 420 Belgian U.N. 
peacekeepers were handing over control of the airport to about 400 Ghanaian 
soldiers. The last Belgians were to depart by Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 With food running out, the first C-130 transport plane arrived with aid 
Saturday. U.N. officials were arranging convoys to cart the food and medicine 
to the national stadium and King Faisal Hospital, where about 12,000 people 
were camped out, many relying on scanty rations shared by peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
 Murderous gangs prowled Nyrambo, an industrial section of Kigali, butchering 
people with machetes and tossing hand grenades into houses, Kabia said. Gangs 
of youths have looted the city and have hacked thousands of people to death 
since the fighting began. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the victims were members of the Tutsi minority slaughtered by Hutu 
gang members and Hutu-dominated government forces. The rebels who pushed into 
Kigali on Tuesday are predominantly Tutsi. 
</P>
<P>
 Tens of thousands of people have died in the warfare and butchery that has its 
roots in a centuries-old struggle for power in Rwanda and neighboring Burundi 
between the Hutu and Tutsi tribes. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 4,000 foreigners have been evacuated from Kigali in the last nine 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations is trying to arrange the burial of thousands of corpses 
that litter the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The orgy of killing began after a mysterious plane crash on April 6 killed 
Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana and Burundian President Cyprian 
Ntayamira. 
</P>
<P>
 Ntayamira and Habyarimana, both Hutus, were returning from a conference in 
neighboring Tanzania on ending the ethnic violence in their countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Ntayamira was buried Saturday in Bujumbura, Burundi's capital.

 Police in Cape Town have charged a schoolteacher as South Africa's worst 
serial killer, dubbed "the Station Strangler," after 21 boys were slain in an 
eight-year rampage. The strangler stalked his victims, boys ages 9 to 15, at 
railway stations, lured them away and dumped their bodies in scrubland. Police 
said the suspect, charged with one murder, is an elementary school teacher with 
a history of mental illness.

MINUTE BY MINUTE: HOW BOSNIA MISSION OF PEACE CAME TO RUIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL J. WILLIAMS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.N. spokesman for Bosnia, Maj. Rob Annink, provided this minute-by-minute 
account of a devastating day for the peacekeeping mission: 
</P>
<P>
 * 12:50 p.m. -- Yasushi Akashi, the special representative of the U.N. 
secretary general and civilian chief of the U.N. Protection Force, heads for a 
meeting with Bosnian Serb leaders in the mountain stronghold of Pale near 
Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1:00 -- Bosnian Serb forces intensify their offensive on the Muslim enclave 
of Gorazde, targeting heavy-artillery fire on the refugee-packed city center. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1:06 -- The U.N. commander for Bosnia, British Lt. Gen. Michael Rose, 
conveys news of the attack to Akashi, who turns back for Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1:15 -- Rose's command post informs the Bosnian Serbs of its awareness of 
and concern over the intensified shelling. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1:16 -- U.N. military observers in Gorazde report back to command 
headquarters that the shelling has become heavy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1:40 -- Akashi discusses the situation with Rose and consults with U.N. 
officials in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1:57 -- Bosnian Serb commander Ratko Mladic insists in discussions with 
Russian special envoy Vitaly S. Churkin that his forces are not attacking 
Gorazde and blames the artillery assault on the Bosnian government army. 
</P>
<P>
 * 2:15 -- Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic claims in telephone discussions 
with U.N. headquarters in Sarajevo that U.N. observers in Gorazde are being 
forced by Bosnian government troops to relay false information to headquarters 
in Sarajevo. Unmoved by the denials, Akashi demands immediate cessation of 
attacks on Gorazde. 
</P>
<P>
 * 3:20 -- Military observers in Gorazde report Serbian tanks moving toward the 
city from the north and east. 
</P>
<P>
 * 3:35 -- Serbian tank rounds are fired into Gorazde city center. 
</P>
<P>
 * 3:39 -- Rose warns the Serbs of "close air support" within 15 minutes unless 
the offensive ceases. 
</P>
<P>
 * 3:44 -- Serbian infantry advances on Gorazde. 
</P>
<P>
 * 3:50 -- The overall commander for U.N. forces in the Balkans, French Gen. 
Bertrand de Lapresle, discusses possible air strikes with Akashi, noting that 
if tank fire on Gorazde persists and the Serbs reach the city center, there 
would be considerable "collateral damage," meaning loss of life. 
</P>
<P>
 * 4:00 -- Three Serbian tank rounds hit Gorazde hospital, injuring patients. 
</P>
<P>
 * 4:10 -- First NATO flyovers ordered. Serbian tanks take cover in woods. 
</P>
<P>
 * 4:30 -- NATO planes ordered to fire on tanks if they can be sighted. 
</P>
<P>
 * 4:40 -- Headquarters in Sarajevo warns that the tanks will be hit if they 
are not withdrawn. Serbs deny ownership of the tanks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 4:51 -- Two NATO aircraft fly a mission intended to seek and destroy the 
tanks, which have not withdrawn. One of the planes, a British Sea Harrier, is 
shot down by a Serbian surface-to-air missile. 
</P>
<P>
 * 5:40 -- Report from last aerial reconnaissance that the tanks that fired on 
Gorazde cannot be located. CAROL J. WILLIAMS

ITALY'S RIGHT WINS TOP PARLIAMENT POSTS; EUROPE: THREE-PARTY ALLIANCE HEADED BY 
BERLUSCONI NOW LOOKS TO GETTING THE PREMIERSHIP, PROBABLY BY MIDWEEK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM D. MONTALBANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three months after making his political debut, billionaire Silvio Berlusconi 
took a decisive stride toward the prime minister's office Saturday when 
supporters of his right-wing alliance won leadership of both houses of 
Parliament. He could be named the head of Italy's next government by midweek. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi called Saturday's election of new presidents for the Senate and 
Chamber of Deputies a test of his ability to govern. 
</P>
<P>
 He passed -- by a whisker. The restive three-party alliance that Berlusconi 
led to a stunning victory in elections last month easily won in the Chamber of 
Deputies but only captured the Senate by a single vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Jubilant supporters of Berlusconi's free-market party and its federalist and 
neo-fascist allies hailed the victories as the first step on the road to what 
they call a Second Republic, a modern state that overcomes the inefficiency and 
corruption of its predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
 In a government-changing ballet performed 52 times in Italy since World War 
II, the installation of parliamentary officers allowed technocrat Prime 
Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi to submit his resignation, which he did Saturday. 
Ciampi will remain in office as a caretaker while President Oscar Luigi 
Scalfaro begins a round of consultations to determine a successor. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi, as leader of the largest party in the new Parliament, is the 
inescapable choice. Most observers think Scalfaro will ask him to form a 
government Wednesday or Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 59-year-old Milan media and real estate tycoon -- who also owns 
supermarkets, Italy's largest advertising agency and the country's best soccer 
team -- is raring to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Himself one of 452 rookie legislators in the 630-seat Chamber of Deputies, 
Berlusconi threatened new elections if his candidate did not win in the Senate. 
And he writhed at the measured pace of legislative life as the Parliament 
convened for the first time Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Will I always be forced to live this kind of life?" he asked reporters 
playfully. "I never have done so little in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi's free-market Forza Italia (Go, Italy) and its allies are a few 
votes short of an outright majority among the 315 elected senators and 11 
nominated-for-life senators. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Senate, Forza Italia candidate Carlo Scognamiglio, 50, a white-bearded 
economist-executive who is now a university rector, ran into fierce opposition 
from supporters of outgoing Senate President Giovanni Spadolini, a former prime 
minister and leader of the tiny Republican Party. For decades, Scognamiglio was 
the bespectacled and rotund symbol of the political Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Backed by centrists and leftists still smarting from their electoral drubbing 
by Berlusconi, Spadolini held off the right-wing candidate in two votes Friday. 
A third round Saturday ended in a tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Scognamiglio won the fourth ballot, 162-161. Then he braced the chamber with a 
let's-work-together maiden speech written on a single page of notes and 
delivered in an informal, professorial style so markedly different from 
Spadolini-era rhetoric and formality that it captured both the changed face and 
the changed nature of the new legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Chamber of Deputies, Berlusconi's backers hold an absolute majority, 
and the victory of the right's candidate was never in question, although she 
proved more controversial than some of her backers might have liked. 
</P>
<P>
 Irene Pivetti, a 31-year-old Catholic fundamentalist member of the Northern 
League, received 346 votes to win the powerful post that is the Italian 
equivalent of Speaker of the House in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your soul to God, your vote to Bossi," was her campaign slogan, referring to 
Northern League leader Umberto Bossi. Pivetti's Catholicism is so pervasive 
that she has drawn accusations of anti-Semitism. She dismisses them as 
"foolishness." 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's parliamentary votes represented the first test of unity for members 
of three alliance parties wed more by a thirst for power than common goals. 
Bossi distrusts Berlusconi and dislikes alliance partner Gianfranco Fini and 
the new respectability of neo-fascism.

N. KOREA'S KIM DENIES NUCLEAR ARMS, DISAVOWS WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 North Korea's Communist leader attempted Saturday to cool the controversy over 
his country's alleged nuclear program, insisting that Pyongyang has no nuclear 
weapons, no intention of building any and no desire to destroy South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kim Il Sung refused to clarify why he has refused to allow full 
international inspections of his country's nuclear facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I promise you we don't have nuclear weapons," Kim told Cable News Network in 
an interview marking his 82nd birthday, which was Friday. "We don't have 
delivery systems. We don't have the technology to build them." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that he was frustrated by claims that North Korea is secretly making 
nuclear weapons, saying, "I've just about had it." 
</P>
<P>
 CNN's Beijing bureau chief, Mike Chinoy, quoted Kim as saying: "The world is 
now calling on our country to show the nuclear weapons we don't have. What's 
the use to have them? We cannot use nuclear weapons against our Korean 
nationals" in the rival south. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Kim's first public statement on the nuclear dispute since it became a 
prolonged crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 The north's refusal to allow full access to secret nuclear facilities prompted 
the U.N. Security Council to issue a statement March 31 urging Pyongyang to 
allow inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 Pyongyang has repeated threats of another war on the peninsula if the United 
Nations pushes too far in its demands for international inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 In the interview, Kim backed away from an earlier North Korean threat to turn 
Seoul into a "sea of fire," saying the comment was "out of place" -- an 
indication that the north wants to reduce tensions on the peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have done a lot of construction in our country, and we don't want to 
destroy it. Those who want war are out of their minds," he said.

SCIENTISTS DELIGHTED BY QUALITY OF ENDEAVOUR'S DATA, PICTURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 NASA scientists said Saturday that they were delighted with the quality of 
pictures and other data beamed to Earth from the advanced radar instruments 
aboard the shuttle Endeavour. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuttle imaging equipment was aimed at forests, fields, deserts and oceans, 
while the six astronauts took matching photographs with a battery of cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 The astronauts reported sighting oil field fires in Argentina, a distinct line 
where the spring thaw has melted snow in Canada, and lightning flashes in 
violent thunderstorms over the Gulf of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Endeavour's launch April 9 on a nine-day mission, instruments it is 
carrying have filled more than half of the 183 data-recording tapes on board, 
in addition to sending data to a science control center at the Johnson Space 
Center in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 "The data quality has been superb," said Ed Caro, a National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration engineer on one of the radar instruments. "You guys don't 
get the high-resolution pictures that we're seeing here, but by the time you 
land I think it'll really impress you." 
</P>
<P>
 Another instrument, designed to measure atmospheric carbon monoxide, has 
worked "almost flawlessly," said Vickie Connors, a NASA scientist. "Our science 
has been beyond our wildest dreams." 
</P>
<P>
 Data from the mission is expected to give new understanding of how human 
activities are affecting the global environment. The instruments will fly again 
on Endeavour later this year.

DEATH TOLL FROM STORMS RISES TO 7; PARTS OF EAST COAST SOAKED

 Robert Williams told his flock to bring lawn chairs to today's service: He'll 
be holding it in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 A tornado ripped through the Community Baptist Church on Friday, smashing pews 
and scattering hymnals and Bibles across the field next door. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, assistant pastor at the church, wasn't complaining. "It's really 
just a building, it can be replaced. People can't," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The twister left one woman dead and at least 16 other people injured. Six more 
deaths were blamed on storms that tore through the South and Midwest on Friday 
and Saturday, including three in Kentucky and one each in South Carolina, 
Tennessee and Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm system drenched parts of the East Coast on Saturday as it moved out 
to sea. 
</P>
<P>
 In this Texas town 25 miles northeast of Houston, people who worked into the 
night cleaning up after the tornado were back at it early Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Under cloudy skies, they cleared away mounds of splintered glass, fractured 
tree limbs, tattered clothing and sodden furniture, and rummaged through the 
wreckage for anything that might have survived. 
</P>
<P>
 Some houses and mobile homes were ripped apart, others lost their roofs and 
still others stood untouched. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to 1,000 people were displaced by the storm, said Janis Parker, spokeswoman 
for the Emergency Medical Service in Crosby, which has a population of about 
1,800. 
</P>
<P>
 In rural Chester County in north-central South Carolina, a woman was killed 
and her son injured when a severe storm rolled through and tossed their trailer 
down the road early Saturday, State Police Lt. Don Lane said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was what sounded like a bumblebee buzzing over our house, and the 
lightning was flashing," neighbor Joyce Clack said. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm damaged about 10 mobile homes in the area, as well as barns, silos 
and cars, Lane said.

3 FAST-FOOD WORKERS SHOT DEAD, 1 HURT

 Three employees of a fast-food restaurant were herded into a walk-in cooler 
and shot to death early Saturday, police said. A fourth worker, wounded and 
left for dead, crawled to a phone and called police. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than two hours later, police arrested two people and charged them with 
capital murder. One of the suspects had been fired Monday from the Popeye's 
Famous Fried Chicken restaurant, police Capt. Jimmie Flanagan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuhuatemoc Peraita, 17, and Robert Bryant Melson, 22, were arrested in an auto 
that was stopped by police in nearby Rainbow City, Ala. Peraita reportedly had 
been fired for excessive absenteeism, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Flanagan said robbery was the apparent motive. "Money was taken and 
recovered," he said. He did not disclose the amount. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said Peraita was being charged as an adult under a state law signed 
Thursday by Gov. Jim Folsom, which allows authorities to execute people as 
young as 16 if they are convicted of a capital offense. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant was supposed to close at 11:30 p.m. Friday. Authorities said 
they believe that the shootings occurred sometime after midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Killed were Tamika Collins, 18, Nathaniel Baker, 17, and Darrell Collier, 23, 
the restaurant manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Police who arrived at the fast-food restaurant said they found the bodies of 
the three employees stacked on top of each other in the narrow, back-room 
cooler. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryant Archer, 17, crawled to a phone and called authorities about 12:30 a.m. 
He was taken to a hospital with multiple gunshot wounds in the chest and was 
listed in serious condition Saturday.

WRITER UPSET OVER STATUETTE RECEIVED AT STATE ARTS AWARDS; CONFLICT: AUTHOR 
ALICE WALKER SAYS THE SCULPTURE OF A NUDE WOMAN'S TORSO SENDS A MESSAGE OF 
'DOMINATION, VIOLENCE AND DESTRUCTION.' SHE HAD JUST FINISHED A PROJECT ABOUT 
FEMALE MUTILATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pulitzer Prize-winning author Alice Walker was horrified when she received an 
award statuette for being a California "state treasure." 
</P>
<P>
 The statuette, almost a foot tall, is a sculpture of a nude woman's torso -- 
sans arms, legs and a head. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker's latest work is a film and companion book about female genital 
mutilation entitled "Warrior Marks." 
</P>
<P>
 "Imagine my horror when, after four years of thinking about the mutilation of 
women, I was presented with a decapitated, armless, legless woman, on which my 
name hung from a chain," Walker told the San Francisco Chronicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker was recognized last month as a "state treasure" at the fifth annual 
Governor's Arts Awards in Los Angeles. Fellow recipients included director 
Steven Spielberg, artist David Hockney and actor Hal Holbrook. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker had initially refused to accept the state's highest literary award 
because educators had pulled two of her short stories from a state achievement 
test for public school students. Religious conservatives found the stories 
offensive. 
</P>
<P>
 But the state reversed its decision to remove the stories after public outcry, 
and Walker decided to accept the award on behalf of those who fought to keep 
her work on the test. 
</P>
<P>
 The statue was designed by California artist Robert Graham. A spokesman for 
Graham said the statue is fine art that will increase in value. 
</P>
<P>
 "In addition to its social value, the torso is a museum-quality work of art," 
said publicist Dale Olson. "Anybody who is an art lover would be happy to have 
the piece displayed in their home." 
</P>
<P>
 Walker disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Though these mutilated figures are prized by museums and considered 'art' by 
some, the message they deliver is of domination, violence and destruction," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker said she is going to keep the gilded statuette packed in a box. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have cherished much more something whole, natural, non-threatening," 
she said. "A feather found in the forest, a seashell or a stone."

SURFERS FIND SHARK-BITTEN BODY OFF SAN DIEGO COAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From the Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lifeguards recovered the shark-bitten remains of a woman off Point Loma in San 
Diego, authorities said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 City lifeguard Lt. Brant Bass said two surfers reported finding the body about 
200 yards off the popular Sunset Cliffs sunbathing beach shortly after 3 p.m. 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The county coroner said the woman probably died as a result of shark bites but 
did not rule out that she may have been dead when attacked. "Without an 
eyewitness we won't be able to discern whether the attack came before or after 
this woman's death," coroner Brian Blackbourne said. 
</P>
<P>
 The last shark-bitten body found in San Diego County was near La Jolla Cove in 
1959. Bass said lifeguards have no plans to close or restrict access to Sunset 
Cliffs or other San Diego County beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman is unidentified. She had a reddish-colored butterfly tattoo on her 
right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Rosenblatt, a marine biologist at Scripps Institute of Oceanography in 
La Jolla said that based on the woman's wounds, it is likely she was attacked 
by a 12-foot-long great white shark. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the chance of a repeat attack is small. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sharks just don't behave in real life the same way many of us have seen them 
in the 'Jaws' movies. More often than not they will be curious when 
encountering humans but not aggressive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although great whites are not as common off San Diego as they are in Northern 
California, other local species have teeth too small to account for the woman's 
wounds, he said.

TRUCK DRIVER IS BEATEN UNCONSCIOUS AFTER CROSSING TEAMSTERS PICKET LINE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 55-year-old truck driver was beaten unconscious after driving through a 
picket line in Pico Rivera, where striking Teamsters protested the hiring of 
part-time employees, Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Glen Yeatts of Santa Monica was attacked at a stoplight on Telegraph Road 
after breaking a line of pickets at ABF freight yard, about 4:30 p.m. Friday, 
deputies said.Yeatts is listed in serious but stable condition at Downey 
Community Hospital, according to deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies said Jesus Acuna, 37, allegedly chased the truck to a stoplight at 
Paramount Boulevard and removed a linchpin that connected the trailer to the 
rig. When Yeatts drove away, the trailer fell on the truck's rear wheels. 
Yeatts got out and was beaten unconscious with a pipe and a rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Acuna surrendered to deputies at the Pico Rivera station and was booked for 
attempted murder, deputies said. The Teamsters went on strike April 5 against 
22 major trucking companies after both sides failed to agree on a labor 
contract for nearly 80,000 workers.

COMMUNITY POLICING HITS HOME; LAW ENFORCEMENT: WHEN POLICE ASKED FOR HELP 
FIGHTING CRIME, VALLEY RESIDENTS AND MERCHANTS RESPONDED. AND THE CRIME RATE 
DROPPED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The many skeptics of the powers and potential of community-based policing need 
only visit with Officer Joe Losorelli and his often-mean streets of Van Nuys to 
see that it can work -- that criminals can be the ones put on the defensive, 
instead of everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 Losorelli is one of several dozen of the Los Angeles Police Department's 
senior lead officers in the San Fernando Valley who have been at the vanguard 
of the city's first concerted effort to promote the concept of community-based 
policing for the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of that effort in the Valley's five police divisions, the senior lead 
officers have enlisted the residents and merchants of the neighborhoods they 
patrol, asking them to become the eyes and ears of the Police Department in its 
war on crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Have they heeded the call? Have they ever, police say. 
</P>
<P>
 From the lush green avenues of the West Valley to Losorelli's blighted section 
of Sepulveda Boulevard to the gritty neighborhoods to the east, the response 
has been even better than police had hoped for, as homeowners and renters alike 
have joined with them to keep a lookout for crime and for crime trends. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 3,000 residents are registered as block captains in the Neighborhood 
Watch program -- a cornerstone of community-based policing. A typical block 
captain might have dozens of residents participating in their Neighborhood 
Watch group. The group members do everything from keeping an eye on neighbors' 
homes to conducting, with police training, surveillance on areas hit by taggers 
or other criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say they don't keep comprehensive statistics on the number of 
Neighborhood Watch participants but agree their ranks have been growing. The 
growth reflects a steady evolution of community-based policing in the Valley 
from a small cadre of officers and volunteers who went door to door in 1991 
seeking new Neighborhood Watch members to a well-oiled machine that is 
responsible for what police say is a dramatic drop in many types of violent 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Community-based policing is working just great out here," said Deputy Chief 
Martin H. Pomeroy, who commands all Valley police divisions. From morning 
breakfast gatherings to night meetings, Pomeroy said, he spends "the great 
majority" of his time these days working with community groups, chambers of 
commerce and any other organization that already is involved in community-based 
policing efforts or wants to participate. 
</P>
<P>
 Pomeroy cited such community policing efforts as the primary reason for a 14% 
decrease in serious crimes such as homicide, rape, aggravated assault, burglary 
and auto theft in the first three months of 1994 over the same period last 
year, and for a 9% drop in such crimes in 1993 when compared with the year 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had a continuing reduction in crime throughout the Valley," said Lt. 
Joe Germain, who heads an anti-gang unit known as CRASH, or Community Resources 
Against Street Hoodlums. "The reduction has been across the board." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials acknowledge that there is no way to definitively connect 
community-based policing with the crime rate, which is influenced by many 
variables. But they doubt the rise of the program, and the drop in the crime 
rate, is entirely coincidental or unconnected. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps nowhere has the effort been more impressive, however, than in Basic 
Car Unit 9A21, the domain of Officer Losorelli. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Losorelli became the first LAPD officer ever to establish a 
civilian network that included a block captain on each and every one of the 150 
or so blocks in his west Van Nuys area. For his work -- which often includes 
16-hour days -- Losorelli was named senior lead officer of the year in the 
Valley in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 And for their work, the residents who work with Losorelli saw a significant 
drop in crime and blight, and developed a two-way system of policing in which 
they have some say in how things are done. "No doubt about it," Losorelli said, 
"more people are getting involved every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Losorelli is particularly proud of one of his accomplishments: starting a 
Sepulveda Business Watch organization in late 1992 and transforming it from one 
merchant into a crime-fighting network with 360 businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Ed Brayton, the community-policing coordinator for Van Nuys Division, 
said all of his senior lead officers do as Losorelli does, although each is 
given leeway to work with civilian volunteers as they see fit. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, there is a kaleidoscope of community-based policing programs in the 
Valley, some large and some small. 
</P>
<P>
 Bilingual officers assigned to Project Amigo help Spanish speakers navigate 
the police and governmental bureaucracies, telling them where to handle DMV and 
Social Security problems, traffic citations, unfair-labor complaints and 
landlord-tenant disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 The vaunted Jeopardy program provides first-time juvenile offenders with an 
alternative to gangs and drugs; some box, while others keep themselves busy 
running and training on a track team, said Detective Andy Monsue, who 
coordinates many of the Valley community-based policing programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Operation Sparkle -- initiated citywide this year -- is in its fifth year in 
the Valley, getting volunteers to paint out graffiti and clean up trash-strewn 
neighborhoods. Monsue said 5,000 people participated in Operation Sparkle last 
year and that he hopes to see at least 1,000 more volunteers this October. 
</P>
<P>
 And of course, there are the Neighborhood Watch groups, which tell their 
civilian block captains of their concerns and alert them to crime problems. 
These, in turn, are passed along to police and city agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The information goes up and down, from the community to the police and back," 
Brayton said. "It's not a question of the Police Department saying this is the 
way it's going to be and you're going to live with what we give you. They are 
helping us formulate strategies and solve problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the groundwork for the Valley's community-based policing effort 
started with Deputy Chief Mark A. Kroeker, who was tapped by Chief Willie L. 
Williams recently to set up a similar program in South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Kroeker may have left the Valley before seeing his pet project come to full 
fruition, but he's been keeping tabs on it since taking over his new post six 
months ago. He says he is greatly encouraged by what he has seen in the Valley, 
both for its residents and those in the rest of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crime is coming down in the Valley and violence is coming down in the 
Valley," Kroeker said. "And to me, that is very encouraging."

ELECTRIC BELT BRINGS ORDER TO COURT WITH SHOCKING RESTRAINT; COURTS: THERE IS 
NO PERMANENT INJURY TO A RECALCITRANT SUBJECT. MANUFACTURER OF THE DEVICE 
DESCRIBES THE FEELING AS 'DEVASTATION.'

 Behave or be shocked. 
</P>
<P>
 A new electric belt can jolt prisoners into shivering submission at the touch 
of a marshal's remote button. 
</P>
<P>
 Defendants sometimes choose it, when they have a choice, because it can be 
worn out of sight: no handcuffs to give the jury a bad impression. 
</P>
<P>
 Some attorneys, however, argue that the painful eight-second "ride" amounts to 
cruel and unusual punishment, administered in a split-second decision without a 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an example of the law-and-order mentality run amok, said David Kairys, a 
professor at Temple University School of Law in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been going on now two decades of this very fierce war on crime, and I 
don't see us getting very far," he said. "There seems to be no end in sight to 
the things we come up with." 
</P>
<P>
 On one point, there's no argument: These things work. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dubbed REACT belts by the manufacturer, Stun-Tech Inc. of Cleveland, the 
devices have been on the market for three years. A 4-inch-wide elastic band 
wraps around the waist and fastens with Velcro. A battery pack fits at the 
kidney. 
</P>
<P>
 Activated by remote control like a garage-door opener, the belt sends 4 to 6 
milliamperes of pulsed, 50,000-volt current in an eight-second burst through 
the prisoner's back muscles. 
</P>
<P>
 The shock is weaker than an electric cattle fence, said Stun-Tech spokeswoman 
Elizabeth Ryan, but it's enough to make subjects scream and drop to the floor, 
writhing in pain. Though there's no permanent injury, the company says the 
feeling can be described in one word: "devastation." 
</P>
<P>
 About 150 of the $600 belts are in use throughout the country, Ryan said, and 
officers have had to push the button just three times.  
</P>
<P>
 All three incidents took place last year: 
</P>
<P>
 In Kankakee, Ill., a police officer immobilized an inmate who had charged a 
colleague at a hospital in June; 
</P>
<P>
 A San Diego County bailiff zapped a man facing assault charges when he started 
walking out of the courtroom during a hearing, and 
</P>
<P>
 A judge in Pensacola, Fla., ordered the belt removed from a murder defendant 
after learning he had been shocked outside court. The man, who had threatened 
to cut the judge's throat, was put back in shackles.  
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the jolt was justified, but the defendant's lawyer accused 
them of "Gestapo tactics." 
</P>
<P>
 At a pretrial hearing after the kidnaping and murder of Polly Klaas, a judge 
in Santa Rosa agreed to let suspect Richard Allen Davis wear the belt under 
street clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis' lawyer wanted him to wear the belt to avoid negative pretrial 
publicity: News photographs showed his client in a white shirt rather than a 
jail suit and handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Just knowing the belt is there keeps prisoners where they belong, said Capt. 
Thomas P. Twellman of the Orange County marshal's office.  
</P>
<P>
 The belt has been worn just once in a local court, and it wasn't activated. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't use it for rude conduct, we don't use it on misdemeanors, drunk 
driving, petty thefts, that sort of thing," Twellman said. "We only use it on 
felony cases and would only activate the belt if there was an overt act of 
violence." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The device is so new that many people haven't formed an opinion. The American 
Civil Liberties Union of Southern California has been watching the debate but 
hasn't taken a position, spokeswoman Mary Takita said. 
</P>
<P>
 To Kairys, problem prisoners should be restrained with either handcuffs or 
courtroom cages or removed from the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an example of our going really to any lengths at all, without thinking 
of what we do to some people or what we do to ourselves as a society," he said.

VOICES: 'BE PATIENT'; IT'S A FAMILIAR REFRAIN FROM THE POLITICIANS, SAYS A 
RESIDENT ACTIVIST AT THE IMPERIAL COURTS HOUSING PROJECTS. BUT WHEN WILL THE 
PROMISES TO THE PEOPLE BE FULFILLED? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNTHIA MENDENHALL, Cynthia Mendenhall, 32, is in her third term as 
president of the residents' advisory committee at the Imperial Courts housing 
project in South-Central.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cynthia Mendenhall, 32, is in her third term as president of the residents' 
advisory committee at the Imperial Courts housing project in South-Central.  
</P>
<P>
 As she puts it, she "came back from a long ways" as a former gang member to 
become a civic leader, and that checkered past is one of the things that has 
driven her to turn her volunteer position into a full-time, non-paying job. "I 
don't want the girls to turn out like we did," she says.  
</P>
<P>
 But Mendenhall says government apathy and a lack of funds have prevented her 
from putting an ambitious community-oriented program to work. And although she 
has witnessed many successes -- such as the South-Central gang truce -- the 
fact that much of her agenda remains unfulfilled leaves her frustrated. She was 
interviewed by Kevin Baxter . 
</P>
<P>
 What we need to do in the projects is empower the residents. Make everybody a 
part of it. I feel like I'm a voice for the community and I'm fighting for 
what's right, but I feel like I've let the people down because we should have 
more than this. We aren't trying to overthrow the government; all we're trying 
to do is get what we got coming to us. All I want is what I was promised. 
</P>
<P>
 It's gotten so bad that the residents never believe in the leaders anymore. 
It's that way in every project. We've been lied to for so many years, the 
people just don't believe us. The residents have been hanging on, waiting for 
the money we were promised, but it never comes. 
</P>
<P>
 The programs we have in Imperial Courts we created ourselves. The Housing 
Authority really hasn't done that much for us. We should have a gang-prevention 
program, so we're doing that on our own. We should have our own resident 
security program, so we're doing that. The community is running these programs 
and that's the way it's supposed to be. But we need some help. 
</P>
<P>
 Look at the gang truce. Since the Watts gang truce, we haven't had any 
problems with gangs. Crime has gone down. We haven't had any drive-by 
shootings. The truce is holding. And who did that? The people of Watts did. The 
politicians couldn't do it, though they tried. The Muslims couldn't do it, 
though they tried. The police couldn't do it, though they tried. Everybody 
tried, but we did it . 
</P>
<P>
 And what did we get for that? Not a damn thing! What we'd really like are some 
jobs. But everyone keeps telling us, "Be patient, be patient." As it is now, 
you can make more sitting at home than you can going to work. But nobody wants 
to sit at home. They want to work. I'm with those who are saying no more 
welfare, but only if you're going to give us decent jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Everything is related to jobs. Child care, training, gang prevention. When 
somebody gets out of the pen, out of jail, you tell them, "Be patient, I'm 
going to get you a job. Be patient." But there aren't any jobs coming to our 
community. At our unemployment center, they send you to Target, K mart, Taco 
Bell. Nobody wants that. We want good jobs with the telephone company, IBM, 
DWP, the probation department. 
</P>
<P>
 Why not pay these companies so much to get us off welfare? Like paying me $10 
an hour to train me for a good job. There are too many people walking around 
here not doing anything. To keep the community quiet, we need more jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 We just don't have the services either. It's not like it used to be. We used 
to have the teen clubs, we had the Community Youth Organization, we had Parks 
and Recreation Department programs. So that's three different centers you could 
have gone to after school. We just have the gym now. We need more services than 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 We need a child care center, so mothers who want to get off of federal aid 
won't have to worry about their kids after school. We need a transportation 
support center. We're trying to fund a 4-H club so we can have something for 
the girls. 
</P>
<P>
 We want to create some small-business ventures, small employee training 
programs, that will allow us, as we expand, to create more jobs and programs 
for the people. Since the riots, the Rodney King thing, the residents have been 
hanging on waiting for the money we were promised. If they're giving the 
Housing Authority money to give us, we haven't received it. If we got it, we 
could do a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 We could get the teen-age girls that are hanging on the walls and walking the 
projects and get them to help the kids with their homework. And with the money 
they make, they could put it into buying clothes for school, they could get 
ready for the prom or put in for college. They could learn how to open a bank 
account. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We want to start an employee training program for the men and women who have 
just been released from prison so they can be the kind of parents they're 
supposed to be. The men who used to drive school buses, they have all these 
skills but they've been laid off. They can drive the vans for the 
transportation that we want for senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 I have a lot of ideas, a lot of dreams. But it seems like if you try to do too 
much, if you try to help your people too much, that's when you get hurt. That's 
when doors start shutting in your face. They want you to stay quiet and do what 
they want you to do. When you try to be a leader, you don't have any friends. 
</P>
<P>
 But I'm not afraid to speak up. We should have more than this. You have to 
listen to the people, the residents, and the politicians will have to listen to 
us so we can tell them what will work for our people. 
</P>
<P>
 The pride in the community is there. We just don't have the services.

VOICES: BOTH SIDES NOW; AN AUTHOR'S ACCOUNT OF HER FAMILY'S DESCENDANTS -- 
BLACK AND WHITE -- STRIKES A CHORD WITH PEOPLE SHE MEETS ON A BOOK TOUR. IT'S 
LIKE HAVING 'ROOTS IN SEVERAL GARDENS,' ONE MAN TELLS HER.

By SHIRLEE TAYLOR HAIZLIP

<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Sweeter the Juice" is Shirlee Taylor Haizlip's account of the two sides 
of her family, one that has lived as black people and the other that has lived 
as white. The fair-skinned descendant of an Irish immigrant and a slave wrote 
about the arbitrariness of racial designations. Her themes of family, race, 
color and class struck a nerve with scores of people she met recently on a 
10-city book tour across the United States. These are some of the stories they 
shared with her.  
</P>
<P>
 Clutching a copy of my book to his chest as if it were some ancient poultice 
soothing an equally ancient wound, a middle-aged, caramel-colored black 
Angeleno looked as if he were about to cry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know this story," he said. "It happened in my family in St. Louis. My 
mother's brother left the race and passed for white, but he did not leave St. 
Louis. One day, when I was about 8, I was walking with my mother and she saw 
her brother coming toward her on the street. When he saw her, he turned and 
ran. She never saw him again. Ever since that day, I have had a deep and 
abiding rage for my uncle." 
</P>
<P>
 And in a Melrose Avenue restaurant, a blue-eyed woman whose sleek red hair 
framed a pale face asserted that she and I had something in common: "We are 
both the great-granddaughters of slaves." 
</P>
<P>
 That was one of the few times I was astonished by someone who claimed to be of 
the same ethnic origin as I. The other was at a book party at a Yale 
professor's house in New Haven. After my talk, a pleasant young man whose pale 
blond eyebrows were almost indistinguishable from the skin of his forehead 
confided that from that night on, he was going to live his life differently. 
"I've been recognizing only one-half of myself, you know." 
</P>
<P>
 "Which half was that?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, my mother is a white woman and my father is black, and all of these 
years I have identified only as a black person." A lesson to me that it is 
never wise to make an assumption. 
</P>
<P>
 At Wellesley College, the black students giggled and snorted knowingly as I 
recalled the lack of black hairdressers in town when I was a student -- 
something that apparently had not changed in 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 While waiting to go on air with a National Public Radio interview in 
Washington, D.C., I was approached by a pretty, dark-haired girl who at first 
glance might have been Irish or English. "I like the message in your book," she 
offered cheerfully. "I'm mixed race, you know, but most people don't know it 
unless I'm with my family; then they look confused or puzzled. One of my 
parents is Japanese and the other is white, and I took my looks after the white 
side. All of my siblings look Japanese. But I feel fortunate because I grew up 
in California and was brought up with great care to honor both sides of my 
family." 
</P>
<P>
 In Seattle they stood in line with their pictures. One woman told of an aunt 
and first cousins who lived as white, while she and her still sorrowful mother 
lived as black. From their pictures I could see no difference. An older white 
man showed me the picture of his obviously black grandchild. "I thought he 
could only be considered black, and this made me feel bad. What about our side 
of the family? I often asked. But maybe a new day is coming and he, like you, 
can say he has roots in several gardens." 
</P>
<P>
 At a bookstore in Stanford, a well-groomed middle-aged white man shook my hand 
and said that my book had inspired him to heal the schism in his family. By now 
I had learned to expect the unexpected. "Which side of your family was black?" 
I asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Neither," he responded, looking bemused. "It was a class schism. The part of 
the family I belong to is upper middle class. The other branch is working 
class. I tried once to reach out, but it just didn't work. I guess I really did 
not try hard enough. But I feel the need to try again. Thanks for making me 
want to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 In Berkeley, the white hostess of a radio program told me that her mother had 
found my book comforting, but not because of color issues. Her mother had been 
an adopted child, and at the age of 52 located her biological mother. The 
adopted child called the mother and asked her why she had put her up for 
adoption. The mother simply said, "I was just 13 when I had you. But there 
hasn't been a day when I haven't thought of you. I married your father and we 
had seven other children. They don't know about you, but I want you to come 
over and meet them." 
</P>
<P>
 The adopted daughter had a successful reunion with her biological parents and 
her siblings. She has been embraced by the family and now sees them often. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a great deal of pain in the American family. Seeking out and 
recognizing our very real genetic connections, rather than our constructed 
social differences, will begin to ease the pain.

Tuesday at Locke. TRACK

 If the competition were wondering about Michael Granville's strategy for the 
800 meters in the Arcadia/Foot Locker Invitational, they weren't alone.The Bell 
Gardens High sophomore wasn't quite sure either. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I have different feelings for strategies, but I didn't decide until 
I was right on the starting line," Granville said. 
</P>
<P>
 His choice at the April 9 meet was a wise one. 
</P>
<P>
 Granville, who was named the Indoor Athlete of the Year by Track & Field News 
magazine, led from the start and held off a late charge from Milton Campbell of 
Atlanta Douglass to win in 1 minute 51.90 seconds -- the fastest high school 
time in the nation this season.

 In the distance medley relay, Loyola's Hugo Rodriguez, Vince Cogan, Brian Duff

VALLEY BRIEFING: JOSHUA TREES; CELEBRATING A 'CURIOUS LOOKING PLANT...' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In the high desert, the Joshua tree is among the most prominent and enduring 
forms of native vegetation. Large specimens average 30 feet tall, with one 
giant in Lancaster measured at 58 feet and estimated to be 1,000 years old.  
</P>
<P>
 In some areas of the Antelope Valley, where many residents are fond of the 
gawky trees, they can be found in dense clusters spread over several acres. 
</P>
<P>
 Joshua trees thrive in arid regions of Southern California, Arizona, Nevada 
and Utah, generally at elevations of 2,000 to 6,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The Joshua tree is not a cactus, but is actually a member of the lily family. 
</P>
<P>
 They have been called "the most imposing yuccas in the Southwest and rank with 
the giant cactus (saguaro) as a symbol of the desert," according to a U.S. 
Department of Agriculture researcher. Early Encounters 
</P>
<P>
 The name for the desert tree is believed to have come from Mormons traveling 
to Utah in the mid 1800s. The Joshua tree's "rigid, angular, grotesquely 
pointing branches struck the imagination of the Mormons who likened the trees 
to Joshua pointing the way and leading them to the promised land," an author 
wrote in a 1938 book on California plants.  
</P>
<P>
 Some have seen Joshuas as the splendor of the desert - tall and stately, each 
one unique. Others have found them grotesque. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first references to the plant was by the explorer, Lt. John C. 
Fremont, who was definitely among the latter group. In 1844 he wrote that the 
Joshua tree "gave a strange and southern character to the country .... 
Associated with the idea of barren sands, their stiff and ungraceful form makes 
them to the traveler the most repulsive tree in the vegetable kingdom." 
</P>
<P>
 A century later, a writer said, "It is indeed a curious looking plant, 
suggesting, in its oldest forms especially, another age; one would not be 
surprised to see a huge prehistoric monster standing by and feeding upon the 
fruit on its upper branches...." Preservation Efforts 
</P>
<P>
 As many as 200,000 Joshua trees in the Antelope Valley were bulldozed and 
discarded in landfills during the residential development boom in the mid- to 
late-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Community-based efforts to ensure the continued existence of the Joshua tree 
in north Los Angeles County have had mixed results, with some saying the 
protection has come too late. 
</P>
<P>
 In Palmdale, a two-year-old ordinance requires that a minimum of two Joshua 
trees per acre be preserved on land proposed for development. The measure, 
which also applies to other native vegetation such as California junipers, 
allows developers additional destruction, but only as a last result and on 
payment of a fee of $200 per tree. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster's efforts to preserve Joshua trees date back to 1980. The city has 
designated four vegetation management districts, totaling about 2,200 acres. 
Developers who want to build within the districts must pay a fee of $6,200 to 
$7,500 per acre, based on the quality of the native vegetation on the site. The 
money the city collects is to be used for the purchase of a 90-acre prime 
desert woodland, about half of which the city now owns. The fee provisions were 
adopted in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 In unincorporated areas of Los Angeles County, Joshua trees lack protection 
except for a small tract west of Lancaster that has been designated as a 
significant ecological area. Any development proposals there are subject to a 
more stringent review. 
</P>
<P>
 Several years ago, county planners drafted an ordinance that would have 
provided some protection to Joshua trees, but it was never enacted. Their 
Desert Environment 
</P>
<P>
 With its stiff, lance-like leaves, the Joshua forms branches for the first 
time after producing its greenish-white flower clusters. Once a branch flowers, 
it does not continue to grow from the end but instead sends off a side branch. 
This process continues over the years to produce the tree-like top seen on the 
most stunning Joshua trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides propagating from seed, Joshua trees spread by underground stems that 
sprout a short distance from the parent tree. 
</P>
<P>
 To animals, Joshua trees are an important part of the desert environment. 
Lizards, rodents and birds seek shelter in the spiny trees. There is a variety 
of a butterfly as well as a moth, which pollinates the tree and lays eggs on 
the Joshua. The fruit of the Joshua tree is eaten by birds and rodents. 
Commercial Uses 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1800s there were attempts to produce paper pulp from the stems and 
leaves. "After shipping large quantities of both white and brown paper, the 
mill was closed, and has been started up only once or twice since," according 
to an 1891 article. "The time for yucca paper has not yet come...."  
</P>
<P>
 In the 1930s, the light, strong wood of the Joshua was used in the manufacture 
of splints.

LATINOS EMERGE AS SOUTHEAST POLITICAL FORCE; COUNCIL RACES: FOR THE FIRST TIME, 
VOTERS IN SOUTH GATE, MAYWOOD AND CUDAHY GIVE CANDIDATES FROM THE LARGEST 
ETHNIC GROUP MAJORITY CONTROL OF THEIR CITIES. 
</P>

<P>
 The political evolution of Southeast Los Angeles County seems nearly complete 
as cities throughout the region transferred more power to Latinos and ousted 
more of the few remaining white elected officials in last week's election. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters in the Hub Cities region, where Latinos have been the majority for most 
of the last two decades, shifted council leadership for the first time to 
Latinos in South Gate, Maywood and Cudahy. Following a countywide trend, 
incumbents were ousted in six of seven races. 
</P>
<P>
 Latino council members began winning seats in scattered elections more than a 
decade ago, but last week's results mark the first time in the area's history 
that most of the region's cities will be presided over by Latino majorities. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some winners said their victories demonstrated voter frustration with lack of 
leadership reflecting the ethnic makeup of the cities, but others denied race 
was an issue. 
</P>
<P>
 In Maywood, a city that is more than 93% Latino, white incumbents Rose Marie 
Busciglio, a 16-year council veteran, and Mayor Thomas H. Engle, who has been a 
council member for 20 years, lost to grass-roots challengers Elvira Moreno, an 
HMO representative, and Tomas Martin, a hotel food attendant. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters "were looking for Latino leaders," said Martin, who hopes to lead 
efforts to build a recreation center and expand programs for the city's youth. 
"They want people speaking the same language as they speak on the street. No 
one goes to council meetings now. Maybe this will help people become involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Busciglio said the vote was split by candidate Salvador Contreras, who she 
said campaigned on "racial issues." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was definitely 'Get the gringos out,' " she said. But she blamed her loss 
on poor voter turnout and effective use of absentee ballots by her opponents, 
which "killed us," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin, like many candidates throughout the area, encouraged voters to use 
absentee ballots and had garnered 25% of the vote before polls opened on 
election day. Voter turnout of 38% was slightly above average for a general 
election, a city election official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in Maywood, City Clerk Sam Pena won a landslide victory over write-in 
candidate Judy Tallman. City Treasurer Michael Williams ran unopposed. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 11-candidate South Gate race, newcomer Bill Martinez, an insurance 
salesman, and Henry C. Gonzalez, who returns to the council after serving six 
years during the 1980s, defeated first-term incumbent Larry R. Leonard and 
Johnny Ramirez, a quality-control specialist. Mayor Mary Anne Buckles was 
reelected to her second term, winning the third council seat with 13% of the 
vote. Leonard lost by about 50 votes, while Ramirez ran a poor eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 "The news media tries to make this a Latino thing, but we had a combination of 
supporters," Gonzalez said. "If it had only been Latino we wouldn't have won." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez agreed. "We were not running on a Latino or a la raza ticket. I don't 
think this is a victory for the Latino community, I think it's a victory for 
the people of South Gate."  
</P>
<P>
 Leonard also claimed that ethnicity was not important in the campaign but 
would not comment on reasons behind his loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll leave that to the experts," he said. Ramirez could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Cudahy voters overwhelmingly rejected a fourth term for Councilman Joe 
Graffio, who ran a distant seventh in the nine-candidate race for three seats. 
Parks Commissioner George Perez and Larry Galvan were voted in, and incumbent 
Alex Rodriguez retained his seat. Councilman Jack Cluck vacated his seat, 
leaving longtime Councilman John O. Robertson the only remaining white council 
member. 
</P>
<P>
 Voter turnout in the city was about 40% higher than in 1992, said City Clerk 
Jack Joseph.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think there was heavier Latino participation because of the Latino 
candidates," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Huntington Park, the election gave the council a 4-1 Latino majority. In a 
race where only one of nine candidates was white, ethnicity was not an issue, 
but perhaps gender was. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosario Marin, a former legislative aide to Gov. Pete Wilson, and Jessica 
Maes, a realtor and hospital outreach director, won seats to become the city's 
first female council members. 
</P>
<P>
 They will replace Councilman Luis Hernandez, whose candidacy was dogged by 
violations from his first campaign, and William P. Cunningham, who is retiring 
after 17 years on the council. Councilman Raul Perez was the top vote-getter, 
winning his second term with 22% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the community was ready for a woman," said Marin, who stressed basic 
values and family issues in her campaign. Hernandez did not return calls for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bell Gardens, Maria Chacon and Ramiro Morales, leaders in the historic 1991 
recall of four white council members who were accused by activists of racism, 
won in landslides on the strength of absentee votes. They defeated incumbents 
Josefina Macias and Rosa Hernandez by margins of more than 2 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The winners ran on a ticket supported by the No-Rezoning Committee, which 
organized the 1991 recall and initially helped get Macias elected. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have won three elections before," Morales said. "The people know us and 
they trust us. After all the turmoil on the council, the people want a change." 
</P>
<P>
 But Macias, once a Chacon ally, questioned the No-Rezoning victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the use of absentee ballots was thoroughly abused," she said, adding 
that she planned to ask for an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, when Macias was elected in 1992 as a No-Rezoning candidate, voters 
also cast unusually large numbers of absentee ballots, and losers in the race 
alleged voter fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 City of Commerce voters elected Parks Commissioner Sylvia Munoz, 51, and Jesus 
Cervantes, a community service commissioner, over Mayor Ruth R. Aldaco, a 
two-term councilwoman. James Dimas will retire after 20 years on the council. 
</P>
<P>
 While the rest of the region voted for change last week, the city of Bell 
bucked the trend. It was the only city in the area to reelect all of its 
incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
 George Mirabal, a funeral director and former city clerk, was the top 
vote-getter. First elected in 1986, Mirabal stepped down in 1990 and was 
appointed to the council last year after Mayor Jay Price died. George Bass, a 
retired fire chief, was elected to his second term and teacher Rolf Janssen won 
his third term. Key to Election Tables

MAYBERRY STREET SCHOOL FINALLY GETS SOME ELBOW ROOM; EDUCATION: AFTER 68 YEARS 
IN "TEMPORARY" BUNGALOWS, THE INSTITUTION GETS A NEW BUILDING. BUT STAFF AND 
TEACHERS SAY CLOSE-KNIT ATMOSPHERE WILL REMAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The way folks around Mayberry Street Elementary School talk, you would think 
the school was actually in Mayberry, that quaint little one-sheriff town in the 
old Andy Griffith television show. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers rave about the close-knit atmosphere at the Echo Park school. They 
say they make a point to meet a student's entire family, and students often 
return as adults to work there. 
</P>
<P>
 The school's nine portable bungalows, two of which date back almost 70 years, 
perhaps have promoted this closeness. At the very least, the old classrooms do 
conjure up images of simpler days gone by. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, after seven decades as a "temporary" school at 2414 Mayberry St., 
Mayberry has come into the 1990s with a sparkling new -- and permanent -- 
building. The two-story structure, painted pale yellow on the outside with 
forest green accents, includes 13 classrooms, a spacious library and 
administrative offices. Administrators will show off the new facilities at a 
9:30 a.m. dedication ceremony Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
 "A real school, with halls!" Principal Andrea Allen-Gonzales said proudly. A 
new playground and a parking lot were also built, and a separate building 
housing the cafeteria and multipurpose facilities is to be constructed in the 
coming year. 
</P>
<P>
 The school opened in 1926 as a temporary campus to handle the overflow from 
other schools in burgeoning Los Angeles. But rather than shut down after a few 
years as it was meant to, it continued to grow, operating out of the original 
gable-roofed bungalows and portable classrooms that were added to the site over 
the years. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, 480 children from preschool to sixth grade attend Mayberry. Next year, 
sixth-graders will be transferred to a local middle school, which will alter 
Mayberry's enrollment slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason it took so long for Mayberry to get a permanent building was that 
it did not qualify for state construction funds because the community is not 
considered a high-growth area with immediate space needs, said Lynn Roberts, 
facilities project director for the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 But the school district in the 1980s recognized the need for a permanent 
structure and sought other funds, Roberts said. Finally, the district 
identified the school as a "special needs project" and got funding for the 
$4.8-million building through special legislation. Construction of the 
multipurpose room, which will cost roughly $918,000, will be funded by money 
from the Community Redevelopment Agency's Bunker Hill project, according to 
district officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Other glitches delayed construction after the funding problem was solved. The 
building's original design was downsized after construction bids came in too 
high. During the replanning, the architect died, forcing the district to go 
through the tedious process of finding a new architect. La Canada Design Group, 
of Pasadena, was chosen. 
</P>
<P>
 Work was completed in 16 months, allowing teachers and students to move into 
the new building last November. It is a far cry from Mayberry's former cramped 
quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, the library and main office were squeezed into one of the 
original clapboard bungalows. The library, which was also used as a 
multipurpose room for school performances, music classes and parent gatherings, 
was housed in a classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 The new library in the freshly painted building is easily double the size of 
the old room, with plenty of seating and green-carpeted gathering areas and so 
much shelving that the present stock of books fills only about a third of the 
space. 
</P>
<P>
 In the former main office, two office employees dealt with students, parents, 
teachers and other visitors in one tiny, narrow room that was slightly wider 
than their desks. "I had to watch my back, because I could step on someone's 
foot with my chair, and people would hang over my desk to use my phone," 
recalled office assistant Irene Aguirre, a seven-year Mayberry employee. "After 
school, when all the teachers would come in, and parents and kids . . . that 
was something else!" 
</P>
<P>
 Two bathrooms served 18 teachers and their 16 aides in the old office 
building; the number of bathrooms has quadrupled in the new building. But 
another feature has proved to be more appreciated by teachers. "Air 
conditioning!" several agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Students also raved about the building. "It's pretty big," said Desiree 
Canales, 10. "It's got a nice color and the inside smells fresh." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayberry will keep three of its nine portable buildings. The other six will be 
refurbished and moved to other schools throughout the district, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with a modern schoolhouse, the small-town character of the school will 
remain, teachers and community members said. In fact, having all the classes in 
one building allows even closer contact among students, according to staffers 
and parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an old-fashioned neighborhood school," said Donna DiStefano, who has 
taught at Mayberry 20 years. "(As a teacher), you don't just talk to and know 
the child in the classroom; you get to know their whole family." 
</P>
<P>
 A former student of DiStefano, Liliana Jerez, has returned to teach, and 
another, Veronica Gardea, is a teacher's aide there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lived across the street for 18 years and I said, 'This is where I want to 
work,' " Jerez said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: BALDWIN HILLS; ROBINSONS-MAY GETS REPAIRS, NEW STOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Robinsons-May in the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza is celebrating its 46th 
anniversary in June with a splashier event than any store officials had in 
mind, but one they say is long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
 The store had sustained extensive damage during the Jan. 17 earthquake and was 
forced to close its doors. Recently, a Robinsons-May official announced plans 
to reopen June 6 not only with structural improvements, but with new 
merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took the opportunity to paint the whole store, put in new flooring and 
replace all of our merchandise," said Robinsons-May spokesman Jim Watterson. 
"It was time to improve the store anyway. This is something the community has 
wanted for years." 
</P>
<P>
 Watterson said that heavy water damage and extensive structural cracks forced 
the store to remain closed longer than expected. But the closure afforded 
officials the chance to spruce up the store. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the new paint and flooring will be a new mix of merchandise, said 
Watterson. The store was a May Co. until last year, when Robinsons and May Co. 
merged. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to take everything out of the store anyway, so this was a perfect time 
to do what we had intended to do for a while," Watterson said.  
</P>
<P>
 Two community-based operations that had operated out of the store -- the 
Museum of African-American Art and the OASIS senior center -- will also reopen 
June 6. In the meantime, OASIS classes are held throughout the Crenshaw area, 
including Christ the Good Shepherd Church, Crossroads Arts Academy and the 
Delta Sigma Theta Life Development Center. 
</P>
<P>
 For merchants with businesses on the mall's upper level next to the 
Robinsons-May entrance, the reopening won't come a moment too soon. Since the 
closure, they said, foot traffic dried up and sales, which had been sluggish 
anyway, plummeted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things have really slacked off," said Ruby Innis, who moved her Radiance 
Boutique across the mall last July in the hopes of improving business. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that a lot of people know that even though the Robinsons-May 
closed, other stores are open for business. We closed for a few weeks, like a 
lot of other stores, but when we reopened, people who came to Robinsons-May 
didn't automatically come back." 
</P>
<P>
 Sam X, a salesman at McClendon's Hats, blamed the mall management for not 
getting the word out that his and other stores recovered quickly from the 
quake. "There's been a total lack of communication," he said, adding that sales 
dropped more than 50% after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Bruning, vice president of mall developer and owner Alexander Haagen Co., 
said that the plaza advertised heavily after the quake, even erecting a 
billboard on Crenshaw Boulevard to let customers know that the mall was open.  
</P>
<P>
 "We appreciate the tenants' frustration, but we think that the business 
generated after the reopening will more than make up for the problems now," he 
said. Bruning said that the mall's other two anchor stores, Sears and the 
Broadway, will also remodel by the end of the year.  
</P>
<P>
 "Robinsons-May gave the other stores the impetus to improve too," he said. "If 
there's a silver lining to the devastation of the earthquake, this is it."  
</P>
<P>
 Bruning said that new tenants coming aboard will nearly fill the mall by 
December. Occupancy now stands at 68%. "The prognosis for the plaza right now 
is very good," he said. Bruning declined to say which stores will be moving in. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Innis shared some of Bruning's optimism that the plaza will recapture some of 
its glory of the 1940s, when it opened as the nation's first shopping center 
with two anchor stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting new merchandise in the Robinsons-May will be a real plus. People have 
been complaining about that stock for a long time," she said, referring to 
criticism in the Crenshaw community that the mall lacks top-quality goods. "The 
earthquake has been rough on us, but we just have to wait it out." ERIN J.

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: LAFAYETTE AND MACARTHUR PARKS; VAN GETS GAMES ROLLING 
AT PARKS 
</P>

<P>
 Like a knight on a white horse charging to the rescue, here comes the Mobile 
Recreation Van. 
</P>
<P>
 Sporting a new coat of white paint and fully stocked with games, balls, 
tables, chairs, arts-and-crafts supplies, juice and snacks, the van is the 
first of its kind in Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake and its surrounding neighborhoods have few recreation facilities, so 
the city's Department of Recreation and Parks decided to bring its fun and 
games to the area's children. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people who live in this community say it's overdue," said Joe Munn, the 
recreation assistant who operates the program with Leticia Hernandez. "Until 
now, the kids had nothing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 On Mondays and Wednesdays, the van rolls into Lafayette Park, and on Tuesdays 
and Thursdays it is at MacArthur Park. The program runs from 3 to 5 p.m. each 
day. Neither park had an organized recreation program until now. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, which began in February, has helped parents and children reclaim 
the parks little by little from drug dealers and other nefarious characters. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, I was a little uncomfortable, but we found that if you get the kids 
here, the negative element won't come," Munn said. "We haven't had any 
problems. It's been real positive."  
</P>
<P>
 The Police Department's Rampart Division has also stepped up its presence in 
MacArthur Park, a move that has improved safety there, according to Nick 
Salicos, the division's new captain. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the children who participate are from families without a regular home, 
Munn said, and may even sleep in the parks on occasion. "This gives them an 
opportunity to take their minds off things for a couple of hours," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 So far, the program has drawn about 50 youths a day. At Lafayette Park, Munn 
organizes three-on-three basketball games for teen-agers and young adults. 
</P>
<P>
 At MacArthur Park one day last week, two students from Vermont Avenue 
Elementary School, Danetria Smith, 7, and Demetrius Evans, 9, squared off in a 
battle of Connect Four, a vertical checkers game in which the players drop 
their tokens in a slot with the aim of getting four in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm gonna win you this time, so don't even think about it," Danetria warned 
her opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not going to win, little girl," Demetrius countered. 
</P>
<P>
 The competition raged fast and furious, so much so that the players forgot 
whose turn it was and the game ended in a dispute. A rematch ensued and they 
continued with their good-natured trash-talking. 
</P>
<P>
 At another table, Reggie Ross, 12, demonstrated his understanding of applied 
physics in Carrom, a pool-like game. "There're a lot of games here. I like it," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other children made puppets out of pieces of fuzz and sticks, or 
manufactured heart-shaped coin purses, carefully threading the plastic twine 
through the punched holes. A few parents volunteered assistance and 
encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can always use more volunteers or donated supplies," said Manuel A. 
Mollinedo, the department's assistant general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot program runs on a shoe-string budget of just over $50,000 for the 
van, the two staff members and the games, equipment and supplies. The money has 
been shifted from other programs in the department.  
</P>
<P>
 Jackie Tatum, the department's general manager, is seeking corporate backing 
to expand the program to other parks and neighborhoods and perhaps broaden it 
to include mobile computer or job-training classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best part about this program is that we're serving an underserved 
population and it's bringing families back to the parks," Mollinedo said. JAKE

 Reading, writing and arithmetic are tough enough. Elementary school students 
shouldn't have to deal with some of life's rougher subjects on their way to and 
from school, local educators say. 
</P>
<P>
 So Hoover Street and Esperanza elementary schools are enlisting parents and 
other members of the community in campaigns to protect students who must walk 
past drug dealers, panhandlers and cigarette and liquor advertisements at 
convenience stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "Schools are realizing that it's not enough just to say 'no' to drugs and 
liquor if you have stores advertising liquor and you see drug dealers selling 
on the street every day," said Isabel Vazquez, a Hoover Street teacher and 
coordinator of the Hoover Parent Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoover Street's strategy is two-fold: encourage parents to volunteer for 
safety patrols around the school and persuade store owners to do business more 
responsibly. 
</P>
<P>
 Four parents have already volunteered for the morning patrols and have even 
made their own red vests with "Hoover Security" written on the back, Vazquez 
said. More volunteers are needed to establish afternoon patrols. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers and parents are also lobbying store owners to put up "no loitering" 
signs, install better lighting, remove graffiti from their stores, and refrain 
from stocking fortified wines or selling single cigarettes, which, Vazquez 
said, encourage loitering. 
</P>
<P>
 A community meeting to discuss these matters is scheduled for 9:30 a.m. May 6 
at the school, 2726 Francis Ave., Room 41. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza Principal Rowena Lagrosa is recruiting parents and businesses to 
help implement a "safe corridors" program for students walking to and from 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need adults to act as guardians for the students," Lagrosa said. The area 
around the school contains dozens of bars, pool halls, liquor stores and alleys 
where drug use and transactions are common. 
</P>
<P>
 Some routes to the school at 680 Little Street are better than others, Lagrosa 
said, so she tells parents and children which streets to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the school plans to offer students uniforms in the school's 
colors -- turquoise, white and gray -- to make the students more noticeable in 
the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Lagrosa is also looking for stores or businesses to volunteer as havens for 
students who might be in need of assistance. JAKE DOHERTY

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: HANCOCK PARK; HISTORIC LIBRARY GETTING SHORED UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Work began last week on the renovation and expansion of the John C. Fremont 
Branch Library, a historic building closed since 1990 because its masonry did 
not meet seismic safety codes. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, paid with library bond funds from 1989's Proposition 1, will cost 
about $2.9 million.In addition to seismic reinforcement, the work will add 
6,000 square feet of parking and library space. Improvements will include air 
conditioning, carpeting, a computerized book catalogue and better accessibility 
for disabled patrons. 
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1927, the library combines elements of Italian- and Spanish-style 
architecture. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is 
one of the city's historic cultural monuments. The library is named after the 
noted explorer, soldier and politician John C. Fremont. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the closure of the building at 6121 Melrose Ave., the library has been 
operating out of temporary quarters at 736 La Brea Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is to be completed in the fall of 1995.

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: EAST LOS ANGELES; NEIGHBORS PROTEST ADULT BOOKSTORE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A loud group of neighbors and merchants, placards in hand, have gathered 
nearly every day for four weeks to protest the opening of an adult book and 
video store in their community. 
</P>
<P>
 They hope their actions will discourage potential customers of Andy's Adult 
Bookstore and force owner Greg Tucker to close up shop at 4624 Whittier Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as we found out about it, we jumped right on it," said Connie Nieto, 
who has lived nearby on McDonnel Avenue for 38 years. She and members of her 
Neighborhood Watch group and another residents group, More Advocates for Safer 
Homes, have joined Whittier Boulevard merchants in their afternoon protests. 
</P>
<P>
 The drivers of several passing cars honked their support as the protesters 
hollered and blew whistles to bring attention to their homemade signs: "Who 
Needs Dirty Business?" and "No Porn." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a slap in the face, what he wants to do to us," said Martha Martinez 
Cooper, who has lived in the neighborhood 42 years. "We're going to do this 
until he gets the message." 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker could not be reached for comment, but his attorney, Roger Diamond of 
Santa Monica, said Tucker is committed to fight for his right to own and 
operate the store. 
</P>
<P>
 Diamond filed a federal civil rights lawsuit Nov. 23 challenging the county's 
business licensing procedures. He says his client has a right to operate the 
store despite legal measures by the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to have county lawyers take action to 
close the business for operating without a conditional-use permit or business 
license. The permit was denied by the Regional Planning Commission and again by 
the supervisors. The supervisors plan to file a lawsuit in Superior Court 
seeking an injunction that would close the business until legal matters are 
settled. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a long history in this country of allowing civil disobedience," 
Diamond said.  
</P>
<P>
 Diamond said the county has wide discretion in denying operating permits and 
should base decisions instead on specific, objective regulations, such as 
adequate parking. 
</P>
<P>
 Students from nearby schools walked past as the protesters decried the 
potential harm they say could come from such a business in their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Other passersby yelled their support of the business. 
</P>
<P>
 But the protesters vowed to continue their effort. "It's not good for our 
community," said Martha Hernandez, who lives on Arizona Avenue. MARY ANNE PEREZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: BOYLE HEIGHTS; COUNTY OKS HOSPITAL PROJECT'S LAST REPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANNE PEREZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors' approval of the County-USC 
Medical Center expansion's final environmental report last week clears the way 
for state and federal funding, and gives neighbors a better idea of when they 
will have to move. 
</P>
<P>
 The $1.1-billion expansion, which will force 250 families from the Marengo 
Terrace neighborhood to the east, will consolidate all the hospitals at the 
site into one 2.1-million-square-foot building. The Replacement Project, as it 
is called, is needed because the main hospital building, which was built in 
1932, does not meet fire, earthquake or safety codes. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal now goes to the state Department of Health Services, which must 
approve funding before June 30. Hospital spokesman Harvey Kern said that 
property appraisals could begin immediately but acquisitions may take several 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 In hearings Tuesday and April 7, hundreds of Central Los Angeles residents 
voiced their support for the project to enhance medical services for the poor.  
</P>
<P>
 Forty-eight percent of County-USC's patients receive Medi-Cal -- which 
prompted the state to pay for that same proportion of construction costs. 
</P>
<P>
 And because the Jan. 17 earthquake damaged 16 buildings on the hospital 
campus, an additional $400 million will be available from the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency for the construction project. The agency allowed the money, 
which would normally have gone to repair and replace the damaged buildings, to 
go toward the new project because those damaged buildings would have been 
demolished anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of Cummings, Cornwell, Chicago, Charlotte and Marengo streets found 
the supervisors' decision on Tuesday strangely comforting because it gives them 
an opportunity to start looking for neighborhoods that they might want to move 
to. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the uncertainty of not knowing what's going to happen to us -- where are 
we going to live?" said Amparo Juarez, a longtime resident of Cummings Street. 
</P>
<P>
 She delivered an emotional address to the supervisors from the residents 
lamenting the loss of the neighborhood over the years to county facilities such 
as the hospital, Juvenile Hall and the former county Road Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the people of this community, and sadly for most of us who are Mexicans, 
Mexican Americans and Latinos, it appears that we are repeatedly being asked to 
relocate and find somewhere else to live because either a baseball stadium has 
to be built, a new county facility is needed, a freeway is required, a prison 
or jail is demanded or a school requires a bigger playground," Juarez told the 
supervisors. "This has been a historic scenario for the people of our 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the closing chapter on a grand community of families who have had 
courage enough to make a home in the inner city in spite of its rigors, and now 
it will be turned into parking structures and street improvements." 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the board also voted down Supervisor Mike Antonovich's proposals 
that families not be living in overcrowded conditions and be legal residents in 
order to receive compensation for their homes and moving expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials estimate the county will save $45 million annually after the new 
hospital is built because of improved efficiency and reduced operating costs.

 Three Highland Park men were killed last week when their speeding truck failed

 Police Detective Richard Lopez of the Central Traffic Division said all three

25-year-old driver, and his passengers, Mario Gonzales, 28, and Andy Fierro, 
26. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told police that the truck clipped a car as it headed south on 
Figueroa shortly before midnight and appeared to be going 95 to 100 m.p.h. 
Police investigators estimated that the Toyota 4-Runner truck hit the wall 
going 85 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 Police suspect narcotics were involved and are awaiting toxicology reports 
from the coroner's office.  
</P>
<P>
 Lopez said it appeared that none of the men were wearing seat belts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It couldn't make the curve and went straight and ran off the roadway," Lopez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had other accidents there," he said, adding that engineers are looking 
into widening the curve to make it less sharp. MARY ANNE PEREZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: SOUTH; CITY UPHOLDS BAN ON STORE'S LIQUOR SALES

<P>
 The city Planning Commission's refusal to let a merchant sell liquor at his 
store, rebuilt after the 1992 riots, appears to mark the end of a permit 
process that drew criticism from residents and store owners alike. 
</P>
<P>
 At the center of what some say is the last case of its kind is Yoon Kap Lee, 
owner of the Ball Park Liquor Store at 4228 S. Avalon Blvd. Lee said he has 
simply tried to reconstruct the store he lost. 
</P>
<P>
 His case was heard last week by the Planning Commission, nearly a month after 
a state appellate court upheld the city's post-riot restrictions on liquor 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee began rebuilding after securing a $500,000 small-business loan without 
immediately applying to the Planning Commission for a conditional-use permit to 
sell alcohol. The commission's zoning approval is required for store owners who 
intend to sell beer and wine. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission turned down his request for a conditional-use permit this 
month, finding that Lee no longer could benefit from a city emergency ordinance 
passed after the riots. That ordinance streamlined the rebuilding process by 
exempting store owners from the tougher requirements the city adopted in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Lee's store was destroyed in the riots, the commission found that 
because he did not apply until last fall -- after the one-year deadline set by 
the emergency ordinance -- he would have to meet the stricter requirements. The 
commission then decided not to approve his request as a new conditional-use 
application. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee said that delays in applying and rebuilding were due to financial 
problems, including securing a loan. He said that in light of the commission's 
decision he may not reopen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are still petitioning the Supreme Court," said Stephen Jones, an attorney 
representing Korean American store owners who challenged the city in a lawsuit. 
"And if that decision is that store owners don't have to reapply, then this 
whole issue will be void." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee's case appears to mark the end of a post-riot process that often put 
merchants and residents at odds over the need to limit liquor sales while 
encouraging mom-and-pop stores to do business in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 This is probably the last "rebuild" case, said Paul Lee, an attorney who 
represents the Community Coalition. "And the commission's decision sent a clear 
message to the (store) owners that when you are ready to reopen, you have to 
comply with the law. You can't circumvent the law." SANDRA HERNANDEZ

 Selling art through billboards may sound avant-garde, but officials at the 
California Afro-American Museum hope it will capture the attention of commuters 
-- and draw visitors and money to the museum at Exposition Park.  
</P>
<P>
 Forty billboards featuring Romare Beardon's "Quilting Time" were unveiled last 
week throughout Los Angeles County as part of the museum's first fund-raising 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles County is a huge place and it's virtually impossible to reach 
everyone, so we're doing a combination of things to increase awareness and 
membership, including billboards," said Aurelia Brooks, chief executive officer 
of the California Afro-American Museum Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time we've done billboards and it's kind of a test to see 
what kind of results we get. After all, this is a driving society." 
</P>
<P>
 The billboards will appear for a month in the San Fernando Valley and other 
parts of Los Angeles, Long Beach and Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks said the 30-foot billboards of the 1979 lithograph, which depicts an 
18th-Century setting of two people in a quilting room, are also meant to 
broaden the scope of the museum as a place that presents historical images of 
African Americans in the United States and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "This museum is a state museum and what it has to offer is not just for the 
African American community, but for everyone. So we tried to cover as much of 
Los Angeles County as we could in our first membership effort," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The billboard space, estimated at $30,000, was donated by Patric Media in 
November after Brooks approached the organization for help. 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor Yvonne Braithwaite Burke, who was a co-founder of the 
museum, called the campaign an important tool to increase membership. "The 
billboards will help get the word out that it's a vital museum in Los Angeles 
that is world recognized and a growing center of culture in Los Angeles," she 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 About 500,000 visitors have passed through the museum annually since it opened 
at the present site in 1984. Brooks said the state has slashed funding to the 
museum by more than 30% in the past few years. The museum received about $1.3 
million in state funding in 1991, and that amount went down to about $816,000 
this year. The museum does not charge admission. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been bad (economically) for us like it has been for everyone else," said 
Brooks. SANDRA HERNANDEZ

 Members of South Gate High School's Young Leaders of America club, scheduled 
to return today from the nation's capital, may come back rich in knowledge but 
they will be cash poor. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20 students, members of the school's nonpartisan political club, sponsored 
garage sales, sold churros and T-shirts, and solicited donations for three 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 But the group was still $3,000 short of their $8,000 goal when they flew to 
Washington on April 12, club leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been tiring" raising funds, said Carlos Privado, 17, before leaving for 
the trip. "I haven't been home from school until 7 or 8 p.m. because I'm 
selling churros or getting donations." 
</P>
<P>
 The group arranged the trip after a class discussion raised questions about 
how the federal government functioned, said Victorio Gutierrez, honors history 
teacher and club sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike other school trips to the capital, Gutierrez said, the Young 
Leaders of America planned to take a self-guided tour because the club could 
not afford a packaged commercial tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Los Angeles) promised to supply the group with 
transportation around the capital, Gutierrez said, but if that plan fell 
through, group members were prepared to see the city on foot or by bus, he 
said. Members also took sleeping bags in case they needed to sleep on the floor 
at homes of some of the students' relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 The club was scheduled to observe Congress in session, tour the White House 
and visit the Smithsonian Institution, Gutierrez said. The club also planned to 
visit some of Washington's residential areas to get a complete picture of the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 The group is seeking donations and will continue to raise funds until they pay 
off the trip, said Anarosa Pena, parent and president of the Pacific Coast 
Parent Teacher Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the group went into debt to make the trip, the experience would be 
worth it, said Pena, who paid $375 to cover one student's ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one time in their lives where they can see beyond their community," 
Pena said. "Who knows? Maybe this will encourage them in the future to run for 
political office." MARY HELEN BERG

 Health care providers could be wooed to the medically underserved Southeast 
area through incentives similar to those used to attract business to 
economically troubled areas, according to a bill being considered by an 
Assembly Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, introduced by Assemblywoman Martha M. Escutia (D-Huntington Park) 
would create 10 "medical enterprise zones" throughout the state and make 
available tax credits and other incentives to health professionals who practice 
in the zones. 
</P>
<P>
 The medical enterprise zones would exist within some of the 25 existing 
business enterprise zones. 
</P>
<P>
 If adopted, the bill could help reduce long-term and emergency health care 
costs by making preventive care readily available to needy residents, Escutia 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Bureau of Primary Health Care has designated the City of Commerce, 
Bell, Huntington Park and Maywood as "health professional shortage areas," poor 
regions where the ratio of residents to full-time doctors is about 3,500 to 1, 
and where there are high rates of birth and infant mortality, according to a 
bureau report. MARY HELEN BERG

 The beleaguered Police Department received a boost recently from some city 
leaders and residents who expressed support despite allegations of 
discrimination and harassment within the 60-member force. 
</P>
<P>
 When Police Assn.President Steve Hess confronted City Council members at their 
April 4 meeting, asking them whether the city was considering turning law 
enforcement over to the county Sheriff's Department, Mayor Ric Loya called the 
idea "a bunch of bunk" and council members unanimously expressed support for 
the city police. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm strenuously opposed to going to the Sheriff's (Department)," said 
Councilman Tom Jackson. "I'm for the Huntington Park Police Department." 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Gonzalez, vice president of Cerritos Valley Bank in Huntington Park, 
praised the department for its quick response to a recent holdup and warned 
that the Sheriff's Department would not be as efficient. 
</P>
<P>
 During a candidate's forum, newly elected council members Rosario Marin and 
Jessica Maes rejected the idea of contracting with the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the five council members, Jackson and recently defeated Councilman Luis 
Hernandez, have also publicly stated support for Police Chief Frank Sullivan, 
whose performance is being reviewed by the council. 
</P>
<P>
 And resident Manuel Delgadillo, a reserve officer in the Bell Police 
Department, submitted a letter to the council as a "vote of confidence" for the 
chief. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan expressed surprise at the public show of support but chalked some of 
it up to election season. Delgadillo, whose letter also criticized Loya and 
Councilman Raul Perez, is the son of unsuccessful council candidate Agustin 
Delgadillo. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council is reviewing the chief's report on problems within the 
department. Sullivan called the report "brief but substantial." MARY HELEN BERG

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: DOWNTOWN; STUDENTS GET KICK OUT OF POETRY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 What do soccer legend Pele and poet William Shakespeare have in common? Not 
much, you may say. 
</P>
<P>
 But the ideas of both figures came into play during a recent lesson in teacher 
Joyce Miles' fifth- and sixth-grade class at San Pedro Street Elementary 
School. Taking ideas from a lesson guidebook created by World Cup USA, Miles 
used soccer as a theme as she taught her students how to write poetry. 
</P>
<P>
 Miles first explained about rhyming patterns and read simple four-line poems 
to demonstrate how lines can be paired in rhyme. Then, she asked students to 
write a poem about soccer, one of their favorite sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Bonilla, 13, got the ball rolling by suggesting a good first line: "Kick 
the ball and make it go." 
</P>
<P>
 Javier Orona, 10, jumped in with the second: "When you kick it, make it low." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah!" classmates responded in appreciative tones as Miles wrote the lines on 
the blackboard. 
</P>
<P>
 The last two lines were more difficult. Students squirmed and knitted brows 
trying to come up with the third line. 
</P>
<P>
 Miles offered some assistance: "How about 'Past the goalie for a . . . point'? 
Or 'score'? Or should I change it? Give me an idea." 
</P>
<P>
 The students chose "score." 
</P>
<P>
 And then Cindy Soto, 11, offered the final line: "Let's go out and play some 
more!" 
</P>
<P>
 In this manner, the World Cup's Gaining Opportunities to Achieve Lifetime 
Success program attempts to make language, mathematics, science, social studies 
and physical education more interesting for fifth- and sixth-graders by 
integrating soccer and the upcoming World Cup games into different areas of 
study. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Cup's education and community outreach staff created GOALS teaching 
guidebooks and sent them to schools nationwide. In the next few weeks, the 
guidebooks will be distributed to every elementary school in the Los Angeles 
Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 San Pedro Street School, on the south end of the Downtown garment district, 
was one of the first to try out the program. 
</P>
<P>
 The school is a natural for the soccer-oriented lessons because of the 
popularity of the sport among its mostly Latino population, teachers said. In 
December, one of the school's soccer teams won the Ketchum Downtown YMCA youth 
soccer league championships. 
</P>
<P>
 San Pedro Street also happens to be the adopted school of Transamerica Life 
Cos., a Downtown firm and regional World Cup sponsor that paid for the printing 
of 3,000 of the GOALS guidebooks to be distributed locally. Transamerica also 
donated new soccer uniforms and balls to the school's soccer teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Miles said the lesson ideas in the GOALS guidebook are creative and effective. 
"It works right in with our math and language skills and poetry," she said. 
"I'm always trying to think of things that will pull words from the kids." IRIS

 Responding to community demand, the U.S. Postal Service has opened a new post 
office in the Broadway Plaza shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Garden Level near the food court in the mall at 750 West 7th St., the 
full-service post office is open from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through 
Friday.All postal services, except post office boxes, are available. 
</P>
<P>
 The new post office stemmed from the popularity of a temporary station at 
Broadway Plaza last Christmas, said postal officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The area has a strong market base, with 45,000 people employed in the 
neighborhood during the workweek, and another 10,000 to 15,000 people per day 
who pass through the area for shopping and various services, Steinberg said.

 A new exhibit at the California Museum of Science and Industry wants visitors 
to think about the quality of the air they breathe -- and what they can do to 
make it cleaner. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening on Earth Day, which is Friday, the exhibit identifies air pollution 
sources and shows how smog can be reduced through mass transit and building 
environmentally sensitive projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the exhibit provides serious information, exhibit curator David Bibas 
said he and designer Alexandra Wilson tried to make it engaging and fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to highlight the science behind all these environmental issues," Bibas 
said. "We talk about all the pollutants, their sources and the impacts, and we 
try to do that in ways that attract people." 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit's four sections highlight air quality, transportation, urban 
design and energy. Children can design a three-dimensional neighborhood using 
scale-model buildings to learn about environmentally sensitive urban design. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3,000-square-foot exhibit was created with Los Angeles and all its 
pollution and transportation problems in mind, Bibas said. "These are problems 
we think people should be made aware of for the sake of the quality of their 
environments," he said.

OUTSIDE LOOKING IN

<TEXT>
<P>
 Outside Looking In is an occasional column on how Central Los Angeles is 
portrayed by news media outside the area.  
</P>
<P>
 The Washington Post recently examined how the mathematics program at Garfield 
High School in East Los Angeles has fared since renowned teacher Jaime 
Escalante left the school three years ago. The story reported that this year, 
the 20th anniversary of Escalante's arrival at the school, "a large group of 
teachers and students mostly unfamiliar with him seem to be doing well on their 
own, a sign that Escalante may have done more for Garfield and for American 
education than even his own considerable ego thought possible." 
</P>
<P>
 The story noted that there were internal differences over how to continue 
Escalante's work and that the number of students who took Advanced Placement 
calculus tests dropped from 131 in 1992 to 86 last year. Teachers and students 
blamed the drop on the school's year-round, three-track schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Post reported, the number now appears to be holding steady. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Garfield's program continues to prosper without him, it will significantly 
boost the notion that demanding high-level work from previously ill- prepared 
students can work anywhere," the article reported. 
</P>
<P>
 But Escalante, in his third year at Hiram Johnson High School in Sacramento, 
"remains skeptical that Garfield can keep its program at a high level without 
him," the Post reported. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a big question mark," Escalante said in an interview with the Post. 
"You have to retain the good teachers to do the job."

 In a story headlined "Brooklyn Expatriates in Los Angeles Mourn Fading 
Reminders of the Past," the New York Times on April 3 used the renaming of 
Brooklyn Avenue to Cesar E. Chavez Avenue to explore changes in East Los 
Angeles and how the city's links to New York are "inexorably weakening." 
</P>
<P>
 The Times noted the rising political influence of the city's Latino community: 
</P>
<P>
 "Ten years ago, Hispanics were unrepresented on both the Los Angeles City 
Council and the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. Now, they have proved 
numerous and powerful enough to rename one of the city's most historic 
streets." 
</P>
<P>
 The story continued: "But a majority of the 1,500 people who signed petitions 
opposed to the change were Hispanic. Either they felt their own attachment to 
Brooklyn Avenue, or believed Mr. Chavez, who had few ties to the neighborhood, 
would more appropriately be honored elsewhere. 'Brooklyn Bridge made New York 
famous and Brooklyn Avenue made East Los Angeles famous,' said Julia Ramirez, 
whose family owns a local mortuary here. 'When they baptize you, they give you 
a name and you hold on to it and like it. We are not farm workers here.' "

1994 PREP BASKETBALL; THE BEST OF THE BEST IN HIGH SCHOOL HOOPS; BOYS: SEVEN OF

 There's no doubt about it. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to producing outstanding high school basketball players, the Los 
Angeles area ranks among the best. And the 1994 City Times' boys' all-star team 
is no exception: Seven of the 10 players have received Division I scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading the list is Toby Bailey of Loyola, who is making his fourth 
consecutive appearance on the area all-star team. Bailey, who guided the Cubs 
to the Southern Section Division I semifinals, was the first recruit to sign 
this year with UCLA. Crenshaw's Kristaan Johnson, who was the City Times' 1993 
Player of the Year, became only the third Cougar in school history to sign with 
the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
 Other players to receive Division I scholarships are: Crenshaw guard Tommie 
Davis (Houston), Crenshaw forward Tremaine Fowlkes (California), Fremont guard 
Calvin Patterson (Loyola Marymount), Manual Arts forward David Rickenbacker 
(San Diego State) and Washington forward Dayron Harris (Cal State Long Beach). 
</P>
<P>
 The April signing period began Wednesday, and that list may grow to include 
all 10 players. As of Friday, Andre Miller of Verbum Dei had narrowed his 
choices to Utah, Long Beach State and the University of San Diego, while Ricky 
Blackmon was considering an offer from Cal State Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Selections were based on a poll of area coaches and Times sportswriters. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys' and girls' all-star teams, along with their parents and coaches, 
will be guests of City Times at an awards breakfast at 9 a.m. April 24 at the 
University Hilton, soon to be the Crowne Plaza, near USC. Winners of the City 
Times' Player and Coach of the Year awards will be announced at the breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a closer look at the all-stars: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Toby Bailey, Loyola -- One of the top five recruits in the state. The only 
player ever to start four seasons under Coach Bill Thomason, Bailey holds most 
of the school's scoring and rebounding records. The 6-foot-6 forward is the 
Cubs' top outside shooter (51.3% from the field), but was moved inside this 
season because the team lacked height. Bailey averaged 22.5 points, 11.3 
rebounds and 4.3 assists while leading Loyola to the Southern Section Division 
I semifinals, where the Cubs lost to Mater Dei Santa Ana. He was selected to 
three preseason all-tournament teams, first-team Southern Section Division I 
and two postseason national all-star games. 
</P>
<P>
 Ricky Blackmon, Dorsey -- Considered a late bloomer by recruiters, Blackmon 
was the leading scorer (22.2 points), and second-leading rebounder (6.2) for 
the Dons, who reached the City Section 4-A finals for the second consecutive 
year. Blackmon is considered a slashing-type player, preferring to drive to the 
basket. But he can shoot well from 20 feet and in. The 6-1 guard made the City 
4-A team and is being recruited by Cal State Sacramento and Humboldt State, a 
Division II school. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Covarrubias, Huntington Park -- Covarrubias developed into one of the 
area's top point guards and was selected to the City 4-A team. He averaged 20.1 
points, 3.8 rebounds and 6.7 assists. The 6-1 senior became more of an 
offensive force this season, using his ball-handling skills to lure double 
coverage and throwing passes to open teammates. He is also an outstanding 
shooter from three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
 Tommie Davis, Crenshaw -- The most controversial story this season involved 
Davis' transfer from Fremont to Crenshaw. The 5-9 senior, who averaged double 
figures in points and assists, is considered one of the top 15 point guards in 
the nation and was also selected to the City 4-A team. Davis' most exciting 
play was setting up Tremaine Fowlkes for a dunk with an alley-oop pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Tremaine Fowlkes, Crenshaw -- Selected City 4-A Player of the Year, Fowlkes 
was the leading scorer (25.5 points) and rebounder (15.8) for the Cougars. A 
gifted small forward, the 6-7 senior was forced to play center and power 
forward after Leon Watson injured his shoulder. Fowlkes was runner-up to Jelani 
Gardner of St. John Bosco for Cal Hi Sports Magazine's State Player of the 
Year. 
</P>
<P>
 Dayron Harris, Washington -- Physically the strongest player in the area, the 
6-4 Harris was also recruited to play football by Division I schools even 
though he never played the sport in high school. Harris scored most of his 
points from inside, but could hit the medium-range jump shot when the game was 
on the line. Also selected to the City 4-A team for the second consecutive 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Kristaan Johnson, Crenshaw -- Although he sometimes appears awkward with the 
ball, Johnson, who averaged 23.3 points and 9.2 rebounds, was one of the 
toughest players to defend, especially when he backed his way toward the 
basket. Johnson, who transferred from Montclair Prep, became one of the first 
players ever selected to the Southern Section first team (1992) and to a City 
4-A team (1993, 1994). Johnson was named the City 4-A and The Times' Central 
City Player of the Year last year. Playing to a higher level during 
championship games, Johnson will best be remembered for the last-second shot he 
made to beat Mater Dei Santa Ana in the 1993 State Southern California 
Regionals. 
</P>
<P>
 Andre Miller, Verbum Dei -- The Southern Section Division IV Player of the 
Year, Miller averaged 23.5 points, seven rebounds and four assists while 
leading the Eagles to a Southern Section title. But those statistics are 
misleading because Miller rarely played more than three quarters, while Verbum 
Dei won most of its games by lopsided scores. The 6-2 guard was explosive on 
the fast break and could score from anywhere within 25 feet. He was an 
unselfish team player and an outstanding passer. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvin (Beaver) Patterson, Fremont -- The 6-2 swingman gave opposing teams 
headaches because he was too fast to be covered by a taller player and too 
strong to be defended by someone his size. With a 24.5-point average, Patterson 
was the area's best pure shooter. Another City 4-A selection, Patterson guided 
Fremont to the City 4-A semifinals and a surprise wild-card berth in the state 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 David Rickenbacker, Manual Arts -- Rickenbacker was another devastating inside 
player whose strength and quickness were hard to stop. He averaged 21.5 points, 
9.6 rebounds and 2.3 assists while leading the Toilers to the best record in 
the Coastal Conference. Selected to the City Times' second team last season, 
Rickenbacker improved his shooting range and defense to become one of the 
area's most versatile forwards. BOYS' ALL-STAR TEAM

 The Crenshaw High School girls' basketball team reaffirmed its dominance of 
the City Section 4-A Division, Roosevelt emerged as a worthy challenger and 
Washington returned to prominence during the 1993-94 season. 
</P>
<P>
 In its first 4-A title game appearance, Roosevelt put the Cougars through two 
overtimes but Crenshaw held on for its second consecutive City championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington, which won consecutive 4-A titles from 1989-92, rebounded from a 
10-15 season to win a share of the Southern Pacific Conference title and reach 
the 4-A semifinals under second-year Coach Julie Rousseau. 
</P>
<P>
 At the 3-A level, Jefferson advanced to the semifinals for the third season in 
a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw, Roosevelt, Washington and Jefferson have each placed two players on 
the City Times' Central City first team. 
</P>
<P>
 Denise Caudillo of Roosevelt and Kyetra Brown of Jefferson are three-time 
selections, while Kimberly Howse of Crenshaw was named to the team for the 
second year in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a look at the first team: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kyetra Brown, Jefferson -- The 5-foot-6 senior guard was equally effective as 
a ballhandler and a scorer, averaging 24 points and 13.5 assists. Brown had 70 
points in three playoff games, including 29 in a first-round 3-A victory over 
Poly. She has attracted scholarship interest from UCLA, Arizona and Cal State 
Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Pleshette Burrell, Washington -- The 5-3 senior averaged 11 points and 3.5 
steals in pacing the Generals to two victories over Crenshaw in Southern 
Pacific Conference play to clinch a share of the conference title. An All-City 
4-A first-team selection, Burrell had a team-high 19 points in an overtime loss 
to Roosevelt in the 4-A semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Denise Caudillo, Roosevelt -- A three-time All-City selection, the 5-6 senior 
concluded her career as Roosevelt's all-time leading scorer with more than 
1,200 points and holds the school's single-game record of 42. The Central 
League Player of the Year, Caudillo averaged 19.8 points. She scored 83 in four 
playoff games, including a season-high 30 in the 4-A championship against 
Crenshaw. 
</P>
<P>
 Maricela Gracia, Belmont -- An All-City 4-A first-team selection, Gracia 
helped the Sentinels to the Northern Conference title and an upset victory over 
North Hollywood in the first round of the 4-A playoffs. The 5-4 senior guard 
averaged eight points, eight rebounds and four assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Tina Greer, Washington -- Her 5-1 stature did little to slow the sophomore 
playmaker. Greer averaged 12.7 points, four assists and 5.7 steals. A City 4-A 
first-team pick, Greer poured in 30 points in the championship of the 
Washington tournament to help the Generals to their second tournament title in 
three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Zenobia Tyson-Hunt, Roosevelt -- Hunt established herself as one of the 
premier post players in the City, responding with 23 points and 21 rebounds in 
the 4-A final. A 4-A first-team selection, the 6-4 junior center averaged 16 
points, 15 rebounds and four blocks in guiding the Roughriders to their fourth 
Southeastern Conference title in six seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimberly Howse, Crenshaw -- Howse was the major force behind the Cougars' 
drive toward their third City girls' title and fifth appearance in a City 
final. The 6-0 senior center was selected as the City 4-A Player of the Year 
and earned All-City honors for the second consecutive season. Howse averaged 
21.3 points and 11.1 rebounds. She had 15 points and 17 rebounds in a 
quarterfinal playoff victory over South Gate and scored 18 points in the 4-A 
final. 
</P>
<P>
 Kristi Lattin, Crenshaw -- The 6-0 junior forward-guard averaged 20.1 points 
and seven rebounds. An All-City 4-A first-team selection and a two-year 
starter, Lattin scored 18 points in the 4-A final. Lattin sank four three-point 
baskets in the third quarter of the City title game to help the Cougars 
overcome a seven-point deficit and had a team-high 22 points in a victory over 
Peninsula in the first-round of the Southern California State playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackie Leverett, Jefferson -- The multifaceted junior led the Democrats in 
blocked shots at 5.5 a game and also averaged 19 points and nine rebounds. An 
All-City 3-A first-team selection, the 5-10 guard connected on more than 50% of 
her shots from the field and 75% from the free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruby Maciel, South Gate -- Accurate from three-point range and able to drive 
the lane, the 5-9 sophomore scored in double digits in 22 of the Rams' 23 
games. Maciel averaged 20 points and 11 rebounds, earning All-City honors and 
helping the Rams to their third consecutive berth in the 4-A quarterfinals.
