 SHE'S IN: White House press secretary -- and Valencia native -- Dee Dee Myers 
emerged a winner in a Clinton staff shake-up (A1). But if you were confused 
over conflicting news reports about her status, you were in good company. Until 
Friday afternoon, even her family couldn't figure it out. . . . When word did 
come, they of course were pleased. The White House "made a good decision," said 
father Steve Myers in Santa Clarita.

 NO ON 187: Organizers are hoping for a big crowd in Pacoima today at a march 
against Proposition 187, the ballot proposal that would restrict health and 
educational services to illegal immigrants (B2). . . . The proposition is a 
"tool for the persecution of fellow Americans," says Franco Fernandez-Rua, a 
march organizer who works with the Campaign for Human Rights. 
</P>
<P>
 OTHER SIDE: Reporter Tracie Savage, above, of KNBC-TV in Burbank, found 
herself in the middle of the O. J. Simpson story Friday when she came under 
harsh criticism from Judge Lance A. Ito. Columnist Bill Boyarsky (A17) reflects 
on the incident, writing about the competition that "makes the media monster 
constantly hungry for more news." 
</P>
<P>
 NEW LIFE: The Rev. Roger Barkley, the new pastor at the Congregational Church 
of Northridge, gave up money for the ministry. Yet his new faith has served him 
well in coping with his wife's cancer (B9). . . . Barkley has a good voice. 
Must be something in that name. The other Roger Barkley -- KABC's morning host 
-- has a pretty good voice, too. 
</P>
<P>
 RISING ON RADIO: Speaking of A.M. air waves, look who's moving up in the world 
-- Kevin and Bean on KROQ-FM (106.7) in Burbank. Their show was ranked ninth in 
the latest Arbitron ratings, a far cry from their embarrassing early days (F1) 
. . . . "I think you get a lot of points in this town for just staying on the 
air," says Gene (Bean) Baxter. Michael Arkush

RURAL HAITIANS HOPE TODAY'S MARINES WILL BRING PEACE AND FOOD; MILITARY: 
FAMILIES IN MOUNTAINOUS REGION FEAR RAVAGES OF LAST OCCUPATION. THEY ARE AMONG 
POOREST IN COUNTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The last time the U.S. Marines came here, they brought death. 
</P>
<P>
 The people living on this remote mountainside remember that; they wonder what 
the Marines will bring this time. 
</P>
<P>
 About 25 miles south of Cap Haitien, the people have watched with awe as Cobra 
helicopters and C-130s have barreled over their sky all week. They hope today's 
Marines bring peace and food and opportunity, not the destruction that befell 
those who resisted the Marine occupation here earlier this century. 
</P>
<P>
 Hylares Vergniaud, sitting in the still heat of her general store, clings to 
that hope because she has heard the stories of her grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pray the Marines this time will help get our country back in order," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vergniaud spoke of the suffering her people have seen from an increasingly 
severe international embargo that failed to shift the Haitian military men who 
ousted democratically elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. That put her in 
mind of the years of war and horror between 1915 and 1934, when the Marines 
last were here and fighting the local caco guerrilla resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 She prayed that unlike the last time, today's suffering would give way to joy. 
</P>
<P>
 "When God spanks his children," she said, "he then gives them food." 
</P>
<P>
 The last time God was angry, he sent the Marines and their mule packs of 
dynamite up along the Grande River that snakes through the imposing mountains 
called the Massif du Nord. 
</P>
<P>
 The Haitians in these mountains lead the poorest of lives in a tropical 
paradise. To reach them from the coast and Cap Haitien, where the Marines 
landed Tuesday, it is first a two-hour excursion over broken roads. Then feet 
have to take over where tires cannot tread. 
</P>
<P>
 The path leads up past verdant gardens, lush with orange groves and banana 
trees and the romantic smell of cocoa. Up farther, the Haitian proverb, "Behind 
mountains are more mountains," comes to mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Cine Chose Mesmen is 69 and lives with his second wife in a small hut with a 
tin roof. They have had 12 children together, and Mesmen has six by his first 
wife. They have all seen the helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
 Mesmen remembers the last Marine presence: "They shot them dead. They shot all 
the cacos they could find." 
</P>
<P>
 He told of a young man named Victor who was shot in an attack by the Marines 
at nearby Ft. Riviere, one of a string of rock-and-limestone forts built in a 
still-earlier conflict, to guard against the French, from whom Haitians wrested 
their independence in 1804. 
</P>
<P>
 The cacos, hundreds of them, had fled to the mountains in a desperate attempt 
to prevent the Marines from spreading out over Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "They shot Victor in the forehead, but he did not die," Mesmen said. "And for 
the rest of his life he walked around town with this bullet hole in his head." 
</P>
<P>
 The man who led the Marines was both brave and harsh. He was Lt. Col. Smedley 
Butler. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler would go on to become a general and a hero, one of only two Marines to 
win two Medals of Honor. His leadership would help bring the Marines into the 
modern era of amphibious warfare during World War II. He was a hard 
disciplinarian, but he was devoted to his men. His devotion to the Corps he 
proclaimed on his chest: a tattoo of the Marine eagle, globe and anchor. 
</P>
<P>
 But some of today's Marines, in Cap Haitien this week, concede that there was 
a darker side to Butler. 
</P>
<P>
 "The impression we have now is that he did not do a real good job in the way 
he treated the Haitians," one Marine official said. "The Marines were cruel, 
and Butler was seen as a racist, and they brought a lot to bear on the Haitian 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 The rebel leader bore the grand name of Charlemagne Peralte. He despised the 
foreign intruders and led his mountain guerrillas into skirmishes against the 
Marines. 
</P>
<P>
 But his record was not pristine, either. His resistance fighters soon became 
unable to provide for themselves in the mountain forts; they took to looting 
and pillaging the small villages. Caco , in Creole, means "bird of prey." 
</P>
<P>
 The people could trust no one. And then one day, in 1919, Butler led more than 
60 Marines up the mountain with rifles and two tons of dynamite. They cornered 
a band of the cacos in the fort and killed all but a few. Peralte was among 
those who escaped. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day Butler marched back into the fort and, with his dynamite, blew it 
apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Several months later, the Marines killed Peralte. Then they photographed his 
body for propaganda. The move backfired; the image of the dead resistance 
leader spawned generations of anger and the embellishments about Marine 
brutality reflected in the memories of the mountain folk. 
</P>
<P>
 Today the people of Bahon turn their eyes skyward when they hear the Marines 
flying overhead. And they wonder: What will they bring?

FOR HUNGRY, NEEDY HAITIANS, A SINGLE GOAL -- STAYING ALIVE; CARIBBEAN: RELIEF 
AGENCIES FEED ONE PERSON IN SEVEN. HUMANITARIAN AID WILL BE A MAJOR TASK FOR 
U.S. FORCES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The kids in line at Bon Berger School are not thinking about U.S. troops or a 
president in waiting or generals who won't go. Clutching their enameled bowls, 
they want lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 In this falling-down port city in northwestern Haiti, and all across a 
destitute nation plumbing new depths of poverty after a three-year embargo, 
people focus on a single goal: staying alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon Stetus, 3, is just about making it. Each noon, he toddles up to the 
black kettles under a banana tree for a dollop of thick gruel. He wolfs down 
most and saves a little for his family. 
</P>
<P>
 All around him, telltale carrot-colored hair and protruding bellies reveal 
deficiencies, parasites and diseases that cut short young lives. Sunken-cheeked 
adults look hardly better. 
</P>
<P>
 "For most, our feeding program provides the only meal they get," said Chris 
Sykes of CARE, which is the largest employer in a city whose population has 
been listed as high as 70,000. Its payroll is only 400 people. 
</P>
<P>
 CARE reaches 300,000 children in Gonaives and elsewhere in Haiti's northwest. 
Since last year, new centers hand out emergency rations of grain and cooking 
oil to another 320,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Altogether, voluntary agencies feed 1 million of Haiti's 7 million 
inhabitants. U.S. officers list humanitarian aid as a main goal of Operation 
Uphold Democracy, but little has yet been planned. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is some confusion," said Tom Friedeberg, CARE director in Haiti, who 
began his first meetings with U.S. generals Thursday. "I don't think anyone is 
quite sure of what should be done." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonaives, a crucible of political ferment since African slaves declared 
independence from France here in 1804, is where the insurrection against the 
Duvalier dynasty began a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In April this year, soldiers surrounded the fetid slum of Raboteau and 
massacred at least 30 people believed loyal to exiled President Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Gonaives is a living ghost town, its spirit broken. Unemployment may be 
95%, but no municipal workers are left to make an assessment. Business is done 
on rickety tables in the street. 
</P>
<P>
 When word came that the Americans might actually invade, the deputy commander 
of the region slipped into jeans and a sport shirt and exchanged the army tags 
on his jeep for civilian license plates. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the town, the 400 children at Bon Berger, age 3 to 16, are a microcosm 
of Haiti's anguish and an indication of what U.S. officers face in trying to 
make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Anita Beausejour watches her son eat and hopes he will fill up before 
finishing his pile. She feeds seven children, including a son of 21 who closed 
his tailor shop because no one can afford clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband farms corn, but a drought in July withered up to 90% of the 
region's crop. The next harvest is not until December, provided sporadic rains 
do not stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "At night, I give my family whatever we have," she said. "Corn, beans, 
vegetables." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the night before, she looked away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I gave them nothing," she said. "If there was money, we could buy food. But 
there is no money." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked what she would serve for the next meal, she looked away again, eyes 
moistening. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. government already pays food and transportation costs for the 
voluntary agencies' programs -- about $50 million a year -- and it is not clear 
how much new funding might be available. 
</P>
<P>
 If U.S. aid is to make an impact, most aid workers say, a basic, urgent 
priority must be repairing Haiti's physical and governmental infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
 Halfway from Port-au-Prince to Gonaives, a total distance of 120 miles, the 
paved road deteriorates in axle-breaking ruts. Many main roads have washed out 
or crumbled away. 
</P>
<P>
 Miles of irrigation canals are blocked solid. Power and phone lines are down. 
Generators are dilapidated. Topsoil washes down denuded hillsides and into 
fishing areas of estuaries. 
</P>
<P>
 While economists wrestle with the larger problems of creating formal jobs and 
a functioning democracy, the aid workers say, thousands can be employed on 
humanitarian cash-for-work projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "It works," CARE's Sykes said, pointing to a gang of men digging out a canal 
along the highway for the minimum wage of about a dollar a day. "It puts cash 
in the economy, and the work gets done." 
</P>
<P>
 But only a few thousand people receive day wages from voluntary agencies, 
which are limited by tight budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 At Bon Berger, no one is yet expecting any miracles from Operation Uphold 
Democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon Stetus' mother, Yolande, was amazed to learn that Americans had landed 
in Haiti. Her friends own no radios and, in any case, battery money would have 
long ago gone into the food pot. 
</P>
<P>
 Siemene Augustin, in a fiery red dress and no shoes, led one son up to the 
food pots and balanced a younger daughter on her hip. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the others, she had not heard that Americans were coming, and she looked 
doubtful when told their intention was to make her life better. "Maybe," she 
said.

her hand that she had gotten from gardening. The patient died of the 
complications of AIDS, but it was not until she tried to give blood in 1990 
that her own AIDS was discovered. Mrs. Fassbinder then began to travel, warning

BENNY BAKER; FILM COMIC GOT HIS START AT HAL ROACH STUDIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Benny Baker, the wide-eyed, round-faced film comic who portrayed bellboys, 
Western Union messengers and bank clerks in more than 75 films dating back to 
the early 1930s two-reelers of producer Hal Roach, has died. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the Motion Picture and Television Fund Hospital said he died 
Tuesday at the Woodland Hills facility at age 87. 
</P>
<P>
 His film roles came after he had spent most of the 1920s in vaudeville and 
burlesque, where his chubby cheeks and quizzical expressions lent themselves to 
slapstick. 
</P>
<P>
 His first film was "The Hell Cat" in 1934; his last was "Jory" in 1973. His 
last appearance on stage was in a 1971 Broadway revival of "No, No, Nanette" 
with Ruby Keeler and Patsy Kelly, his old friend from their years with Roach. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview for the film anthology "Who's Who in Hollywood," Baker 
complained that "Hollywood agents leave us (older actors) out in the cold." He 
joked that he was working on his memoirs, which he had titled "My Phone Is 
Empty. " 
</P>
<P>
 "They're only looking for people under 30," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His other pictures included "The Big Broadcast of 1936," "The Inspector 
General," "Papa's Delicate Condition" and "Paint Your Wagon." 
</P>
<P>
 Survivors include his wife, Edith, a daughter, Zoe, and two grandchildren.

MADELEINE RENAUD; LEADING ACTRESS OF FRENCH THEATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Madeleine Renaud, a stage and screen actress for six decades who with her late 
husband, actor-director Jean-Louis Barrault, formed the First Couple of the 
French theater, died Friday at the American Hospital in Paris. She was 94. 
</P>
<P>
 She and Barrault, who died in January, were considered the French equivalent 
of America's Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne. Friends said Renaud had been in 
poor health since the death of her husband of 54 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Renaud was just 5 feet tall, but her stage presence and versatility were 
commanding. 
</P>
<P>
 She was known in America primarily for her appearance in the World War II saga 
"The Longest Day," and for playing Maude in a U.S. touring company adaptation 
of "Harold and Maude," in which she played the role of the funeral-going, 
romantic octogenarian made famous in film by Ruth Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to have a heart and a soul to play Maude," she told a French theater 
critic in 1977. "But don't be mistaken, you've got to have muscle too." 
</P>
<P>
 Although she had written short stories, plays and a novel as a girl, drama 
inspired her most, and she entered the Conservatory for the Performing Arts. 
Her performance in Moliere's "School for Wives" earned her the conservatory's 
top honor, and she joined the Comedie Francaise at 21. 
</P>
<P>
 A leading lady there for 24 years, she performed the French classic repertory 
of playwrights Racine, Corneille, Musset and Marivaux. 
</P>
<P>
 She married Barrault, 10 years her junior, in 1940. In 1947 they founded the 
popular Theatre de Marigny on the Champs Elysees, which played for a decade to 
audiences packed with artists, intellectuals and other celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
 After a brilliant decade at Marigny, the Renaud-Barrault troupe moved to the 
Theatre de l'Odeon, where they staged works by contemporary playwrights such as 
Jean Anouilh, Jean Giraudoux, Eugene Ionesco and Samuel Beckett. 
</P>
<P>
 Renaud adapted her melodious voice and delicate gestures to tragedy, comedy, 
and even vaudeville. 
</P>
<P>
 She appeared in such French films as "Jean de la Lune," "La Maternelle," 
"Maria Chapdelaine," and "La Mandarine."

THE REV. DANIEL CORRIGAN, 93; EPISCOPAL BISHOP, RIGHTS ACTIVIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rev. Daniel Corrigan, an Episcopal bishop who demonstrated for peace and 
civil rights and was among the first of his faith to seek the ordination of 
women and homosexuals as priests, has died at his retirement home in Santa 
Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 A family spokesman said Corrigan died Wednesday of complications after a fall 
at his home last week. 
</P>
<P>
 He was 93. 
</P>
<P>
 A veteran of the submarine service in World War I and the merchant marine 
afterward, he was attracted to the ministry after the death of his first wife. 
He entered a seminary in Nashotah, Wis., in 1922. He was ordained a priest in 
1925. By 1958, he was offered bishoprics in Colorado and Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
 He accepted the Colorado position and became director of the Home Department 
of the Executive Council of the Episcopal Church with responsibility for 
domestic missionary programs. He became philosopher in residence and minister 
to Amherst College. 
</P>
<P>
 It was during this period that he marched with Martin Luther King Jr. in 
Washington and sat with him when King delivered his famous "I Have a Dream" 
speech in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1970s he was among the first priests to stand at the general convention 
of the Episcopal Church and advocate gay rights and the ordination of 
homosexuals and women. 
</P>
<P>
 Corrigan retired in 1970 and moved to Santa Barbara but remained active in his 
church. He assisted the bishop of Los Angeles with ordinations and other 
rituals. In 1974, with three other prelates, he ordained the first women as 
Episcopal priests. 
</P>
<P>
 Survivors include his wife, Elizabeth; four sons; 18 grandchildren, and nine 
great-grandchildren.

CONFEREES ADOPT POLICY ON GUNS FOR SCHOOL FUNDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 House and Senate negotiators agreed Friday to require one-year suspensions of 
students who bring guns to school, but to drop a provision in existing law that 
automatically cuts off funds to school districts that don't have such a policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The compromise came as the negotiators sought to settle differences between 
the House and Senate versions of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act 
reauthorization. The measure authorizes nearly $13 billion; current law expires 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 A major sticking point is the formula for distributing money to aid 
educationally disadvantaged children, who tend to be poor. House and Senate 
staffers planned to work through the weekend in an attempt to reach a 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate version of the legislation included a provision requiring school 
boards to establish policies opposing guns in school and mandated a one-year 
expulsion for students who violate the policy. School boards that didn't comply 
would lose their share of ESEA funds. That same provision is included in the 
Goals 2000 Act, which became law last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said Friday that the Senate language is 
designed to make America's schools safe. "I have no doubt that this legislation 
will save youngsters' lives," she said. "It will say to parents that schools 
can be safe." 
</P>
<P>
 The House bill also called for policies against guns in school, but left it to 
school boards to set the punishment. Supporters of the House version said it 
correctly left the responsibility for deciding punishment with local school 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't understand why we still want to federalize school discipline," said 
Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
 House negotiators agreed, 15 to 12, to a compromise offered by the Senate. It 
requires states that receive funds under the act to require local school 
districts to adopt a mandatory one-year expulsion policy. Local school boards 
or superintendents could modify the punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the bill does not require a cutoff of funds, supporters of the 
compromise said they expected enforcement to be addressed in Education 
Department regulations.

<P>
 Two major Protestant denominations will hold regional gatherings at Los 
Angeles churches next week to define and plan their missions for the turn of 
the century. 
</P>
<P>
 The Presbytery of the Pacific will convene Kaleidoscope '94 from 8:15 a.m. to 
4 p.m. next Saturday at First Presbyterian Church of Hollywood. The conference 
theme is "The Year 2000: Sharing Our Faith." 
</P>
<P>
 On the same day, the Los Angeles District of the California-Pacific Annual 
Conference of the United Methodist Church will present "Vision 2000: Planning 
for Ministry Into the Next Century" from 8:30 a.m. to noon at Holman United 
Methodist Church. 
</P>
<P>
 The keynote speaker for the Presbyterian gathering will be the Rev. Ben 
Campbell Johnson, professor of evangelism and church growth at Columbia 
Theological Seminary in Decatur, Ga. Johnson, who has written several books on 
evangelism, will speak about "What Most Presbyterian Churches Need." 
</P>
<P>
 The gathering will be a reflection of the church "not as a one-dimensional 
picture, but as an intertwined and ever-changing kaleidoscope, encompassing 
worship, education, mission, evangelism, peacemaking and social concerns," said 
Linda Culbertson, acting general presbyter. 
</P>
<P>
 Speakers and seminar leaders include local pastors as well as Emory University 
professor Robert M. Franklin, author of "Liberating Visions: Change and 
Continuity in Black Church Culture"; the Rev. Jacquelyn Grant, professor of 
systematic theology at the Interdenominational Theological Center and the 
author of "White Woman's Christ, Black Woman's Jesus", and poet Ann Weems, 
author of "Kneeling in Jerusalem." 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five seminars will be presented, some in Spanish, Korean and Taiwanese. 
About 700 are expected to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Methodist conference, the emphasis will be strictly local. Event 
organizer Pansy Wing said that at least 100 Los Angeles-area clergy and lay 
leaders in church ministry teams are expected to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the clergy from Greater Los Angeles will lead five sessions 
inspired by the 1989 book "Vision 2000: Planning for Ministry Into the Next 
Century," by United Methodist leaders, the Revs. Joe A. Harding and Ralph W. 
Mohney, Wing said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Sharon Rhodes-Wickett of Westwood United Methodist Church will lead a 
workshop on how a church can clarify its goals and revitalize itself. The Rev. 
Lydia Waters of Crossroads United Methodist Church in Los Angeles will speak 
about the "Evangelism Explosion." Al Pineda, chairman of the Hispanic 
Ministries of the California-Pacific Conference, will conduct a sixth workshop, 
in Spanish, on the meaning of Vision 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes we become too comfortable as Christians," Wind said. "A few of our 
district churches are struggling, and this conference is one way of helping 
them. It is a call to the other churches to say, 'What good things are you 
doing?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Advance registration is required for both events. For information about fees, 
location, child care, youth and group rates, call Linda Culbertson or Patricia 
Gruver at the Presbytery of the Pacific (310) 670-5076 or Lesa Smith at the Los

HE TAKES THE HEAT, HE NEEDS THE TOOLS; WHITE WANTS TIGHTER CONTROL OVER RAIL 
PROJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With billions of dollars going into subway and rail construction projects in 
Los Angeles, how can we ensure that the public is getting a first-rate system, 
one that is safe and cost-effective? 
</P>
<P>
 That's undeniably the Metropolitan Transit Authority's responsibility. The 
development of serious problems in subway construction, including tunnel walls 
built thinner than designed and leaks of potentially hazardous gases, signals 
the need for the MTA to provide better accountability and oversight for the 
nation's largest public works project. 
</P>
<P>
 The current structure of the MTA obscures accountability. Without a change, 
public confidence and the very credibility of the MTA and its transportation 
system could suffer, both locally and nationally. Already federal authorities 
are investigating the tunnel problems. The MTA board of directors must take 
action and support the recent moves by the agency's chief executive officer, 
Franklin White. 
</P>
<P>
 To secure tighter control over subway and rail projects, White has hired Jerry 
B. Baxter, a Caltrans veteran, to review how the MTA designs, builds and 
monitors the transit projects. In addition, White has proposed to dissolve the 
Rail Construction Corp., a subsidiary agency of the MTA, which in 1990 assumed 
authority over rail construction held by the Southern California Rapid Transit 
District when it was merged with the Los Angeles County Transportation 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The RCC has its own board of political appointees who recommend contract 
awards and changes to the MTA. The RCC also has quality control oversight and 
monitoring responsibilities; so why has it come under fire recently for 
problems of construction quality and cost overruns? An accountability problem 
perhaps? After the first tunnel problems surfaced, White ordered an outside 
review, which did find some problems in construction management. 
</P>
<P>
 White acknowledges that a revamp does not guarantee that the rest of the Metro 
Rail construction will be problem-free. But, as head of the MTA, he is 
reasonably asking that the lines of responsibility at least be made clear-cut. 
No other city has found it necessary to use a similarly structured unit to 
oversee transit construction. Indeed, the RCC structure appears to dilute and 
obscure accountability rather than enhance it. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA board has put off a vote on the RCC proposal until next month, partly 
at the request of Mayor Richard Riordan and City Councilman Richard Alatorre, 
who were unable to attend the MTA meeting this week. The mayor, with his three 
appointees to the MTA board, can and should play a pivotal role in supporting 
White's RCC proposal to help create a world-class transit system in Los 
Angeles.

GOVERNMENT WATCH; WORK ETHIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state agency that investigates political corruption says it will not deal 
with the Los Angeles agency that investigates political corruption. What it 
comes down to is that the state Fair Political Practices Commission doesn't 
like the way the Los Angeles Ethics Commission's executive director does his 
job.The state insists it will not work with the city commission as long as that 
body is led by Benjamin Bycel. 
</P>
<P>
 Hold on. The last time we checked, the state Fair Political Practices 
Commission was still a public agency. It can't refuse to deal with a local 
ethics commission just because, goodness gracious, somebody rubs somebody the 
wrong way.  
</P>
<P>
 Bycel is indeed a hard-charging lawyer who did not take the job at the Ethics 
Commission to make friends, either in Los Angeles or Sacramento. City powers 
made sure he and the commission got a warm welcome by placing their offices not 
in a convenient City Hall location but in the underground L.A. Mall. 
</P>
<P>
 The understaffed Ethics Commission doggedly worked with the FPPC to secure a 
record fine -- $895,000 -- after the Ethics Commission uncovered a 
money-laundering scheme that touched several big names in City Hall. Results. 
That's what the city Ethics Commission has been fighting for, against 
tremendous odds. Frankly, the long-established FPPC could learn a thing or two 
about aggressive investigations from the local commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The FPPC and the Ethics Commission must work cooperatively on behalf of their 
employer, the public. As for the petty personal asides, get over it.

DWP'S TERRIBLE CASE OF MONO; MAYOR RIORDAN WORKS TO BRING CITY WATER POLICIES 
INTO THE MODERN AGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The train known as the Mono Lake issue has been roaring down the tracks toward 
Los Angeles for 16 years. Yet the Department of Water and Power just stood 
there. Now, predictably, it has been run over. 
</P>
<P>
 In a move with profound implications for Los Angeles' future, the state Water 
Resources Control Board has offered a proposal to restore the ecologically 
devastated Sierra lake 340 miles to the north that supplied about 15% of the 
city's water, for half a century, until a state court halted diversions five 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, if approved by the board Wednesday as expected, will mean Los 
Angeles would lose all Mono Lake water for 20 years or more, until the lake 
rises enough to restore its unique ecological balance. Los Angeles ratepayers 
would also have to spend millions to repair damaged trout streams in the Mono 
basin. 
</P>
<P>
 This result has been obvious for years. Yet the DWP, haunted by the ghost of 
William Mulholland, refused to see that times had changed. The DWP litigated, 
and lost, at every step, refusing compromises that were much better than the 
solution the state is about to impose. And it passed up good opportunities to 
obtain alternative water sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan quickly saw the madness of all this when he took office 
last year. Along with Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, he pressured the DWP to 
negotiate with the Mono Lake Committee to use a special state fund to find 
replacement water. The only trouble was that the fund had dwindled from $60 
million to $36 million by the time agreement was reached last December. Still, 
four excellent projects to reclaim treated waste water are being mounted. 
</P>
<P>
 While arguing that the state plan goes too far, the DWP has sensibly decided 
not to fight the proposed lake level. However, it will dispute the costly 
stream-restoration plans as overkill. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor is basically right. It is time to give up the Mono Lake battle, to 
move on and try to replace the lost water with reclaimed water and through 
conservation. The Metropolitan Water District says it can make up for much of 
the loss. But the possibility of more drought, federal and state requirements 
to increase fresh-water flows to repair environmental damage in the Sacramento 
Delta and other uncertainties mean the city should not lean too heavily on this 
old, reliable source, the MWD. 
</P>
<P>
 As ever, water is the future of arid Southern California. But what is needed 
at the DWP is not just more water, but more vision, leadership and courage.

THE BASEBALL SEASON ENDS EARLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re "Baseball Season, Series Canceled," Sept. 15: 
</P>
<P>
 When I was 11 years old, I skipped school one autumn afternoon. I ran to my 
grandmother's house to watch the most awful thing happen. After 8 1/2 exquisite 
nerve-racking innings, Bill Mazeroski of the Pirates hit a home run in the 
bottom of the ninth of the seventh game of the World Series to beat my beloved 
Yankees. I cried for days. 
</P>
<P>
 Back then, I thought people owned cars. Houses. Department stores. I didn't 
know people owned baseball. I thought baseball belonged to all of us. Like the 
streets. And the airways. The air itself. 
</P>
<P>
 You couldn't cancel the baseball season any more than you could cancel the 
sunrise tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball has destroyed itself. And in doing so, has answered the age-old 
question: Was it a game or a business? The answer, at last, is: No. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball was a treasure. Now plundered by pirates of a different sort. Come 
October, my own 11-year-old son will truly watch the most awful thing happen. 
No World Series at all.

 * Baseball strike? Much ado about nothing if you ask me! 
</P>
<P>
 However, as with any venture, significant problems will arise whenever an 
individual's desire (or demand in this case) for personal compensation begins 
to interfere with his desire to be of service to his clientele. This goes for 
players and owners alike. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides are at fault for not being absolutely sincere and honest with each 
other from the start. This is what happens when things like faith and trust 
begin to lose their importance when setting up agreements. The rest of this 
problem can be attributed to egos, selfishness and greed. 
</P>
<P>
 These issues are nothing new to man, however, and the baseball strike is not 
so much a focal point for an argument as it is a reminder to people of how bad 
we can let things get before someone feels compelled to dump a bucket of cold 
water on our heads to snap us out of our childish temper tantrums.

BUS VS. RAIL SPENDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re James E. Moore's commentary, "Shift the Spending to Buses," Sept. 7: 
</P>
<P>
 Moore suggests that the MTA should allocate Proposition A and C money to 
subsidize bus routes, rather than use the money for where it was intended -- 
rail-transit systems. To Moore, the socially correct policy is to use the funds 
to keep bus fares down for the poor people of Los Angeles. While I certainly 
agree that helping the poor is noble and worthwhile, I humbly suggest, however, 
that the intent of the voting public in taxing themselves was to build rail 
lines, not to subsidize bus fares. 
</P>
<P>
 I personally voted for both propositions with the understanding that rail 
lines would get people out of their cars and onto trains, thereby reducing both 
smog and congestion. It seems reasonable to conclude that the propositions 
passed because the citizens of Los Angeles County want rail transit so as to 
improve the quality of life in the L.A. basin. I am quite sure that the 
taxpayers would not have agreed to pay higher taxes in order to subsidize bus 
fares.  
</P>
<P>
 Moore uses his faulty premise that good social policy dictates use of 
Proposition A and C funds to subsidize bus fares to laud the recent decision of 
U.S. District Judge Terry Hatter in imposing a stay on MTA rate hikes. 
Assuredly, the learned Judge Hatter had good reason for making his decision. 
Nevertheless, Moore's suggestion that the MTA use public funds for an 
unintended use is clearly erroneous.

<P>
 Inserting the race issue into transit financing is unnecessary and inaccurate. 
There is no credible evidence that discrimination figures into the decisions of 
the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA and its board are strongly committed to providing improved transit to 
all of Los Angeles County. Lower-income areas and minority residents have been 
especially well-served when it comes to transit innovations and additions. The 
Long Beach Blue Line, the county's first modern rail line, serves many minority 
and low-income areas and draws a two-thirds minority ridership. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA has designated its two inner-city bus divisions to receive the fleet's 
newest buses in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 The plaintiffs' argument that money from rail projects could be transferred to 
buses is inaccurate. The proposal to transfer $50 million from the Pasadena 
Blue Line to bus operations is illegal. The only possible Pasadena Blue Line 
money that could be transferred to bus operations is approximately $5 million, 
available only in the unlikely event that the MTA defaults in its bond 
obligations. 
</P>
<P>
 The portion of the lawsuit calling for a return of the monthly passes will 
cause more of a burden on the poor. According to figures provided by the MTA, 
only 18% of its riders use regularly monthly passes, with over 40% of those 
having annual household incomes over $50,000. This meant that the monthly pass 
holders were being subsidized by poorer riders, who were forced to pay cash 
fares each day. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, a token system, with tokens costing 90 cents, 20 cents lower than the 
previous basic fare, was implemented, giving a cost break to the frequent 
rider. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Hatter's decision not to resolve this case until Oct. 17 will cost the 
MTA $4 million. This will end up hurting the people the plaintiffs claim they 
are trying to help because cuts throughout the system will have to be made to 
balance the budget.

 * Re "Law on Disrupting Worship Draws Fire," Sept. 15: 
</P>
<P>
 As the moderator and founder of the Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan 
Community Churches, the largest organization touching gays and lesbians in the 
world, I read with interest the article concerning the new law that doubles the 
penalty for disrupting a church service. I am a gay Christian who is delighted 
with the action of our Legislature.  
</P>
<P>
 I'm just at a loss as to why the Rev. Lou Sheldon of the Traditional Values 
Coalition claims this will "level the playing field," as though fundamental 
Christian churches have been the only groups targeted by protesters in 
California. As the head of a Christian denomination that has had 18 of its 
churches arsoned in the last 26 years, I'm delighted with this law. 
</P>
<P>
 For two years the local Metropolitan Community Church in San Diego was 
picketed every Sunday morning by screaming demonstrators from an independent 
Baptist church. It only stopped when a member of that church was arrested by 
the FBI for setting a bomb in the basement of an abortion clinic in San Diego 
and when the pastor of the group was arrested for trying to tamper with a 
witness in that case. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopefully, this law will stop the Rev. Fred Phelps of Topeka, Kan., when he 
flies into California to disrupt the funeral worship services of AIDS patients 
as he did this year at the funeral service of Randy Shilts, the author of "And 
the Band Played On," a history of the AIDS epidemic in America. 
</P>
<P>
 Any time any group, whether it is the Aryan Nation (who set our church on fire 
in Springfield, Mo., the same day as it burned down the Jewish Community 
Center), or misguided gay demonstrators (trying to break up a worship service 
where someone who we perceive as our enemy is speaking), or fundamental 
Christians (trying to disrupt the worship service of a predominantly gay 
congregation), it is wrong! 
</P>
<P>
 Hopefully, all of us remember what happens when anyone disregards the parts of 
our Constitution that give all of us the right to worship God and to believe 
what we may under our freedom of religion laws, as well as the right of every 
citizen, whether it is Sheldon or myself, to use the right to free speech to 
declare what we believe is the truth.

 'S Wonderful: After numerous delays, "The Glory of Gershwin," a CD collection 
of George Gershwin songs covered by contemporary pop and rock performers, will 
finally be available in stores Tuesday from Mercury Records. Jon Bon Jovi, 
Elton John, Sting, Oleta Adams, Cher, Kate Bush, Elvis Costello, Peter Gabriel, 
Sinead O'Connor, Meat Loaf and Robert Palmer are among those who recorded songs 
in London's Air Studios, accompanied by a full orchestra and Larry Adler on 
harmonica. The album is the inspiration of Adler, a renowned harmonica player 
who wanted to celebrate his 80th birthday by paying tribute to his late friend, 
Gerswhin, with an album of his best songs. MOVIES

 'Speed' Writer Scores: Ending an intense bidding war among rival studios, 
Columbia Pictures has paid $1.5 million for the screenplay "Afterlife," a 
suspense thriller about a scientist whose brain is grafted into the body of a 
younger man by the government so that he can carry on his important DNA 
research -- only to find the body belonged to a serial killer. The script was 
written by Joss Whedon, who has become a hot property in Hollywood since doing 
the celebrated rewrite on "Speed." Whedon's agent, Chris Harbert of United 
Talent Agency, said there were nine bids in the $1-million range for 
"Afterlife," including bids from Sony's two studios, Columbia and TriStar. 
Rather than have his studios submit competing bids, Sony's Mark Canton ordered 
TriStar to halt its offer, sources said. The film will be produced by Denise 
Denovi with Ned Tanen as executive producer. No stars or director are yet 
attached. TELEVISION

 Prime-Time Trial?: O.J. Simpson's series pilot "Frogmen" was sunk by NBC, but 
the trial of the former football great may inspire an ABC series from "NYPD 
Blue" creator Steven Bochco. Tentatively titled "Murder One," the courtroom 
drama would follow a fictitious trial from beginning to end over the course of 
an entire season, reports Mediaweek in its current issue. Bochco, who 
co-created "L.A. Law," cited the public's fascination with law and its 
intricacies -- as evidenced in the Simpson and Menendez brothers televised 
cases -- as his motivation. "So for the first time we can roll the dice 
creatively. We (can) take on the case and really run," he said. Most of the 
season would be concerned with pretrial events, and the actual trial would 
occur only during the last quarter of the season. ABC declined comment on the 
new show, being developed for next fall.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; LUIS MIGUEL DISPLAYS HIS MUSICAL RANGE AT UNIVERSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEILA COBO-HANLON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Talk about a Luis of all trades. Pop, Spanish ballads, rap, mariachi, funk, 
R&B, boleros -- Luis Miguel did it all Thursday, the first of four nights at 
the Universal Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of his phenomenally successful new album of boleros, "Segundo 
Romance" (an unprecedented 730,000 copies sold in the U.S. since its Aug. 30 
debut), the Mexican pop star switched deftly and convincingly between styles in 
concert. 
</P>
<P>
 Accompanied by a dynamic 13-piece band, Luis Miguel (he always uses his two 
first names) demonstrated why he's clearly a step ahead of others in the same 
arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The former teen idol sauntered on stage clad in a gray suit and tie, 
reminiscent of a 1950s balladeer. But instead of launching the program with any 
of his trademark bolero s (most of them decades-old love songs befitting his 
garb), Luis Miguel started by alternating between straight-ahead contemporary 
ballads and his now signature funk and R&B-laced pop tunes. And while the 
24-year-old cuts a dashing figure, his strength lies in his voice.  
</P>
<P>
 Luis Miguel utilized expected embellishments, including a 24-piece string 
orchestra that rose from the back of the stage to accompany a rendition of 
famed Mexican composer Armando Manzanero's "No se tu." But there were still 
surprises left: In the second half, the singer -- now dressed in black -- sang 
the classic "El Dia que me Quieras," accompanied by a bandoneon player -- new 
territory for the star. 
</P>
<P>
 And the house truly came down when he sang a set of beloved rancheras with 
L.A.'s Mariachi Los Camperos de Nati Cano, and finally capped the evening with 
a bilingual version of "Blame It on the Boogie." 
</P>
<P>
 Best of all, the over-50 crowd was having as much fun as the mostly young 
adult fans. For Mexico's other romantic idol, Juan Gabriel, coming to the 
Universal in October, this is going to be one tough act to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 * Luis Miguel performs tonight and Sunday at the Universal Amphitheatre, 100 
Universal City Plaza, Universal City, 8:15 p.m. $52.50-$40. (818) 980-9421.

MC MICKEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was saddened and disgusted to see that the Walt Disney Co. has dropped its 
standard of decency and good taste.Having our beloved Disney characters emulate 
the national tragedy of juvenile gangsterism is not cute ("Ready for MC 
Mickey?," Sept. 15). The incredible insensitivity of showing Mickey Mouse 
"dressed down" in gang clothing is appalling. Children have been murdered by 
gunfire in our city simply because they were unknowingly dressed in the manner 
of a local gang. 
</P>
<P>
 If Walter could see his beloved Mickey flashing gang signs with underwear 
deliberately showing, he would fire the entire Disney Records division.

'THE CRIMSON THREAD'

<P>
 I was astounded to read Laurie Winer's disparaging review of "The Crimson 
Thread" (" 'Crimson Thread' a Familiar Family Tale," Sept. 20). After seeing 
the play and the enormous impact it had on the audience (who gave it a standing 
ovation), I can only surmise that Winer is drastically out of touch with the 
theatergoing public.

SOMETHING'S MISSING AT EMMY AWARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 America's longstanding contempt for African American humanity was candidly 
reflected on the 46th annual nighttime Emmy Awards. As I tuned in to the sea of 
white faces, I was reminded of the sad fact that the Rainbow Coalition is not 
"alive and well" in television land. 
</P>
<P>
 In the middle of the program a montage of the year was shown. It had such an 
insidious racist overtone that I was shocked. Dozens of clips from white shows 
were represented to celebrate the diversity of white America -- from the 
intellectual wit of "Frasier" and "Seinfeld," to the poignant home life of 
"Roseanne," to the grit-and-grime drama of "NYPD Blue," to several other 
examples that portrayed whites as having a multifaceted existence. 
</P>
<P>
 There were only three black images shown during this montage, unless I missed 
one or two when I closed my eyes in shame, as my heart sank from rage and 
embarrassment at the demeaning stereotypes I saw depicted. The three black 
images that the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences saw fit to show were 
Sinbad with his butt to the camera doing a version of the "hoochie-coochie," 
Martin Lawrence doing a "coon shuffle" in his underwear and -- the most 
insidious of the three -- a clip from a "reality-based" cop show where a black 
man was pinned to the ground by two white, uniformed officers as the black man 
strained his neck to almost bite off one officer's hand like a deranged, mangy, 
rabid dog. 
</P>
<P>
 African Americans have been vehemently maligned and stereotyped for centuries. 
When will it ever stop? Did the academy choose these clips with good intentions 
? 
</P>
<P>
 As Shakespeare says in "Hamlet" (Act III, Scene 2), ". . . The purpose of 
playing (acting) . . . is to hold . . . the mirror up to nature; . . . O, there 
be players that I have seen play . . . have so strutted and bellowed . . . they 
imitated humanity so abominably." 
</P>
<P>
 The "mirror" that the Emmy Awards held up to the contribution of African 
Americans for this last year on television suggested a "nature" so abominable, 
with no humanity, and helped to reinforce these distorted stereotypes firmly in 
the minds of millions of Americans, as well as those watching around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Those whites who are constantly being fed a diet of subtle and overt racism 
from every facet of the media and those blacks who live with these vile images 
daily cannot continue to sit passively as this flagrant racist behavior is 
practiced on such a grand scale.

LATINOS AND PRIME TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thank you for your article on the declining and often negative portrayal of 
Latinos in prime-time television ("Study No Surprise to Latinos," Sept. 8). It 
has often puzzled me how 23 million Latino Americans, many of them doctors, 
lawyers, teachers, legislators and artists, could continue to remain ignored on 
prime-time television.Even worse, Latinos are continually portrayed as 
criminals or in menial labor positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Latinos will be the largest minority group in the United States by the year 
2000, and yet we are barely a blip on the landscape that is prime-time 
television. Even from an economic point of view, it does not make sense to 
ignore the Latino market. 
</P>
<P>
 It is truly sad that we must look as far back as "Chico and the Man" for an 
example of an outstanding Latino program. Network programmers in charge of 
development must be made aware of the talent that exists within our community. 
Only when we become involved in the creation of programming will we be able to 
change the face of prime time.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; JOHNNY CASH AT CERRITOS: RIVETING 'RECORDINGS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Think of Johnny Cash's concert Thursday as a feature presentation with a 
preview of coming attractions.  
</P>
<P>
 It was two hours' worth of the Man in Black's business-almost-as-usual show 
with wife June Carter and the Carter Family at the Cerritos Center for the 
Performing Arts, the first of two nights at the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is Cash's new solo album, "American Recordings," that has given his 
career its biggest artistic and sales boost in a decade or more. The 
combination made for an unusually diverse audience, with young and old, too-hip 
and couldn't-care-less, sitting side by side. 
</P>
<P>
 It also spiced up what is a strong country show to begin with. The major 
difference between Thursday's performance and the ones Cash and the Carter clan 
have been doing for years is that he included six songs from the new album. 
They were performed as he recorded them: just his own acoustic guitar 
supporting that towering oak tree of a bass voice. 
</P>
<P>
 The new songs, about sinners, inner demons and the quest for redemption, 
proved as riveting in concert as on record. Some tension, however, was 
dissipated by the revolving stage in the Cerritos Center's in-the-round 
configuration, which made Cash a moving visual target rather than the fixed 
center of attention.  
</P>
<P>
 Cash is expected to add a December or January date in Los Angeles to a brief 
solo tour devoted to the "American Recordings" material. 
</P>
<P>
 The remainder of the 34-song show consisted of the signature numbers that have 
won him a place in both the Country Music and Rock and Roll Halls of Fame, 
several duets with June and a gospel finale with the full entourage. RANDY

DANCE REVIEW; SHADES OVERSHADOW STARS IN 'BAYADERE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER FISHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is often said of the Kingdom of the Shades scene in "La Bayadere" that the 
corps de ballet is the real star, with each dancer etching crystalline shapes 
that mesmerize when multiplied. 
</P>
<P>
 The geometric precision of white veiled arms and slowly extended legs creates 
the icy melancholy of a poetic "beyond" in which separated lovers meet again. 
Nevertheless, it's the soloists who continue to be featured in prominent type 
on the program and to be paid more for dancing in front. That's how it works. 
</P>
<P>
 And there's no doubt American Ballet Theatre has worthy principal dancers. But 
the corps was where to put your money on Thursday night, as the second evening 
of a mixed program unfolded at Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cruel World" and "In the Upper Room" (reviewed Friday) were again preceded by 
the "Bayadere" excerpt, this time featuring Cynthia Harvey and Guillaume 
Graffin as the doomed lovers Nikiya and Solor. 
</P>
<P>
 Technically, Harvey and Guillaume were strong with only a few tangles with 
gravity: she, trying to launch some tricky releve turns; he trying to land a 
series of double tours. Recovery was swift, and Guillaume's airy leaps and 
balanced turns were matched in energy and elan by Harvey's measured extensions 
and perfectly poised pirouettes. 
</P>
<P>
 However, where perfect poise suits the unison work of the corps, the doomed 
lovers need more deeply felt passion, notoriously difficult to develop in short 
bursts on mixed programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, without earlier scenes to establish character, Harvey and Guillaume 
became preoccupied with the pristine layer of containment required for 
19th-Century balletic passion. What was missing was the requisite restraint 
that trembles with inchoate emotions. 
</P>
<P>
 The first Shadow variation was crisply danced by Ashley Tuttle, the second 
given sweeping dimensions by Shawn Black. With enviable balance, a keenly 
focused gaze and sparkling runs on pointe, Veronica Lynn made the third Shadow 
the most substantial of the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 That is, if you're not counting the corps, the "stars" who also stand and 
wait. During the curtain call, as is traditional with "Bayadere," the corps 
received shouts and applause at a level normally reserved for principals.

WEEKEND TV; TOO MANY BUCHANANS SPOIL SITCOM BROTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Five Mrs. Buchanans" may be one Mrs. Buchanan too many. 
</P>
<P>
 Set in an Indianapolis suburb, the new CBS comedy series is an unlikely 
gathering of wives: four of them married to Buchanan brothers, the fifth their 
miserable, meddling wretch of a mother-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
 The young Mr. Buchanans are invisible on the premiere, and one appears briefly 
in Episode 2. Their main role is as joke fodder for the young Mrs. Buchanans: 
Alex (Judith Ivey), an earthy, wisecracking former New Yorker; Delilah (Beth 
Broderick), a loopy ex-waitress who favors skimpy body dresses; snooty, snotty, 
snide Vivian (Harriet Sansom Harris), and naive newlywed Bree (Charlotte Ross), 
a former Disneyland worker who shows off by doing the splits. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Alex and Delilah run a thrift store together, the sisters-in-law seem 
to have little in common beyond their acute dislike of Mother Buchanan (Eileen 
Heckart). 
</P>
<P>
 And what's not to dislike? She's insulting, overcritical, manipulative, 
nagging, selfish and generally loathsome -- so gratingly unpleasant, in fact, 
that spending even part of a half-hour with her gets to be a drag. When she 
surfaces on the premiere, it's an iceberg ripping into the hull. The show 
immediately sinks, as does the second episode when she comes around to cause 
trouble for Bree and her wimpy husband. 
</P>
<P>
 Mother Buchanan would be tolerable if the writers could at least turn her 
endless droning into humor. They don't. Or if Heckart were in some way able to 
rise above the gimmickry of her cartoonish character. She isn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that most of the other Mrs. Buchanans are any bargain either. Three are 
vastly overdrawn. Only the appealing Ivey's Alex stands apart from this ghetto 
of caricatures, furnishing the first two shows with their only glints of wit 
and intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Five Mrs. Buchanans" premieres at 9 tonight on CBS (Channels 2 and 8).

WEEKEND TV; AUTISTIC BOY'S SKILL FINGERS THE KILLERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 9-year-old autistic boy's startling ability to draw exact likenesses of 
everything he sees puts him in jeopardy after he witnesses a brutal killing in 
the TV movie "The Innocent." 
</P>
<P>
 In a smart detour from his Emmy-winning role in "Frasier," Kelsey Grammer 
stars as the detective who, against all odds, encourages the little boy to 
revisit the crime scene and draw the face of the killers.His relationship with 
the boy (Keegan Macintosh) lifts the cop's character, who's coping with the 
loss of his own son, from the walking dead. 
</P>
<P>
 But what sparks the plot is not sentimentality but writer/co-producer David 
Venable's pitched series of chase scenes between the mad-dog killers (starkly 
etched by Jeff Kober and Gary Werntz) and the silent witness who can finger 
them. It's implausible yet still manages to tease our sense of 
fantasy/suspense. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the protective custody of Grammer and the boy's devoted social worker 
(the earthy Polly Draper), the youngster gradually emerges from his private 
hell. The young Macintosh is up to the challenge and his autism is evenly 
dramatized -- without being exploited -- under director Mimi Leder. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Innocent" airs at 9 p.m. Sunday on NBC (Channels 4, 36 and 39). RAY

WEEKEND TV; NO SIGN OF ALDA IN THIS 'HAWKEYE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No, Alan Alda isn't back. The syndicated series "Hawkeye," inspired by James 
Fenimore Cooper's "Leatherstocking Tales," takes place in the Hudson River 
Valley in 1755 and centers on the adventures of a rugged frontier hero with a 
preternatural knack for showing up at the right place at the right time. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkeye (Lee Horsley) appears, deus ex machina style, whenever an innocent 
colonist is in danger of a tomahawk from the nastier warring natives or, worse, 
a snit fit from corrupt British officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-part series opener, shown in consecutive hours tonight, introduces a 
Virginia merchant couple on their way to the frontier to set up business. The 
husband (Michael Berry) is a major-league twit, but his wife (Lynda Carter), 
well, his wife. . . . Cooper may never have written specifically of heaving 
bosoms, but the sight of Wonder Woman in the 18th-Century equivalent of a 
Wonderbra does wonders for this series' circulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Said twit merchant is quickly drawn into Native American danger by his evil 
brother (Garwin Sanford), a British officer with all sorts of terrible designs. 
The lovely wife ineptly sets out to rescue her hapless husband from the French 
fort where he's being held, and she must be rescued herself by Hawkeye. This 
star-crossed couple exchange tempestuous glances and heavings, but the 
two-parter closes with her thoughts that this is a love that can never be. At 
least not for a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The grown-ups among us may fret over the uneven casting and uneven 
performances, but kids who are experiencing the first of their Mohicans will 
enjoy this with fewer fettering preconceptions. And there is a good amount of 
action here for them -- of an old-fashioned sort hard to find this side of 
reruns. As a modern lad's introduction to bows, arrows and corsets, it might 
suffice. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Hawkeye" premieres at 8 tonight and thereafter will be seen Saturdays at 10 
p.m. on KCOP-TV Channel 13.

WEEKEND TV; COCAINE CARTEL CAN'T HIDE FROM CNN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Colombian cocaine cartel may have gone global, but CNN long ago mastered 
another worldwide racket -- international news. The cartel might run, but it 
can't hide from CNN snoops Peter Arnett and Brian Barger in "The Kingdom of 
Cocaine." 
</P>
<P>
 But because all of CNN's lengthier reports ("Kingdom" clocks in at 90 minutes) 
are designed in short segments that may be slotted into the network's daily 
news schedule, the narrative flow of a complex story is dammed up, rendered 
choppy and almost incoherent. And the complexity of the drug cartel story is 
especially impeded by this seemingly inflexible approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Adopting a garish approach right out of "True Stories of the Highway Patrol," 
the early segments reported by Barger serve up a bloody but manic account of 
the rise and fall of Pablo Escobar, Colombia's first drug lord. Moderately 
exciting and fairly pointless, the Escobar affair is quite unrelated to the 
current, infinitely more sophisticated and corporatized cocaine cartel based in 
Cali, Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is the real coke kingdom, now richer than such U.S. companies as Texaco 
and in control of 80% of the world market. Run largely by two brothers who 
parlayed a corner drug store into a big chain operation before branching into 
illegal substances, the cartel dominates Cali and the nation through bribery 
and influence peddling rather than Mafia-like force. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez own soccer teams, shopping malls and phone 
companies, and pump so much cash into the Colombian economy (1993 profits 
reportedly topped $2 billion) that they seem to be untouchable. Certainly, 
Barger and Arnett show, they easily avoid arrest, and have developed incredibly 
intricate means of shipping drugs to the vast U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
 The report sloppily includes an admission from U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency 
official Thomas Clifford -- who says, "There's no way we can win," then adds 
lamely and nonsensically, "There's no way we can give up" -- that deserves a 
whole report unto itself. That, and the Reagan Administration drug-war official 
Michael Abbell, caught on camera, who is now the Rodriguezes' attorney in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 So much for just saying no. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Kingdom of Cocaine" airs at 6 p.m. and again at 9 p.m. Sunday on CNN.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; GETTING ON WITH IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The devastating fires in Laguna Beach continue to heap misfortune on some 
victims nearly a year after blazes swept the canyons. City officials should 
take better care not to compound the woes of those displaced by the flames. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna is a small city with a bureaucracy that was overwhelmed after the 
fires. Officials did a good job in helping those in need. They were forced to 
settle disputes over reseeding of hillsides, making new dwellings more 
fire-resistant and helping homeowners rebuild as quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 From the start, the city said it would try to cut red tape to speed 
rebuilding, but there were some unavoidable delays in the fire-damaged 
neighborhood of Mystic Hills when fears arose that an old landslide could pose 
a hazard as new homes went up. 
</P>
<P>
 The experiences of two couples burned out of their homes on Buena Vista Way 
demonstrated the roadblocks bureaucracy can create. 
</P>
<P>
 Both couples learned they were ineligible for special processing and waivers 
of fees because they decided to rebuild elsewhere in Laguna, rather than where 
their homes had burned. One couple spent months waiting for their plans for a 
new house to finish the design review process. They said their plans sat for 
too long on a zoning official's desk. 
</P>
<P>
 The city manager now has said the city will try to accelerate the permit 
process for all fire victims, even those building outside their former 
neighborhoods. That is sensible. Those who lost homes they loved should be 
helped in getting on with their lives. They should not be penalized.

LASORDA PACT IS EXTENDED BY DODGERS; BASEBALL: MANAGER, 67, IS TOLD BY CLAIRE 
THAT THE TEAM'S EMPHASIS NEXT SEASON WILL BE ON YOUNG PLAYERS. 4 LINES. 4 
LINES. 4 LINES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Tom Lasorda says he still has the desire and ability to do the job, and Dodger 
owner Peter O'Malley honored that on Friday when he asked Lasorda to return 
next season as manager. It will be Lasorda's 19th year as the Dodger manager 
and 46th with the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they didn't want me back, I would have walked out of Peter's office and 
thanked him for for all the wonderful things he and the Dodgers have done for 
me," said Lasorda, whose contract was renewed for one season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, I felt I wanted to manage again. I felt I could still do the job. If I 
didn't think that I could do for them exactly what they wanted me to do, I 
wouldn't have accepted it. If I thought I was hurting this club as the field 
leader, I would not be here. But I know one thing, I know I can still do the 
job for them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers had a 58-56 record when the owners ended the season but had been 
in first place for 87 days in the National League's West Division. They 
appeared headed for their first playoff berth since 1988, when Lasorda's team 
won the World Series.  
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people didn't give us any chance at all and said the (San Francisco) 
Giants were a shoo-in," Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I believe this as much as I am breathing, that we could walk out with any 
team in the major leagues and beat them. There wasn't any doubt in my mind we 
would be No. 1." 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda usually has managed on one-year contracts, and speculation began, as 
it has in recent years, that the 1994 season might be his last. The Dodgers had 
struggled through the 1992 season and achieved only average records the next 
two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 But O'Malley said before this season began that he did not blame Lasorda for 
the decline, instead pointing to player injuries and an interruption of talent 
in the minor leagues.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, the Dodgers say their flow of talent has resumed. And that, in part, was 
the subject of a meeting Lasorda had Friday morning with Fred Claire, Dodger 
executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 "The primary thrust (of our conversation) is the direction we are taking as 
far as the young players," Claire said. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I am confident that Tommy can do a job and continue to do the job and is 
enthusiastic in leading the team with the knowledge that we will have a heavy 
emphasis on youth. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has had the opportunity (during the strike) to see the young players and I 
feel confident that we have the players who can come up here and do the job for 
us, just as they have in recent years." 
</P>
<P>
 Claire said that he and Lasorda are still discussing the coaching staff. 
Decisions are expected next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda, who turned 67 on Thursday, has a record of 1,480-1,338, tying him for 
15th in victories with Earl Weaver. He has two World Series championships, four 
National League pennants and six Western Division titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda's salary is believed to be between $800,000 and $1 million, but he 
said that money was not discussed in his meeting with O'Malley.  
</P>
<P>
 "When I got this job, I told them I would pay them to do it," Lasorda said.

MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: FIND THE GOOD GUYS IN THE BASEBALL WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Will I miss the World Series? Absolutely. Will I miss Barry Bonds & Co. with 
their gleaming diamond earrings, standing at home plate to admire their 
greatness? Never. 
</P>
<P>
 My only hope is that due to bad investments, a prolonged layoff and the 
dissolution of the players' union, we see these guys in a few months on QVC, 
hawking those earrings for grocery money. Until then, I'll be watching players 
that still play for the competition and the love of the game -- Little League.

Of course, then we had only Hitler, Tojo and Mussolini to deal with. Now we

 In this age of spin doctors, when it's usually impossible to distinguish the 
villains from the heroes, I hope at least one absolute truth comes out of this 
lost baseball season -- the villains are Bud Selig, Dick Ravitch and Jerry 
Reinsdorf. As Donald Fehr pointed out, "They have been looking forward to and 
planning this day for a long time." The three of them should be deported to any 
country that will take them -- and their filthy money.

 Bud Selig says that we need to solve baseball's "grave economic problems." 
What problems? According to the L.A. Times, the owners would have received $580 
million in revenue, while the players would have received $230 million in 
salaries, for the games lost due to the strike. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm no accountant, but that leaves the owners with $350 million to pay all 
other expenses, which is quite a chunk of dough, considering most teams have 
low or no-rent stadium deals, free advertising through TV and newspaper 
coverage, and cities around the country tripping over each other trying to get 
a team. 
</P>
<P>
 If an owner can't make a profit with a gold mine like a major league baseball 
club, he (or she) is an idiot.

I'LL TAKE THE REAL THING EASILY OVER QUAINT SERIES

<TEXT>

 KCET may shed no tears, but based on the previews and the cancellation of the 
rest of the '94 season, I'm boycotting Ken Burns' baseball documentary series. 
The funereal narration and general tone, plinky-plunk single note banjo 
renditions of "Take Me Out to the Ballgame," and utter lack of the muscular 
rush and thrill of baseball add up to fan depression. 
</P>
<P>
 In 100 years there will be some fake little artifact, probably owned by 
Disney, that they'll tell us is our great national pastime -- baggy uniforms, 
handlebar mustaches and big wind-ups. 
</P>
<P>
 My fiance and I met at Dodger Stadium, and we marry Oct. 22. Neither of us 
buys the Ken Burns notion of baseball as a quaint anachronism, and we'll be in 
the top deck the next time Piazza homers, screaming at the top of our lungs. 
That's baseball. Wait'll next season -- hope there is one.

CAN'T YOU GUYS EVER RIP RAIDER COACHES? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the Raiders were beaten by San Francisco and Seattle, The Times' 
sportswriters placed the entire responsibility on the players. Never will any 
of your writers criticize the coaching staff.Not once last year did reporters 
for Raider games place any responsibility on Art Shell and his coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason is clear: Your writers fear what Raider management will do to their 
player access. The Raiders have made it clear, they will tolerate criticism of 
players, but never the coaches, and Times writers adhere to this policy. How 
can we know that you are our trusted agents at the battle front who won't 
automatically place the responsibility for a loss on the soldiers rather than 
on the generals?

MORNING BRIEFING: PERHAPS HE SHOULD HAVE GONE TO AN ARENA FOOTBALL GAME

 After watching the first five hours of "Baseball" on public television, Tony 
Kornheiser of the Washington Post writes: 
</P>
<P>
 "The documentary is as slow as the game it documents. I'm told it picks up 
after the first eight hours. But so did the Hundred Years War, and I wouldn't 
have stuck around to see that either. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's see, 'The Civil War' lasted 12 hours, and this goes 18. I can't wait 
for (Ken) Burns' next big score: 25 hours on 'Household Pets.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, Kornheiser has a short attention span.

 Wishful thinking? With an unexpected 0-3 record, Arizona Cardinal Coach Buddy 
Ryan can be forgiven, perhaps, for being confused. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you're going to see a different Eagle offense next week. I hope you 
do," Ryan said recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he meant the Cardinals, Ryan, a former Philadelphia Eagle coach, 
said, "I mean Cardinals. Get the right place, whatever it is."

 War of words: Stanford Coach Bill Walsh reportedly took some cheap shots at 
Arizona in his book, "Rough Magic." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Cardinal defensive end Pete Swanson is accusing Arizona of taking cheap 
shots in last year's game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate them," he said. "I thought their offensive line was cheap. Under the 
pile, they're grabbing your throat, punching your ribs." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Add book: Greg Hansen of the Arizona Daily Star writes that Walsh has provided 
added incentive for the Wildcats for their game against the Cardinal today. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Rough Magic," he referred to Arizona as a "mercenary program," and 
speaking of the players, said that one needed to "hose them off" before playing 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona Coach Dick Tomey said he hasn't read the book and doesn't intend to. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh claims he wasn't serious when he made those remarks.

VOLKOV STUNS STICH ON FAST COURT, RUSSIANS TAKE SURPRISING 2-0 LEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Russia moved to the brink of its first Davis Cup final ever here Friday, when 
Alexander Volkov beat Michael Stich to complete a sweep of the two opening 
singles matches against the defending champion German team. 
</P>
<P>
 Stich, playing under a death threat on the same court where Monica Seles was 
stabbed last year, was upset by Volkov, 7-5, 1-6, 7-6 (7-5), 6-4.In the opening 
match, Yevgeny Kafelnikov beat Bernd Karbacher, 7-6 (7-2), 6-1, 2-6, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia can reach the final for the first time since it joined the competition 
in 1962 by winning the doubles today or one of two singles Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Volkov beat Stich, recent U.S. Open runner-up, on a hard court especially put 
down for the German, who is ranked No. 2 in the world. Afterward, Stich said he 
might skip the doubles, apparently because of a death threat called in against 
him late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Germany, three-time Davis Cup champion, last rallied from a 2-0 deficit in 
1960, against Czechoslovakia. The Germans have not been beaten at home since 
losing, 3-2, to Sweden in the 1985 final. 
</P>
<P>
 The hard court replaced the usual clay surface at the Rothenbaum club and was 
put in to help Stich's serve-and-volley fast-court game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't concentrating, I was not at all on the court," Stich said. "I didn't 
react, I moved badly. But this is no excuse." 
</P>
<P>
 Stich also complained that the home crowd failed to inspire his team.

FORMER CHAMPION JERRY BARBER DIES OF HEART FAILURE; GOLF: DURABLE 78-YEAR-OLD 
WON THE 1961 PGA TITLE AS ONE OF THE GAME'S FINEST PUTTERS EVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jerry Barber, the 1961 PGA champion who also served as the pro at Griffith 
Park Golf Club for 28 years, died Friday of heart failure. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
 Barber's son, Tom, currently listed as co-pro at Griffith Park with Jerry, 
said his father entered Verdugo Hills Hospital on Monday complaining of 
flu-like symptoms and it was discovered that he had a bad valve in the left 
side of his heart. He had a massive stroke later that night, precluding surgery 
to repair the faulty valve. 
</P>
<P>
 Barber, who played on the tour full time from 1948 to 1962, was a member of 
the U.S. Ryder Cup teams in 1955 and 1961, serving as captain the latter year. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the PGA player of the year in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
 Victories in the Azalea Open served as bookends for his career on the regular 
tour. His first win came in that tournament in 1953 and his last was in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
 Barber nearly had his first tournament victory in 1950 at the L.A. Open before 
heavy rain washed away his chances. Barber played through the rain and was in 
the clubhouse with a 10-shot lead after the third round at Riviera. With 
several greens at least partially under water, many players had asked for 
cancellation of the round, to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ben Hogan took matters into his own hands. Hogan staged a one man sit-in 
and refused to cross the bridge over the torrent rushing through the barranca 
on No. 11, waiting for the siren to signal postponement of play. When the siren 
finally sounded, the day's totals were wiped out and scores reverted to the 
second round. Barber finished the tournament eight shots back. Hogan eventually 
won, defeating Sam Snead in an 18-hole playoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Barber was long considered one of the sport's great putters. In 1976, he 
helped Tom Watson with his putting, and Watson then won four consecutive titles 
on the regular tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have spent many hours practicing long putts," Barber said. "I tell people 
to get out there and practice 40-foot and longer putts. Practicing medium and 
short putts won't develop a stroke for long putts." 
</P>
<P>
 A hot putter led to Barber's PGA victory. Barber, then 45, was trailing Don 
January by four shots with three holes remaining. Barber sank putts of 25, 40 
and 52 feet and when January bogeyed the 18th, the two-shot switch enabled 
Barber to tie. In a playoff the next day, Barber shot 67 and won by a stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 He thought his career as a competitor was over until the senior tour 
blossomed. He was already 64 when it was organized in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Barber, a native of Woodson, Ill., joined the senior tour in 1980 and played a 
limited schedule this season, the last time a few weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Barber was 28 years older than the senior rookies, and even most of the 
players in the super seniors (60 or older) were at least a dozen years younger. 
And though seniors are allowed to ride in a cart, only in the past couple of 
years did Barber begin using one part of the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been walking all my life and it's no problem," Barber said. 
</P>
<P>
 He wanted to keep playing as long as he could. 
</P>
<P>
 "The older you get, the easier it is to shoot your age," Barber said at a 
tournament a few years ago, adding that he had no thoughts about giving up his 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It beats working," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Longevity runs in the Barber family. His mother was 103 when she died, and his 
father was 86. He has eight brothers and sisters, all still living, ranging in 
age from 75 to 90. 
</P>
<P>
 Barber played a number of events on the regular tour in 1991 after losing his 
exemption for the Senior (over 50) Tour. He was still eligible for the regular 
tour because his PGA championship carried a lifetime exemption from qualifying 
for tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom said his father also had the distinction of making the first hole in one 
in a PGA tournament that was captured on film, at the Buick Open in Flint, 
Mich., in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you figure he went on the tour in 1948 and he came off two weeks ago, 
that's a hell of a roll," said Tom. 
</P>
<P>
 Barber is survived by two sons, Tom and Roger; three daughters, Nancy, Sandra 
and Sally; eight brothers and sisters; 10 grandchildren and two great 
grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Funeral arrangements are pending.

 2. San Francisco 49ers. . . . Can Deion Sanders ensure an NFC championship 
victory over the Cowboys? Not with the 49ers' entire offensive line in 
bandages, he can't. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Miami Dolphins. . . . Some wise guy told Dan Marino he was finished, and 
now the rest of the league is paying for it. THE THREE BIGGEST FRAUDS 
</P>
<P>
 1. Kansas City Chiefs. . . . Steve Bono will be the starting quarterback by 
Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
 2. New York Giants. . . . Even Dan Reeves, football's best coach, can't help 
them survive a second-half stretch of five road games in eight weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Cleveland Browns. . . . What, are you color blind? Vinny Testaverde has 
thrown more interceptions, seven, than his team has scored offensive 
touchdowns, five. FIRST THREE THINGS SCOTT DAVIS SAID TO RAIDER TEAMMATES UPON 
HIS RETURN 
</P>
<P>
 1. "But the headlines said, 'Season Canceled.' Oh, so now you tell me." 
</P>
<P>
 2. "Next time, I'm going to tell Al Davis to hunt down his own darn 
Brylcreem." 
</P>
<P>
 3. "Sorry guys, couldn't find any running backs. You?" THREE THINGS YOU DIDN'T 
KNOW ABOUT BEN COATES, NEW ENGLAND TIGHT END WHO HAS CAUGHT MORE PASSES THAN 
JERRY RICE FOR MORE YARDS THAN ANDRE RISON 
</P>
<P>
 1. His first name 
</P>
<P>
 2. He was the first player ever drafted into the NFL from Livingstone College 
in Salisbury, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 3. He played one season of high school football. THREE REASONS THE RENEWED 
ENFORCEMENT OF THE NO-CHUCKING RULE HAS BEEN THE LEAGUE'S MOST IMPORTANT 
OFF-SEASON MOVE 
</P>
<P>
 1. After three weeks, there have been 19 passing performances of 300-plus 
yards or more. Last season after three weeks, there were five. 
</P>
<P>
 2. There have been 132 touchdown passes, compared to 91 after three weeks last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 3. There have been 34 individual receiving performances of 100 yards or more, 
compared to 18 last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of byes, there were four fewer games played after three weeks last 
season. But the numbers still startle. THE THREE BEST PLAYERS 
</P>
<P>
 1. Stan Humphries, quarterback, San Diego Chargers. . . . Not only is he the 
highest-rated quarterback in the league, he had the best play of the early 
season last week -- passing 45 yards from the back of the end zone in the face 
of an all-out Seattle blitz. Tony Martin caught it tied a record by going the 
rest of the way for a touchdown, the play covering 99 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Dan Marino, Miami Dolphins. . . . Do any other doubters want to see his 
repaired Achilles' tendon on artificial turf? This weekend, we will get the 
chance. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Derrick Thomas, Kansas City Chiefs. . . . His return to linebacker has 
helped lead the unbeaten Chiefs to a plus-10 turnover ratio, twice as high as 
all but one other team in the league. His safety sack of Steve Young in Week 2 
will be shown on highlight films for years. THREE LEADING CANDIDATES TO BECOME 
HEAD COACHES WHOSE LAST NAMES ARE NOT JOHNSON 
</P>
<P>
 1. Dennis Erickson, University of Miami. . . . Carolina has him on its mind. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Tony Dungy, defensive coordinator, Minnesota Vikings. . . . With the 
league's toughest defense on his resume, somebody will finally give him a 
chance. Detroit sounds nice if Wayne Fontes fails to win a playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Rusty Tillman, defensive coordinator, Seattle Seahawks. . . . A younger 
version of Chuck Knox, but louder. THREE REASONS THE RAMS ARE GOING TO STAY 
</P>
<P>
 1. The league will make life miserable for them if they go to Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Empty seats will make their life miserable if they go to St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 3. That "Save The Rams" group -- which should be heeded if its millions of 
dollars are real -- is going to hound them to the ends of the earth. THREE 
REASONS THE BRONCO DEFENSE REALLY STINKS 
</P>
<P>
 1. Denver brought two veterans out of retirement -- Karl Mecklenburg and 
Dennis Smith -- and put them in the starting lineup without the benefit of 
training camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was going to be a P.R. move until I found out I was starting," 
Smith said. 2. It has the only free safety in the league, Rondell Jones, who 
nearly fainted from exhaustion while chasing a receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember last week when it appeared that Jones had given up on Tim Brown's 
43-yard touchdown catch for the Raiders? Jones didn't quit. He was so out of 
shape after off-season surgery that he couldn't breathe. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Wade Phillips isn't the least bit funny anymore. THREE THINGS THAT LION 
LINEBACKER BRODERICK THOMAS HAS BEEN CALLED 
</P>
<P>
 1. Fontes calls him "Robert" Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 2. A club official called him, "Derrick" Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 3. After he stripped the ball from Troy Aikman of the Dallas Cowboys to set up 
the winning field goal Monday night, the press box announcer called him "Pat 
Swilling." WHAT THE JETS DID TO MAKE ROOM UNDER THE SALARY CAP FOR TONY 
CASILLAS 
</P>
<P>
 1. Cut defensive end Coleman Rudolph ($350,000). 
</P>
<P>
 2. Cut receiver Rob Carpenter ($298,000). 
</P>
<P>
 3. Cut linebacker Tuineau Alipate ($180,000). THREE THINGS OILER DEFENDERS 
HAVE SAID ABOUT THEIR OFFENSE 
</P>
<P>
 1. Safety Marcus Robertson: "Our offense is a joke." 
</P>
<P>
 2. Cornerback Cris Dishman: "We need somebody over there who knows what the 
hell he's doing. What's happening on offense is a bunch of bull." 
</P>
<P>
 3. Cornerback Darryll Lewis: "I think it's time to point fingers and name 
names. The defensive players feel like we have to score to win the game." THE 
THREE-GAME RUSHING TOTALS FOR THE PACKERS 
</P>
<P>
 1. 94 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 2. 38.  
</P>
<P>
 3. 37. THREE THINGS THAT BENGAL FANS ARE CALLING DEFENSIVE LINEMAN DAN (BIG 
DADDY) WILKINSON, THE NO. 1 DRAFT PICK WHO HAS FIVE TACKLES AND NO SACKS IN 
THREE GAMES 
</P>
<P>
 1. Big Duddy. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Big Cruddy. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Big Bust. THREE THINGS BUDDY RYAN DID TO HIS QUARTERBACK POSITION LAST WEEK 
</P>
<P>
 1. Brought in Rich Gannon for a tryout. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Implied that Steve Beuerlein was a cancer that needed to be cut out. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Said he was impressed with the quarterback play of Jeff Feagles, the 
Cardinals' punter. QUICK HITTERS 
</P>
<P>
 * COMING SOON TO A DIVISION NEAR YOU: Although the league is not expected to 
announce realignment plans until early November, they will be discussed at the 
owners meetings next week in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources say one plan has become a clear favorite among league officials and 
many owners. It includes: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Moving Seattle and Arizona into the NFC West with the Rams, San Francisco 
and New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Moving Houston into the AFC West with the Raiders, Kansas City, Denver and 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Dropping Carolina into the NFC Central and moving Tampa Bay into the NFC 
East. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Dropping Jacksonville into the AFC East along with Atlanta and moving 
Buffalo to the AFC Central with Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 A breakdown of divisions under this favored plan: 
</P>
<P>
 NFC West: San Francisco, Rams, Seattle, Arizona, New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 NFC Central: Detroit, Green Bay, Chicago, Minnesota, Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 NFC East: Dallas, New York Giants, Philadelphia, Washington, Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 AFC West: Kansas City, Raiders, Denver, San Diego, Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 AFC Central: Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Indianapolis, Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 AFC East: Miami, New York Jets, New England, Atlanta, Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
 Under this plan, the NFC West and East would clearly be football's toughest 
divisions, and the AFC East could become the Dolphins' domain for the rest of 
this century. 
</P>
<P>
 The only major rivalry that would be lost would be the Dolphins and Buffalo 
Bills, but that would be replaced by an even more intense regional squabble 
among the Bills, Pittsburgh Steelers and Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
 And how about that Jacksonville-Atlanta rivalry? 
</P>
<P>
 * GOOD TO SEE SOME THINGS HAVEN'T CHANGED: Goose Gonsoulin, a safety with the 
original Denver Broncos of 1960, recalls a locker room scene after a game 
against the Los Angeles Chargers that year. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonsoulin, who had intercepted six passes in his first two games, was 
approached by a man carrying a board and a box of chalk. 
</P>
<P>
 "Goose, what's the hardest play for you to cover?" the man asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonsoulin, thinking the man was a sportswriter, drew up one such play, and was 
still drawing when he heard his general manager shout, "Al, get the hell out of 
our locker room!" 
</P>
<P>
 That man was then-Charger receiver coach Al Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 * NAME THAT TUNE: Johnnie Morton, former USC wide receiver and first-round 
draft pick of the Detroit Lions, recently became engaged to Shanice, a noted 
rhythm and blues singer. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he suffered the blues of an NFL rookie. After seeing his name in the 
starting lineup against the Dallas Cowboys on Monday night, he excitedly ran a 
reverse while returning the opening kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
 He was promptly benched. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he was expected to replace injured Anthony Carter, and although 
bosses say they now love him after a slow training camp start, he has yet to 
even have a pass thrown in his direction. 
</P>
<P>
 * WE CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THIS STUFF: When we last left Barry Switzer, he was 
leaving the Cowboys less than 24 hours before a Sunday game, flying off to 
watch his son play college football. 
</P>
<P>
 He has since proved that even when he is there, he isn't there. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second half of the Monday night game with the Detroit Lions, Cowboy 
quarterback Troy Aikman could not get Switzer's attention while trying to 
decide whether to accept a penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 After futilely screaming at Switzer from the field, Aikman called a timeout to 
confer with him on the sidelines. That timeout could have been better used 
later during the overtime loss. 
</P>
<P>
 * LET THE FRANK REICH SWEEPSTAKES BEGIN: At league meetings next week in 
Dallas, officials are expected to announce the personnel plans for the 
expansion Carolina Panthers and Jacksonville Jaguars. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources say each of the 28 existing franchises will lose no more than three 
players in an expansion draft, with each team forced to expose only eight 
players. The expansion teams also are expected to be rewarded with about a 
dozen extra college draft picks in each of the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 One key to the plan is a ruling that will allow Carolina and Jacksonville to 
begin signing free agents by early November. Look for their first acquisitions 
to be veterans who were released too late to sign with existing teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Carolina won a coin toss last spring for the first pick in the 1995 college 
draft. Jacksonville will pick second, and each team will get three more picks 
before the end of the second round.

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; RECEIVERS LONGING TO GO DEEP AGAIN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the first three games, quarterback Jeff Hostetler has had difficulty 
completing long passes, and he can thank the intimidating speed of his 
receivers for this problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've received so much hype about our speed that teams have been laying off 
really deep against us," wide receiver Tim Brown said. "I don't think that 
we've completed a deep ball all year. I don't even think that we've even thrown 
more than five." 
</P>
<P>
 The extra room underneath has not been a problem for Brown, who leads the team 
with 18 catches for 239 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's right up my alley when they play 10 yards off of me and give me a 
cushion like that," Brown said. "I still want to be a big-play guy, but I'll 
take being a control receiver when it's there." 
</P>
<P>
 One receiver who has suffered against this coverage, however, has been 
world-class sprinter James Jett.  
</P>
<P>
 With only four catches for 53 yards and no touchdowns, Jett is frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first couple of weeks have been kind of rough and things are down right 
now, but I'm ready to pick up and take it to another level," said Jett, who 
last season as a rookie led the NFL with a 23.4 yards-per-catch average with 33 
receptions. "Teams have been showing one type of coverage on films, but in the 
games they have been totally different in playing back really deep. I have to 
somehow find a way to get open on the field." 
</P>

 Joe Madro, a 50-year veteran of football coaching and scouting, died Friday. 
He was 81. Madro, who began his pro coaching career with the Rams under Sid 
Gillman in 1954, had been a personnel scout for the Raiders since 1977.

 After blowing out Denver in their "throwback" 1963 road uniforms, the Raiders 
will wear their home 1963 uniforms Sunday. Because their black jerseys are the 
same, the only difference will be the white background logo on the helmet. San 
Diego will wear its road white 1961 uniform for the second consecutive week 
after defeating Seattle last Sunday. Hall of Fame center Jim Otto will be the 
Raiders' honorary captain. LONNIE WHITE

 Phil Simms said he will listen to offers from Arizona Cardinal Coach Buddy 
Ryan or anybody else who wants him to return to the NFL as a quarterback. He 
just hasn't had any offers yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Simms' agent confirmed Friday that Arizona had called to talk about his 
client, but David Fishof said no offer had been made. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still don't know anything, and I still haven't talked to anybody from out 
there," Simms said from Franklin Lakes, N.J. "If somebody wants to contact me, 
I will listen." 
</P>
<P>
 Simms, who was not offered a contract by the New York Giants this season, said 
he hadn't spoken with his agent Friday, but "he told me they were going to 
talk, so I assume they have. I just don't know at this point."

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAMS; BETTIS UNWORRIED ABOUT FUMBLING

<P>
 The Kansas City Chiefs have forced a league-leading eight fumbles in three 
games, but Ram running back Jerome Bettis said there is no cause for concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're going to concentrate on something like that, you're going to give 
it up," said Bettis, who fumbled on his first carry of the season."You can't go 
in fearing such a thing or you will cough it up. If you're a sound runner, you 
shouldn't have a problem no matter where you go. It's when you're not sound 
fundamentally that a team can take advantage of you." 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis carried the ball 294 times last season and fumbled four times. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis has 66 carries this season, but in two defeats he has received the ball 
only once during the fourth quarter. In the team's only victory, he carried the 
ball nine times in the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't really had the chance to get that constant feeding because we've 
fallen behind," Bettis said. "We need to stay close so we can stick to our game 
plan. I'm looking for 28 to 30 carries a game, whereas I've been getting about 
20 a game. Then I'll hit my stride." 
</P>

 Linebacker Shane Conlan is expected to start against the Chiefs after working 
without complications Friday. Cornerback Steve Israel, however, will probably 
sit out the game because of a sore knee. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Chuck Knox said rookie James Bostic will be inactive for a fourth 
consecutive week along with wide receiver Richard Buchanan, tackle Darryl 
Ashmore and defensive tackle David Rocker. Rookie tackle Wayne Gandy poked 
Rocker in the eye earlier this week in practice, and team physicians advised 
against Rocker suiting up. T.J. SIMERS

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE NFL; CARDINAL OFFER TO SIMMS REJECTED

<TEXT>
<P>
 Phil Simms apparently won't be playing quarterback for the Arizona Cardinals. 
At least not yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Simms' agent, David Fishof, said the Cardinals made an offer that has been 
rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 "The salary cap put Phil Simms out of football and probably will keep him 
out," Fishof told NY 1, a new York cable station. 
</P>
<P>
 Confirming that the Cardinals had called to talk about Simms, Fishof had 
earlier told NY 1 that "an offer has been made." 
</P>
<P>
 "I still don't know anything, and I still haven't talked to anybody from out 
there," Simms said from his home in Franklin Lakes, N.J. "If somebody wants to 
contact me, I will listen." 
</P>
<P>
 Simms, a commentator for ESPN, said he hadn't spoken with Fishof on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview last Wednesday, Simms said he couldn't envision returning to 
football now, and on Friday, he said he hadn't changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing that could make me go back to playing right now. I've stepped 
away," Simms said.

 A grand jury in Cincinnati has decided not to indict Deion Sanders on a felony 
charge for his confrontation with a police officer at Riverfront Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders, who was playing for the Cincinnati Reds and is now with the San 
Francisco 49ers, was then indicted on a first-degree misdemeanor of failing to 
comply with a police officer's order. The Hamilton County grand jury's decision 
was a setback to police who wanted the two-sport star prosecuted on a felony. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've said all along it didn't happen the way the city said it did and that 
came out in the grand jury," said James Keys, Sanders' attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders was arrested Aug. 8 and charged with misdemeanor counts of failing to 
provide a driver's license and resisting arrest during a confrontation with an 
off-duty Cincinnati police officer working as a guard at Riverfront Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders, who pleaded innocent to all charges, faces up to six months in jail 
and a $1,000 fine on the one misdemeanor count, but jail time is extremely 
unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 Wide receiver Mike Pritchard of the Denver Broncos was listed in serious 
condition with a possible ruptured kidney Friday night. Pritchard, who noticed 
blood in his urine, was rushed to Presbyterian-St. Luke's Hospital at about 
8:30 p.m. CDT by an ambulance responding to a 911 call, hospital spokesman Brad 
Bawmann said. Doctors took X-rays and performed a CAT scan to pinpoint the 
problem. There was no indication if the condition was football-related. . . . 
Running back Harold Green has been fined a reported $4,000 for skipping two 
days of practice without the Cincinnati Bengals' approval to attend a friend's 
funeral. Green won't start Sunday against the Houston Oilers because he missed 
important practice time, but will play.

the timing is not right.The state Legislature is adjourned until January, when 
a new governor will be sworn in. Weicker is not running for re-election. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless we had some extraordinary matter taking place, I'm not prepared to go 
ahead and speak for the state and saddle the new incoming administration, the 
incoming Legislature with a deal that size -- which is not to say we will not 
maintain communications," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Legislature approved a stadium bonding package to build a stadium last 
year in hopes of bringing the New England Patriots to Connecticut's capital 
city. The Patriots remained in Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he thought a deal would be completed before January, Weicker said, "I 
don't want to say no, but I'm just trying to speak common sense right now. . . 
. If all of a sudden tomorrow (the team) said 'Hey, we're ready to go,' I'd say 
hallelujah and try to get it right up there in special session."

 For King right wing Rich Tocchet, it was a different kind of hat trick on 
Friday -- a new contract, a debut with his new team at the Forum and a game 
against his former team. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours before the Kings tied the Pittsburgh Penguins, 5-5, before an announced 
crowd of 12,652, Tocchet agreed to a four-year contract in the $8-million 
range.There is deferred money included in the deal, a typical practice in most 
King contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Tocchet, 30, was acquired from the Penguins in July for left wing Luc 
Robitaille. Robitaille did not play, but Tocchet appeared in his first 
exhibition and showed he isn't afraid of contact after his off-season back 
surgery. Tocchet, who had been with the Penguins since the 1991-92 season, 
threw one of the hardest checks, delivering a solid hit on defenseman Pat 
Neaton behind the net. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings don't want to push Tocchet too quickly. He is scheduled to play in 
the final exhibition Wednesday at the Forum against San Jose. King General 
Manager Sam McMaster said the team will take a prudent approach with Tocchet as 
well as with right wing Tony Granato, resting them on longer trips and keeping 
the two players out of games on consecutive days. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we'll do that with Tony Granato all season and we'll see how it goes 
with Rick Tocchet," McMaster said. "The type of goal could be 65 games out of 
84 for Granato. I don't think we have a specific goal with Tocchet. We want 
them to be healthy for the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Gretzky, who has a groin injury, did not play for the second consecutive 
game.

DUCKS, STARS TIE IN OPENER THAT MIGHT NEVER BE PLAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 The NHL schedule says the Mighty Ducks and Dallas Stars will open the season 
against each other next Saturday in Dallas, but they might not come any closer 
to their scheduled meeting than Friday night's exhibition before 16,533 at The 
Pond, a 4-4 tie that ended with a union-solidarity handshake. 
</P>
<P>
 The on-time start of the season is so much in doubt that Anaheim club 
officials have canceled the team's Dallas hotel reservations to avoid risking 
their deposit, although Tony Tavares, club president, says the team has a 
backup plan in case the games begin as scheduled.He said he won't make a 
decision on plane tickets until next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Should the start of the season be postponed, it will delay the 
much-anticipated debut of rookie Paul Kariya, who scored his second 
short-handed breakaway goal of the preseason Friday, beating goalie Andy Moog. 
</P>
<P>
 Kariya, 19, has eight points in six exhibitions and has earned a place on the 
team's first line, the first power-play unit and the first penalty-killing unit 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have an offensive talent like Paul, it intimidates the other team's 
power play," Coach Ron Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're always worried about making a mistake and seeing it end up in the 
other net. It's the same with Wayne Gretzky killing penalties, or Mike Modano." 
</P>
<P>
 Modano had one goal and two assists for Dallas, and Stephan Lebeau had a goal 
and an assist for the Ducks.

HART CHANGES PACE IN BEATING WESTLAKE WITH GROUND ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What happened to Hart High's football team? The one with the no-huddle, two- 
minute- scoring- drive offense? 
</P>
<P>
 The normally high-scoring Indians (3-0) used a ball-control running game to 
beat Westlake, 20-7, Friday night at Newbury Park High in a game matching teams 
expected to contend for Southern Section titles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a good running back and a great line," Hart Coach Mike Herrington 
said. "We wanted to control the ball. We didn't want to give them the ball 
because their offense has a lot of weapons." 
</P>
<P>
 Hart's main weapon was running back Ted Iacenda, who gained 115 yards in 29 
carries and scored twice on one- and five-yard runs. Quarterback Steve McKeon 
ran for 56 yards in 15 carries and scored once. He completed seven of 10 passes 
for 121 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake (2-1), which averaged 45 points in its first two games, could not 
move the ball in the second half, when it needed to come back. The Warriors did 
not score and gained only 90 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart put the game away with its first drive of the second half. The Indians 
drove the ball 63 yards on a 14-play drive that took 7 minutes 49 seconds and 
ended with a one-yard run by Iacenda. JEFF FLETCHER

BLOOMINGTON DOES IT AGAIN, 62-10; PREP FOOTBALL: COACH IS ON THE HOT SEAT AMID 
ACCUSATIONS OF RUNNING UP SCORE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD, TIMES PREP SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bloomington High is turning its fortune around on the football field this 
season, but off the field the team is not making many friends. 
</P>
<P>
 First-year Coach Don Markham has led Bloomington to a 3-0 record, but the 
victories have been so lopsided that outsiders have accused the Bruins of 
running up the score. 
</P>
<P>
 How bad has it been? 
</P>
<P>
 After opening the season with an 86-8 victory at Big Bear two weeks ago, the 
Bruins defeated Riverside Notre Dame, 84-0, last week and Hemet West Valley, 
62-10, Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Bloomington has outscored its opponents, 232-18, and has an average margin of 
victory of 71 points. Its winning scores are among the highest since the 
governing CIF Southern Section was founded in 1913. 
</P>
<P>
 The scores have not gone unnoticed. Local newspaper and television reporters 
turned out in mass this week to find out why the team is scoring so many 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our school has never had this much press before," Markham said. "My wife 
joked that our story was placed right between the O.J. Simpson trial and the 
crisis in Haiti. I guess everyone wants to read about the high scores." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone is taking them lightly. Bill Clark, Southern Section associate 
commissioner, called Bloomington Principal James Downs twice this week to talk 
about the school's football team. 
</P>
<P>
 Since taking over the program last spring, Markham has quickly turned things 
around. Bloomington struggled through a 1-9 record in 1993 and finished fifth 
in the Division 8 Sunkist League. The Bruins are now considered title 
contenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Markham, a coaching veteran of 23 years, has only 20 players on the varsity 
and runs a simple double-wing offense. The playbook contains seven plays, and 
the three passing routes have hardly been called. 
</P>
<P>
 The offense has dominated, scoring on 29 of 30 possessions. The defense has 
given up two fourth-quarter touchdowns and a 51-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We basically run the same plays over and over and over again," said Markham, 
who is best know for building nearby Colton High into a powerhouse in the 
1970s. "So if a team can't stop those plays, the score can get kind of high. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not out there to run up the score, however. None of that in-your-face 
stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 There was concern all week that Bloomington might beat West Valley by as many 
as 100 points or more. West Valley entered the contest having been outscored, 
116-0, in its first two games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins jumped to a 54-0 halftime lead, but were held to a touchdown in the 
second half due, in part, to a running clock. 
</P>
<P>
 The victories have done wonders for the Bloomington community, 60 miles east 
of downtown Los Angeles. Friday's home opener drew a rare sellout crowd and 
Markham said kids had been coming up to him all week asking about trying out 
for the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Controversy is nothing new to Markham, 55, who has won 80% of his games. In 
coaching stints at L.A. Baptist, Riverside Romona, La Puente Bishop Amat and 
Colton, he gained a reputation for limiting the number of players on the 
varsity and often running up the score. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1990 through 1993 Markham coached at Bandon High in Oregon. Lopsided 
scores there resulted in a state rule that ends a game when a team has a 
45-point lead at halftime or later. It is often referred to as "the Bandon 
Rule."

TABASCO CAT, BEST PAL TO MEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trainer Wayne Lukas says a victory today by his Tabasco Cat in the Kentucky 
Cup Classic, and victories in the Jockey Club Gold Cup on Oct. 8 at Belmont and 
in the Breeders' Cup on Nov. 5, would give his colt a chance to be voted horse 
of the year over the leading candidate, Holy Bull. 
</P>
<P>
 Tabasco Cat is the 7-5 morning line favorite in the $400,000 Kentucky Cup 
Classic.The 1 1/8-mile race is the highlight of Turfway Park's first $1-million 
Kentucky Cup Day of Champions. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Mandella, trainer of Best Pal, the 8-5 second choice in the Kentucky 
Cup Classic, also trained last year's horse of the year, Kotashaan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you've got to take a horse's whole year into consideration," he said.

FAIRPLEX; TRIAL SET FOR JOCKEY BRIAN LONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED ROBLEDO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jockey Brian Long, under indefinite suspension at Fairplex Park because he 
failed to appear at a hearing to answer charges of sexual harassment, pleaded 
not guilty at his arraignment in Monrovia on Friday after being arrested in an 
Arcadia motel room Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Long is charged with resisting arrest, possession of marijuana for sale and 
destroying evidence, according to the Arcadia police. 
</P>
<P>
 Trial for Long has been scheduled for Oct. 3. His bail has been set at $10,000 
and he remains in custody at the L.A. County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Long, 31, who has not been seen at the racetrack since being charged with 
sexual harassment by female jockey Joy Scott, was with a female companion at 
the motel on Colorado Boulevard at the time of his arrest, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police gave this account of the arrest: 
</P>
<P>
 They first noticed a 1981 Honda Prelude with a faulty sticker on the license 
plate at the motel. 
</P>
<P>
 While running a check on the vehicle, police were told by a maintenance man 
that the occupants were in Room 111. The maintenance man also said that he had 
found narcotics paraphernalia that had come from that room. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were given permission to enter the room, and upon entering, heard a 
toilet flushing. Long and his companion, Florence V. Fleming, 35, were arrested 
after a brief scuffle. Fleming was charged with suspicion of having marijuana 
for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 The stewards at Fairplex Park had no knowledge of Long's arrest and no action 
will be taken upon it unless charges are filed by the California Horse Racing 
Board. As far as the stewards are concerned, Long remains on indefinite 
suspension. Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Diane's Halo, beaten three times by Lakeway and once by Sardula, dropped to a 
more realistic level and posted a half-length victory over She's Enchanting in 
the $50,000 CTBA Marian Stakes, a 1 1/16-mile race for 3-year-old fillies at 
Fairplex Park. Airistar, who had finished first or second in six previous 
starts, battled for the lead most of the way with Cimply A Lady and finished 
third. 
</P>
<P>
 David Flores made a strong move toward his sixth consecutive riding title at 
Fairplex with four winners to take a 21-15 lead over Fernando Valenzuela with 
10 days remaining. Flores had victories aboard Master Dicke ($4.20) in the 
fourth, Golden Rubles ($3.00) in the fifth, Watching Royalty ($6.20) in the 
sixth and Special Comic ($3.60) in the eighth. . . . There was a $13,000 show 
bet made on 3-5 favorite Apalache Chick in Thursday's fifth race, according to 
mutuel manager Dick Brandley, who suspects it was made by the so called "Barona 
Bomber" who placed such bets at the Barona satellite facility last year. 
Apalache Chick won and paid $2.10 to show, meaning the profit on the $13,000 
bet was $650. . . . Post time for the first race has been moved back an hour to 
1 p.m. today and will remain at that time for the remainder of the meet. . . . 
Jay Cohen, whose trumpet calls the horses to the post each day, reached a 
milestone with his 29,000th call Thursday.

CUT IN FUNDING TIES UP PLANS FOR COURTHOUSE; CONGRESS: THE TENTATIVE LOSS OF 
$25 MILLION FOR THE FEDERAL PROJECT IN SANTA ANA MAY FORCE IT TO BE SCALED BACK 
OR DELAYED. 
</P>

 Unless Congress restores the remaining $25 million for construction of Orange 
County's first federal courthouse, plans for the long-awaited facility will 
have to be dramatically scaled back or placed on hold, the General Services 
Administration said Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot legally let a contract without having the money," GSA spokeswoman 
Mary Phillipini said. Courthouse funding troubles surfaced suddenly Thursday 
night when a congressional conference committee slashed the massive 
Treasury-Postal appropriations bill, including the money needed to complete 
funding for the $128-million court project in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress approved $103 million for the project last year. 
</P>
<P>
 If the $25 million is not restored when the federal budget goes to the House 
and Senate for a final vote next week, Phillipini said it is likely that the 
GSA will be forced to change its proposed schedule for building the 
601,000-square foot courthouse in the Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Excavation for the project was to begin within the next few months and 
construction to begin by April. Under that schedule, the 10-story building 
would have been ready for occupancy by late summer, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the remaining money, Phillipini said the GSA would consider reducing 
the size of the building or waiting for additional funds to become available. 
</P>
<P>
 "Needless to say, it is shocking and catching us all by surprise," said Santa 
Ana City Councilman Miguel A. Pulido Jr. "Last night, I was at a neighborhood 
meeting talking about the courthouse -- how important it is to the city. Little 
did I know it was dying in the conference committee."  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, and Rep. Christopher 
Cox (R-Newport Beach) are in dispute about what, if any, last-ditch strategy 
could salvage the courthouse funding.  
</P>
<P>
 Cox contends that Feinstein could save the building by wielding her influence 
with the Democratic majority in the conference committee. Feinstein, however, 
contends it is the responsibility of Cox and other Orange County 
representatives to persuade the House to send the appropriations bill back to 
committee with specific instructions to reinstate the courthouse project. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein has blamed Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), in whose district 
the courthouse would be located, and Rep. Mike Huffington (R-Santa Barbara), 
who is running for her Senate seat, for placing the Orange County project in 
jeopardy. The senator claimed that both congressmen supported a House decision 
to send the funding bill to a conference committee with the directive to cut 
$200 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington has said that he wasn't aware that the Orange County courthouse 
project was part of the bill, while Dornan has said he did not believe the 
project would be among the cuts the conference committee would consider.  
</P>
<P>
 Brian Keeter, Dornan's press secretary, said Friday that Dornan believes the 
Democratic majority in the conference committee decided to punish those 
Republicans who voted to cut expenditures by scuttling projects in their home 
districts.  
</P>
<P>
 Keeter said Dornan on Friday appealed to Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-Maryland), who 
co-chaired the conference committee, "to put partisan politics aside and 
restore the funding for this Ronald Reagan Courthouse."  
</P>
<P>
 "Dornan believes there is an outside chance that the courthouse could be 
slipped back in the bill," Keeter said. "Congressman Dornan is going to work to 
get the money next year if we can't get it this year," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Maynes, press secretary for Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), the Senate 
leader of the conference committee, said he believes neither Feinstein nor 
anyone else can persuade the committee to add the courthouse project. He said 
Orange County Republicans' "shot themselves in the foot" when they lobbied for 
budget cuts and now are trying to save face. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have egg on their face and they are trying desperately to wash it off," 
he said.

MIGHTY DUCKS: NOW THAT'S THE TICKET; SPORTS: MORE THAN 500 FANS RISE EARLY TO 
VIE FOR TICKETS FOR THE ANAHEIM TEAM'S SOPHOMORE SEASON -- A SEASON THAT MIGHT 
NOT START ON TIME. 
</P>

 More than 500 people converged on The Pond on Friday morning to hunt for 
Mighty Ducks tickets despite a player contract dispute that threatens to delay 
the National Hockey League season. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50,000 single-game tickets went on sale at 10 a.m. Fans young and old, 
many decked in Ducks athletic wear, waited in the long line for a chance to see 
their local team play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really excited," 8-year-old Chuck Miller of Los Angeles, said. "I have 
cards and a doll of the mascot at home. They're my favorite team." 
</P>
<P>
 At 8 a.m., Ducks officials began distributing pink priority bracelets to those 
waiting in line. Each bracelet was numbered, and a computer was used to 
randomly pick the order of purchase. Some fans who had lined up as early as 3 
a.m. ended up behind people who got there hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 As security guards called out the numbers, people waited behind barricades, 
reading novels or using cellular telephones to call in sick at work. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're grateful for the overwhelming response," said Bill Robertson, a Ducks 
spokesman. "We couldn't have asked for anything better. Hockey is alive and 
well in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 As of 3:30 p.m., 20,113 tickets had been sold, Robertson said. Each person was 
limited to six per game. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the lucky fans was Michael Fridella, a 37-year-old hockey fanatic from 
Westchester who owns a collection of 550 hockey sticks that were given to him 
at games by professional players. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got here at 8:20 a.m. and I was 37th in line," Fridella said. "I got 25 
tickets for five games for my family." 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets for games with local rivals the Kings sold out especially fast. 
</P>
<P>
 Amber Hannigan, a 20-year-old from Anaheim, just wanted tickets to see her 
favorite hunk, former Kings player Luc Robitaille, who was recently traded to 
the Pittsburgh Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's awful," she complained, as she waited under a warm morning sun. "I'm 
wondering how long I'm going to have to stand in line." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the fans were concerned about the contract talks. 
</P>
<P>
 The NHL season might not begin as scheduled on Oct. 1 if a new collective 
bargaining agreement isn't reached between the players and team owners, hockey 
officials have said. The owners want to establish a salary cap and tax clubs 
that go over the amount. But the players object. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are really fed up with professional sports," said Donna Young, 32, of 
Colton. "The baseball strike left a bad taste in people's mouths and it will 
just continue the bad feelings if (hockey) doesn't start on time." 
</P>
<P>
 Kurt Goss, 35, arrived at The Pond at 3:30 a.m. to buy tickets for games 
scheduled for late in the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I promised (my 5-year-old daughter) I'd get her tickets to a ballgame," said 
Goss, a baseball fan laughing at his Freudian slip since there are contract 
disputes in both sports. "It's hard to feel sorry for people who make millions 
a year." 
</P>
<P>
 Mighty Ducks tickets will be on sale at The Pond from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday 
through Friday and from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday. Officials say that if games 
are postponed, tickets will be valid for rescheduled games. Those who can't 
attend those games will receive a full refund, said Bob Wagner, advertising and 
sales director for the Ducks.

LION SIGHTINGS FORCE IRVINE PARK CLOSURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 An unusually high number of mountain lion sightings in the city -- including 
one this week -- has forced the indefinite closure of the 150-acre trail area 
at the William R. Mason Regional Park for the first time in decades, officials 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be on the safe side, we decided to shut it down," said Jerry F. Lahart, 
the supervising park ranger. Officials began posting new red and white warning 
signs around the park on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 A lion sighting at Mason park Wednesday was the second in three weeks reported 
to county officials, Lahart said. Animal control officials said there have been 
a total of six reports of mountain lions in the area in the past two months. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like mountain lion behavior has been changing a little all over the 
United States," Lahart said. "We are seeing more and more of these unusual 
occurrences. We are getting more and more close encounters with animals of this 
sort. There is the potential for definite concern." 
</P>
<P>
 State Fish and Game Department officials said the mountain lion population in 
Orange County has grown rapidly over the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "The habitat is full of them," said Patrick Moore, a Fish and Game spokesman. 
"They are now outgrowing (it). They are trying to expand their habitat and they 
are coming into the human habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 "We continuously have mountain lion sightings in Southern California, one or 
two a month." 
</P>
<P>
 Mason is at least the second park to have been closed in recent years because 
of such sightings. 
</P>
<P>
 At the corner of University and Culver drives, most of the park is surrounded 
by homes and part of it extends into a rural area. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, a woman walking in the park notified officials that she had seen 
a mountain lion in the same area where the other sighting was reported earlier 
this month. Both sightings occurred in the park's natural area, across the 
street from a 100-acre picnic area, softball field and other developed 
facilities.. Those areas will remain open. 
</P>
<P>
 Park staff have investigated the area and found no mountain lion tracks, 
Lahart said. State Fish and Game officials will inspect the site this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, no one has been attacked at the Mason park, Lahart said. But 
in 1986, a mountain lion grabbed 5-year-old Laura Small by the head with its 
jaws while the girl and her mother were searching for tadpoles at Ronald W. 
Caspers Regional Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The El Toro girl's family won a $1.5-million settlement from the county. Small 
was blinded in her right eye, suffered brain damage and left partially 
paralyzed in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Only months later, 6-year-old Justin Mellon of Huntington Beach was mauled in 
the same park, which was closed for 60 days after the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the attacks we've had have been (on) children," Moore said. "They are 
small and kind of look like game. Mountain lions think they are prey." 
</P>
<P>
 After the attacks, park officials adopted the policy of closing parks whenever 
a mountain lion was sighted. 
</P>
<P>
 The unusually high number of sightings reflects a rising mountain lion 
population. According to Fish and Game surveys, the population jumped from 
2,400 in 1972, to 3,000 in 1982 and 4,100 in 1984. There were 5,100 mountain 
lions as of 1988, the last time a count was made, Moore said. Officials 
estimate the population is now 6,000.

FROM WIPEOUT TO WIMP OUT; BODYSURFERS HAD BUMMER SUMMER AT WEDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a party for the summer that never was. The Wedge just didn't fire. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For the past three months, Mel Thoman, 37, and members of the Wedge crew, 
dreamed of seeing Newport Beach lifeguards hoisting yellow or red warning flags 
at the famed bodysurfing spot, signifying macho-sized waves. 
</P>
<P>
 But the summer of '94 is best remembered for its many green flags and calm 
ocean, the bodysurfer said. On Friday, with Wedge regulars -- some of whom 
arrived from San Diego and New Mexico -- looking on and hooting, Thoman 
ceremoniously said goodby to summer and hello to autumn as he propped a 
flagpole at the Wedge. Hanging on the end was one of his wash towels. Green of 
course. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had an amazingly bad summer for bodysurfers," said Thoman. "The 
weather's been great, water temps have been great, but the whole Wedge crew is 
down in the dumps about the summer of '94. That's why we're drinking champagne 
today, to toast autumn and drown our sorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, it's illegal to drink alcoholic beverages on a public beach, they 
acknowledged. But kissing off a bad summer is part of a ritual as Southern 
Californian as palm trees and strip malls. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1981, when there was a bad year for the Wedge," Thoman said, "we had a 
'Death to Summer' party and we all wore black. But our motto this year is to 
wear green. Everybody has to have something green because we've had the green 
flag flying for most of the summer." The Wedge, at the tip of the Balboa 
Peninsula, usually produce some of California's premier waves, which are known 
for their steep drop and speed of the ride. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During a good summer, powerful south swells bounce off a rock jetty, creating 
20-foot waves and larger. It's one of Southern California's attractions that 
draw hundreds of spectators who ooh and aah while fearless bodysurfers -- clad 
only in trunks and swim fins -- attack "Big Wedge," as it's called during big 
swells. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach surf photographer Ron Romanowsky, who records only big days at 
the Wedge, said, "The first swell that made it over 10 feet at the Wedge was 
Aug. 14. And, by 5 o'clock, the swell had virtually died." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's funny," Romanowsky said, "because we had so many swells last year, (we 
had) 22 days in July, 1993, with waves over six or eight feet at the Wedge. But 
this year in July? Zilch. There might have been something there, but nothing 
big to record on my calendar. It got so bad I stopped logging waves!" 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach Marine Safety Lt. Jim Turner disagreed with Thoman's belief that 
the lifeguard tower at the Wedge hoisted only one red flag this summer, though 
he did agree there have been better summers at the Wedge. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a very quiet summer in regards to the Wedge," Turner said. "But we 
had the red flag up at the Wedge five days. I think they have that old feeling 
that, as experts at the Wedge, they feel there's no need to put the red flag 
in. But the flag system is not only for the locals but for the public. And it's 
the public's safety we're concerned with." 
</P>
<P>
 Sean Collins, a wave forecaster at Surfline/Wavetrak in Huntington Beach, said 
it's been one of the poorest summers for hurricanes that produce the big 
swells. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as the overall swell, it was one of the worst years we've had with 
regard to major Southern Hemisphere swells," Collins said. "The kicker is that 
we had a great summer for consistent waves for board surfers, but nothing over 
the seven- or eight-foot threshold. A lot of us surfers were pretty stoked." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Daily "Wedge watching" may seem obsessive to inlanders. But after all, this is 
a spot whose reputation extends to a Wedge Preservation Society, a local surf 
wear company (Wedge Wear), Viper fins which were developed by longtime local 
Fred Simpson, and a drink, "The Wedge," a concoction which includes white and 
gold tequila and is poured nightly at Newport's Studio Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wedge is such a magnet that Ian (Eli) Johnston, a 24-year-old UC San Diego 
student living in La Jolla, doesn't think twice about making the long drive to 
bodysurf here. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up in Venice Beach," Johnston said. "I remember that after I got a car 
I would come here as often as I could. On that big day on Aug. 14, I called 
Mel's message machine because he gives the surf report. But his machine was 
broken. Well, I called him later and he told me there was a big swell in and 
that was at 5 p.m. I left immediately. Two hours later I was in Newport."

EX-CASINO OFFICIAL FOUND GUILTY OF LOAN-SHARKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY L. RABIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal court jury on Friday found the former Asian games manager at the 
Bicycle Club casino guilty of conspiracy, loan-sharking, and extortion for 
loaning money to gamblers at exorbitant interest rates, then having an 
associate use force to collect the debts. 
</P>
<P>
 The conviction of Hollman Cheung on nine criminal counts was hailed by 
prosecutors from the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles, who described the 
matter as a significant Asian organized crime case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, it sends a message that this type of conduct will not be tolerated 
in California card casinos," said Assistant U.S. Atty. Marc R. Greenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very disappointed," said Cheung's defense attorney, Charles R. English, 
who said he plans an appeal. "We believed then and now that Hollman was 
innocent."  
</P>
<P>
 English complained about the government's reliance on several unindicted 
co-conspirators who had been facing life in prison and received reduced 
sentences for their cooperation with prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 The case had an ironic twist for the U.S. government, which seized the Bicycle 
Club in April, 1990, after federal prosecutors proved the vast casino alongside 
the Long Beach Freeway was built in part with $12 million in laundered drug 
money from Florida. The government still owns a controlling interest in the 
club, but last month entered into a $38-million sales agreement with a Santa 
Monica investment group. 
</P>
<P>
 The government charged that Cheung and several associates "would loan money at 
usurious rates to people gambling at the Bicycle Club in Bell Gardens," then 
use extortionate means to collect on the loans. 
</P>
<P>
 The conspiracy count alleged that Cheung and others engaged in loan-sharking 
and extortion until February, 1993, nearly three years after the government 
acquired its interest in the club. During the 12-day trial, victims testified 
that Cheung charged up to 10% interest every three days. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheung also faces federal conspiracy and racketeering charges in New York 
related to gold bullion businesses that allegedly looted the investment 
accounts of customers. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon set Cheung's sentencing for Nov. 28. The 
maximum sentence is 160 years in prison and $2 million in fines. Under federal 
sentencing guidelines, Greenberg said, the best that Cheung can hope for is 
eight years in federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheung, 42, of Hacienda Heights, ran lucrative pai gow and super pan nine 
poker games at the Bicycle Club until he was arrested last March after being 
indicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg, who tried the case with Assistant U.S. Atty. Stephen Larson, said 
the guilty verdict marks the end of "a significant Asian organized crime case" 
involving someone who was organizing loan sharks in the Asian community. 
</P>
<P>
 "He made victims out of people who could be victimized -- people who are 
addicted to gambling, people who are unfamiliar with American culture and our 
legal system," Greenberg said. "People in the Asian community who didn't have 
the trust and willingness to go to authorities. He knew that and he preyed upon 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses testified that co-defendant Tony Wong, a former associate of 
Cheung's at the Bicycle Club, fired shots into the homes of two loan shark 
victims and used force or intimidation to collect or attempt to collect on 
loans owed to Cheung. 
</P>
<P>
 Wong, who pleaded guilty to state charges in 1991, fled to Hong Kong before 
being indicted on federal counts. He remains a fugitive.

COMFORTERS; NEEDY: QUILTING CLUBS DONATE ELABORATE HANDIWORK TO BABIES WITH 
AIDS, THE HOMELESS, AND ABUSED CHILDREN. IT'S TIME WELL-SPENT ON A GOOD CAUSE, 
THEY SAY. 
</P>

 Gail Thompson knows how to warm arms and legs -- and hearts. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson makes quilts. She's among hundreds of sewing enthusiasts in Los 
Angeles who are preparing thousands of bed coverings to give away to homeless 
families, sick children and battered women this year before winter arrives. 
</P>
<P>
 Scissors and needles flash as quilters gather weekly in mall community rooms, 
church halls and apartment club rooms to form makeshift sewing assembly lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Between meetings, they work alone -- their living room floors covered with 
brightly colored squares of cloth, hunks of fluffy lining and yards of thick 
backing fabric. 
</P>
<P>
 They are likely to spend 20 hours sewing before the last piece of thread is 
tied off and the quilt is lovingly folded and sent off to someone they're 
unlikely to ever meet. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's OK for people like Thompson, a Los Angeles bank manager who keeps 
cloth patches handy by filing them (by their color) in CD cabinets at her home 
near the Beverly Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't get a lot of personal feedback -- we don't always get a thank you," 
she said. "But places like hospitals keep asking us for more. And that's a 
compliment, as far as I'm concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 Quilts were a necessity in pioneer times. Settlers often slept under corn 
husks or old newspapers sandwiched between stitched scraps of worn-out shirts 
and pieces of old blankets. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, quilts have evolved into an art form. And an expensive one at 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 As bedroom accessories, they can cost hundreds of dollars in stores. As wall 
decorations, they sometimes bring thousands in art galleries. 
</P>
<P>
 Quilt makers think nothing of giving theirs away, though. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a limit to how many you can put on your bed or keep as wall hangers," 
said Hanna Meottel, a retired Encino office administrator whose 50-member group 
produced 467 quilts last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids need them more than we do," said Evelyn Langford, a Westminster 
secretarial service owner who organized a quilting group that has lasted 15 
years and supplies them to babies with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 About 6,000 quilt makers are affiliated with the Southern California Council 
of Quilt Guilds -- "our blanket organization," as quilter Beverly Sutton, a Los 
Feliz school enrollment clerk, puts it. 
</P>
<P>
 Hobbyists belong to about 50 local guilds between Santa Barbara and San Diego 
and in Las Vegas. Some have as many as 400 members. 
</P>

 "Each guild I know of has philanthropy included as part of its charter," said 
Cynthia Paul, a Woodland Hills nurse who serves as the council's secretary when 
she is not sewing with three groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "My morning guild is Valley Quilt Makers. My evening one is called San 
Fernando Quilters Guild. My afternoon group is Afro-American Quilters of L.A.," 
Paul said. "Quilters are not all the same. We're very diverse." 
</P>
<P>
 The 20 members of the Los Angeles Quilt Makers Guild decide each year where 
they want their donations to go. Meeting a few weeks ago to sew 31 baby quilts, 
they voted to send them to an organization called Caring for Babies With AIDS, 
said group President Corlis Ushijima. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last 12 years, the Los Angeles guild has donated quilts to Ronald 
McDonald House, Los Angeles County Department of Children's Services, Head 
Start, individual needy families and a YWCA shelter for battered women, 
according to Ushijima -- a secretary who lives in the Wilshire district. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, homeless shelters received the first of 200 handmade quilts from 30 
members of Trinity Lutheran Church in Hawthorne. The group, working in 
conjunction with the Ortho Mattress Co., calls itself the Comforters. 
</P>
<P>
 Victims of the Northridge earthquake received quilts from the Valley-based 
Quilters for Others in January. That 50-member club has also donated quilts to 
a shelter for battered women, an Alcoholics Anonymous recovery home and to an 
organization for retarded people. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley Quilt Guild has given small quilts to local police for use in 
comforting children who have been abused or have become separated from their 
parents. Simi quilters have also auctioned quilts and donated the proceeds to a 
local free clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Selling handmade quilts as charity fund-raisers is also popular with some Los 
Angeles-area hobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
 The South Bay Quilters Guild has held shows and raffles to raise cash for a 
family center and for a shelter for homeless pregnant women. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of a Van Nuys Jewish group called Hamish Amish Quilters auctioned one 
of their bed covers at a Fourth of July party for $1,700 and contributed the 
money to an anti-nuclear weapons organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The Diabetes Quilt Guild of Los Angeles sold its members' handiwork, along 
with donated quilts from across the country, to raise about $20,000 a year or 
so ago for diabetes research. 
</P>
<P>
 But most quilters prefer to donate quilts directly to organizations that need 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Quilter Linda Graham of West Los Angeles said the 13 members of her group 
learned "we weren't that good at raising money" when they began holding 
auctions in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 So for the last decade they have donated 100 quilts a year to such places as 
hospitals, a Skid Row children's project, church-based assistance groups, an 
AIDS hospice and a shelter for babies born with AIDS, she said. This year's 
output is headed to a child care facility for babies born addicted to drugs or 
alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 Infants and toddlers at the Bienvenidos Children's Center in West Covina will 
be able to keep their quilts forever, said Lorraine Castro, the facility's 
executive director. Many of them arrive with only the clothes on their back. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an incredible gift. Quilts remind you of mommy and home. The children 
sleep with them, they take them with them when they leave," Castro said. "A 
quilt is comforting. It's something to hold on to that's really yours." 
</P>
<P>
 Although quilting conjures up images of grandmothers in rocking chairs, local 
hobbyists include a smattering of men and numerous young women. And interest 
continues to grow -- something that is a far cry from the 1950s and '60s, 
according to quilting council President Patty McCormick of Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 "It almost died out because blankets back then were so cheap," said McCormick 
-- who has been selected to serve as a consultant on an upcoming movie from 
Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment. The film is about seven woman in a 
quilting group that has lasted 35 years. 
</P>
<P>
 If quilting is a traditional craft for some, it's an up-to-date one for many. 
</P>
<P>
 Quilters gather for "meetings," not "bees," said Lillian Grodsky, who is in 
her 80s and lives in Park La Brea. "The word bee is kind of old-fashioned. 
We're modern." 
</P>
<P>
 Joanne Bloomfield agrees with that. She's a college textiles professor from 
Northridge who stitches "while I'm watching the O.J. (Simpson) case on TV." She 
watches her computer screen for quilting inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a quilting forum on CompuServe at 7 o'clock every Tuesday. It's an 
extension of conversations we have at quilting meetings," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Enthusiasts can design quilt patterns by computer if they want to, she said. 
And some new sewing machines can even be hooked up to be run by computer. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bloomfield isn't worried that automation will replace the sewing circle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quilts are personal things," she said.

PARENTS OF SUSPECTED VANDALS WHO DIED IN CRASH SUE STATE; COURTS: SUIT ALLEGES 
THAT A STRUCTURAL FLAW IN HIGHWAY CAUSED THE DEATHS. CALTRANS LAWYER SAYS THE 
ACTION BY SURVIVORS OF ALLEGED TAGGERS 'JUST DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT.' 
</P>

<P>
 The parents of six suspected graffiti vandals and a friend killed in a freeway 
accident near the City of Commerce last year have filed an $80-million suit 
against the state, saying there was a structural flaw in the highway. 
</P>
<P>
 State attorneys were sardonic about the suit, which also seeks damages from 
the suspected drunk driver who struck the pickup truck, from the owner of the 
truck, from its driver and from the manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Apparently, some of the people (who were killed) spent their time destroying 
public property, which cost the taxpayers lots of money to repair, and now 
they're asking the taxpayers for $80 million more," said Christopher Hiddleson, 
a Department of Transportation lawyer handling the state's defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "That just doesn't seem right." 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney for the parents of the dead youths, Gregory James Owen, said the 
victims' background is irrelevant to the merits of the lawsuit.  
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds like if you're labeled a tagger you get whatever you deserve," Owen 
said. "What does that have to do with the fact that they were in an awful 
accident where people died and were maimed?" 
</P>
<P>
 On July 2, 1993, nine people whose ages ranged from 14 to 20 were in a 1988 
Mitsubishi Mighty Max on their way back to the San Gabriel Valley after a night 
in Redondo Beach. Six of them were riding in the rear bay of the truck and none 
were wearing seat belts, according to accident investigators.  
</P>
<P>
 Friends and California Highway Patrol investigators said most of the 
passengers were members of a tagging crew that called itself FBI, known 
varyingly as Far Beyond Insanity, Far Beyond Imagination and Fully Brown and 
Insane. Spray paint cans were found in the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims' friends said they had not been tagging that night, and that they 
were easing out of the tagging lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 A little past midnight on the Long Beach Freeway the pickup was hit by a Chevy 
Camaro driven by Sarkis Peltekian, who police said was drunk. The pickup was 
knocked off the freeway and plummeted more than 100 feet to a railroad track 
below. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the driver of the loaned Mitsubishi, Pedro Hidalgo Jr., 20, and a friend 
in the passenger seat survived. 
</P>
<P>
 Owen said the 1988 Mighty Max has a defect that causes it to roll over. 
</P>
<P>
 He said other lawsuits have been filed by survivors of roll-over accidents, a 
claim denied by a Mitsubishi spokesman.  
</P>
<P>
 Owen said the truck rolled over the barrier at the side of the freeway after 
hitting a berm, or elevated piece of concrete at the side of the freeway that 
Owen said was in violation of California codes. Hiddleson said the alleged 
violation never existed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no berm there," he said, saying the freeway is bounded by a standard 
barrier.

REPORTS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AT DWP EMERGING; WORKPLACE: NEARLY 100 COMPLAINTS 
LODGED OVER THE LAST 2 YEARS ARE COMING TO LIGHT IN WAKE OF $1.5-MILLION 
SETTLEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 She was the new employee, and the first woman to work in the warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon she was one of the guys, trading playful punches with her four Department 
of Water and Power colleagues and withstanding a daily litany of dirty jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 But eventually it went well beyond offensive words and roughhousing and ended 
in charges of rape in the workplace. The single mother was reassigned for her 
own protection and three of the four men were discharged for sexual harassment, 
according to city documents. The fourth was suspended for 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
 This is one of nearly 100 sexual harassment cases that have occurred at the 
DWP over the last two years which have remained largely unknown to the public 
and even top city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not until this week -- when the giant utility agreed to pay a record 
$1.5-million settlement to a former employee in another case -- that the full 
extent of the problem became evident. 
</P>
<P>
 In discussing that $1.5-million settlement to Ruby P. Zilly, a DWP official 
disclosed that in the last two years, five employees have been fired and 12 
others suspended for sexual harassment. The number of cases, their severity and 
the legal cost caught some city officials by surprise and prompted calls for 
greater scrutiny of the agency, its policies and practices. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, who has been reviewing sexual harassment 
incidents and policies in the city work force, said she was unaware of the 
number of complaints and disciplinary actions at DWP until the settlement was 
disclosed. Goldberg said she will hold hearings next month to question DWP 
officials on their sexual harassment policies and attempt to determine the 
magnitude of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg says she believes that problem is extensive. "Is it an isolated 
problem?" she asked. "With 98 cases, I think not." 
</P>
<P>
 Civil Service Commission President Joe Gelman said he will also take a closer 
look at the DWP, which he already has criticized for uneven, inconsistent 
handling of such cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg and Gelman may have their work cut out for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Brenda Simpson, a 20-year DWP veteran, said many women feel intimidated by 
what she described as a pervasive macho mentality of an agency that is 76% 
male. "The mind-set is that it's men's work and that women don't belong here," 
Simpson said. 
</P>
<P>
 DWP General Manager Bill McCarley said last week's expensive settlement with 
Zilly, a former security guard, has caused the department to re-examine its 
procedures for handling sexual harassment cases and its commitment to ending 
such behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our policy is zero tolerance and that will be our management posture," 
McCarley said. "We are trying to improve accountability of all managers." He 
said the DWP will improve its monitoring of management responsiveness to 
harassment complaints and make sensitivity to these issues a part of each 
supervisor's annual evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Tito, president of the DWP commission, said he had been unaware of the 
number of sexual harassment cases and learned of the Zilly case only last 
month. At that point Tito proposed building financial incentives into their 
enforcement by charging the legal costs of any harassment cases to the 
department where the complaint originated. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Tito and McCarley cautioned that changing attitudes toward sexual 
harassment will take time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like turning an oil tanker around," Tito said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zilly's attorney said she complained repeatedly over a three-year period that 
she was being sexually harassed, but that DWP officials took no disciplinary 
until a month before she filed her lawsuit last November. Zilly alleged that 
she was subjected to a series of verbal and physical assaults, batteries and 
other harassing acts. 
</P>
<P>
 "There appears to be an attitude -- not just with rank-and-file -- but on part 
of management, that these are not incidents to be ferreted out and stopped," 
attorney Jeffrey S. Thomas said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Zilly's alleged tormentors faces termination. In the past two years, 
five employees have been fired for sexual harassment. The nature of the cases 
were all very different. In one case, an electrical engineer was discharged 
after one incident of touching a co-worker. In another, a veteran employee was 
fired for making repeated lewd comments. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the fired employees worked in a warehouse in the San Fernando Valley 
where the alleged rape occurred. The woman for several years was subjected to 
"extensive, continuous and prolonged physical and sexual harassment . . . 
including patting on the breasts, buttocks and genitalia, repeated pinching of 
the nipples, pulling on clothing so as to reveal covered areas and (suffered) 
degrading and embarrassing comments," according to a Civil Service Commission 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 A series of managers at the warehouse failed to detect the abusive behavior. 
Finally, a new supervisor witnessed a minor incident and told the victim he 
knew that was probably not an isolated event. The victim confided in the 
supervisor. Eventually, one co-worker was discharged for repeated rape, and two 
others were fired for other assaults and derogatory comments, according to city 
documents and DWP officials. A fourth was suspended for 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear whether the incident was ever referred to police. 
</P>
<P>
 In another case, the city in June paid about $300,000 in an out-of-court 
settlement to a former DWP administrator who alleged that she was harassed by 
one of her bosses and five other co-workers two years ago. The woman said that 
the supervisor spread a false rumor that she was having an affair with an 
engineer in the utility's Van Nuys office. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman's lawsuit also alleged that she became the target of teasing and 
sexual jokes and that her bosses retaliated after her initial complaint by 
reducing her job responsibilities, undermining her authority and promoting one 
of the men who allegedly harassed her. And at a DWP sexual harassment training 
session, she claimed, employees spent nearly two hours looking at photographs 
of near-naked women. Officials at the DWP disputed the charge. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 About three-fourths of the complaints at the DWP involve leering and lewd 
comments, not physical assaults, and few result in litigation. According to 
Assistant City Atty. Terry Rosales, since 1990 about six lawsuits and about a 
dozen complaints have been filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission and other outside agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the cases of Zilly and the former administrator, only one other 
lawsuit has been settled and that was for about $20,000, according to Rosales. 
</P>
<P>
 Fewer than half of the complaints filed with the EEOC and other outside 
agencies have been settled, all in the $20,000 to $25,000 range, Rosales said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some say the department has made significant strides in sexual 
harassment training over the years, DWP veteran Simpson said many women do not 
report problems until they become intolerable because they feel discipline is 
not imposed swiftly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that most women fear reporting it until gets out of hand because they 
fear that there will be retaliation instead of discipline against the abuser," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Women make up 24% of the DWP work force, which has 10,807 employees, according 
to DWP data. Among the top 153 officials and administrators, 18, or 12%, are 
women. 
</P>
<P>
 Sexual harassment is an issue of power and control that is common in 
predominantly male agencies such as the DWP and police and fire departments, 
said Paula Petrotta, executive director of the city's Commission on the Status 
of Women. 
</P>
<P>
 And within these agencies, it is departments that have traditionally been 
male-dominated, such as security, and crafts such as welding, plumbing or 
electrical work, that are prone to problems. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The DWP's security division is a case in point. 
</P>
<P>
 Security officer Zilly was not alone in her allegations against fellow 
security employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Carla D. Barboza represents another female security officer who 
alleges that DWP officials ignored repeated complaints that she was being 
harassed by four men over a two-year period. The woman went on disability leave 
in December, 1993, as a result of what she says was trauma from the constant 
abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 On several occasions, a fellow officer grabbed the woman from behind "so 
tightly that she could feel his genitals" and called her a "sweet blonde 
thing," Barboza said. 
</P>
<P>
 In another instance, Barboza said, a DWP employee told her client that "he 
wished she were a doll so he could dress her" and asked "if she cooked in the 
nude." 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly King, director of human relations for the DWP, declined to comment 
because the city is attempting to settle the case. Rosales did not comment 
either, saying that the city attorney handling the case was reassigned last 
month and that he was not familiar with the specifics. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is difficult to determine how the DWP compares with other departments in 
terms of sexual harassment because Los Angeles is only now beginning to conduct 
a citywide survey. The city strengthened its sexual harassment complaint 
procedure in September, 1992, after the issue was pushed into the spotlight by 
Judge Clarence Thomas' Supreme Court confirmation hearings a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The county also has just begun to track sexual harassment complaints. Since 
February, the county, with a work force of 86,000, has recorded 24 complaints, 
according to John Hill, the newly appointed affirmative action compliance 
officer for the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill said the DWP's figures are indicative of an organization with ingrained 
problems. "It tells me they must have some blatant cases," said Hill, who has 
worked in the affirmative action field for more than 20 years. "Five 
terminations in two years tells me that some serious training needs to be 
done." DWP at a Glance The Department of Water and Power is the nation's 
largest municipally owned utility, providing water and power to more than 3 
million Los Angeles households and businesses. Its work force, the city's 
largest, operates scores of facilities throughout several counties and even in 
other states. Here is how the agency's 10,807 employees break down: 
</P>
<P>
 * 8,165 are men, or 76% of the work force 
</P>
<P>
 * 2,642 are women, or 24% of the work force 
</P>
<P>
 * 18, or 12%, of the top 153 officials and administrators are women 
</P>
<P>
 HARASSMENT COMPLAINTS Of the 98 sexual harassment complaints in 1992 and 1993, 
the greatest number came from the divisions with the most workers and the 
highest percentage of men. All but about 20 of those complaints were made by 
women. 
</P>
<P>
 * Power system: Includes line workers, meter installers and electrical 
engineers, has 5,679 employees -- 4,691 men and 988 women. 
</P>
<P>
 Number of complaints: 44 
</P>
<P>
 * Water system: Includes security officers, truck operators and craft workers, 
has 3,415 employees -- 2,783 men and 632 women. 
</P>
<P>
 Number of complaints: 35 
</P>
<P>
 * Customer service system: Includes workers who answer telephone complaints, 
has 1,306 employees -- 572 men and 734 women. 
</P>
<P>
 Number of complaints: 11 
</P>
<P>
 * Joint systems: Includes finance and accounting systems, has 407 employees -- 
119 men and 288 women.

CITYSCAPES / SCOTT COLLINS: ON ROAD TO RUIN, TEEN-AGER GETS HELP MAKING A 
U-TURN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Anna and Jonathan act like the typical mother and teen-age son, even though 
they're not related. She nags him about the cruddy food he eats and pokes fun 
when he flirts with girls. He bums quarters for video games and asks her advice 
on getting a job. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was no surprise when they recently shared that familiar adolescent rite 
of passage, the driver's license test at the Department of Motor Vehicles. As 
Jonathan queued up with other motorists waiting to take the road test, Anna 
worried about whether he'd had enough practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time he's driven it since he stole it," she explained, 
squinting at her Jeep Cherokee. 
</P>
<P>
 After a two-year odyssey in the criminal justice system, Jonathan McDonald has 
taken a major step toward independence in the very car he stole from Anna 
Hamilton Phelan, his most recent, and certainly most trusting, victim. The 
19-year-old, who spent 18 months in a youth prison before entering a halfway 
house in February, now chalks up her intervention in his life to the grace of 
God. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Almost since the night of April 6, 1992, when McDonald swiped the Jeep from 
Phelan's Santa Monica house, Phelan, a 52-year-old screenwriter and mother of 
two grown children, has helped mentor the streetwise kid from South-Central Los 
Angeles, who had been a stranger to privilege and family for much of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Their unlikely relationship comes at a time of rising  
</P>
<P>
 concern over juvenile crime. According to FBI statistics, 44% of the people 
arrested for vehicle theft in 1992 were, like McDonald, under the age of 18. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's so much crime committed by youth these days, and (finding a solution) 
really falls in everybody's lap," Phelan said. "Jonathan's going to prison for 
however many years is really not going to solve anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy MacDonald, a supervisor at the California Youth Authority in Paso 
Robles, where McDonald had been held before his transfer to the halfway house, 
said she has never heard of another case of a victim helping a perpetrator in 
her 19 years as a corrections counselor. But she applauded the pair for their 
courage: "Hopefully this will lead to a successful parole for (McDonald). 
That's what we want." 
</P>
<P>
 Others questioned Phelan's motives at first but were eventually won over. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she's sincere," said McDonald's state parole officer, who declined to 
be identified by name. "The staff at Paso was kind of leery about what the real 
relationship was because they had never seen a victim help a prisoner before. 
But I think it's admirable. I sure wouldn't help someone who stole my car." 
</P>
<P>
 "What Anna's doing in her personal life is a little Don Quixote-ish," said a 
friend, Janet Yang, the president of Ixtlan Corp., director Oliver Stone's 
production company. "But sometimes it does take people who (seem) naive and 
idealistic to break down barriers." 
</P>
<P>
 Phelan and McDonald make a strange duo. A show business insider, she is a 
former New York stage actress who went on to write the scripts for the 
critically acclaimed films "Mask" and "Gorillas in the Mist." McDonald likes 
different fare: Danielle Steel novels, NBA basketball and the animated TV show 
"Tiny Toon Adventures." 
</P>
<P>
 He dresses in basketball high tops and baggy jeans belted low on his wiry 
frame, every now and then flashing a wide, movie star smile. Phelan, meanwhile, 
is a model of artsy understatement, garbed in an elegant black tunic and white 
socks, her blonde mane salted with a few gray strands. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's almost too nice of a person, too giving," said McDonald, describing his 
benefactor to a visitor during a pizza lunch celebrating his passing the 
driving test. Phelan paid for the meal, though she was quick to point out that 
McDonald has promised to repay her once he comes into a little money. 
</P>
<P>
 Phelan's generosity provides a rare example for McDonald. He grew up in the 
small east Texas town of Jacksonville, living with his mother after his 
parents' divorce. He got into trouble at school and at the age of 15 was sent 
to stay with his aunt, Darlean Ross, who lives in South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I went and got Jonathan, he didn't even look at me. He was like a cake 
of ice," Ross said.  
</P>
<P>
 Although the boy slowly began to trust her, Ross said, he quarreled with her 
ex-husband, who was still living with the family, and started hanging out with 
"the wrong boys." Not long after moving to Los Angeles, the teen-ager pocketed 
a screwdriver at a friend's house and used it to steal his first car. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took me an hour and a half to do it, but I took it," he said. "I gave it 
to my 'homeys,' because I didn't know what else to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan free-lanced about 50 car thefts for various chop shops around town. 
He said he netted at least $1,000 for each one and blew the money on clothes 
and guns. 
</P>
<P>
 The night of the Phelan theft, he was casing cars in Santa Monica Canyon, 
where Phelan lives with her husband, attorney Chip Post. McDonald said he 
settled on Phelan's car because he saw it had a nice cellular phone. After 
breaking the vent window and working on the steering column for a couple 
minutes, he found himself headed back to South-Central in the Jeep. Police 
arrested him later that night a few blocks from his house, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Phelan, whose as-yet unproduced screenplay about a man who spent 20 
years in California prisons had given her a keen interest in juvenile crime. 
(Phelan firmly balked at the idea of turning this story into another 
screenplay. "There are screenplays and then there is real life. The two are 
very different," she said.) 
</P>
<P>
 Using court records, she tracked down McDonald at the Youth Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "After meeting him, I knew this was a young man on the brink and extremely 
supportive of any help he could get," Phelan said. "He was extremely smart, 
funny and just needed a support network under him." 
</P>
<P>
 "When she came to see me, I thought she had some kind of death wish out for 
me," McDonald said. "She said she wanted to help me, but I thought she was 
lying." But his distrust soon evaporated: "It was in her eyes -- you know, that 
motherly, caring feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 Phelan began visiting McDonald and, using her screenplay research, put him in 
touch with Lonnie Morris, a San Quentin inmate and activist serving a life term 
for a 1977 murder. Morris wrote McDonald letters encouraging him to give up 
crime and get a job and an education. 
</P>
<P>
 "This kid started off just like I started off," Morris said in a phone 
interview from San Quentin. "He's borderline. Without a good support system, he 
could go either way. For most kids in the inner city, it's harder to get out of 
trouble than it is to get into trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Phelan said she's well-aware of the risk that Jonathan may break down and 
steal again. But if that happens, she said, "I'll feel that everything was done 
to support him. A hand was reached out and he was not willing or not capable of 
taking it. But all of us in Jonathan's circle are better off for having given 
it a shot. To do nothing is inexcusable." 
</P>
<P>
 The same day he passed his driving test, McDonald was hired as a $5-an-hour 
bag boy at a local supermarket. It's a lot less money than he made stealing 
cars, but that's OK, he said. He wants to get into the movie business someday 
and maybe help steer other troubled youths away from crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Heading back to the Jeep after lunch, Phelan asked McDonald if he still had 
the car keys. He patted his front and back pockets and appeared for a moment to 
have misplaced them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not used to getting in a car that way, are you?" Phelan joked. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald dug further down into his pocket and pulled out the keys. He smiled 
and kept walking.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: PLACENTIA / YORBA LINDA; 14 SCHOOL COMPUTER LABS GET 
$630,000 IN UPGRADES 
</P>

<P>
 State-of-the-art computer labs have been installed at 14 Placentia-Yorba Linda 
Unified School District campuses in the past three months, part of an ambitious 
project that school officials say brings many improvements for students. 
</P>
<P>
 The new computers and software, installed at a cost of $630,000, have features 
that make them superior to previous labs at the schools, said Dennis Steinwand, 
the district's education technology specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 "The old computers only produced text. Now we can use graphics, color, 
multimedia with sound, we can access CD-ROMs," Steinwand said. "We moved from 
the middle of the pack to the front with these labs." 
</P>
<P>
 At Van Buren Elementary School, students using a computer to write stories and 
reports can print them on paper that has the same wide lines as the paper they 
use to write on, an advantage for beginning readers. 
</P>
<P>
 The computers can use a variety of CD-ROMS, computer disks that contain moving 
graphics, pictures and sound. Using CD-ROMs, students can hear John F. Kennedy 
deliver a speech, listen to a piece from Mozart or hear the proper 
pronunciation of a word while they see it on the screen, Steinwand said.  
</P>
<P>
 The district used new equipment and software combined with existing computers 
from middle schools and high schools to create new labs at Golden, Glenknoll, 
Sierra Vista and Wagner elementary schools. Morse, Glenview, Fairmont and 
Woodsboro elementary schools also received existing computers, enhanced with 
new software and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 New equipment was installed at each of the districts three high schools, as 
well as Bernardo Yorba and Yorba Linda middle schools and Van Buren Elementary 
School. The district will continue to upgrade equipment and software at 
remaining schools throughout the school year. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

<P>
 A 22-year-old man was shot and killed early Friday after a dispute over a 
woman, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Just after 6:30 a.m., Faustino Sanchez Venegas of Santa Ana was shot in the 
chest outside his apartment building in the 300 block of South Oak Street, Sgt. 
Dick Faust said. 
</P>
<P>
 Venegas was placing tools in the trunk of his car at the time. He ran between 
30 feet and 50 feet to the building's front door, where he collapsed and died. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are searching for the suspected assailant, Jose Fortunato Torrez 
Vasquez, 30, who fled in an older model black-and-gray van. Before July, 1993, 
Vasquez was in prison in Mexico on a narcotics-related crime, Faust said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of shooting, Venegas was living with Francisca Pereida Soto, 32, 
who police said was Vasquez's former common-law wife. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vasquez had threatened to harm Venegas if the relationship was not 
terminated," Faust said. "He came to the apartment this morning and confronted 
Venegas." 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez is described as Latino, 6 feet, 1 inch tall, weighing between 180 and 
200 pounds, last seen dressed in black boots and camouflage fatigues. He is 
considered armed and dangerous and should not be approached, Faust said. Anyone 
with information regarding his whereabouts can contact the Santa Ana Police 
Department at (714) 834-4801 or (714) 834-4211. MARK I. PINSKY

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; DEATH ROW INMATE GETS DEC. 16 EXECUTION DATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An Orange County Superior Court judge signed a death warrant Friday for one of 
the youngest killers ever sent to California's Death Row, but authorities said 
they expect the Dec. 16 execution date to be postponed by a new round of 
federal appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 William Noguera was just 18 when he used a martial arts baton to bludgeon his 
girlfriend's mother in April, 1983, so the young couple could make off with the 
proceeds of a $25,000 life insurance policy.He was 23 at the time he was 
sentenced to death and become the second-youngest killer on the state's Death 
Row. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Robert R. Fitzgerald signed Noguera's death warrant 
Friday, 6 1/2 years after sentencing him to death in January, 1988. At the 
time, Fitzgerald called the murder particularly "cruel and vicious." 
</P>
<P>
 Noguera and his 16-year-old girlfriend, Dominique Navarro, plotted and carried 
out the murder of Jovita V. Navarro, 42, who was strangled in her La Habra home 
and suffered 14 blows to the head. 
</P>
<P>
 Trial testimony indicated the victim was trying to keep her daughter from 
dating Noguera. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominique Navarro refused to testify against her boyfriend, and was convicted 
of murder in 1984. She was sentenced to the California Youth Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Noguera's sentencing, he has exhausted his efforts to have California 
courts overturn his conviction. While no new appeals are pending, officials say 
Noguera will likely seek new reviews of his case in federal courts. 
</P>
<P>
 "In all likelihood, his execution will not take place anytime soon," said 
Deputy Atty. Gen. Susan Frierson. 
</P>
<P>
 Noguera's attorney was out of town Friday and could not be reached for 
comment. Deputy Dist. Atty. Rick King, who prosecuted Noguera, said Friday 
"this was just a horrible, vicious murder." RENE LYNCH

means "luck," First Interstate Bank is targeting Chinese American customers by 
offering checking account numbers that begin with 888, rather than the usual

Festival celebration in Pasadena, the bank even offered a group of especially

 Jean Askham wants information about the city's Redevelopment Agency in order 
to make a choice on whom she will vote for in the upcoming City Council 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates' campaign literature has been arriving in Askham's mail almost 
daily and she is confused about the biggest issue being addressed: the 
Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think redevelopment is such a complex issue and it's being distorted by 
campaign statements. So it's hard for a citizen to know whether the 
Redevelopment Agency is good or bad," said Askham, 69, a 12-year Fullerton 
resident. 
</P>
<P>
 At a City Council meeting earlier this week, Askham asked the city to put 
together a fact sheet, explaining what the agency is, how it operates and how 
its money is spent. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen candidates are running in a special October recall election and 15 
are running in the November general election. The elections have many residents 
confused, and learning how the candidates stand on issues is a difficult task, 
Askham said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fullerton Recalls Committee successfully recalled the mayor and two 
council members. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want some simple explanation about how the Redevelopment Agency works and 
how the city has used redevelopment money so I will be able to judge for myself 
whether it's good or bad," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She suggested that the city provide an information leaflet on the 
Redevelopment Agency for residents to pick up at the library. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials haven't responded to Askham's proposal, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Chris Norby said he would prefer calling a special meeting for 
residents to attend to ask questions about the agency.MIMI KO

<TEXT>
<P>
 A plan to help homeowners fix up their homes and to preserve neighborhoods was 
approved this week by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the program, money will be available for grants and low-interest 
loans, planning services manager Andrew Perea said.The program is targeted at 
low- and moderate-income households. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a plan that will help the citizens and the visual image of the city," 
Mayor John Collins said. "This will give them pride in their neighborhoods and 
their city. It would also be an incentive for them to do to other things to 
keep their property level up."  
</P>
<P>
 Total funding for the program, including federal grants and redevelopment 
money, is $1.7 million, Perea said. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifics of the plan -- who will qualify for loans and grants, and how much 
will be available per household, for example -- have yet to be worked out.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're at an age where the city is aging and a good portion of the housing 
stock is 30 years old," Perea said.DEBRA CANO

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: VALENCIA; QUAKE-DAMAGED 
CALARTS CAMPUS OFFICIALLY REOPENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Institute of the Arts officially reopened its campus Friday 
after the completion of almost $30 million in earthquake repairs.  
</P>
<P>
 Construction crews finished work in time for the beginning of the fall 
academic term last week, and a celebration was held Friday to mark the 
reopening and 25th anniversary of the art school, founded by Walt Disney. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been done in a phenomenal period of time," spokeswoman Anita Bonnell 
said. "The school has really been refinished, refurbished, and we're up and 
running."  
</P>
<P>
 In the Jan. 17 earthquake, walls and ceilings collapsed, floors buckled and 
the heating, air-conditioning and electrical systems were destroyed. During 
reconstruction, workers also had to remove asbestos while they were replacing 
ceilings.  
</P>
<P>
 The disaster displaced CalArts' 1,000 students, sending them to alternative 
classrooms and studios dispersed throughout the area, including some as far as 
Pasadena.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SOUTH-CENTRAL; BODY OF 
MAN FOUND AT MEAT PLANT IDENTIFIED AS INMATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The body of a man found in a 55-gallon steel drum at a meat rendering plant in 
South-Central was identified Friday as an escaped inmate from a state prison in 
Norco, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miguel Corrales, 47, an inmate serving a 10-year drug sentence at the 
California Rehabilitation Center, was discovered dead inside the drum Thursday 
morning by workers at the Darling Delaware Co., which recycles inedible meat 
parts and grease for use in products such as pet food. 
</P>
<P>
 According to prison officials, the drum containing meat scraps was picked up 
early Thursday from the prison's culinary facility by a refrigerated truck. 
Preliminary findings of the Riverside Sheriff's Department indicate that 
Corrales was attempting to escape from the facility. 
</P>
<P>

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: CULVER CITY; MOVIE 
TECHNICIAN PLUNGES TO HIS DEATH ON STAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A movie technician fell 80 feet to his death Friday on a Sony Pictures sound 
stage being prepared for the upcoming movie "Indian in the Cupboard," officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Tanner of Redondo Beach was riding a motorized hoist designed to lift 
scenery but not people when he fell at 9:09 a.m., said John Bogner, Sony 
Pictures' director of fire, life and safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Department Battalion Chief Neil Petzing said Tanner was in "full 
traumatic arrest" when the firefighters arrived. He was transported to Brotman 
Medical Center where he was pronounced dead, Petzing said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He decided to ride the hoist up," Bogner said. "It's strictly forbidden." It 
was unclear why Tanner fell, Bogner said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Indian in the Cupboard" is a production of Sony's Columbia Pictures and 
Paramount Pictures.

<P>
 Despite a prediction of cloudy skies, organizers of Smith's Festival of 
Ballooning over Tustin Ranch say this weekend's festivities should go on as 
scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the clouds are expected to remain, there should be no rain or winds 
that would prevent about 80 colorful hot-air balloons, 20 which are shaped like 
parrots, dragons and other animals or things, from taking to the sky at 7:30 
a.m. and 5 p.m. today and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 At 7 p.m., the Beach Boys and America perform, and on Sunday beginning at 4 
p.m., an oldies concert will feature performances by ex-Supreme Mary Wilson, 
the Grass Roots, the Turtles and Gary Puckett. Festival tickets ($15 per day, 
$5 for ages 6 to 12, free for 5 and younger) include general admission seats to 
the concerts.  
</P>
<P>
 Other daily entertainment will include local pop and jazz bands, strolling 
mimes, jugglers musicians and puppeteers. The festival will include more than 
100 exhibits, arts & crafts booths, live radio broadcasts, and promotions and 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival site is at Jamboree and Tustin Ranch roads, north off the Santa 
Ana Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Festival-goers will see temperatures in the low to mid 80s, lowering to the 
mid-60s at night (the festival closes at 10:30 p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters say winds should be fairly light at 5 to 15 m.p.h. along the 
ground to 10 to 20 m.p.h. about 1,000 feet up. NANCY HSU

 FOUNTAIN VALLEY 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor: John Collins 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 50 
</P>
<P>
 Occupation: Business broker 
</P>
<P>
 First elected: November, 1990 
</P>
<P>
 Term expires: November, 1994 
</P>
<P>
 Key issues: Collins said his priority is to provide for the safety and welfare 
of residents and he wants to continue to provide quality services while 
minimizing fees and costs to residents. He also wants to ensure public safety 
and fiscal responsibility, which he says serves as the philosophical umbrella 
in which all decisions are made. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman: Guy Carrozzo 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 62 
</P>
<P>
 Occupation: Retired school principal 
</P>
<P>
 First elected: November, 1990 
</P>
<P>
 Term expires: November, 1994 
</P>
<P>
 Key issues: Carrozzo says he wants to continue his diligence as a crime 
fighter. He also would like to see the city update its master plan, the central 
planning document that guides city growth. He wants the general plan to 
maintain the integrity of the community. Another priority is to develop more 
housing for the city's growing senior population. He also wants to upgrade the 
city's older buildings and homes to keep them from deteriorating. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman: Laurann Cook 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 45 
</P>

community volunteer 
</P>
<P>
 First elected: November, 1986 
</P>
<P>
 Term expires: November, 1994 
</P>
<P>
 Key issues: Cook wants to reduce the crime rate. She thinks Fountain Valley's 
viability is tied to attracting new tax-generating businesses to the city. She 
also wants to make sure the city government is accessible to the city's 
residents. Cook said it's important to maintain the lowest possible tax rate 
while providing quality services to residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman: George B. Scott 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 61 
</P>
<P>
 Occupation: Insurance business owner 
</P>
<P>
 First elected: September, 1969 
</P>
<P>
 Term expires: November, 1996 
</P>
<P>
 Key issues: Scott said he wants to continue to have a City Council that works 
as a team to improve the community and the quality of life for residents. Scott 
also wants to attract more businesses to the city to generate the needed 
sales-taxes to pay and keep the current level of public services. At the same 
time, he wants the city to maintain a "hometown" atmosphere to be responsive to 
residents' needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman: James D. Petrikin 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 54 
</P>
<P>
 Occupation: Chiropractor 
</P>
<P>
 First elected: November, 1988 
</P>
<P>
 Term expires: November, 1996 
</P>
<P>
 Key issues: Petrikin said he wants to reduce crime and concentrate city 
resources on youth problems to prevent gangs from forming in the city and to 
prevent youth violence. In addition, he said city government must always be 
fiscally responsible while at the same time offering residents the highest 
level of services possible without increasing taxes. Petrikin said he wants 
residents to serve on different city committees and to work with community 
groups and organizations to make the city a better place to live. He said 
maintaining a balanced city budget is essential.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; PUBLIC TO GAIN ACCESS TO MOST OF BAY CLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOLLY J. WAGNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson has signed a bill that will allow the Balboa Bay Club to stay 
on state tidelands property and undertake a $20-million to $30-million 
renovation that will give the public access to about 95% of the now-private 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The law, which Wilson signed Thursday, represents a compromise between the 
city and the State Lands Commission, under which the city will keep 95% of 
lease revenue for up to five years after a new lease is negotiated, then 90% in 
succeeding years. The balance will go into a state fund for care of the 
property and other tidelands. 
</P>
<P>
 The club, at 1221 W. Coast Highway, has occupied the property since 1948, when 
the city granted it a 50-year lease. In 1978, the state transferred the land to 
the city as a public trust, which requires public access. 
</P>
<P>
 A renovation approved by the City Council in July will open 95% of the 13-acre 
facility to the public to meet the access requirement. It will include adding a 
restaurant, ballroom, four conference rooms, a coffee shop and two bars and 
converting the 144 terrace Apartments on the west four acres to hotel rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Deteriorating portions of the original club will be redesigned and built so 
homeowners on the hillsides above Coast Highway have "view corridors." 
</P>
<P>
 Renegotiation of the club's lease, which expires in 2011, was on hold until 
the land-use hurdle was cleared. Balboa Bay Club owner Beverly Ray hopes to get 
a 50-year extension, which City Manager Kevin J. Murphy said would run from the 
close of negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Lease revenue was nearly $850,000 last year and will increase annually because 
of a stepped lease, City Atty. Robert Burnham said. Ultimately, city officials 
hope the renovated property could produce up to $2 million in annual city 
revenue, based on a percentage of rents. 
</P>
<P>
 The new law and a new lease are crucial to the renovation because lenders are 
unlikely to finance the renovation without long-term prospects. HOLLY J. WAGNER

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE; CITY ACTS TO SHORE UP COLONY COVE CLIFF 
AREA

<P>
 A $2.25-million effort to shore up unstable slopes near the devastating La 
Ventana landslide was helped along by a pair of City Council votes this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members agreed to support an application for $2 million in federal and 
state assistance, and then passed an ordinance allowing work crews to cut into 
slopes along Pacific Coast Highway at a steeper angle than allowed by city law. 
</P>
<P>
 City Engineer William Cameron said the steps were necessary if stabilization 
work is to begin by next spring on the area known as Colony Cove. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to keep this from becoming another La Ventana," he said. "We 
haven't had any failures (landslides), but it's a similar type of soil 
composition." 
</P>
<P>
 The 1993 landslide on La Ventana devastated five homes and poured more than 
40,000 tons of rubble onto Pacific Coast Highway, which is still closed.  
</P>
<P>
 The Colony Cove work is designed to prevent a similar disaster for a 
condominium complex on the cliffs, which are a few hundred yards from the La 
Ventana site. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Cameron said the Colony Cove slopes are not in imminent danger of 
slipping. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not as severe a situation as La Ventana," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a manner similar to the methods being used to shore up the La Ventana 
slide, construction workers will drill large metal rods deep into the ground 
and encase them in concrete. A wall will be built above the rods. FRANK MESSINA

 World War II brought sudden development to the bean fields of central Costa

 In 1943, the military converted 1,283 acres of mostly vacant land between 
Harbor and Newport boulevards into the Santa Ana Army Air Base.

 The base was used to train pilots, according to the book "Historic Place Names 
in Orange County." 
</P>

 After the war, the base closed and the land divided among several public

CEMETERY INVESTIGATION; SCANDAL: WILMINGTON GRAVEYARD IS PLAGUED BY CHARGES OF

<P>
 When Betty Shanklin kneels beside the grave of her father in Wilmington 
Cemetery, the anguish over his death last December is heightened by months of 
frustrating dealings with the cemetery's operators. 
</P>
<P>
 The grave of Cleophos Gordon, who died at the age of 89 after living in the 
harbor area for 50 years, remains unmarked despite the $250 Shanklin paid for a 
headstone that was supposed to be erected by May 5. Shanklin is not even sure 
that her father's body is buried legally because she still has not received a 
deed for the plots sold to her nine months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is about respect," she said. "It's taken everything out of me. My father 
worked too long and hard to say he can't have a headstone." 
</P>
<P>
 Shanklin is not the only person despairing over burials at the publicly owned, 
137-year-old Wilmington Cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department's Harbor Division is investigating 16 
complaints that a caretaker at the cemetery accepted money from grieving 
families in exchange for plots and headstones that do not exist or have not 
been delivered. 
</P>
<P>
 No charges have yet been filed against the caretaker, Je-Rome Poland, who was 
fired this summer after nearly three years at the facility, officials of the 
Wilmington Cemetery District said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Detective Robert Contreras said the case will be turned over to county 
prosecutors next month for consideration of grand theft charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Dade Albright, the cemetery district's president, said Poland was contracted 
in October, 1991, to do landscaping and handle burials at the cemetery. But he 
soon expanded his role -- without the board's knowledge -- to sell plots and 
headstones from an office at the cemetery and later from an office on Avalon 
Boulevard, Albright said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were asking questions and we started checking it out," he said. "We 
dismissed his services in July." 
</P>
<P>
 Poland, who is working in the Pomona area, said he has been in recent contact 
with the LAPD and the cemetery board. 
</P>
<P>
 "My intention is to work with the board and resolve who owns what, and to work 
with the families to resolve the matters, whatever they are, as soon as 
possible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He declined to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
 Contreras said new complaints are being received by police almost every day. 
"Some of (the victims) are out $300, some are out thousands of dollars," the 
detective said. He declined to specify how much Poland had received, but 
estimated the sum at tens of thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Cemetery Board, which oversees maintenance funds and audits the 
trusts of California's crematories and nearly 200 privately owned cemeteries, 
has no jurisdiction over the public Wilmington Cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 But the board is about to hand over to prosecutors the results of its own 
investigation into similar complaints about Poland at the Sunnyside Cemetery in 
Long Beach, according to Executive Director Raymond Giunta. Poland owned that 
cemetery for a few days in June before selling it to the state when he could 
not meet license requirements for a financial plan, Giunta said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilmington Cemetery has been at the center of controversy at least since 1991, 
when 12 families filed suits against the cemetery district, the board of 
trustees and a former caretaker, alleging improper burials. The case is 
scheduled to go to trial Oct. 24. 
</P>
<P>
 Poland was also a defendant in the civil action for allegedly reinterring 
bodies without relatives' written consent, but that part of the case was 
recently settled, according to Scott E. Schutzman, the attorney representing 11 
of the families. 
</P>
<P>
 Schutzman said Poland discovered that 190 caskets were buried only inches deep 
by the previous caretaker, so he had them reburied deeper. 
</P>
<P>
 "We settled with Je-Rome because whatever acts he did go back to the cemetery 
district," he said. "They told him what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 But Albright said the cemetery district will not accept responsibility for 
Poland's actions because he was an independent contractor. The board has filed 
its own complaint with police over the former caretaker's practices, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shanklin, who bought four plots for $1,450, said she now believes only one 
grave exists -- and laments her decision to bury her father at the cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Poland came to my home and he picked up the cashier's check. I had it made 
out to Wilmington Cemetery, but he said the check had to be to Down to Earth 
Maintenance (Poland's company)," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would never suspect that someone would be doing that to you when you're 
going through (a death)."

 History will show that the group talking today at the Huntington Library about 
the old days is an open-minded bunch. 
</P>
<P>
 They are taking note of Mexican women who helped shape the American West a 
century ago. And of gays who played a role in the California Gold Rush, Native 
Americans in Arizona who kept their culture alive against all odds and a 
religious group in New Mexico that survived hundreds of years of persecution.

 But that's to be expected when scholars, students and amateur historians from 
five states sit down to grapple with the issue of "the power of ethnic

 The two-day conference that began Friday is showcasing the work of researchers 
trying to fill in the blanks left in past history books -- and correct a few 
historical errors along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "The field of history has gotten real exciting in the last five or six years," 
acknowledged William Deverell, a history professor at UC San Diego who helped 
organize the symposium. "There are a lot of old myths that have been turned 
upside down." 
</P>
<P>
 Like the notion that the old West was a time of rugged individualism and 
personal freedom. Or that it was made into a laboratory for democracy by 
kind-hearted and fair-minded settlers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know it really wasn't that simple. There was violence, discrimination and 
imperialism. My sense is that the rugged individualists were the ones who died. 
People had to work together -- the times were severe," Deverell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Seminars continuing at 9:30 a.m. today at the San Marino landmark will examine 
the power of identity and the relationship between "insularity and endurance" 
among various ethnic groups that have inhabited the Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
 The conference will close with an afternoon discussion of the "crypto-Jews" -- 
residents of New Mexico who secretly kept Jewish traditions for hundreds of 
years after the Spanish Inquisition, according to Stanley Hordes, a history 
professor at the University of New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's sessions explored why some ethnic groups' contributions to the early 
development of the Southwest have gotten short shrift. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason may be that some historians in the late 1800s and early 1900s 
tailored their writings to the expectations of the white power structure, which 
was paying for their work, suggested Albert Hurtado, a University of Arizona 
history professor. 
</P>
<P>
 But sexism and other forms of prejudice may have sometimes been to blame as 
well, offered Susan Johnson, a history professor from the University of 
Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson told of how evolving stories about California bandit Joaquin Murrieta 
changed him from villain to victim -- and how some Mexicans' version of the 
legend put a feminist spin on it by involving Murrieta's widow at the end. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's mention of the legacy left by a pair of homosexual Forty-Niner gold 
miners raised some eyebrows among the conference audience of 75. But most 
seemed to feel that a little eye-opening is appropriate for those who read -- 
and write -- American history. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issues at work here are increasingly important," said James Brooks, a UC 
Davis graduate history student. "Just look at Proposition 187," which would 
deny many public services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Simkins, a high school social studies teacher from Phoenix, said 
recognition of issues such as ethnicity and women's rights in history is long 
overdue.  
</P>
<P>
 Some at the conference, such as UC San Diego graduate history student Delfino 
Rangel, worried that historical "revisionism" that helps some groups could end 
up hurting others. "I don't want to bring out new truths at the expense of 
somebody else," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilbur Jacobs, a retired UC Santa Barbara professor, said new ideas about 
history will always be healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a matter of being politically correct," Jacobs said. "It's a matter 
of telling the truth."

 Mac Bernd, superintendent for the Newport-Mesa Unified School District, will 
throw out the first pitch at a "strike out gang violence" softball game at 
Lions Park from noon to 5 p.m. today.  
</P>
<P>
 Who will play in the first game is not yet known, but Roy Alvarado, a gang 
counselor and event coordinator, said he will try to get in as many games as 
possible in the five hours allotted. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose is for families to play against other families. Mothers can play 
against sons, daughters can play against fathers, or sons can play against 
fathers. Or whatever kind of mix possible, Alvarado said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole idea is to get the family out on the field," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The games will be sponsored by the Todos Hermanos, a nonprofit gang prevention 
organization. Although the games are free, the group hopes to raise money from 
the tacos and cold drinks sold by Madres and Padres Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 A disc jockey will also play songs for $1 donations. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, the men who make up Todos Hermanos just wanted to play hardball 
among themselves, Alvarado said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But then we considered our age and we decided to let the women and the kids 
in on the game," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lions Park is at West 18th Street and Newport Boulevard.

 Three public meetings on the controversial proposed development of the Bolsa 
Chica wetlands are scheduled next week in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The first will be a City Council study session at 6:30 p.m. Monday in the 
council chambers, 2000 Main St. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members will discuss the revised draft environmental report on the 
proposed housing development for the lowland marshes and bluff areas of the 
wetlands. The public will also have an opportunity to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make sure that the public has an opportunity to give their input," 
Councilman Ralph Bauer said. "We want to make sure that we don't overlook 
anything and that our comments are couched in terms that reflect the desires of 
our constituency." 
</P>
<P>
 The county Planning Commission will have a public hearing at 4 p.m. Wednesday 
in the council chambers. This will be the only county Planning Commission 
hearing on the environmental impact report held in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 A third meeting will be at 7 p.m. Thursday, hosted by the Huntington Beach 
Waterways and Beaches Committee. The meeting will be at the Huntington Harbour 
Yacht Club on Warner Avenue, east of Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 A representative from the county Environmental Management Agency will discuss 
the environmental report and the effects of alternative wetland restoration 
plans on Huntington Harbour and the beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 The Koll Real Estate Group proposes to build 4,286 homes on the bluffs and 
lowlands and restore 1,100 acres of wetlands. DEBRA CANO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; GENDER STEREOTYPES IN TESTING DISCUSSED

<P>
 Public high school students in Huntington Beach, Fountain Valley and 
Westminster are doing better in college-entrance exams, and wiping out gender 
stereotypes has been one key to the success, an education official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorothy Crutcher, director of pupil personnel services for the Huntington 
Beach Union High School District, said results of college-entrance tests in 
years past had indicated that boys did better in math and girls excelled in 
verbal skills.She said test results in the high school district a decade ago 
tended to show such a gender disparity. 
</P>
<P>
 But Crutcher said that when the district launched an extensive effort to get 
more girls into math classes and more boys into verbal-skill subjects, the 
disparity on tests started leveling off. 
</P>
<P>
 That effort has done more than just improve college-entrance Scholastic 
Aptitude Test composite scores, Crutcher said. The move has also made students 
more academically enriched, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are turning out very well-rounded students," Crutcher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Crutcher spoke to the district board at its meeting Tuesday night. She 
analyzed 11 years of Scholastic Aptitude Test scores in the high school 
district. The 1994 composite test score was particularly good, she said: It was 
985, compared to a national composite of 902 and a statewide score of 895. 
</P>
<P>
 Three candidates for the school board, who were in the audience, later 
addressed the board and said the district should not be complacent about the 
rising scores. The candidates, Jim Ball, Joe Wagner and Leon McKinney, said the 
district needs to improve even more. 
</P>
<P>
 "The scores are good, but they're not that good," Ball said. "There's a lot of 
room for improvement." BILL BILLITER

 Capistrano Unified School District officials today plan to dedicate Aliso 
Niguel High School. 
</P>
<P>
 The dedication comes more than a year after the $50-million campus opened its 
doors. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of construction delays caused by rainstorms, the school was forced to 
open last fall despite being only half built. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility has been touted as a "school of the 21st Century." 
</P>
<P>
 The dedication ceremony begins at 1 p.m. in the school theater. There will 
also be tours and food and beverages in the school stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 A 6 p.m. concert will feature the Drifters and the Coasters. Tickets are $3 
for adults and $1 for children 12 and younger. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from the concert will benefit the Aliso Niguel High School 
Parent-Teacher-Student Assn. The school is at 28000 Terrace View Drive, in 
Aliso Viejo.JEFF BEAN

SEMINAR URGES THE REPORTING OF SUSPECTED CHILD ABUSE; SOCIAL SERVICES: THE 
MEDINA TORTURE CASE IS CITED AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW CRUCIAL IT IS THAT TEACHERS, 
DOCTORS ALERT AUTHORITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With Orange County's first child torture case as a backdrop, 80 teachers, 
social workers, doctors and religious leaders attended a daylong seminar Friday 
designed to dispel their fears about reporting suspected cases of child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 The seminar for people required by law to report their suspicions of child 
abuse included tours of Orangewood Children's Home and Juvenile and Family 
Court. Featured speakers included Family Court judges, social services 
officials and a deputy district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just hoping to encourage people to report cases of abuse by giving them 
a sense of how the system works," said Jeanie Ming, a pediatric nurse with the 
Social Services Agency's child abuse services team. "People want to know about 
what happens after they file a complaint." 
</P>
<P>
 The furor over Orange County's first child torture case has led to a 
heightened awareness in recent weeks of the role and legal responsibilities of 
teachers, social workers, police, doctors and others who are required by law to 
report suspected abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 According to authorities, on Sept. 7, Cynthia Medina, a 31-year-old Orange 
woman, seared her 10-year-old nephew's tongue with hot knives, then anally 
penetrated him with a baseball bat as punishment for playing with her marijuana 
cigarettes. The child's injuries were so severe that he had to undergo surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 The abuse came to the attention of authorities the next day, when Medina and 
her husband took the child to a doctor, alleging that he had fallen on the bat 
in a freak accident, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 After examining the child, the doctor faxed a child abuse complaint to the 
Orange County Child Abuse Registry. A social worker dispatched to the home 
examined the child and immediately ordered him hospitalized, according to 
social services officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some children's advocates were critical of the doctor's decision to 
send the child home with the Medinas, Deputy Dist. Atty. Charles J. Middleton 
said Friday that authorities credit action by both the doctor and the social 
worker in saving the boy's life. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking at Friday's seminar, Middleton alluded to the Medina case in 
stressing the legal responsibility of attendees to report suspicions of abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a crime committed when a case is not reported to social services," 
Middleton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lori Marshall, a pediatric nurse at Children's Hospital of Orange County, said 
that criticism of the doctor involved in the Medina case is unfair. 
</P>
<P>
 "People make assumptions that because you are medical people, you have the 
expertise to determine if something is child abuse," she said. "One of the 
things we're trying to do now is educate medical professionals. The need is 
apparent when you have a case like this that is so blatant."

RELIGION ISN'T CURBING MATERIALISM, POLL SAYS; STUDY: WORSHIP IS BEING USED TO 
SALVE CONSCIENCES, NOT TO CHALLENGE PEOPLE TO EXAMINE THEIR LIFESTYLES, SURVEY 
FINDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Four in five working Americans say selfishness and the condition of the poor 
are serious national problems. But ask them what they consider important in 
life, and the same number say having a beautiful home, a new car and other nice 
things. 
</P>
<P>
 These are among the findings of a new national study on work, money and 
religion that reveals a desire of many Americans to lead simpler, gentler 
lifestyles even as they find themselves caught in the rat race. 
</P>
<P>
 Religion does appear to help individuals lead more ethical lives in the 
marketplace, but sociologist Robert Wuthnow also found substantial evidence 
that many people are turning to churches and synagogues more to salve their 
consciences than challenge them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We live in a materialistic culture, and we want money and possessions, and 
very few people have heard a powerful voice telling them to resist those 
impulses, or how to resist those impulses," said Wuthnow, who reports the study 
findings in his new book, "God and Mammon in America," being published by the 
Free Press. 
</P>
<P>
 "The point is the clergy need to be speaking more forthrightly and boldly on 
these issues." 
</P>
<P>
 The national Gallup survey of 2,013 working adults in 1992 was part of a 
five-year project Wuthnow directed on religious and economic beliefs and 
values. The data was supplemented by more than 175 in-depth interviews with 
people in a range of jobs throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Many respondents criticized society's emphasis on pursuing material wealth. 
Ninety-two percent said the condition of the poor is a serious social problem, 
while 81% said selfishness is a serious problem. Three-quarters of the 
respondents said there is "too much emphasis on money" in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Brought down to a personal level, however, 80% said having a beautiful home, a 
new car and other nice things was absolutely essential, very important or 
fairly important to them. Three out of four respondents said wearing nice 
clothes was important. 
</P>
<P>
 And organized religion, which tends to treat money like sex when it comes to 
taboo topics in the sanctuary, has not done a good job of challenging people to 
examine their lifestyles, according to the study. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, when asked whether their choice of jobs was influenced by 
religion, 75% said no, 12% said maybe and only 10% said religious values 
definitely influenced their decision. The No. 1 reason people chose their 
present line of work: the money. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to how people allocate their treasure on Earth, Wuthnow found in 
interviews that religion is merely a therapeutic device to make people feel 
good about themselves. In their own lives, respondents reported considering 
themselves anxious about their personal needs no matter how far they were up on 
the economic ladder. One worker interviewed in the book said she earns a 
six-figure income but that it would take at least $50,000 more a year for her 
to live comfortably. 
</P>
<P>
 When religion is taken seriously, it influences people in all areas, from 
business ethics to their concern for the poor, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
 Respondents who said religion was very important to them were consistently 
less likely than respondents who said religion was not very important to have 
bent the rules in dealing with others or to take time off from work that was 
not due them. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-nine percent of weekly churchgoers said they were involved in charity 
or social service activities, compared with one-quarter of all respondents. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 7% of church members said they would be more likely to give money to a 
church that emphasizes giving money more than it does now, while 65% said they 
would be more likely to give money if the church was doing more to help the 
needy. 
</P>
<P>
 In personal interviews reported in the book, several people said their faith 
helped reinforce alternative values to the secular culture. One woman left a 
high-stakes political career to become a social worker, while other women 
sacrificed careers for a time to raise their children at home. One couple 
significantly reduced their consumer spending to help refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 "The point isn't that we are all just strapped," said Wuthnow, director of the 
Center for the Study of American Religion at Princeton University. "It's a 
matter of making moral choices of how we use our resources."

TRAGEDY BRINGS CHURCH SINGER'S MESSAGE HOME; FAITH: A BALLAD RECORDED 11 DAYS 
BEFORE KIRK LYNN DIED IN A PLANE CRASH IS TOUCHING MANY LISTENERS AND KEEPING 
HIS DREAM OF A MUSICAL MINISTRY ALIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the months before he died in a plane crash, church singer Kirk Lynn felt 
compelled to share his religion with others. 
</P>
<P>
 His pastor called him a "winsome witness" -- a devout person who was shy about 
spreading the word of God and story of Jesus Christ. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynn, 26, had been planning to devote more time to a religious music ministry 
when he and 131 others died in the Sept. 8 crash of USAir Flight 427 near 
Pittsburgh International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 But death, it seems, has not stopped his calling. 
</P>
<P>
 A tape recording of "As We Sail to Heaven's Shore," a ballad Lynn sang in 
church 11 days before the crash, is touching the hearts of relatives of Flight 
427's passengers as well as people with no connection to the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's ironic that his faith and testimony in that song are reaching more 
people in his death than he ever could have imagined," said the Rev. Michael 
Alfieri, adult ministries pastor at First Evangelical Free Church, where Lynn 
was head soloist. 
</P>
<P>
 The song tells of a journey to heaven on stormy seas, with God's hand guiding 
the way. It opens, "Storms may rise on seas unknown, while we journey toward 
our home, surely we'll learn what grace is for, as we sail to heaven's shore." 
</P>
<P>
 Lynn's performance and the lyrics by Phill McHugh have moved many to tears, 
including dozens at a small service Monday for several passengers from rural 
southwestern Pennsylvania. The tape also was played in Pittsburgh four days 
after the crash for thousands of people at an outdoor memorial service for 
Flight 427 passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 As Lynn's voice echoed off nearby buildings, his family and fellow churchgoers 
bowed their heads, just as Lynn asked them to do Aug. 28 when he sang in 
church. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wanted us to think about the song as a prayer," said his father, Glenn 
Lynn of White Oak, a Pittsburgh suburb. 
</P>
<P>
 The song is keeping volunteers busy at First Evangelical, a Protestant church 
in McKeesport near Pittsburgh. The church is giving away copies of the tape to 
more than 1,000 people who have called and written from as far away as 
Colorado, Alabama and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 USAir requested six dozen tapes of Lynn's tenor voice, accompanied by his 
mother-in-law on piano. 
</P>
<P>
 Christian bookstores in the Pittsburgh area sold out of contemporary Christian 
singer Steve Green's album "Find Us Faithful," which includes another version 
of the song. 
</P>
<P>
 When Pittsburgh radio stations went silent for 15 seconds exactly one week 
after the crash, top 40 radio station WBZZ returned to play Lynn's tape. 
Several television news reports have included the song. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Nelson wrote the music. McHugh of Nashville, Tenn., said the words came 
to him suddenly seven years ago after he left a friend at an airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've traveled a lot over the years, and I've always felt this sense of 
sadness in airports," said McHugh, 43. "There's always a lot of hurry and 
excitement and people going here and there. I know it's a cliche to say 
everyone's in a hurry and should slow down, but it's the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Lynn said his son began singing "just about before he could talk" and 
always worked hard with First Evangelical's ministers to pick just the right 
song for Sunday services. He said his son, a computer programmer for PNC 
Financial Corp., had talked about beginning his own musical ministry. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that hearing the tape at the Pittsburgh service was "uplifting." 
</P>
<P>
 "It kind of consoled us. His music always did -- any time I heard him sing. 
Wherever he went, he ministered. And he always will," the elder Lynn said. 
</P>

Drive, McKeesport, Pa. 15132

 Assemblyman Gil Ferguson, an outspoken ex-Marine lieutenant colonel and former 
Irvine Co. executive, made it official Friday by formally announcing he would 
seek the state Senate seat soon to be vacated by Marian Bergeson (R-Newport 
Beach). 
</P>
<P>
 In a news conference at his office, Ferguson, also a Newport Beach Republican, 
said he is distinctly qualified to replace Bergeson in the 35th District, one 
of the wealthiest and most staunchly Republican districts in the country, 
because of his unflinchingly conservative voting record.  
</P>
<P>
 "The issue in this campaign will be the record," said Ferguson, 71, a member 
of the state Assembly for 10 years. "The candidates on the Republican side will 
all be against taxes, against crime, against illegal aliens. But I'm the only 
one who has a record showing I have never voted for a tax bill." 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson will vacate her Senate seat in January to take over an Orange County 
supervisorial seat from Thomas F. Riley, who is retiring. A special election 
for her Senate position will be called after January. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson also took a shot at anyone who might move from another district to 
challenge him in what local politicos say will be a nasty and expensive battle. 
Ferguson is a 35-year resident of the district, which stretches from Seal Beach 
south to Laguna Beach along the coast and as far inland as parts of Buena Park 
and Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to boil down to who knows this district, who lives here and who 
has worked among the people here," Ferguson said. "I live here, not in 
Sacramento. I come home every weekend. . . . When people vote for me, they know 
who they are voting for." 
</P>
<P>
 That message was apparently aimed directly at Assemblyman Ross Johnson 
(R-Fullerton), the former Assembly minority leader who most insiders believe 
will challenge Ferguson. Johnson has been criticized for living and bringing up 
his family in Sacramento and has been accused of keeping a residence in 
Fullerton only to qualify for election. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson would also have to counter charges that he has accepted large sums of 
financial backing from oil company interests, a source of funds that could hurt 
him in this largely coastal district where many people are opposed to offshore 
oil drilling. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who has already been raising money and shopping for a home in Newport 
Beach, did not return phone calls for comment. He is running for reelection in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 Another expected challenger could be Assemblywoman Doris Allen (R-Cypress) 
whose 67th Assembly District is encompassed by Bergeson's state Senate 
district. Allen, also in the midst of a reelection campaign, acknowledged 
Friday that she is seriously considering the challenge, but won't decide until 
after November. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, I am considering it, but I'm not ready to announce at this point in 
time," Allen said, adding that it would confuse the voters to enter another 
race now. "But if I did, I would be representing the people I represent 
currently, plus more." 
</P>
<P>
 Allen took her own shot at Johnson, suggesting she doesn't want an outsider 
moving in. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the candidate "should be someone from the district, whether it's Gil 
or me or someone new from this district. I believe that makes more sense for 
our representative form of government." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson's critics say he long ago lost touch with his constituents, 
particularly women and minorities. But he counters by saying he has won every 
election he has entered by nearly 2-to-1 ratios. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I could be out of touch when I am consistently the highest 
vote-getter in the state . . . and my volunteers are 99% women," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson said it could easily take $600,000 to win this Senate seat, a 
powerful position with constituents who are major financial players in national 
Republican politics. With 230,000 registered Republicans in the district, a 
conservative Republican will be an overwhelming favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 A special election for Bergeson's Senate seat will have to be called by the 
governor in January. The election would have to take place within 90 days 
thereafter.

LOCAL ELECTIONS / LAGUNA NIGUEL CITY COUNCIL; WHO'S NOT RUNNING IS THE BIGGEST 
NEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN FRANEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What's interesting about this fall's City Council race isn't who is running. 
It's who's not running. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman James F. Krembas' decision to retire from the council surprised 
political observers here, who have watched the school administrator help lead 
the community through the incorporation effort and then guide the city through 
its early, roller-coaster years. 
</P>
<P>
 "His leadership will be missed," said Councilman Thomas W. Wilson. "Hopefully, 
he'll remain active and give us input when he deems it appropriate. I know him 
to be not a bashful person, so I'm sure he'll step up and give us some valuable 
input." 
</P>
<P>
 Krembas, who was on the Laguna Niguel Community Services District and an 
active member of the Chamber of Commerce before being elected to the council, 
explained the decision simply, saying it was a promise he made in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said that I thought it would be appropriate for me to run for only one term 
to get the city going and off the ground and provide what expertise I could," 
he said. "My wife and I have lived in the community for 17 years and (have) 
been involved (with civic affairs) virtually every one of those days. It's time 
for a break." 
</P>
<P>
 The other incumbent whose term is ending, Patricia C. Bates, 54, is seeking 
reelection. Like Krembas, she was a political fixture here long before this 
city of 52,000 -- nestled in the hills between Laguna Beach, Laguna Hills, Dana 
Point and San Juan Capistrano -- incorporated in 1989.  
</P>
<P>
 Bates said she is proud of what the city has accomplished in the four years 
she has been on the council: the building of the $3.3-million Sea Country 
Senior and Community Center, the maintenance of one of the lowest crime rates 
in the county and the privatization of many government services. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight other residents have stepped forward to try to influence how this young, 
growing city parcels out a $16.3-million budget and how it interacts with the 
county, state and surrounding city governments.  
</P>
<P>
 Several candidates -- Paul Christiansen, Eddie Rose, Linda Lindholm and 
Richard Taylor -- are involved in local politics. The other candidates -- 
Harvey Holden, Greg Cox, Sandy Miller and Mary Ann Malamut -- are relative 
newcomers to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the candidates except Richard Taylor are registered Republicans, as are 
the five council members -- Krembas, Bates, Wilson, Mark Goodman and Mayor 
Janet Godfrey. 
</P>
<P>
 Christiansen, a 43-year-old former councilman who lost a reelection bid in 
1992, has vowed to fight against development of a commercial airport on the El 
Toro Marine Corps Air Station and against higher taxes and business fees. 
</P>
<P>
 The only drama in the low-key race so far has been an argument between 
Christiansen and the city over how his occupation would be listed on the 
ballot. He wanted to be called a "taxpayer advocate." But City Clerk Juanita 
Zarilla said advocating lower taxes was not Christiansen's primary occupation, 
and that the term could mislead voters. His name will appear on the ballot with 
no designation. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose, a 56-year-old engineer, has run twice unsuccessfully for the City 
Council. He also led an unsuccessful 1990 recall effort against four council 
members, including Bates. The recall effort partially stemmed from the 
council's testing the constitutionality of a citizens' initiative to ban 
ridgeline development before placing it on the ballot. When the judge declared 
it unconstitutional, the council enacted a less-restrictive ordinance that 
protected the ridgelines from new developments, while also allowing current 
owners of ridgeline homes to remodel their homes if they wished. 
</P>
<P>
 The man who led the initiative drive, Taylor, 52, is also seeking a seat on 
the council. A retired conceptual designer, Taylor is involved in leading youth 
programs, especially Boy Scout activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindholm, 42, is a registered occupational therapist and city planning 
commissioner. As a commissioner, she approved locating a Montessori preschool 
in the Beacon Hill Commercial Center, after she initially opposed it due to 
traffic concerns. She said she changed her mind when the school decided to have 
one-way, not two-way drop-off traffic in front of the school, which she said 
would be safer.  
</P>
<P>
 Holden, 71, is a former city councilman and mayor in Walnut. After leaving 
public office, he paid a $2,000 fine to the state Fair Political Practices 
Commission for not listing as a gift $10,000 worth of free grading a developer 
did on his property while he was a councilman. He said he hopes to bring the 
perspective of seniors to the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, a 53-year-old mortgage loan consultant, said she wants to encourage 
patronage of local businesses and creation of more recreational opportunities 
for teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 Small business owner Cox, 46, said his primary reason for running is his 
strong opposition to an airport at El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 Malamut, a 35-year-old paralegal, said her focus is on safety for children 
near schools and giving kids more places to go for fun.

ORANGE COUNTY ZOO MAKES A BID TO PROVIDE HOME FOR MONROVIA BEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The curator of the Orange County Zoo has asked the county for money to create 
a home here for Samson, the pool-hopping black bear from Monrovia. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Zoo curator Forrest De Spain said he is trying to obtain funding 
from the Orange County Board of Supervisors to build a large, $100,000 exhibit 
-- complete with logs, rocks, a waterfall and a pool -- to house the now-famous 
animal. 
</P>
<P>
 Several zoos and wildlife organizations, including the Orange County Zoo -- 
which is at Irvine Regional Park in Orange -- have made serious offers to 
permanently house the 400-pound bear, Department of Fish and Game spokesman 
Jeff Weir said.  
</P>
<P>
 Samson was captured in Monrovia on Sunday and was to have been killed until he 
won a last-minute stay of execution from Gov. Pete Wilson, after the 
neighborhood in which the bear had frolicked all summer mobilized to save him. 
He is staying at a Rancho Cordova state facility until officials can find a 
permanent home. 
</P>
<P>
 Weir said the department is looking for a facility that would provide Samson 
with at least 800 square feet of space and use the bear as part of an 
educational program. The Orange County Zoo is a serious contender, he said.

FAMILY HOMELESS AFTER FIRE AT FOURPLEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A fire of suspicious origin left one family homeless Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire began about 8 p.m. on the second floor of a fourplex in the 16500 
block of Regina Circle and quickly spread to the ceiling and roof, Battalion 
Chief Duane Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
 A 14-year-old girl living in one of the four units was treated for smoke 
inhalation and taken to Huntington Beach Medical Center, according to Fire 
Department spokesman Randy Goodman. 
</P>
<P>
 It took 33 firefighters a little more than 20 minutes to control the blaze.

WORST MAY BE OVER IN LETHAL GOAT AILMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN EYERLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Officials are cautiously optimistic that the worst is over in a mysterious 
ailment that killed about 20 goats earlier this week after they had been 
grazing on a brushy hillside as part of a fire control program. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach Fire Chief Richard Dewberry said sick goats have been inoculated 
with penicillin and isolated from the rest of the herd.The animals seem to be 
responding to the medication, and no additional deaths have occurred within the 
last 24 hours, the chief said Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the results of toxicology tests are available early next week, officials 
can't be sure whether the goats were killed by a poisonous substance or a 
bacterial infection. There is also a possibility that poison could have 
weakened the animals, thus making them susceptible to an infection. 
</P>
<P>
 Dewberry said the ailment hit the herd "hard and quick" on Wednesday when the 
goats were grazing next to the fire road between Arch Beach Heights and the Top 
of the World area. A field check conducted by the Fire Department and the 
county Environmental Management Agency found that oleander was the only 
poisonous plant growing in the area where the goats had been feeding. Because 
oleander is not believed to have caused the deaths, officials are investigating 
the possibility that a poison was inadvertently disposed of in the brush, or 
intentionally placed there as a deadly bait. 
</P>
<P>
 The goats were brought to Laguna Beach in July as part of the Fire 
Department's annual fuel management program. The goats are creating about 40 
miles of firebreak in residential areas. ALAN EYERLY

WORK BEGINS ON PLAYGROUND FOR DISABLED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 City and county officials broke ground Wednesday for a new "barrier-free 
playground" designed to meet the needs of disabled children. 
</P>
<P>
 The playground at Thornton Park will include rubberized play surfaces suited 
for people in wheelchairs, as well as ramps and other innovations to permit 
disabled children to play on climbing equipment, swings and slides.The $600,000 
renovation, paid by city, county and federal grants, is expected to be 
completed by mid-1995, said Ron Ono, design manager for the recreation and 
community services agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good project. I think it's going to be received pretty well," Ono said 
after the groundbreaking ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 Later phases of the project will add camping facilities, a restroom and a 
wheelchair basketball court. The playground is projected to cost about $2.5 
million and is not expected to be completed for several years, Ono said. 
</P>
<P>
 The park is at Segerstrom Avenue and Raitt Street. JON NALICK

USAIR CRASH: NO PROBLEMS WITH RUDDER FOUND; AVIATION: TRANSPORTATION SAFETY 
BOARD IS CONTINUING ITS TESTS. ONE COMPONENT UNDER INVESTIGATION WAS MADE IN 
IRVINE. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Tests so far have found no evidence of problems with the rudder of the USAir 
Boeing 737-300 that crashed earlier this month near Pittsburgh International 
Airport, killing all 132 aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Michael Benson said testing and 
inspections being performed in Seattle and California showed no evidence of 
malfunction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything fulfilled requirements as far as I know," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The rudder components are being examined by NTSB investigators at their 
laboratories in Washington, at Boeing headquarters in Seattle and at a Parker 
Bertea plant in Irvine, where a hydraulic device that moves the rudder was 
manufactured. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker Bertea is a unit of the Cleveland-based Parker Hannifin Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings might shift the investigation's focus away from problems with a 
malfunctioning rudder as a possible cause of the Sept. 8 crash, but Benson 
emphasized that the NTSB has not yet ruled anything out.

BULLISH ON THE BEAR; INVESTORS REGAINING FAITH IN RUSSIA, ITS OFFICIALS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONNI EFRON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The frenzied flight of capital from Russia is over. Investors have already 
poured more than $2 billion into Moscow's levitating stock market. And Russia 
is now ready, willing and stable enough to absorb more foreign investment, 
Russian officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign investment in Russian securities increased by 40% each month in July 
and August and should reach $1 billion a month by the year's end, Deputy Prime 
Minister Anatoly B. Chubais said in an interview published in Friday's Izvestia 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 In the most tangible sign to date that citizens have regained confidence in 
the battered Russian economy, at least 10% of the incoming dollars are from 
Russian nationals. They had stashed their money in overseas bank accounts but 
now see greater investment opportunities back home, Chubais said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other economists say up to 50% of the incoming dollars are investments by 
Russians. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reforms have changed the fundamentals of society," said Chubais, who is also 
Russia's privatization minister. "Financial stability has been achieved. And if 
today we solve the investment problem, tomorrow everybody will be talking about 
the Russian economic miracle." 
</P>
<P>
 This burst of official happy talk comes on the eve of a summit in Washington 
between President Clinton and Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin. There Yeltsin 
is expected to pitch Russian's economic turnaround -- and plead for more 
foreign capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton intends to encourage Americans to double their investments in Russia 
and has arranged for Yeltsin to meet at the White House with three top 
executives from General Motors, Dresser Industries and U.S. West. Clinton has 
also asked Congress for a permanent end to Cold War-era trade restrictions, and 
he supports most-favored-nation status for Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, the Russian government began openly courting both Russian and 
overseas investors. 
</P>
<P>
 While Chubais touted the success of the Russian stock market, a senior adviser 
to Yeltsin talked up the government's commitment to improving the business 
climate at an American Chamber of Commerce luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
 Yevgeny G. Yasin, head of the President's Analytical Center, spoke Friday to 
an audience of more than 100 dapper Western business people in the 
American-managed Radisson Slavyanska Hotel, where Clinton stayed when he 
visited Moscow in January. The economist rattled off a list of new presidential 
decrees he said would improve the tax status of foreign investors -- and he 
urged American executives to sink their money into Russian factories, which so 
far have been left out of the investment boom. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin also announced a new plan this week to 
devote 0.5% of Russian gross domestic product to investment in private 
companies that can repay the loan in two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The state will own 20% of each of these companies and private investors -- 
including foreigners -- will own the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, economists remain skeptical that Russia will soon attract the long-term 
capital investment its ailing industrial sector desperately needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Without such capital, the Russian nationalist nightmare could come true: With 
obsolete factories bankrupted by cheaper and better imports, Russia would be 
reduced to being a Third World supplier of raw materials to the West. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Russians are extremely wary of foreign investment -- particularly the 
kind of investments that foreigners want to make, said Clifford Gaddy, an 
economist who studies Russian defense conversion at the Brookings Institution 
in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 They fear that "foreigners are going to buy up all the good stuff -- oil, gas, 
lumber, metals," Gaddy said, that "they're going to ship all that stuff out of 
Russia and use it in their own industry, and sell it back to Russia in the form 
of a Sony TV." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the new investors are pension funds and other giant institutions with 
so many billions of dollars under their management that they can afford to risk 
a tiny percentage in Russia's wildly unregulated securities markets, Gaddy 
said. And, of course, they are mainly buying shares of privatizing companies 
that have rights to oil, gas, timber, metals and other raw materials. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, they've been making a killing. The new Moscow Times Index of stock 
prices shows the market leaped 30% in the past 22 days. (The index tracks the 
over-the-counter price of 30 Russian stocks. The base of the index is the total 
market capitalization of the 30 companies on Sept. 1.) Even with a Russian 
inflation rate estimated at 6% this month, that return puts the Dow Jones to 
shame. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors must have steel stomachs. The ruble plummeted 5% against the dollar

 Figuring credit card users can't get no satisfaction, the band has put its 
name and lips-and-tongue logo on a new Visa card. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rolling Stones card, introduced by Maryland-based Chevy Chase Savings 
Bank, is the first to be linked to rock 'n' roll, said Barbara Hvasta, vice 
president for Visa."We're delighted to be affiliated with these legendary 
performers," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Legendary indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year-old band actually predates modern credit cards by a few years. 
</P>
<P>
 The card is aimed at the band's fans, who range in age from teen-agers to baby 
boomers, and it has been launched in conjunction with the Stones' worldwide 
Voodoo Lounge Tour. Users will get discounts at participating music stores and 
can earn points toward discounts on Rolling Stone merchandise.

AIRLINE CHIEF VOWS CUTS UNLESS UNIONS AGREE TO LESS; LABOR: AMERICAN CHAIRMAN 
THREATENS TO REDUCE FLEET BY 18 MORE JETS, RESULTING IN THOUSANDS OF LAYOFFS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 American Airlines will continue to shrink and lay off thousands of workers 
unless pilots and other unionized employees agree to major contract 
concessions, American Chairman Robert L. Crandall said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech to securities analysts, Crandall complained that American is 
making "negligible progress" in talks with its pilots' union on a new contract. 
American therefore plans to cut its fleet by another 18 jets, to 631 by the end 
of 1995 -- "which means, inevitably, more layoffs as well," Crandall said. 
</P>
<P>
 American, the nation's second-largest carrier, has said that about 150 workers 
are associated with each of its planes. So layoffs loom for another 2,700 
people, or 3% of the airline's 94,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 American spokesman John Hotard declined to say specifically how many jobs 
would be lost. But he said that if the carrier "gets favorable labor contracts, 
with the pilots primarily, then American Airlines can stop shrinking and start 
to grow again." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ft. Worth, Tex.-based airline, the main operating unit of AMR Corp., is 
undergoing a sweeping restructuring to bolster its profitability. Since 1992, 
the airline has shed about 5,000 jobs, grounded 93 jets and withdrawn from 25 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
 AMR -- which lost $1.3 billion from 1991 through 1993 -- posted a $146-million 
profit for the first half of this year on revenue of $7.9 billion. And despite 
its troubles, it remains one of the industry's strongest players. 
</P>
<P>
 But Crandall said American is being battered by competition from lower-cost 
rivals, which "will do serious damage" to American's yield, or average ticket 
price, in the third and fourth quarters of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 His remarks rattled investors, and AMR's stock fell $1.50 a share, to $53.125, 
in New York Stock Exchange trading. The stock traded as high as $72 early this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Crandall said American's "labor costs remain far out of line," and he 
reiterated that it needs to slash its annual labor expense by $750 million, 
including $300 million in pilot salaries and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie Hardin, an analyst with BT Securities Corp. in New York, said reducing 
the airline's size is Crandall's "only basic weapon" in trying to persuade its 
9,000 pilots and other union employees to accept the cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 But the pilots' union, the Allied Pilots Assn., is "likewise frustrated," said 
APA spokesman Gregg Overman. Crandall's demand that the pilots account for $300 
million in savings is "an ultimatum in our view," Overman said. "We wouldn't 
characterize that as negotiation at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Last November, the failure of American and its flight attendants to reach a 
new contract with concessions triggered a costly five-day strike by the 
attendants. That dispute is still before a federal arbitration panel.

DISNEY SAID TO END NBC BID, NOT CONTENT WITH 49% STAKE; ACQUISITION: THE 
WITHDRAWAL MAY AID THE POSITION OF TIME WARNER, WHICH SEEKS A MINOR STAKE TO 
AVOID REGULATORY PROBLEMS. 
</P>

<P>
 The Walt Disney Co. has ended negotiations to buy General Electric's NBC after 
only being offered a deal to acquire 49% of the network, one knowledgeable 
source said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry sources said Disney did not want to pay a premium to buy a minority 
stake in NBC but still remains interested in acquiring a network. GE values NBC 
at $5.5 billion, the sources indicated. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's decision to pass on the NBC deal at this time may enhance the 
negotiating position for Time Warner, which does want the 49% deal to avoid 
regulatory problems. Ted Turner's Turner Broadcasting System is also pursuing 
talks with NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hollywood studios -- which face a shrinking market for the TV programs 
they supply -- see the broadcast network as a secure distribution outlet for 
their shows. Time Warner owns Warner Bros., and Turner owns two independent 
production companies as well as CNN. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesmen for Disney and GE could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 GE Chairman John Welch has been firm about selling only a minority stake in 
NBC, which encompasses a television network and seven TV stations in addition 
to cable network CNBC. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you're dealing with right now in all these discussions are things that 
really look to the future," said one senior network executive. "Welch still 
believes in this business, and he wants a strategic alliance where two-plus-two 
equals nine." 
</P>
<P>
 A source close to Welch, however, said that although the hard-driving GE 
chairman would prefer a strategic alliance, he could change his mind in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until he's convinced he can't do his (49%) deal, that's all he's going to 
entertain," said the source, who also pointed out there is nothing to prohibit 
GE from putting the entire network on the market down the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Time Warner has been holding discussions with GE about acquiring a 49% stake 
in the NBC Television Network while allowing GE to retain full control of the 
seven NBC TV stations it owns in major markets such as New York, Los Angeles 
and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 But Time Warner faces rival interest from cable mogul Ted Turner, who has 
wanted to acquire a broadcast network ever since his failed 1985 hostile bid 
for CBS. Earlier this week John Malone, the chief executive of Denver cable TV 
giant Tele-Communications Inc., met with Welch on behalf of Turner to press the 
cable mogul's case. TCI is a major TBS shareholder. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner, however, is in a difficult position because Time Warner is also a 
major TBS shareholder. Time Warner might be willing to get out of Turner's way 
-- in the past it has blocked efforts by Turner to cut deals -- if it could 
swap its equity stake in TBS for one of the company's entertainment cable TV 
networks like TBS, TNT or The Cartoon Network. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney shares fell 75 cents to $39.50 on Friday, a new 1994 low. Time Warner 
lost 62.5 cents to $36.50 and Turner A shares were unchanged at $18.375. GE 
stock was off 37.5 cents to $48.75.

STATE PENSION FUND BUYS $250-MILLION STAKE IN CABLE TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California's massive public-employee pension fund has become the newest player 
in the cable-television sweepstakes by investing $250 million with Comcast 
Corp., the media giant that is buying the cable operations of Maclean Hunter 
Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
 A top official at the California Public Employee Retirement System (CalPERS) 
confirmed Friday that the $80-billion pension fund agreed to invest $250 
million in cable ventures to be chosen by Comcast. Sources said 
Philadelphia-based Comcast will put the money toward its down payment on 
Maclean Hunter's cable-TV division, which it agreed to buy in June for $1.27 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Although officials at Comcast and CalPERS would provide few details of the 
venture, sources familiar with both groups said CalPERS would get a direct 
equity stake of 40% to 49% in Maclean Hunter and that Comcast would have the 
controlling interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to be in cable, but we want Comcast to provide the expertise," said 
Charles Valdez, a CalPERS director and chairman of its investment committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal would mark CalPERS' first direct investment in a cable company and 
only its third direct equity investment. The pension fund, noted for its 
shareholder-activist role at dozens of blue-chip corporations, invests the 
retirement money of about 800,000 government workers and retirees in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Although CalPERS has already invested several million dollars in cable 
ventures, all of that money has been invested through limited partnerships in 
which the pension fund is merely a silent partner. The venture with Comcast 
would give CalPERS a big say in how Maclean Hunter is run. 
</P>
<P>
 Valdez said that if the venture with Comcast is successful, "there's a very 
good chance" the pension fund will pursue "other cable opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
 The value of cable holdings can be more volatile than more traditional 
pension-fund investments such as real estate, but a CalPERS official said cable 
still has a place in the fund's portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to balance out our portfolio and balance our risks," said Hal Brown, a 
CalPERS investment officer in Sacramento. "That's simply wise investing." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Brown noted, a $250-million investment would be less than 
one-half of 1% of the fund's assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Maclean Hunter is a diversified media company based in Toronto that is being 
purchased by Rogers Communications, Canada's largest cable operator. 
</P>
<P>
 To pay off some of its debt, Rogers agreed to sell Maclean Hunter's U.S. cable 
operations to Comcast. A Comcast spokeswoman said Friday that the purchase is 
expected to receive regulatory approval later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Maclean Hunter has about 550,000 subscribers, most of them in Michigan and on 
the East Coast. Its purchase would make Comcast the third-largest cable 
operator in the nation, with 3.5 million customers. 
</P>
<P>
 CalPERS has been trying to invest more of its money directly in targeted 
companies to diversify its portfolio and boost its return. Such "private 
equity" investments also allow the fund to bypass investment bankers and avoid 
huge fees, and provide it with more influence on how the company is run. 
</P>
<P>
 CalPERS has such investments two other companies: Enron Corp., a natural-gas 
company based in Texas, and Wright Medical, a company that manufactures 
artificial joints. 
</P>
<P>
 The investments are overseen by an alternative-investments division created 
several years ago that also has holdings in 40 limited partnerships in diverse 
areas. The division's investments account for 4% of CalPERS' huge portfolio.

CAR REPAIR DATA MUST BE SHARED WITH GARAGES; AUTOMOTIVE: WILSON SIGNS BILL 
FORCING MANUFACTURERS TO ALLOW INDEPENDENT SHOPS TO OBTAIN NEEDED TECHNOLOGY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY DELGADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Automobile manufacturers will have to share valuable repair technologies with 
independent car repair shops after Gov. Pete Wilson's approval this week of 
legislation the garages called critical to their survival. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides claimed victory in the compromise legislation. While the 
independent service stations will now have access to information that 
previously was hard to obtain, the car makers rebuffed the garages' campaign 
for the data needed to fix computer-controlled systems on late-model vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Garage operators contend that manufacturers have sought to dominate the repair 
market by steering business to their dealers, who have had access to the most 
advanced technology. But the car makers have insisted that they developed both 
the on-board computers and related repair systems and therefore had the right 
to retain them as trade secrets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We worked long and hard with the sponsors of the bill and achieved a 
compromise on the legislation," said Dave Ackerman, a lobbyist for 
Gardena-based Nissan North America. "It is definitely in the interest of the 
manufacturers to furnish the independents with the necessary information." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson signed the measure, AB 2852, into law Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This new law preserves the independent repair shop industry, saves thousands 
of jobs across the state and upholds California's commitment to clean air," 
said the bill's sponsor, Assemblywoman Martha Escutia (D-Huntington Park). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The bill enhances legislation passed earlier this year that overhauled the 
state's smog check program to comply with the federal Clean Air Act. 
</P>
<P>
 To do the emissions testing mandated by the new smog-check system, the several 
thousand independent service stations that repair more than 75% of all vehicles 
in the state claimed they needed easy access to the car makers' most up-to-date 
repair technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, independent service stations said, they would not be able to repair 
cars properly -- and would often be forced to send them to competing car 
dealerships. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to make sure that (the automobile manufacturers) did not withhold 
this information that will help us," said Ed Little, owner of Ed Little Auto 
Services in Culver City. Little wrote about 50 letters to legislators asking 
them to support the bill and persuaded several other businesses to do the same. 
"The consumer is much better off when everyone is able to repair the cars 
correctly." 
</P>
<P>
 Also supporting the bill was the Automotive Service Councils and Automotive 
Trade Organization, which together represent more than 5,000 independent 
service stations and garages in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "People would have been furious if they had to drive 25 miles down the road to 
the dealer instead of five miles to the neighborhood (garage) and then pay much 
more than what they should have," said Tom Riley, a lobbyist for the groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley said the organizations were disappointed in not receiving the computer 
reprogramming information. But Riley said it is possible the Environmental 
Protection Agency will force automobile manufacturers to provide the 
information in a rule it is expected to issue later this year.

 Interactive Network Receives Cash Infusion: Financially troubled Interactive 
Network Inc., which in August told federal regulators it was in danger of 
shutting down unless it received a further cash infusion, said it has received 
financing of about $42 million. The San Jose-based interactive TV company said 
that strategic partners Tele-Communications Inc. and NBC, plus new investors 
Motorola and Sprint, have together provided $25.25 million, of which about $24 
million is in the form of a secured, convertible loan.In addition, IN said it 
has received about $12 million from unidentified "foreign financial 
institutions" and another $5 million in convertible debt from an unidentified 
"principal supplier." IN announced on Sept. 1 that its major investors had 
agreed to infuse the company with $20 million toward its financing goal of $50 
million.

 Exstar Stock Plunges After Auditor Quits: Exstar Financial Corp.'s stock dived 
29% after its auditing firm, Coopers & Lybrand, resigned in a dispute and 
withdrew its approval of Exstar's 1993 financial statements. Exstar, a casualty 
insurer based in Solvang, Calif., saw its stock drop $2 a share Friday to close 
at $5 in Nasdaq trading.The dispute concerned Exstar's treatment of $7.9 
million in loans that the company made to TCO Insurance Services Inc., an 
affiliated underwriting manager. Exstar said Coopers & Lybrand changed its mind 
and decided that a portion of the loans should be treated as operating 
expenses, which would cause reductions in Exstar's net income and stockholders 
equity for 1993 and the first two quarters of this year.

 U.S.-Japan Trade Talks Continue: U.S. and Japanese negotiators met for a third 
day amid growing indications that the countries were close to reaching at least 
partial agreements in a contentious trade fight that has split the two for 15 
months. Officials indicated that the two sides were closing the gap in 
negotiations aimed at opening Japan's insurance market to U.S. and other 
foreign companies and expanding opportunities for U.S. telecommunications and 
medical equipment companies to compete for Japanese government contracts.Those 
deals, if they can be reached, would be the first major negotiating successes 
to result from lengthy talks under a framework accord signed by President 
Clinton in July, 1993. Officials close to the discussions stressed that the 
deals are not completed yet and that they could still come apart over the 
still-contentious issue of how to measure success.

IRS TO TEST SIMPLIFIED 1040 TAX FORM FOR USE IN 1997; PAPERWORK: SOME ATTACHED 
SHEETS WILL BE ELIMINATED. THE FORMAT CAN BE READ BY MACHINES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The IRS is developing a new, easier-to-fill-out tax form that residents of 
four states will see in 1996 and the rest of the country in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now it's called 1040T, for test. It features bigger type, more space 
between the lines and a box for every numeral. 
</P>
<P>
 It will replace the 1040A form for individual taxpayers who don't itemize 
deductions. But many taxpayers who now use the long form, 1040, will be able to 
use the 1040T, the Internal Revenue Service said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-page form (two double-sided sheets) has space for the most popular 
itemized deductions, including state taxes, mortgage interest, charitable 
donations and medical expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 It also has space for three other functions that now require a separate 
attachment: claiming the credit for child and dependent care, filing for the 
earned income credit for low-income people and listing dividend and interest 
income. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe the form is a much-improved design over the current 1040 and it 
will enhance the ability of taxpayers to complete the form correctly," said 
Sheldon D. Schwartz, IRS director of tax forms and publications. 
</P>
<P>
 The new form also should cut down on IRS errors. It will be readable by 
machines, eliminating the need to keypunch the information into the IRS 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
 "To the extent that we can process the form more accurately and more 
efficiently we expect it to have an impact on the timeliness of refunds," 
Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1040T will be tested in 1996 in Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas. If 
all goes well, it will be used nationwide in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the IRS received 60 million 1040 forms on paper and 19 million 
1040As. After the switch, the IRS anticipates 45% of taxpayers will use the 
1040T. 
</P>
<P>
 The simplest tax form, the 1040EZ, is already machine scannable and not 
involved in the redesign.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; SURGING GOLD PRICE TOUCHES $400 AN OUNCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 World commodity prices this week extended their explosive 1994 rally, led by 
gold, which attracted a new wave of speculative buying. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, key gold futures contracts touched the elusive $400-an-ounce level 
during the day for the first time since August, 1993, but eased below that 
level on profit taking at the end of the session. 
</P>
<P>
 In other markets, stock prices were marginally lower Friday and bond yields 
were little changed, awaiting next week's Federal Reserve Board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides gold, prices of silver, copper and zinc hit high spots Friday, and 
coffee, cocoa and wheat also surged. 
</P>
<P>
 Some key commodities are up 30% or more in price this year, although 
economists say the gains are just making up for part of the price declines in 
many raw materials in the late '80s and early '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prices are rising from a low base," notes Morgan Grenfell Economics in its 
latest review of the outlook for commodities. 
</P>
<P>
 The gold market has been fired higher by concern that the United States is 
vulnerable to inflation pressure as the economy grows. Gold has risen more than 
$10 since Sept. 1 on buying by cash-rich commodity funds. 
</P>
<P>
 On New York's Commodity Exchange, December gold futures closed up 60 cents at 
$399.60 an ounce Friday after rising early in the session to $400.70. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have been seeing is a bit of good old-fashioned gold fever," said a 
dealer in London. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent strong U.S. economic reports have convinced some investors that 
business activity is healthy enough to generate higher prices throughout the 
economy. Gold, as a store of value, is a traditional safe haven in times of 
rising inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 But many Wall Streeters insist that the Fed is serious about restraining the 
economy and thus inflation. This week, bond yields jumped and stock prices sank 
as economic data suggested that that Fed could raise short-term rates again, as 
early as next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Higher interest rates would normally take the wind out of gold's sails. But 
some analysts say another Fed rate hike has already been discounted by gold 
traders and that they are looking ahead to the possibility that the economy 
will fail to slow meaningfully even if the Fed acts next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, gold's rising price could backfire by slowing demand. Buying before 
Christmas by the Italian jewelry industry, the world's largest user, may be 
dampened by higher gold prices. 
</P>
<P>
 In other commodity trading Friday, copper soared 3.55 cents to $1.29 a pound 
on the Comex, the highest in more than two years. Analysts cited rising 
industrial demand and declining copper supplies. Elsewhere, zinc traded in 
London at $1,040 a ton, its highest since February. 
</P>
<P>
 Silver, meanwhile, added marginally to this week's gains, with the November 
contract up 0.5 cent to $5.72 an ounce on the Comex. 
</P>
<P>
 Crude oil posted its highest close in more than five weeks, with November 
futures up 16 cents to $17.83 a barrel on the Merc. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stock market, the Dow Jones industrial average ended 5.38 points lower 
at 3,831.75 Friday. For the week, it lost 101.60 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Declining issues led advances 1,268 to 880 on the Big Board on Friday, as 
volume shrank to 297 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 In bond trading, the yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond inched up to 7.79% 
from 7.78% on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Friday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Basic materials stocks fared well as commodity prices advanced. ASARCO, a 
producer of copper, silver, lead and zinc, jumped 1 1/8 to 33 7/8, gold miner 
American Barrick rose 1/2 to 26 3/4 and Phelps Dodge surged 2 to 64 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Paper stocks also rocketed. Georgia Pacific leaped 3 1/8 to 74 5/8, Champion 
International gained 1 3/4 to 39 3/4 and International Paper advanced 1 1/4 to 
78 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among the day's losers, auto stocks fell as investors worried about interest 
rates. Ford fell 3/8 to 26 5/8 and GM tumbled 1 5/8 to 46 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Digital Equipment gave back 2 7/8 to 25 7/8. PaineWebber downgraded the 
stock to neutral from buy, citing the shares' price. Digital's stock had 
rallied in recent sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Overseas, Frankfurt's DAX index rose 16.09 points to 2,089.12 while London's 
FTSE 100 index added 7.0 points to 3,028.2. Japanese markets were closed for a 
national holiday marking the beginning of autumn. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico's Bolsa index surged 29.01 points to 2,857.52, continuing its rally.

BORDEN AGREES TO BE ACQUIRED BY KKR; MERGER: THE FOOD AND DAIRY GIANT AND 
KOHLBERG KRAVIS ROBERTS SIGN A DEFINITIVE PACT FOR THE $2-BILLION DEAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Food and dairy giant Borden Inc., brushing off last-minute overtures from 
financier Paul Kazarian, said Friday that it has signed a definitive merger 
agreement under which it will be acquired by buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis 
Roberts & Co. for about $2 billion in stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the $14.25-a-share deal, KKR would pay for Borden with stock in food and 
tobacco firm RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., which KKR took over five years ago in 
a record $25-billion buyout. 
</P>
<P>
 "This merger is the best alternative for Borden shareholders," Borden Chairman 
Frank Tasco said. 
</P>
<P>
 Borden said, however, that its board would still be obligated to consider 
other credible offers. Kazarian has expressed an interest in the Columbus, 
Ohio-based company. 
</P>
<P>
 The KKR deal would link companies with two of the best known corporate symbols 
-- Borden's Elsie the Cow and RJR's controversial Joe Camel figure advertising 
cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone is toasting the betrothal. Borden shareholders have filed two 
class-action lawsuits in a last-ditch effort to block the merger, contending 
Borden is worth more than KKR is offering in RJR stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Some major Borden shareholders have also objected to the KKR offer, among them 
spokesmen for the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and the City of New 
York, whose pension funds own Borden stock. 
</P>
<P>
 The merger also faces a challenge by investor Kazarian and his Rhode Island 
firm, Japonica Partners. Kazarian has expressed an interest in mounting a bid 
for Borden but has not outlined financing details. 
</P>
<P>
 "Financing shouldn't be an issue," he said when asked about financial backing 
in an interview on CNBC Friday, referring to his record in previous deals. 
</P>
<P>
 Borden met on Wednesday with Kazarian, who expressed an interest in buying the 
company for $16 to $18 a share but did not make a concrete proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Borden's products range from Cracker Jack candied popcorn to Elmer's glue, 
Eagle Brand condensed milk with the famous Elsie label, Borden and Meadow Gold 
dairy products, Wise snack foods and Creamette pasta. 
</P>
<P>
 Borden has been struggling with weak earnings. In January, it launched a 
restructuring aimed at selling off weak units and turning its profits around. 
Borden posted a restated loss for 1993 of $631 million, or $4.47 a share. Its 
dairy operation alone lost $35 million in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 For KKR, the deal would be its biggest since RJR Nabisco. It also would cut 
the investment firm's holdings in food and tobacco giant RJR in half to $2 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Borden shares eased 12.5 cents to $14 on the New York Stock Exchange Friday.

 Josephthal to Take Over Blech Accounts: Josephthal, Lyon & Ross Inc. agreed to 
acquire all the customer accounts and brokers of D. Blech & Co., one day after 
the bank was forced to shut down because of a cash crunch. The move eased 
pressure on several biotechnology stocks for which Blech served as a market 
maker.Josephthal said it will begin making a market in the 57 stocks Blech 
previously covered and that it would take over the firm's stable of pending 
initial public offerings. Josephthal will take over Blech's 6,000 accounts and 
acquire its 150 brokers and its New York and Boca Raton, Fla., offices. Blech's 
inventory of biotechnology stocks was not included in the transaction, nor was 
the firm's founder, David Blech, who associates said would devote himself to 
raising venture capital for companies.

 Discover Loses Battle to Issue Visa Cards: Visa doesn't have to let 
competitors issue credit cards bearing its brand name under a decision handed 
down by a federal appeals court.The decision, issued by a three-judge panel in 
Denver, was a major blow to Dean Witter, Discover & Co., which had sued to gain 
entry into Visa's consortium of card issuers. Membership in Visa would have 
given Dean Witter access to a much larger network of customers and merchant 
locations. Dean Witter's Discover Card has a 6% share of the credit card 
market, a small position compared to Visa, which has 38%. The two companies 
have been battling in court for several years.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; CLASSIC CASH AND A LITTLE JOHNNY COME LATELY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Think of Johnny Cash's concert Thursday as a feature presentation with a 
preview of coming attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was two hours' worth of the Man in Black's business-almost-as-usual show 
with wife June Carter and the Carter Family at the Cerritos Center for the 
Performing Arts, the first of two nights at the 1,600-seat facility. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is Cash's new solo album, "American Recordings," that has given his 
career its biggest artistic and sales boost in a decade or more. The 
combination made for an unusually diverse audience, with young and old, 
Hollywood hip and Middle America sitting side by side. 
</P>
<P>
 It also spiced up what is a strong country show to begin with. The major 
difference between Thursday's show and the ones he and the Carter clan have 
been doing for years is that Cash included six of the 13 songs from the new 
album. They were performed as he recorded them: just his own acoustic guitar 
supporting that towering oak tree of a voice. 
</P>
<P>
 In the spoken "A Cowboy's Prayer" that led into "Oh, Bury Me Not," Cash neatly 
summed up his musical credo with the verse: "Let me be easy on the man that's 
down/Let me be square and generous with all/I'm careless sometimes, Lord, when 
I'm in town/But never let them say I'm mean or small." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, humility and honesty are hallmarks of the Johnny Cash songbook, 
whether it's an early song about losing a love ("I Still Miss Someone") or a 
new one about a Vietnam vet getting on with his life ("Drive On"). 
</P>
<P>
 His songs frequently sketch the lives of killers, cheats and other assorted 
sinners -- and never more consistently than on the new album. But unlike so 
many outcasts and outlaws who find their way into popular culture, Cash never 
lays the blame for their wrongs at any door but their own. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even the convicted murderer of "Folsom Prison Blues" -- the one who "shot a 
man in Reno just to watch him die" -- accepts responsibility for his action and 
feels the full weight of the regret that comes with it: "I know I had it 
coming, I know I can't be free." 
</P>
<P>
 The songs from the new album proved as riveting in concert as on record. Some 
tension, however, was dissipated by the revolving stage in the Cerritos 
Center's in-the-round configuration, which made Cash a moving visual target 
rather than the fixed center of attention.  
</P>
<P>
 This show, however, was just a preview; works from his new album should get 
the full treatment at a theater near you -- if you live near Los Angeles, that 
is -- in December or January as part of Cash's brief solo tour, according to a 
record company spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 From the first song, the autobiographical 1971 "The Man in Black," Cash 
provided a striking contrast to the lightweight country music that dominates 
the charts these days. He laid out his empathy with the luckless, the homeless, 
the loveless and otherwise downtrodden of the world. "Until things are better 
I'm the Man in Black." 
</P>
<P>
 That's the kind of song that has typified his 39-year recording career, which 
he generously surveyed during the rest of the 34-song show. He covered his '50s 
Sun Records work ("I Walk the Line," "Get Rhythm," "Big River"), duets with 
June ("Jackson," "If I Were a Carpenter") and offered a show-closing gospel set 
with the full entourage. 
</P>
<P>
 That finale included a rousing rendition of "The Fourth Man," which merged 
Cash's morality-based country with the Carter Family's rave-up gospel 
harmonizing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A 30-minute mid-show segment featured June Carter, her sister Helen and June's 
daughter Rosey, who belted a gutsy lead vocal on the Carter Family standard 
"Will the Circle Be Unbroken." The time June Carter squandered on silly 
chitchat with the audience, however, would have been better spent singing 
another song, especially if she had another up her sleeve like the poignant one 
about her days in New York studying acting. 
</P>
<P>
 Bassist David Roe and longtime Cash cohorts W. S. Holland (drums) and Bob 
Wootton (guitar) expertly supplied the stripped-to-the-bone country sound Cash 
created in the '50s with the Tennessee Two, then the Tennessee Three. 
</P>
<P>
 Keyboardist Earl Poole Ball, a legend among country piano players, usually 
stayed tastefully in the background, adding an atmospheric swell here, a 
tasteful turn there. More than once, though, he inexplicably elicited some of 
the most intrusive sounds possible from his synthesizer (such as the $49 
Casio-quality pseudo-trumpet sounds for "Ring of Fire") and frittered away a 
perfectly good three minutes tinkling his rendition of Frank Mills' 1979 
instrumental hit "Music Box Dancer." 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder it was never the Tennessee Four.

SCREENING ROOMS; THESE DIVIDERS CONTROL LIGHT AND SPACE AND CAN CREATE 
PERSONALITY, BOTH INSIDE AND OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY BRYANT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Room screens -- a centuries-old solution to dividing spaces and adding 
artistic touches -- are proving themselves to be versatile additions to modern 
homes.  
</P>
<P>
 New designs are lighter and more open, reflecting trends in architecture and 
furnishings. In addition to traditional woods, screens are being made with 
metals, sheer fabrics and just about everything else. Screens can be ornately 
decorated or simply stated, single panels or multiple ones that fold and 
unfold, huge expanses or narrow accents. 
</P>
<P>
 They can be pricey works of art or simple home-style inventions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Screens can be used in many ways," said Leon Geotz of Z Gallerie in Fashion 
Island, Newport Beach. "You can put them in front of windows instead of 
curtains, so light comes in at the top but you still have privacy. You can 
change the fabric on some screens just like slip covers to get a whole new look 
with each change in the seasons." 
</P>
<P>
 In an entry, a screen can help set a mood or direct the flow of traffic and 
air. 
</P>
<P>
 All around the house, a room divided can often do double duty.  
</P>
<P>
 Put a screen in front of the couch in the living room and you have an 
immediate mini-bedroom where a sleeping guest is visually isolated from the 
rest of the house. In the kitchen, a screen can be used to create an intimate 
dining area separate from the sink, stove and clutter of meal preparation. On 
the patio, it blocks an unwanted view. 
</P>
<P>
 The corner screen that adds a glamorous touch to a movie star's dressing room 
can do the same in less stellar settings. Or it can be used to conceal clutter, 
from computers to storage boxes to racks of clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Screens provide great storage space for people," said screen collector Jackie 
Jefferies, who has used them to create discreet storage areas in her Orange 
County home. Her holiday decorations are stored behind an antique European 
screen that extends along a wall in her dining room. She has used the screens 
to add character to every house she's lived in. That, she says, brings up 
another good point about screens: "You can always take them with you when you 
move." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if you don't need the privacy or storage, an open screen made from 
materials such as wrought iron or bamboo can visually divide space between 
rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Well-placed indoors or outdoors, a screen can be used to make space more 
interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of using screens to alter spaces is an ancient one. 
</P>
<P>
 Invented by the Chinese more than 2,000 years ago, the free-standing room 
screen was heavy and often highly decorated. The most prized lacquer screen, 
the Chinese coromandel, has incised decoration made with a very sharp knife. 
The Chinese used screens primarily to provide privacy and to control the flow 
of air, space and light within large rooms.  
</P>
<P>
 Centuries later, the Japanese developed screens that were smaller and more 
mobile. Sliding screens made from wood and heavy paper were used to separate 
rooms within a house; lightweight folding screens that established the style 
popular today were used to create privacy. The folding panels were held 
together by a flexible paper hinge that created one continuous surface that was 
an ideal canvas for artists. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 17th Century, screens began to be imported into Europe from China and 
Japan, and by the end of the century many noble houses had them. 
</P>
<P>
 The Europeans gradually developed new styles of screens using needlework, 
canvas and wood. Screens depicted pastoral life, floral arrangements and scenes 
from court, among many others. Panel sizes varied; some screens had two panels, 
others had as many as 12. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the 20th Century, artists as diverse as Man Ray, Ansel Adams and David 
Hockney have created screens. From both the Art Nouveau and the Arts and Crafts 
periods came screens with intricate wood carvings. 
</P>
<P>
 Designer and utilitarian versions are sold through home furnishings, import 
and department stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices vary widely: Rice paper and wood screens at discount stores are priced 
at less than $100; designer wood, canvas or wrought iron screens sell for 
hundreds of dollars. Antique screens or those signed by noted artists are much 
more costly. 
</P>
<P>
 For a truly personal screen, the do-it-yourself version is an option, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Plain canvas and wood screens can be purchased and then personalized. Or a 
basic screen can be constructed by connecting plain doors or frames with 
hinges, then covering them with fabrics or painting them. On solid screens, 
some people decoupage mementos like letters, post cards, special wine labels or 
menus. 
</P>
<P>
 The true screen test comes with imagination -- expressed in the screen you've 
discovered or made yourself or the way you've placed it in your home.

PESTS; SILENCING THE RAT-A-TAT-TAT OF THOSE LITTLE RODENT FEET

 Barbara doesn't want anyone to know her last name or what city her well-kept, 
20-year-old house is in. The reason? She found a rat scurrying across her patio 
one evening this summer. "It headed for the bushes, and I headed for the 
phone," she says.  
</P>
<P>
 She asked exterminators about their effectiveness, their rates and their 
trucks. "I didn't want some guy driving up to my house with a big plastic rat 
on the roof. I wanted to be discreet; this is a good neighborhood."  
</P>
<P>
 But rats and mice are truly democratic animals. They infest neighborhoods good 
and bad, rich and poor, throughout Orange County. "When they're spotted, people 
are sure they're coming from the guy next door or the flood channel nearby," 
says Gil Challet, district manager of the Orange County Vector Control 
District. "They can't believe there's a nest on their property, but that's 
often the case." 
</P>
<P>
 Vector Control is the county agency charged with keeping track of rodents and 
other pests that are potential health risks and with educating the public about 
eradication. The district conducts free surveys for homeowners, showing them 
the measures needed to prevent rodent infestation.

 Complaints about rodents to Vector Control have multiplied during the past two 
years. At the height of the drought, there was an average of 6,000 calls per 
year. But as rainfall and local vegetation have increased, the numbers have 
climbed: Last year there were approximately 11,000 calls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rodents are extremely adaptable to their environment," says Kevin O'Connor of 
Global Extermination Co. in Santa Ana. "In lean years, they'll have smaller 
litters; in years with more vegetation, they'll bear more young."  
</P>
<P>
 Coinciding with the ideal conditions for rodent populations is heightened 
public concern about a deadly strain of hantavirus, which some rodents carry 
and can transmit to humans. 
</P>
<P>
 The virus, which affects the lungs and is fatal 60% of the time, has been 
found in the saliva, urine and feces of deer mice and harvest mice. It has not 
been identified in rats and what is commonly known as the house mouse. While 
several cases of the hantavirus have been confirmed in mice trapped in Orange 
County, there have been no recorded cases here of people infected. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodents have been known through history for their ability to spread certain 
diseases. Fortunately, the diseases that can be passed from rodents to humans 
are not common, say health officials. "Bubonic plague is a possibility, typhus 
and a mild form of meningitis, but the risks are low," says Hildy Meyers, an 
epidemiologist with the county Health Care Agency. "What you mainly need to 
worry about with rats and mice are bites and if they contaminate food 
supplies." Any type of bite requires immediate medical attention. 
</P>
<P>
 The mice that are of concern for hantavirus -- deer and harvest mice -- tend 
to be found in open, chaparral areas, Challet says. "They're not like the 
typical, urbanized house mouse, which is indoors."  
</P>
<P>
 However, homeowners in areas of new construction near open fields should 
probably be more aware of controlling rodents on their property. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the rats in Orange County are the roof, or fruit, variety. Although 
they primarily feed on plants, vegetables and fruit, "They'll eat anything," 
Challet says. "If you have them in your yard, you'll often find crushed up 
snail shells." 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing them on fences or scurrying across wires may make it appear as though 
the neighborhood's being invaded, but more than likely the occupation began 
long ago. "Rats and mice are nocturnal; once you start seeing them during the 
day, that's usually a sign that the population is at a pretty good size," 
Challet says. "They generally have a main nest and a few auxiliary nests 
covering two or three properties on a block."  
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't take long to walk through your house and yard and pick out areas 
where rats and mice can thrive," Challet says. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara's rat problem was traced to an old storage shed in her back yard. 
"There were some boxes of books and magazines in one corner that were too heavy 
for me to move; they had been there for years, and that's what the rats called 
home," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Her scenario was typical of those encountered by rodent specialists. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll tend to nest indoors, out of the elements," O'Connor says. "I once 
found an old desk that was tucked away in a garage. Rats had filled up the 
drawers with dog food they had collected and stored away." 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners with cats often believe that they live with an effective rodent 
exterminator. While felines are natural hunters, they're not always successful 
against rats and mice. "They may be more effective against mice, since they're 
smaller, but cats don't always do so well with rats. Every second or third home 
probably has a cat, yet we still have a growing rat population," Challet says. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, pets are only in danger from a rodent if they're bitten, but that's 
not common because rats and mice tend to avoid larger animals such as dogs and 
cats.  
</P>
<P>
 If you do have pets, be aware that a common dinner spot for rodents is the 
half-empty pet food bowl. "Bring the bowls in at night," Challet says. 
"Otherwise you're just inviting them to your property." 
</P>
<P>
 The best way to keep rodents at bay is to eliminate as many places as possible 
where they find shelter and food. 
</P>
<P>
 Any rodents in or around the house should be trapped and removed. An 
independent exterminator or Vector Control technician can advise you on the 
best course of action in your situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping rodents out of your home and yard means putting the "S & S" method 
into action, O'Connor says. "You need to seal the outside of your home to 
prevent them from gaining entry and sanitize your yard to keep them from 
finding easy food sources." 
</P>
<P>
 If you keep garbage cans or bins outside, check the lids. "If the cover isn't 
on tight, you're basically just putting food out for them," Challet says. Pay 
special attention to composting bins, making sure the material is inaccessible 
from the outside.  
</P>
<P>
 Heavy vegetation should be thinned out, and fruit that has dropped from trees 
and ripe vegetables should be routinely picked. "If you have a severe 
infestation, you may have to pick your trees and vegetable garden clean," 
O'Connor says. "The key is to discourage them from finding any food in your 
yard."  
</P>
<P>
 Rats are known for their love of avocados, and it's been said that after 
eating them they're immune to poison. "That's just a myth," Challet says. 
"Avocado has Vitamin A, which is an antidote to anti-coagulant poisons, but 
there's not enough Vitamin A to help them, and even if there was, other poisons 
would be just as effective." 
</P>
<P>
 Preventing rodents from entering the house means carefully examining any 
possible entrances. "A rat can squeeze into a space only half-inch big," 
Challet says. "And a mouse can get into even smaller gaps. One of the best 
things to do is attach a sweep to the bottom of your garage door, creating a 
seal that keeps rats out."  
</P>
<P>
 Vents leading to a crawl space should be checked, as well as areas where pipes 
enter and exit walls. "These are often not sealed correctly during 
construction. You don't want to leave any gap for a rodent to travel through," 
O'Connor says.  
</P>
<P>
 Roof vents are vulnerable because they're harder to inspect. Make sure that 
screens are intact and that areas where the roof line comes together are 
sealed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Only about 10% of complaints to Vector Control are for rodent problems inside 
a house, although that figure climbs to about 15% during the winter, Challet 
says. "Like any mammal, when it's cold, they'll go here it's warm." 
</P>
<P>
 After a house has been sealed, indoor rats and mice are generally eradicated 
through trapping, although the techniques differ. "Mice are relatively easy to 
trap; they're curious about anything new in their area," Challet says. Rats are 
very suspicious by nature, making trapping a more involved technique.  
</P>
<P>
 "What's called 'pre-baiting' is done," Challet says. "The trap is put out with 
a bait like peanut butter, and it's left in their area for a few nights 
unsprung. After they become accustomed to it and eat from it, the trap is set." 
 
</P>
<P>
 Setting out poisons might kill a rodent, but they can lead to complications 
after the pest has died. "If it gets in behind the wall, it can be a problem 
getting it out," O'Connor says. "The exterminator finds it by the odor, which 
isn't pleasant."  
</P>
<P>
 Another unfortunate effect after a nest of rats or mice is removed from a home 
can be mites. "People will often find them after the rodents have been 
destroyed," O'Connor says. "Generally the attic or wherever the nest was is 
fumigated to kill the mites as well." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Ridding Orange County of rodent problems may be too idealistic, but the Vector 
Control District says that by educating homeowners about rats and mice, the 
problem can be lessened.  
</P>
<P>
 "The homeowner really has to be determined to keep them out," Challet says. 
"But first, they probably have to accept that they're not coming from the guy 
across the fence." Ground Covers With Bad Taste 
</P>
<P>
 If you want to attract rats, plant Algerian ivy -- the familiar, large-leaf 
variety. Rats not only love it as shelter but as food. It also harbors snails, 
another rat delicacy. 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't want to attract rats, plant these ground covers instead: 
</P>
<P>
 Bronze ajuga (Ajuga reptans atropurpurea) -- Bronze-colored leaves, blue 
flowers, two to four inches tall, hardy, sun or light shade. 
</P>
<P>
 Giant ajuga (Ajuga crispa) -- Large, very hardy, metallic-colored leaves, blue 
flowers, up to nine inches tall, sun or shade. 
</P>
<P>
 Chamomile (Anthemis nobilis) -- Turf up to six inches tall, can be mowed, good 
around stepping stones or walkways, pleasant fragrance, sun only. 
</P>
<P>
 Creeping speedwell (Veronica repens) -- Dense, green leaves with blue flowers, 
hardy, up to six inches tall, sun or light shade. 
</P>
<P>
 Creeping thyme (Thymus serphyllum) -- Small, light-green leaves with lavender, 
white or pink flowers, up to four inches tall, sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Dichondra (Dichondra repens) -- Usually a lawn plant, can reach three inches 
in height and withstand moderate foot traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Germander (Teucrium chamaedrys) -- Bright-green foliage, resembles mint, 
spreads rapidly, lavender flowers, up to 10 inches tall, sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldmoss stonecrop (Sedum acre) -- Hardy, succulent evergreen, sun or shade, 
three inches tall. 
</P>
<P>
 Hahns ivy (Hedera helix) -- Good for erosion control, sun or shade, up to a 
foot tall.

 TELLTALE SIGNS OF RATS: If you've seen one, you've got at least that many. 
Half-eaten fruit on the tree or ground; empty snail shells; droppings along 
fence tops, air conditioners, water heaters or furnaces, and signs of gnawing 
are all evidence of rodent problems.

 Jeffrey Manpearl's Ferroglyphs are not your ordinary stick figures. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're actually a crazy interpretation of myself," said Manpearl, 29, of the 
steel figures, which he uses to adorn everything from candleholders to tables, 
from mirrors to security gates. "I'm such a stress-monger; I try to make my 
figures like happy people who don't have a care in the world."  
</P>
<P>
 There is no hidden meaning behind his work, he says; he just wants people to 
look at it and like it. 
</P>
<P>
 Manpearl, who has a studio in Rancho Dominguez, took his first 
welding/sculpting class at UC Berkeley in 1986. To make the figures and his 
other home and garden furnishings, he works with a mild steel plate, which cuts 
with a plasma torch. 
</P>
<P>
 He usually finishes off the items by polishing and painting them with a clear 
acrylic. If a client desires a rusty patina, he'll leave the pieces in their 
natural state. 
</P>
<P>
 Manpearl's figure collection numbers more than 50, the most popular being a 2 
1/2-foot-tall ballerina set on a base. 
</P>
<P>
 Also available are objects such as hearts, stars and strings of ivy that can 
be put on switch plates, napkin rings, picture frames and bookends. 
</P>
<P>
 Among his larger works are a 5-foot-6 sax player (about $550) and a security 
gate (about $1,000) featuring a cloud and sun scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of his pieces are available at the Laguna Museum of Art at South Coast 
Plaza or by calling Manpearl during business hours at (310) 632-9867. Fowl Play

 If rotisserie-cooked chicken is your passion, then the vertical poultry 
roasters by Spanek Inc. of Saratoga, Calif., are just the ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 The roasters, made of tempered steel, cook poultry up to 50% faster and help 
keep the meat juicy and flavorful. 
</P>
<P>
 The vertical position bastes the poultry while allowing the fat to drain away, 
a boon for those looking for a low-fat cooking method. 
</P>
<P>
 You simply place the bird on the rack, then set the rack into a shallow baking 
pan with a little water, which keeps the draining fat from spattering all over 
the oven. 
</P>
<P>
 The designers of the roasters are the parents of company owner Denis Spanek, a 
marketing specialist. His parents devised the roasters about 20 years ago, and 
the popularity of rotisserie-cooked chicken has renewed interest in them. 
</P>
<P>
 Three sizes are available -- a turkey rack (about $25) that is 9 3/4 inches 
tall, Cornish hen racks (about $17, sold as a set of two) that are 5 1/2 inches 
tall and one sized for chicken and duck (about $19) that is 7 3/4 inches tall. 
Recipes are included. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spanek racks are sold through Chef's Catalog, (800) 338-3232, and at 
gourmet kitchen stores throughout Orange County. Tall Tales

 Mariann McDougall's "A Pinch to Grow an Inch Growth Chart" makes it 
unnecessary to record your child's growth with marks on the garage wall or the 
kitchen door -- even if your child is 6-foot-2. 
</P>
<P>
 McDougall's growth charts (about $10 each plus shipping and handling) are made 
of a durable vinyl and can move with you. They easily roll up and are also 
colorable and erasable. 
</P>
<P>
 McDougall, of Mission Viejo, has two sons, both over six feet, and seven 
grandchildren. She decided to create her own growth chart with some help from 
her friend, illustrator Chris Naves, so she could chart her sons' growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most charts on the market only go up to 5-foot-6; mine measures up to 
6-foot-2," said McDougall, who began manufacturing her product last October. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a nice keepsake that they can take with them when they leave home." 
</P>
<P>
 *To order the chart, call (714) 455-9230 or write to 2M Creations, Box 
6080-313, Mission Viejo, CA 92691.

ESCORTS HELP FIND HIGH POINT'S BEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MAYER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shoppers searching for bargain-priced furniture here can hire professional 
guides to lead them through the city's maze of warehouses and retail stores. 
</P>
<P>
 High Point, just a few minutes outside Greensboro, is also known as 
Furnitureland USA and annually attracts about 75,000 people who come just to 
buy furniture, according to Gary Smith, executive director of the city's 
convention and visitor's bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Though shoppers find many wholesale furniture showrooms that sell only to "the 
trade," consumers are welcome at about 60 retail outlets, ranging from 
bare-bones warehouses stocking mainly samples and discontinued items to 
full-service stores with fully-decorated model rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 All this can add up to a great buy, or to great confusion. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for weary shoppers, several new ventures provide escorts who know 
the ropes. While the tours differ somewhat, each will custom-tailor an 
itinerary to the client's wishes and will provide entree into a few of the 
showrooms normally open only to retailers and decorators. 
</P>
<P>
 Gail Humphrey, owner of Furniture Safari, offers a two-day shopping tour of up 
to 10 outlets for up to four people at a time. Offered on Fridays and 
Saturdays, the tour costs $250 a person and includes lunch, snacks and local 
transportation by van. 
</P>
<P>
 On Fridays, the group visits several different types of outlets for an 
overview. The next day they get down to serious buying, either returning to 
places visited the day before or moving on to new stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Priscilla Vickrey, owner of Interiors by Priscilla and a flight attendant 
based in Burlington, N.C., escorts clients to selected wholesale showrooms in 
High Point, including high-end ones at Market Square and Hamilton Square. 
</P>
<P>
 Vickrey charges $125 per day for the tour, local transportation, lunch and a 
ride to and from the Greensboro airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the client arrives, she discusses what they want and makes showroom 
appointments based on individual needs. Clients purchase items through her for 
10% above the wholesale price. To keep things manageable, she suggests no more 
than three go together on a tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Shopping guide Chris Morris charges $25 an hour or $200 for an eight-hour day 
plus 10% of purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who prefer to go it alone, free help is available from the 
convention and visitors bureau, which stocks free copies of the "Central North 
Carolina Home Furnishings Guide" from Carolina Publications Inc. The 64-page 
booklet includes maps and advertisements for about 30 retail outlets. Because 
some advertisements list the furniture brands carried, the guide can be used to 
plan an itinerary. 
</P>
<P>
 The visitors bureau also carries free brochures published by some stores, 
maintains a list of all the area retailers and will provide a free map and 
directions. 
</P>
<P>
 The bureau also will share information about any sales. These occur especially 
right before and after wholesale furniture markets in April and October. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it worth it to come to High Point to buy furniture? Retailers claim 
shoppers save at least 40%. Those who find a decent floor sample or 
discontinued item may save more, according to Humphrey. 
</P>
<P>
 Delivery will cost extra, depending on distance and weight. To ship a typical 
300-pound sofa to Atlanta, for example, would cost about $100, one retailer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shopping in High Point is not necessarily for everyone," Humphrey says. 
"Unless you are actually ready to buy furniture, it really doesn't make sense 
to come."

KITCHENS; WHAT'S COOKING? IT'S 19TH-CENTURY UTENSILS, ACCORDING TO COLLECTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Vintage kitchenware -- from jelly molds and rolling pins to cher ry pitters 
and butter churns -- constitutes one of the hottest fields in antiques. 
</P>
<P>
 These collectibles owe their popularity to their availability and a nostalgic 
desire to personalize modern kitchens. 
</P>
<P>
 Kitchenware collectors tend to fall into two categories. At the grass-roots 
level there are casual collectors more concerned with the look of a gadget than 
with its patent date, manufacturer or problems posed by reproductions. 
</P>
<P>
 Serious collectors can distinguish an 1890 Griswold muffin pan from one 
manufactured 50 years later. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately there are enough canister sets and cookie cutters around to 
satisfy everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Many collections begin with items found in a relative's basement or garage. 
Some collectors search for unusual examples of a particular device, while 
others try to duplicate a typical 19th-Century kitchen, seeking one example of 
each of the most popular utensils. 
</P>
<P>
 Advanced collectors often will specialize in a particular device or 
manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
 As prices for the rarest objects have risen, so have the number of 
reproductions. Many have been commissioned from foreign factories using 
inexpensive labor. Others have remained in production to fill a demand by rural 
families for non-electric utensils. 
</P>
<P>
 As a rule, the higher the price, the more closely an item should be 
scrutinized. 
</P>
<P>
 Old cast iron is almost always heavier, darker and smoother than new cast 
iron, which has a grayish color and a grainy texture. All antiques should 
exhibit ample evidence of wear. 
</P>
<P>
 While nearly every item used in 19th-Century kitchens has a collector, certain 
items have attracted large followings. 
</P>
<P>
 Cast-iron hollowware made by the Griswold Manufacturing Co., of Erie, Pa., 
dates to the firm's beginnings in 1884. For several decades, Griswold 
manufactured a high-quality line of baking pans inscribed with either the word 
"Griswold" or "Erie" or a three-digit pattern number. 
</P>
<P>
 The apple parer has long had the most collectors as well as a newsletter 
published by the International Society of Apple Parer Enthusiasts. Early 
19th-Century models are priced between $150 and $200, while the mass-produced 
cast-iron varieties from the late 1800s are more apt to be priced in the 
$40-$80 range. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the apple parer, the earliest surviving cherry pitters were largely wood 
and were either made by hand or were crudely produced in small quantities. 
Later models incorporated cast-iron parts and, by the end of the 19th Century, 
could be adjusted to accommodate cherries of various sizes. A desire for 
increased speed and efficiency inspired inventors to dream up dozens of unique 
models, many of which remain very affordable, priced in the $30-$100 range. 
</P>
<P>
 Churns were made from wood, metal, clay or glass and ranged in size from 
free-standing floor models to tabletop versions. Among the most popular models 
today are the hand-cranked glass churns with metal gears and wooden or metal 
paddles. 
</P>
<P>
 The best known manufacturer of glass churns was the Dazey Churn & 
Manufacturing Co. A rare model may run $500, but $50-$150 is a more realistic 
range for most examples. 
</P>
<P>
 No collection of kitchenware would be complete without a mixing bowl. A 
growing number of collectors find mixing bowls and rolling pins adorned with 
advertising slogans the most desirable. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't be fooled by patent dates on kitchenware. They tell the date after which 
the item may have been manufactured -- the actual date of an object's 
manufacture may be years, even decades, later than the patent indicates.

SAFETY; FIGHT FIRE WITH A HOME READINESS PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN CIRILLO, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Planning and practicing a home emergency fire prevention and escape plan can 
save your life, because most deaths from fire happen in the home when victims 
are sleeping, according to the National Fire Protection Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Statistics show that 78% of deaths from fire occur in the home, and most of 
these fatal fires occur between 2 and 4 a.m., the nonprofit organization said. 
</P>
<P>
 To create your personal escape plan, fire officials say: 
</P>
<P>
 * Install smoke detectors on every level, outside the bedroom, near the 
kitchen and garage. Keep them clean and dust-free. Check batteries and smoke 
sensors monthly. (Some fire departments say weekly.) Replace batteries yearly 
and detectors every 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 * Draw a floor plan of all levels of your home with normal and emergency 
exits, including two exits from each bedroom. Designate a safe meeting place 
outside and someone to call 911 from a neighbor's home or to rescue small 
children from outside the building if inside entrances are blocked. 
</P>
<P>
 * Practice the plan, including crawling out with eyes closed (heavy smoke 
impairs breathing and sight; staying close to the floor increases chances of 
escape). If need, practice using escape ladders. 
</P>
<P>
 * Small children unable to escape can learn to open their windows and wave an 
article of clothing to attract attention. Instruct them to wait at the window 
until someone comes and never hide from the fire. Discuss with a fire marshal 
whether an escape ladder would be appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sleep with doors closed. If children are frightened, parents can close doors 
after the children fall asleep and use a room monitor to hear them in the 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 * If awakened by a smoke detector or a fire, instruct family members to feel 
the door for heat and check air at bottom. If you don't smell smoke and the air 
is cool, kneel and open the door slowly, turning your face away from the 
opening. If smoke is present or the door is hot, use another exit. 
</P>
<P>
 * Purchase an A-B-C-rated fire extinguisher and learn how to use it by 
remembering the word PASS. Pull the pin, Aim the extinguisher, Squeeze or press 
the handle, Sweep side to side at the base of the fire. (The rating is based on 
the fire. A is a wood or paper fire; B is caused by flammable liquids, C is an 
electrical fire.) 
</P>
<P>
 Educators warn parents not to frighten children about fires. Reassure them 
that emergency planning is a way of being prepared and does not mean a fire 
will occur.

HOUSECLEANING; COME TO THINK OF IT, WHAT BETTER PLACE TO COME CLEAN THAN THE 
BATH? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Making your bathtub or shower sparkling clean need not be a chore if you know 
the right steps to follow. Regular cleaning once a week usually wins at least 
half the battle. Here are some tips to help you achieve complete victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The best time to clean a tub or shower is right after using it, when steam has 
loosened the dirt. Before you exit, just wipe off the damp surfaces with a 
towel. If you are in a hurry and must set aside another time to clean the 
bathroom, run the shower on hot for a minute beforehand, then open the shower 
curtain or tub door to help loosen dirt on other bathroom surfaces. Be sure to 
close the curtain or door eventually, so it can air-dry. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiping tub and shower surfaces while they are still wet is important if you 
live in an area where water is "hard" (contains minerals). Commercial cleaners 
applied with a sponge or damp cloth will remove hard-water scale and film. For 
a homemade cleaner, try white vinegar, undiluted or mixed with up to four parts 
warm water. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid bathtub rings, don't use oily bath preparations. If a ring does form, 
wipe it off with undiluted ammonia (wear rubber gloves) or a wet sponge 
generously sprinkled with baking soda. For stubborn rings, wipe with white 
vinegar or automatic dishwashing detergent, then rinse. 
</P>
<P>
 Wipe mildewed areas with a cloth dipped in household bleach. Again, wear 
rubber gloves. Never mix any combination of bleach, ammonia and commercial 
cleaners; a toxic gas may result. To reduce and often eliminate mildew, 
increase ventilation as much as possible by installing an exhaust fan (or by 
increasing the size of the present fan) and opening doors and windows soon 
after bathing or showering. Extend shower curtains so they dry thoroughly and 
leave shower doors ajar so that air can circulate inside the enclosure. 
</P>
<P>
 Clean stained porcelain surfaces with a commercial bathroom cleaner containing 
mild abrasives or by applying a paste of cream of tartar and hydrogen peroxide. 
Avoid cleaners with harsh abrasives; when used repeatedly they can mar smooth 
finishes. Spread the paste over the stain and scrub lightly; let the paste dry 
and then wipe or rinse it off. To shine chrome fixtures, wipe with rubbing 
alcohol or a damp cloth dipped in baking soda. 
</P>
<P>
 To clean a fiberglass tub, use a water conditioner for dishwashers or a 
commercial bathroom cleaner containing EDTA (ethylene diamine tetra acetate). 
</P>
<P>
 Wiping with bleach, vinegar or alcohol will clean the caulk around bathtubs. 
However, cracked caulk must be replaced. First pry out the old caulk with an 
ice pick or screwdriver and clean away any residue by wiping with mineral 
spirits. Attach masking tape to the tub and wall on both sides of the gap, 
leaving a space about half an inch wide; then fill the tub with water to expand 
the gap fully. 
</P>
<P>
 Slice the nozzle on a tube of tub-sealing caulk at an angle of about 45 
degrees to produce an opening about a quarter-inch wide. Starting at a corner, 
place the nozzle over the seam between the tub and wall and then push or pull 
the tube while squeezing it to force caulk into the gap. Apply caulk at an even 
rate. When finished, smooth the surface with a lightly soaped finger so that 
caulk extends onto both strips of tape. Remove the tape carefully after the 
caulk has hardened overnight. Drain the tub.

DECOR; ART OF THE WOOD FLOOR: INLAYS AND BORDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MAYER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The floor in the foyer in the Fairfield, Conn., home of Susan Hankins and Bob 
Gulash is every bit as complex as a fine old tapestry. The difference is, it's 
wood. 
</P>
<P>
 The Renaissance-style inlay has a double image of a lion (Hankins' birth sign) 
and a falcon (her longtime interest). The design is further embellished with a 
fleur-de-lis surrounded by Florentine scrollwork. It is custom-made of nine 
species of wood through an ancient craft known as marquetry. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodworker Eugene Klotz of Renaissance Floor Inlays in San Francisco used 
strips of two varieties of American walnut, birdseye maple and pearwood, 
African padauk, wenge and avodire, Brazilian cherry and Australian lacewood to 
create the 4-by-5-foot inlaid panel. The panel then was shipped from San 
Francisco and installed by a Connecticut contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 Hankins contacted Klotz after seeing an example of his work in a flooring 
trade publication. Once she chose the motifs, the two collaborated on the final 
design via telephone and mail. 
</P>
<P>
 The design won an award this year from the National Wood Flooring Assn. and is 
an example of a national trend toward inlays and inserts to dress up wood 
floors. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the award-winning residential floors in the annual competition are 
either custom borders or medallions, according to Bonnie Holmes, executive 
secretary of the trade group in Memphis, Tenn. Woods of various color and grain 
in combination with materials such as stone or ceramic tile offer an almost 
unlimited number of patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all of the patterns invoke the past. Another 1994 winner, Jim Caroll of 
Buffalo Hard Wood Floor Center in Buffalo, N.Y., bordered a pale birdseye maple 
floor with slender stripes of black wenge. The custom border in the dining area 
of a Buffalo home surrounds the dining table and chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very rarely would we exactly repeat a design," Caroll said. "People may see 
what we have done in other homes in our showroom samples, but they want a floor 
that is personalized to their home." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides borders, other popular motifs include circular inlays such as a 
compass rose, six-pointed star, initials and insignias such as an eagle or a 
buffalo head. The dining room is the room most often selected for a border, 
followed by the foyer and the den. 
</P>
<P>
 "Men often want to go all-out in their den with a medallion or an inlay," 
Caroll said. "We have done college insignias, and a friend of mine installed a 
floor with the logo of the Portland Trail Blazers." 
</P>
<P>
 Designing and installing a custom wood inlay or border should be left to 
specialists. It is important to select woods that react to humidity and 
temperature changes more or less at the same rate. Otherwise, chaos will reign 
as the woods expand and contract with the weather. 
</P>
<P>
 There also are various methods of installation, depending on climate. The more 
complex the pattern, the more costly the installation. As a rule, figure that a 
custom inlay will double the cost of the wood floor, Caroll said. 
</P>
<P>
 One way to keep costs low is to assemble a wood panel and ship it to the site. 
Historic Floors of Oshkosh in Oshkosh, Wis., for example, makes about 25 
standard borders and 22 medallions or inserts. These are shipped ready to be 
placed in a new or an existing wood floor by a local installer or experienced 
do-it-yourselfer. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Historic Floors' patterns are based on turn-of-the-century originals, 
said Dick Norton, marketing manager. Working from photographs, the company also 
will repair old borders. Historic Floors' borders range from $7 to $50 a linear 
foot. For a new floor, a 27-inch medallion costs about $200, a 36-inch one 
about $350. 
</P>
<P>
 Historic Floors sells primarily through distributors such as Caroll's company 
in Buffalo, but will send catalogues to consumers on request. 
</P>
<P>
 For homeowners who want a custom look without the effort or expense, Caroll 
suggests a painted floor. The existing floor is stripped of its finish, a 
design is painted either by stencil or in freehand and then the floor is coated 
in a clear polyurethane. Although it's highly decorative, a painted floor isn't 
as long-lasting as an inlaid wood floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't expect the paint to last longer than five years in a kitchen or other 
high-traffic room," Caroll says. "Clients who request this application usually 
want to match wallpaper or fabric."

DECOR; TONE THINGS DOWN WITH NEW PAINT, LESS CLUTTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MAYER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Decorating in the '90s is following the lead of fashion and dressing down. To 
make the adjustment, those who succumbed to indulgent decorating in the 1980s 
are looking for relief.  
</P>
<P>
 Changing colors is one of the best methods of toning down any strong 
decorative theme, whether it's opulent traditional, country or pastel 
Southwestern. All can become tiresome, especially when taken too far. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding slipcovers, painting and removing accessories and clutter can introduce 
a new mood. "The remedy is to edit and prune -- get rid of the dried flowers 
and ruffled lampshades," said decorator and author Teri Seidman of New York. 
</P>
<P>
 If a country-style room is mainly pink and blue, add more white, perhaps by 
painting some furniture. This will provide crispness and tone down the country 
feeling. Neutral textures, such as a sisal rug in place of a hooked rug, will 
have a similar effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Clients who are no longer happy with their down-on-the-farm furnishings might 
also replace some print fabrics with solid colors by reupholstering or getting 
slipcovers. Seidman might also replace all the lampshades with simple parchment 
or white linen shades. Though seemingly insignificant, lampshades have a big 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I were working with someone who had gone overboard on log furniture, large 
terra-cotta pots and stone tables, I might mix in some Jacobean furniture," 
said decorator Celeste Cooper, who has offices in Boston and New York.  
</P>
<P>
 Pieces in the 17th-Century English style are on the same scale as the log 
furniture, but they would introduce a different mood, as would African art and 
textiles, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although such tinkering can revive a tired room, it can also cause a fatal 
collision of styles and colors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certain styles are compatible, like country and English or French, but 
extreme contemporary and country are not usually compatible," Seidman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding a Lucite table to a country room would be like bringing a piece of the 
big city onto the farm -- a little too much excitement. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper confronted that problem in a house in suburban Boston where the clients 
were grafting a new master bedroom wing in Bauhaus modern style onto the back 
of their postwar American Colonial. 
</P>
<P>
 "These clients were 90% through with the renovation when they realized they 
had a problem," said Cooper, who was called in to integrate the home's split 
personalities. 
</P>
<P>
 Dramatic color was her main weapon. In the entry hall where the old and new 
meet, she dyed the stairway handrail bright red and colored walls and floors in 
charcoal gray and white. She lacquered the walls red in the den and in the 
living room cut up carpet remnants in beige and black to resemble an abstract 
painting by Mondrian. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper also created "art furniture" with paint. A game table now has a 
checkerboard design. A standard chest was given a new base and treated to a 
painted "granite" top; the drawers were outlined with black striping. 
</P>
<P>
 The piece de resistance is the large china buffet in the dining room. This 
highly traditional piece with drawers in the base and shelves behind glass 
above has been painted to look like Anglo-Indian Raj furniture. The "ebony and 
ivory inlays" are actually just paint.

SCULPTURE; SCULPTOR-DESIGNER NOGUCHI'S SPIRIT, RANGE ARE SHOWCASED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN BRUNSKILL, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The spirit of its sculptor-founder is present in even small details at the 
Isamu Noguchi Garden Museum, an oasis of tranquillity just over the East River, 
with the Manhattan skyline looming in the background. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent morning visit, art, found art and nature were in harmony. A 
squirrel hopped unhurriedly across the garden's gray pebbles, through a group 
of small, pale boulders lying near "Indian Dancer," a 5-foot pink granite 
sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, the way you see this is as it was when Noguchi was here," said 
museum director Bruce Altshuler. 
</P>
<P>
 "These boulders are aji granite -- they are the practice pieces stonecutters 
make, and Noguchi took some of them and put them here." 
</P>
<P>
 Altshuler pointed out another corner of the garden, near a fountain among 
junipers, birches and bamboos. "Half of Noguchi's ashes are here, half in 
Japan," he said. It's one of many reminders of the sculptor's Japanese-American 
background. 
</P>
<P>
 The garden museum, which opened in 1985, has been called one of Noguchi's last 
and perhaps greatest works. The sculptor died in New York in 1988, at the age 
of 84. 
</P>
<P>
 (Noguchi's works include "California Scenario," near South Coast Plaza in 
Costa Mesa. The 1.6 acre sandstone courtyard is sandwiched between El Torito 
Grill and the Bank of the West building.) 
</P>
<P>
 At the museum in New York, 12 galleries, rambling over two stories, complement 
the high-walled garden, with wide windows, doors and corners occasionally open 
to the sky. 
</P>
<P>
 About 300 works are being shown, and many more are in storage, Altshuler said. 
They are works from all periods of Noguchi's wide-ranging and influential 
60-year artistic career -- as sculptor in wood, stone, metal and paper, and as 
designer of gardens and plazas, stage sets and furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 Noguchi acquired a studio opposite the present museum in 1961, Altshuler said. 
"Then he bought this place, an old photo-engraving factory, and in the early to 
mid-'70s began to consolidate his sculpture here." 
</P>
<P>
 Another lot was added and the museum building expanded. The space was for 
storage in the beginning, Altshuler said, "then people began to tell him it was 
so beautiful, like a museum -- so he got the idea and gradually it came about." 
</P>
<P>
 Noguchi was born in 1904 in Los Angeles to an American mother and Japanese 
father, spent part of his childhood in Japan, then attended schools in this 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 One landmark early in his career came in 1927 when he spent a few months in 
Paris as assistant to Romanian sculptor Constantin Brancusi. Eventually he 
returned to New York, where he met and collaborated with choreographer Martha 
Graham and visionary inventor R. Buckminster Fuller. The three became the 
greatest influences on his work, Altshuler said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea of the museum was partly inspired by Brancusi, who always insisted 
on installing his own work," Altshuler said. Because of Noguchi's theories of 
sculpture in space, the installation of his work was critical for him, too, 
Altshuler said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1935, Noguchi made the first of many stage designs for Graham. In 1938 he 
designed his first fountain, for the New York World's Fair; in 1940 he 
completed the huge stainless-steel bas-relief, "News," above the entry of the 
Associated Press Building in Rockefeller Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other projects around the world, including his "sculpture of spaces," 
Noguchi designed the gardens for UNESCO'S Paris headquarters, the Billy Rose 
Sculpture Garden in Jerusalem's Israel Museum and the Horace E. Dodge Fountain 
in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of his life, he was spending six months of each year at his studio 
home in Mure, Japan, where he did his carving, Altshuler said. New York was the 
base for his architectural projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of his late works in granite, basalt and andesite, their dark surfaces 
shot with rusty tones, dominate a main-floor gallery. Few of these later works 
have been seen outside the museum. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me they culminate his work," said Altshuler, whose book, "Noguchi," was 
recently published by Abbeville. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the museum's galleries reflect the sculptor's wide range. A tour 
takes one from early biomorphic works in wood and bronze, fragile slate 
carvings and terra cottas, to brush drawings and other works on paper, models 
for large-scale landscape sculptures, dance sets, and photographs of works and 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 There's also an ethereal group of the famous paper and bamboo Akari lamps, 
some lit, some not.  
</P>
<P>
 "Noguchi considered they had life as sculpture in addition to lighting," 
Altshuler said. 
</P>
<P>
 The galleries' style is simple, accommodating pieces in materials ranging from 
highly polished rose marble to roughly worked granite in which the stone's own 
nature remained part of the work. Basically, he left the factory as it was, 
Altshuler said. "It's a place of repose, but it still evokes a working place. 
</P>
<P>
 "The museum is largely as he left it -- the artist's work as the artist chose 
to exhibit and install it." 
</P>
<P>

GARDENING; DELPHINIUMS STAND TALL AND DRY WITH DIGNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When it comes to bold, beautiful blossoms, it's hard to beat eye-catching 
delphiniums. They grow in vibrant shades of blue, purple, lavender, white, pink 
and yellow and consist of spikes with individual stems of single flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Because varieties of delphinium plants can grow anywhere from 1 1/2 to 6 feet 
tall, they often provide a vertical accent to flower gardens. Their spikes also 
make beautiful additions to both fresh and dried flower arrangements. Sometimes 
confused with larkspur (an annual), delphiniums grow as perennials. 
</P>
<P>
 Delphiniums grow best in areas washed with lots of water and sun but have 
difficulty thriving through hot, dry summers. 
</P>
<P>
 Plant delphiniums in well-drained, loamy soil about 12 inches apart for 
smaller varieties and 20 inches apart for larger ones. Allowing space between 
the plants lets the air circulate better, helping prevent mold, mildew and 
other diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 Delphiniums provide an attractive background for smaller plants, although you 
can incorporate some of the smaller varieties in the middle of your flower 
garden. For best results, stake larger delphinium varieties while they're still 
young and before the wind has had a chance to bend them. A single bamboo or 
wire stake for each plant should provide plenty of support. 
</P>
<P>
 Delphiniums typically bloom in early summer. Cut each spike when most of the 
flowers have developed but before the bottom blossoms start to fall off. If you 
cut the bloom stalks down to ground level after the spikes have finished 
blooming and before they seed, most delphinium varieties will bloom again in 
late summer or early fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Although fragile, delphiniums hold color well. You can successfully preserve 
them by air-drying, using desiccants or pressing. 
</P>
<P>
 If you air-dry delphiniums, hang individual spikes upside down, then group 
them into bunches after they've dried. (If you try to dry delphiniums in 
bunches, you'll probably crush the fragile blossoms). To preserve delphiniums 
in silica gel, lay the spikes horizontally in crystals, then gently cover them 
with more crystals. 
</P>
<P>
 Large delphinium blossoms make perfect additions to oversize arrangements and 
crafts projects or to add height to smaller ones. What's more, their deep 
colors provide focal points for groupings of pale flowers or dried grasses. You 
can best work delphiniums into small arrangements by using individual flowers 
rather than a whole spike.

GARDENING; PETUNIAS, DAISY MAKE THE CUT FOR ALL-AMERICA TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Two petunias and a gloriosa daisy are the newest All-America Selections. No 
vegetable was judged worthy this time by AAS, which has been making such awards 
for 62 years. The petunias, Purple Wave and Celebrity Chiffon Morn, both 
hybrids, and the easy-care daisy, Rudbeckia Indian Summer, were honored for 
1995 after comparisons at 33 display gardens across North America for flowers 
and 26 for vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 They will be offered by seed sources for the coming season with this AAS 
endorsement: "Distinct and superior, worthy of being grown by professional 
growers and home gardeners alike." 
</P>
<P>
 Purple Wave is touted as the first of a new class of petunias because of its 
horizontal growth habit. It reaches only four to six inches in height but can 
spread two to four feet. Blooms are single and about two inches in diameter. 
</P>
<P>
 The height of Celebrity Chiffon Morn is a more familiar 18 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 AAS says Purple Wave will do best in a sunny location and the "plants are 
vigorous and drought-tolerant, perfectly adaptable to hanging baskets that tend 
to dry out rapidly." It also is recommended for rock gardens, sloping hills and 
terraces because "a flowering carpet aptly describes this new plant." 
</P>
<P>
 Most are likely to be purchased as bedding plants although "experienced 
gardeners could grow Purple Wave from seed," AAS says. 
</P>
<P>
 Celebrity Chiffon Morn has a single, floribunda form and produces 2 1/2-inch 
flowers that are described as "a soft, pastel pink color with a delicate 
topping of cream and white in the center of the bloom. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only the flower color can be described as soft or delicate," adds AAS. "The 
plant is tough and reliable." 
</P>
<P>
 The judges said the color will blend or contrast well with blue, red or green 
shades, is visible for quite a distance and is best used to draw attention to a 
garden feature, such as a birdbath or bench. It, too, is most likely to be 
found as a bedding plant. 
</P>
<P>
 However, even novice gardeners should be able to grow Indian Summer from seed 
sown directly into soil, AAS says. 
</P>
<P>
 The golden yellow flowers are six to nine inches in diameter, among the 
largest in its class. They come in single or semi-double form. Plants reach 
three to four feet in height but "due to the basal branching habit, do not need 
staking in the garden." They need full sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Rudbeckia is native to the eastern United States. Indian Summer is described 
as relatively free of diseases and pests, free-flowering all summer and 
requiring little care. 
</P>
<P>
 AAS describes itself as a nonprofit educational group formed to evaluate 
flowers and vegetables from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 In the all-America tests, flowers are scored on the basis of color, prolonged 
flowering, attractiveness of blossoms, uniformity, uniqueness, fragrance and 
resistance to disease, insects and weather stress. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been 568 previous AAS winners. Lavender Lady flower, Big Beef 
tomato and Fanfare cucumber won for 1994.

GREENBELT PETITIONS SUBMITTED; VENTURA: THE INITIATIVE WOULD GIVE VOTERS A SAY 
ON DEVELOPMENTS IN THE DESIGNATED AGRICULTURAL AREA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Supporters of an initiative to preserve Ventura's greenbelt turned in a box 
jammed with their petitions Friday, submitting a third more signatures than 
they will need to qualify the measure for the November, 1995, ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The activists must have at least 5,798 signatures from registered voters in 
Ventura to qualify the petitions for the ballot, and they turned in 8,779 
signatures, City Clerk Barbara Kam said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County elections officials, who will count the signatures, usually 
advise petition circulators to gather at least 20% more signatures than are 
needed to qualify, because many people signing the petition are not registered 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure would prohibit City Council members from allowing any development 
on the city's greenbelt without first putting the project before Ventura's 
voters. The greenbelt is a hodgepodge of farm properties that dot the city's 
east end and is designated under Ventura's Comprehensive Plan to remain 
agricultural until 2010. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so glad to see it . . . come up for a vote," said Tina Atkins, a mid-town 
resident who helped collect the signatures. "We can see what people really want 
and not just the result of some private deal." 
</P>
<P>
 The petition drive began earlier this year as a fight to prevent developer Ron 
Hertel from constructing more than 400 homes on a city-owned lemon orchard at 
Telegraph Road and Petit Avenue. Fearful that Hertel already had the council's 
support, neighbors of the proposed development mounted a fierce campaign to 
discourage his project and all future development in the eastside greenbelt.  
</P>
<P>
 Hertel wanted to swap the city's land for his 94 acres just south of 
California 126. He proposed that the city build a park on his land, and he 
offered $2 million in seed money to get the process started. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal pitted homeowners near the lemon orchard against eastside sports 
enthusiasts who wanted a nearby park where they could play their league games. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the City Council denied Hertel's request last month, backers of the 
petition say they hope to place their initiative on next year's ballot, when a 
council election should send many of the city's voters to the polls.  
</P>
<P>
 "We decided that since this affects everybody, let's put it on the November, 
1995, ballot," said Sheri Vincent, an eastside homeowner who has led the 
petition drive. "The people that will come to vote in a general election in 
1995 will not just be a special-interest group."  
</P>
<P>
 Some council members said they oppose the initiative because they think it 
subverts the original purpose of electing city leaders -- to make key decisions 
in the name of the citizens who put them in office. 
</P>
<P>
 "A petition such as this puts (the decision) into the voters' hands, who 
predictably do not put in the time and effort to research the facts to be able 
to make a legitimate and sound decision for the whole community," said 
Councilwoman Rosa Lee Measures. "That's what elected officials are mandated to 
do -- to vote in the best interests of the community, and not for special 
interests." 
</P>
<P>
 But Vincent said that is one of the initiative's purposes -- to guard against 
council members who do not understand the needs of the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the City Council doesn't have its hand on the pulse of the city," she 
said. "They don't even have a vision of what they want the city to be. It's 
completely piecemeal." 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes after Vincent and her neighbors submitted their petition-stuffed 
carton Friday, resident Elaina Fletcher arrived at City Hall to turn in her 
notice of intent to circulate a petition to recall Measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Fletcher submitted a notice of intent last month, but missed a later filing 
deadline and had to restart the petition process. 
</P>
<P>
 Measures said she will resubmit her response to the notice within the required 
seven days.

NATURE PUTS ON LIGHT SHOW; BOLT INJURES FARM WORKER AS STORM SWEEPS OVER AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A farm worker was critically injured Friday when lightning struck a field near 
Oxnard as Ventura County's first fall storm -- an unpredictable mix of thunder, 
lightning and torrential showers -- unleashed up to half an inch of rain in 
some areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Eulogio Rodriguez, 53, of Santa Paula was working as a foreman in a pepper 
field in the midst of driving rain when a lightning bolt struck him about 7:45 
a.m. Witnesses said Rodriguez had been sitting on the ground to ward off 
lightning strikes, but he apparently stood up just as a bolt descended. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one saw him get hit," said Steven Gill, the owner of Rio Farms, who hired 
Rodriguez several weeks ago. "They just turned around and he was down." 
</P>
<P>
 Several men began performing CPR on Rodriguez as he went into cardiac arrest. 
Paramedics, who arrived minutes later, were able to regain a pulse en route to 
St. John's Regional Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez was in a coma and listed in critical condition late Friday, said Dr. 
Allen Hooper, director of the hospital's emergency room. It is too early to 
tell about brain or kidney damage, he said, but Rodriguez's pupils were 
responding to light. 
</P>
<P>
 By noon Friday, the bulk of the storm system had swept through Ventura County, 
moving into Santa Barbara and Kern counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Partly cloudy skies and only a 20% chance of rain were predicted for Ventura 
County this morning, although scattered showers were expected to continue off 
the coast. 
</P>
<P>
 National Weather Service forecaster Mike Wofford said the storms began 
building late Thursday when an upper-level low-pressure system collided with 
moist air from the south and moved ashore. 
</P>
<P>
 The mixture produced a dazzling light show, with jagged strikes illuminating 
the sky throughout the night. At dawn, dozens of bolts danced on the horizon 
against the backdrop of Santa Rosa Island. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unusual to have the lightning continue for that amount of time," Wofford 
said. "It's because the low-pressure system isn't moving anywhere."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The mountainous areas north of Ojai received the most precipitation, with 
county rain gauges picking up 0.67 of an inch in Matilija Canyon and just over 
half an inch in Rose Valley. More than a third of an inch fell at the 
Government Center in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastern Ventura County missed most of the overnight rain, but heavy skies and 
scattered bursts were reported by midday Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 County meteorologists said it is unusual to get tropical storms this late in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not often you have thunder rumbling off and on all night on the first 
day of fall," said Terry Schaeffer, an agricultural meteorologist for the 
National Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters were reluctant to predict whether the upcoming winter would be 
wetter or drier than normal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have a good feel for what the winter will be like yet," Schaeffer 
said. "We'll just have to wait and see a little bit longer." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the accident involving Rodriguez, no other serious rain-related 
mishaps were reported in Ventura County, although emergency workers were kept 
busy. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Highway Patrol Officer Staci Morse: "It's just been a very busy day of 
constant calls. It seems to be all over the county." 
</P>
<P>
 Road workers cleared several minor debris slides from Pacific Coast Highway, 
said Caltrans supervisor Warran Finley. 
</P>
<P>
 And crews using heavy equipment cleared mud and boulders that had tumbled 
across the southbound lane of California 33 north of Rose Valley, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a small one," he said. "Nothing they can't handle right away." 
</P>
<P>
 Some minor street flooding was reported in the Oxnard Plain, along Wooley and 
Victoria roads. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the frequent lightning and thunderclaps, some residents refused to 
stay inside. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Duffy Cink, a golf pro at Soule Park Golf Course in Ojai, said he warned each 
foursome teeing off Friday morning that golfers were exposing themselves to 
danger. 
</P>
<P>
 "Carrying a golf club out on the course is like holding a lightning rod," Cink 
said. "We tell golfers it is at their own discretion, and we don't stop them if 
they want to play." 
</P>
<P>
 At least 170 golfers decided to play the odds with Mother Nature and hit the 
links, Cink said. Another 56 opted to wait for another day. 
</P>
<P>
 Cink said he has seen players struck by lightning on other golf courses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell the golfer . . . 'Have fun, but I'm staying in the shop,' " he said.

OXNARD LIBRARY INSTALLS NEW SECURITY SYSTEM; SURVEILLANCE: THE FRIENDS RAISE 
$18,000 FOR VIDEO CAMERAS, MIRRORS AND MONITORS TO END VANDALISM AND THEFT OF 
BOOKS. 
</P>

 Book bandits beware: Pocketing paperbacks or tearing up tomes at the Oxnard 
Library may prove difficult due to a new video surveillance system. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking to halt rampant book theft and vandalism at the red-brick building, 
the Friends of the Oxnard Library raised $18,000 for a set of cameras and 
mirrors to monitor hard-to-see spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 "Books were going through the easy checkout -- off the roof," said Friends 
President Felicity Harper. "People were throwing them off the balcony to their 
friends down below." 
</P>
<P>
 A video security system was supposed to be installed in the building when it 
was built in 1992, but the plan was scrapped due to dwindling funds as the 
building neared construction, Harper said. 
</P>
<P>
 The $12-million, 72,000-square-foot library has more than 250,000 books on its 
shelves. An average of 2,000 patrons visit the building each day, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Friends of the Oxnard Library, which runs a gift shop in the building's 
first floor, bought five video cameras, 11 curved mirrors, monitors and other 
surveillance equipment with funds donated by a group of city businesses, 
associations and residents. Four cameras have been installed to date. 
</P>
<P>
 Contributors included the Rotary Club of Oxnard, the Ventura County Amateur 
Radio Club, Thompson Lumber Co., Gene Jackson Farms Inc. and Procter & Gamble 
Papers Product Co.  
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez pitched in $100 for the surveillance system, Harper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A security system was certainly needed," Lopez said. "It's such a beautiful 
building, but as soon as it was open and dedicated, we started to see graffiti 
and damage. People weren't taking care of it. It's really kind of sad."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Michele Izay, services manager for the Oxnard Library, said the theft and 
vandalism at the building have been exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
 "The library, I feel, is in excellent shape," Izay said. "Most people tend to 
take pretty good care of the library, but like any public building, we've had 
some problems with graffiti and vandalism." 
</P>
<P>
 But Harper said the library was becoming blighted and scarred. 
</P>
<P>
 "The glass entry doors were etched, the windows were etched, mirrors in the 
restrooms were etched," Harper said. "The surfaces were literally cut into. 
What they used I have no idea. But many had to be replaced."  
</P>
<P>
 People were not only defacing the building, but the books as well, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of someone checking the book out for a class project, the pages would 
be cut out," Harper said. "And there was theft of books, which you think 
wouldn't happen with our checkout system." 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Friends of the Oxnard Library are still raising money to pay 
for 10 more cameras they hope to install next year, increasing the total cost 
of the surveillance system to about $29,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Izay said anything that keeps books on the shelves and the building intact is 
welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can go back, look at the tapes and maybe catch someone," Harper said. "At 
least it will act as a deterrent."

2 VACANCIES HAVE COURT PERSONNEL SCRAMBLING; JUDGES: AS THEY WAIT FOR GOVERNOR 
TO MAKE THE APPOINTMENTS, OFFICIALS HAVE RESORTED TO PLEADING WITH PRIVATE 
ATTORNEYS TO HELP OUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Two vacancies on the Ventura County Superior Court have judicial officials in 
a mad scramble to find enough judges to handle the court's business each day, 
the supervising judge said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're always running around trying to get somebody to cover those vacancies," 
said Melinda A. Johnson, the Superior Court presiding judge. "It gets a little 
crazy. Every day is controlled chaos, even more than usual." 
</P>
<P>
 As they wait for Gov. Pete Wilson to make the two judicial appointments, local 
court officials have resorted to pleading with private attorneys from across 
the county to fill in on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Without these attorneys, court officials say they would have to close down 
some civil courtrooms. The so-called judge pro-tems are picked from a list that 
contains the names of dozens of private lawyers who have volunteered their 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the governor's office said it is working as fast as possible 
sifting through applicants for the two vacancies, which resulted from one judge 
retiring and another being promoted to an appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been working on judicial appointments," said Evelyn Miller, 
spokeswoman for Wilson. "The governor has been taking time to do what he can." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said the appointment of Assistant Dist. Atty. Colleen Toy White to fill 
one vacant term is near. But she said it will take considerably longer to fill 
a second term that opened in the county last month. At least half a dozen 
current municipal judges and a string of private attorneys have applied for 
that post, according to Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But until someone is appointed, Johnson said she will continue to call private 
attorneys to provide the Superior Court with a helping hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Diane L. Rowley of Thousand Oaks, who presided over family law cases one day 
this week, said she sees her volunteer service as a way to keep the judicial 
system from stalling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ultimately, the people who are trying to get through the system can do that 
because the courts don't have to go dark when we are missing a judge or two, or 
a judge goes on vacation," said Rowley, a certified family law specialist.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know anybody who can do it too often," she added. "It's volunteer, 
and when an attorney spends a day there, it pretty much means they can't bill 
that day. It's a no-income, no-production day." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County judicial officials have long complained of the 15-judge 
Superior Court bench being too small. And the state Judicial Council recently 
determined the county should have at least three more Superior Court judges. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, expanding the bench is the last thing on local court officials' 
agenda. They just want to get back up to normal staffing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of my job is looking around every day and seeing what workload isn't 
being covered and finding someone to cover it," Johnson said. The first 
priority, she said, is covering criminal cases because those are under stricter 
deadlines. 
</P>
<P>
 "Criminal never suffers in the sense that other civil cases would have to shut 
down to make sure the criminal cases get done," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first vacancy opened in February when Superior Court Judge Edwin M. 
Osborne announced his retirement after serving two decades. Four months later, 
White won election to Osborne's vacant seat. 
</P>
<P>
 But White's term does not start until January. She thought Wilson would waste 
little time appointing her because they share a law-and-order philosophy. Like 
Wilson, White is a Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly four months later, however, White has not been appointed to finish out 
Osborne's term before her own term commences. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, White said she expects to be appointed no later than the 
first week in November. She will become a family law judge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand that they really need some help with two vacancies," said White, 
who has been attending classes on family law at the state judicial college. 
"I've had attorneys walk up to me at social functions and ask, 'When are you 
going to be there?' They are feeling the pinch." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The second local judicial post opened in August, when Wilson appointed Judge 
Richard D. Aldrich to the state appeals court. In line for Aldrich's former 
seat are a number of local attorneys and at least half a dozen current 
Municipal Court judges. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the candidates -- such as Municipal Judges Herbert Curtis III, John R. 
Smiley and Arturo Gutierrez -- have been in the running for the Superior Court 
on past occasions. Other Municipal judges who have applied include Vincent 
O'Neill Jr., Steven E. Hintz and Barry B. Klopfer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just an awful lot to do," Miller said of the governor's appointment 
process. "When it comes down to the final decision, he (Wilson) will sit and 
read every one of the applications. He's very thorough. He does his homework."

 A Simi Valley man who faced sentencing under the new "three strikes" law after 
pleading guilty to molesting a 13-year-old girl told a judge Friday he now 
wants a trial in the case.

<P>
 Acting Superior Court Judge Bruce A. Clark, who had been set to sentence Henry 
Diaz, 40, to a mandatory 25 years to life in prison, agreed to give the 
defendant's lawyer time to withdraw the guilty plea. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark set an Oct. 21 hearing to rule on the motion. 
</P>
<P>
 Diaz, a three-time convicted robber, entered guilty pleas to three counts of 
child molestation in August. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the incidents occurred after the "three strikes" law went into effect 
on March 7, making the heavily tattooed gang member eligible for sentencing 
under the new statute. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted under the law, defendants with a least two prior serious or 
violent felonies face a mandatory prison sentence of 25 years to life. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his robbery convictions, Diaz was found guilty by the state 
Department of Corrections of killing a fellow inmate in 1979, court records 
show. The probation report gave no details of the slaying, but said that the 
lifelong Simi Valley resident has 22 arrests on his rap sheet. 
</P>
<P>
 Diaz's child-molestation case stemmed from an arrest in March, when Simi 
Valley police raided the home he and several other people shared in the 1700 
block of Sitka Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Court records say the home was raided after a confidential police informant 
purchased drugs there. During the raid, police found Diaz in bed with the girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Diaz was charged with 10 felony counts of child molestation, including two 
counts after the new law for repeat offenders took effect. He faced up to 70 
years to life in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 In an agreement that accompanied his guilty plea on Aug. 9, Diaz was able to 
shave 33 years from the potential sentence. However, Diaz's attorney, Deputy 
Public Defender Neil B. Quinn, said Friday that his client wants to go to 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Quinn cited a technicality in the way the plea agreement was structured as 
basis for the request for a new trial. He also told the judge that the girl 
does not want Diaz to go to prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "She wants to have contact with him," Quinn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Patrice D. Koenig, however, called the defendant 
manipulative. She said that he is putting pressure on the girl not to testify 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
 But Koenig said the point is moot: Under California law, adults are prohibited 
from having sex with minors, even if the youth consents. 
</P>
<P>
 Contained in the court file for the case are letters between Diaz and the girl 
since his incarceration. The letters were intercepted by Ventura County Jail 
officials, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you know I need to know something from you?" Diaz wrote. "It's important 
to me how much do you love me!! I ask cause you can make all the difference in 
this whole situation. I'm not trying to confuse you in no way. I need to know 
from you what (you are) going to do for me in court." 
</P>
<P>
 In one letter to him, the girl said she was sorry to see Diaz "in that awful 
place." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you have done no crime," the letter said, "for love is no crime."

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; SCHOOL COUNSELORS MOUNT SILENT 
PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 About 20 Thousand Oaks counselors and psychologists staged a brief and silent 
protest before the Conejo Valley Unified school board Thursday night to call 
attention to their stalled contract negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated by the district's unwillingness to meet their demands, the 
employees briefly stood in silence after one representative addressed the 
board. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our only request . . . was that services to our students be protected against 
further staffing cuts," psychologist Patricia Rebbe told the school board. "The 
district has denied our request." 
</P>
<P>
 After the meeting, the employees said they will seek community support to 
pressure the district to resolve the contract dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, we plan to continue to put pressure on the board and fight for 
what we believe is a just settlement," counselor David Holmboe said. 
</P>
<P>
 He declined to comment on what further actions the employees might take. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past two years, the district has eliminated four counseling 
positions, leaving 14 counselors and nine psychologists at the district's 
junior high and high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The employees now want a guarantee that no more positions will be cut. But no 
such agreement could be reached during contract negotiations last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials have said they are unwilling to make guarantees, given the 
district's uncertain financial future. 
</P>
<P>
 During Thursday's meeting, Supt. Jerry C. Gross said the district will 
continue to work with the counselors to sign a new contract. The existing 
contract, which expired in June, has been extended until an agreement can be 
reached. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Dolores Didio said in the 10 years she has served on the 
board, she has never known a contract negotiation between the counselors and 
the district to take so long. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time you don't finalize a contract, it is a concern," she said. "The 
unfortunate part is there are only so many dollars we are dealing with these 
days." TRACY WILSON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; MAN GETS 90 DAYS FOR CRUELTY TO HORSES 
</P>

<P>
 A Moorpark man convicted of nearly starving his two horses to death was 
sentenced Friday to 90 days in jail and stripped of ownership of the geldings. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Superior Court Judge Charles W. Campbell Jr. also placed 
Stephen Michael Ney, 49, on five years' probation. 
</P>
<P>
 The horses were seized Oct. 21 by the Ventura County Humane Society, after 
authorities found them nearly starved to death in their Newbury Park pasture, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 The horses -- a thoroughbred and a Hanoverian -- were each about 350 pounds 
underweight, authorities said. A Superior Court jury convicted Ney of two 
counts of felony animal cruelty and two misdemeanor counts of not providing the 
horses with food or water. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard E. Simon recommended a sentence of eight months in 
prison for Ney, who has also been charged with fraud for running up $8,000 
worth of purchases on a neighbor's credit card, Simon said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy Public Defender Michael J. Neary asked the judge to show leniency 
in sentencing Ney. Neary maintained that the defendant had fed the horses 
before they were seized. 
</P>
<P>
 "The theory that he intentionally starved the horses and was cruel to them is 
rational only if he bought the feed and flushed it down the toilet," Neary 
said. DWAYNE BRAY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Business owners whose shops are tucked away from the street will get a break 
under a new Thousand Oaks law allowing some strip malls to post directory 
signs. 
</P>
<P>
 Any commercial center set at least 150 feet back from the street will now be 
able to woo shoppers with a directory sign listing stores that are difficult 
for passersby to see.Stores that directly face the street cannot be included on 
the directory. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid clutter, all signs must look alike, with up to eight business names 
set in identical type, using letters no more than four inches high. While each 
shopping center can use different colors for the lettering, all signs must be 
wood rather than plexiglass. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members approved the directory signs in a 5-0 vote Tuesday night.

<P>
 An argument between a Thousand Oaks auto mechanic and two brothers ended with 
the mechanic stabbed and the brothers under arrest, sheriff's deputies said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Kurland, 35, who was stabbed in the side about midnight Thursday, was 
in serious condition late Friday afternoon in Westlake Medical Center, a 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday morning, deputies arrested Michael Clark, 27, and Scott Clark, 28, on 
suspicion of attempted murder, Sgt. Bruce Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Thousand Oaks men were being held in lieu of $250,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Kurland was stabbed on the front porch of his house in the 3200 block of Royal 
Oaks Drive, Sheriff's Detective Ernie Montagna said. A woman who identified 
herself as Kurland's girlfriend said the mechanic and at least one of the 
brothers had been working on a car before the argument. 
</P>
<P>
 Kurland was initially listed in critical condition, but he improved following 
abdominal surgery early Friday, according to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Hammond, 40, a friend of Kurland's, said the Clark brothers are former 
neighbors of the victim. GREG RIPPEE

<P>
 Child support collections in Ventura County were up nearly 16% for fiscal year 
1993-94, according to the office of the district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Collections for the year totaled more than $27.2 million, an increase of $4 
million over the previous fiscal year.The county's fiscal year ends June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is good news for the children of Ventura County and for custodial 
parents who need these payments to provide for food, clothing and shelter," 
Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury said in a release Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury said collections for fiscal year 1994-95 already have surpassed last 
year's totals at this date. 
</P>
<P>
 He cited aggressive collection efforts and the cooperation of the Franchise 
Tax Board in holding back refund money as factors in the office's success. MARY

 A Newbury Park woman was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after she 
rammed her estranged husband's car, knocking it off two jack stands while he 
was lying underneath Friday afternoon, Ventura County sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy Lee Burns, 40, also of Newbury Park, was treated and released for a 
severely bruised arm at Los Robles Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies said witnesses told them Burns was working under a jacked-up car at 
1355 Lawrence Drive when his wife, Marcia Burns, 43, arrived and exchanged 
words with him. 
</P>
<P>
 She left, then returned within minutes and rear-ended the vehicle, knocking it 
off the jack stands and onto her husband, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcia Burns fled the scene and was later taken into custody, deputies said.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; ACCUSED TEACHER'S HEARING POSTPONED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to get more evidence against a Ventura High football coach accused of 
sexual misconduct, Ventura school officials have temporarily halted a hearing 
on the matter to get a former student's written statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The administrative hearing that will decide whether school officials may fire 
Bret Taylor, a Balboa Middle School history teacher and part-time high school 
coach, recessed Friday and will resume Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 During the recess, Ventura Unified School District representatives will fly to 
Florida to take a deposition from a girl who was a student at Ventura High when 
Taylor was a substitute teacher there. 
</P>
<P>
 Classmates of the girl have told school officials that the girl told them she 
had sex with Taylor. But the girl has said only that Taylor once picked her up 
at her friend's house and drove her to the beach, where he put a hand on her 
leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the girl does not corroborate her classmates' account, school 
officials believe they have enough evidence against the 28-year-old teacher to 
fire him, said Mary Jo McGrath, attorney for the school district. 
</P>
<P>
 The district suspended Taylor in July on allegations that he had sex with two 
Ventura High students and kissed and dated others. Although Taylor has admitted 
kissing two girls, the allegations that he had sex with students are based only 
on other youths' testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the girls whom Taylor has admitted kissing testified during the 
administrative hearing that Taylor kissed her repeatedly -- at times on his bed 
-- while she was at his home one day, McGrath said. One kiss lasted more than 
20 minutes, the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor declined to discuss the case. His attorney could not be reached for 
comment. MAIA DAVIS

SUGGESTED EXPANSION OF LANDFILL OPPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rejecting a Ventura County grand jury recommendation, officials with the 
county's solid waste department said there are no clear reasons to drastically 
expand the capacity of the Toland Road landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 In its annual report, the grand jury had suggested that the landfill between 
Santa Paula and Fillmore begin accepting up to 1,000 tons of trash per day.The 
landfill is now licensed to accept 125 tons per day. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury recommended the increase to help generate money to pay for the 
closure of the dump. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kay Martin, director of the county's Solid Waste Management Department, 
said Toland is not scheduled to close for another 40 or 50 years, allowing 
plenty of time to pay for the closure. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, she said raising the capacity of Toland would require lining the 
entire dump and installing a methane gas collection system, both costly 
ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if that were done, she said, there is no guarantee enough trash would be 
brought to Toland to justify the expansion and cost of retrofitting. 
</P>
<P>
 Another landfill off California 126 in Los Angeles County is already being 
planned for expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're proposing to take 10,000 tons a day. When you get a high volume site 
like that, it becomes difficult to compete on price," she said. JULIE FIELDS

<P>
 An Oxnard man who shot and killed his ex-girlfriend on Mother's Day has been 
convicted of second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
 A jury in Ventura County Superior Court returned the verdict Thursday against 
Gary Michael Rose, 25, after deliberating one day. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors, who accused Rose of acting with premeditation in the death of 
31-year-old Victoria Ramey, had asked the jury to convict the defendant of 
first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was a fair verdict," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Donald C. Glynn. "I 
discussed it with them, and their analysis was sound." 
</P>
<P>
 Rose's attorney, Deputy Public Defender Douglas W. Daily, had asked the jury 
to return a verdict of voluntary manslaughter, which carries a penalty of no 
more than 11 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the second-degree murder conviction, Rose will face 17 years to life in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramey died about 9:30 p.m. May 8 in her home in the 800 block of La Canada 
Avenue in Oxnard. Glynn said she was shot after Rose pushed her down the stairs 
of the two-story home. DWAYNE BRAY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; COMMISSION OKS LANDSCAPING LAW

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seeking to rid the city of blight, the Camarillo Planning Commission has 
approved an amendment to the city's zoning ordinance that will require 
homeowners to landscape and provide lawn irrigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Voting 3 to 1 during its meeting Tuesday, the commission decided to give 
residential property owners up to a year to install landscaping on their front 
and side lawns. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner William Liebmann cast the dissenting vote. Commissioner Ed Miller 
was absent. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're saying is that you have to have some kind of landscaping," said 
Commission Chairman Les Meredith. "You can't just have a dirt patch." 
</P>
<P>
 Meredith said the amendment's requirement for an irrigation system simply 
means that the homeowner has to have either an automatic sprinkler system or 
some other means of making sure the landscaping is kept green. 
</P>
<P>
 "That could be a $5 sprinkler you get from the hardware store or a complete 
underground automated system," Meredith said. 
</P>
<P>
 The amendment must go before the City Council for final approval. J.E. 
MITCHELL

ELECTIONS / THOUSAND OAKS CITY COUNCIL; 16 CANDIDATES STATE THEIR CASES AT 
FORUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 They may differ on development and clash on crime, but the 16 candidates 
running for Thousand Oaks City Council share one common goal: teaching voters 
to tell them apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Matching names to faces and then to ideas can be tough with such a crowded 
field -- as candidate Irving Wasserman found out during Thursday night's forum 
before a homeowners' coalition, the Westlake Joint Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he serves as a planning commissioner and presides over televised 
meetings each week, the first question Wasserman fielded after his six-minute 
introductory speech was a slightly sheepish, "What's your name?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Now there's a downer," the 72-year-old business executive said, chuckling. "I 
thought that just by my being up here, you would all know who I am." 
</P>
<P>
 No one else dared make that assumption. 
</P>
<P>
 Eager to impress their names into voters' consciousness, several candidates 
came up with gimmicks: 
</P>
<P>
 Police Detective Michael Markey pointed out that his initials spell "M & M," 
and handed out packs of the multicolored candy. Candidate David Hare explained 
that he cherishes the Conejo Valley partly because conejo means hare or rabbit 
in Spanish. And activist Ekbal Quidwai wore a T-shirt emblazoned with a photo 
of himself testifying during a recent council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Other candidates vying for three open council seats are: dentist Greg Cole, 
retired businessman Marshall Dixon, firefighter Andy Fox, financial manager 
Michael Friedman, retired filmmaker M. Ali Issari, former Councilman Lee 
Laxdal, real estate salesman Chuck Morsa, public access TV producer Jeannette 
Scovill, mortgage broker Bill Williams, mobile car-wash owner Lance Winslow, 
and two incumbents, Councilwomen Judy Lazar and Elois Zeanah. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-hour forum Thursday night was the first of about six where all 16 
candidates are expected to appear as the Nov. 8 election approaches. 
</P>
<P>
 A few candidates -- speaking to about 50 people at the North Ranch Community 
Center -- devoted their allotted six minutes to detailing their backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Cole described his years of service on the city's Planning Commission and the 
Ventura County Community College District board. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Issari, 72, focused on his career as an academic, explaining that he was "not 
a politician by any means." The youngest candidate, 27-year-old Friedman, also 
tried to position himself as an outsider, saying he would come to office with a 
"clean slate." 
</P>
<P>
 But most candidates focused intently on the issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Public safety won top billing from Fox, Markey and Winslow. 
</P>
<P>
 Markey suggested several new programs to fight crime, such as assigning two 
police officers to full-time gang detail, enacting curfew and loitering laws to 
keep kids off the street at night, and establishing a storefront police station 
at the Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Describing himself as energetic and willing to hustle, the 29-year-old Winslow 
offered details about a new crime-busting tactic he has already launched. The 
mobile watch program enlists traveling vendors to report suspicious activity 
they see while driving through the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox emphasized the need to bolster existing programs by hiring more police 
officers and boosting Neighborhood Watch efforts.

PREP EXTRA / SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; THIS TIME, EDISON DEFENSE PROVES A 
STOPPER; PREP FOOTBALL: EIGHTH-RANKED CHARGERS HOLD TWICE IN LAST FEW MINUTES 
TO BEAT SAN CLEMENTE, 14-7. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Edison relied on the unreliable Friday night -- the sore spot, the sieve, the 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
 It propped up the Chargers in a 14-7 victory over San Clemente at San Clemente 
High. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison (3-0), ranked eighth in Orange County, got little but gave up less. The 
offense made token appearances, but the defense stuck around, stopping the 
Tritons twice in the final minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our defense did it for us time and time again," Coach Dave White said. "They 
were there for us." 
</P>
<P>
 They were there two weeks ago as well, in a less than enthusiastic appearance. 
Corona del Mar has the highlight films to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers' defense was mauled that night. The offense came to the rescue in 
a 35-28 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, the defense returned the favor. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was Edison defense tonight," said Bryan Lachapelle, the Chargers' 
linebacker, defensive back and spokesman. "Fierce, wild and out of control." 
</P>
<P>
 It was at key moments at the end. 
</P>
<P>
 A 33-yard touchdown pass from Patrick Markovsky to Mike Ogas gave the Chargers 
the lead with five minutes left. It was left up to the defense to make it stand 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers stopped San Clemente twice on fourth down in the final 2 minutes 
30 seconds. True, Edison did catch a couple breaks. A holding call wiped out an 
80-yard touchdown pass by the Tritons. Another one helped kill their last 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Chargers made enough big plays on their own to rate a rave. 
</P>
<P>
 On fourth down at midfield, linebacker Keith Coleman batted down a Jeff Carlin 
pass. He then carried defensive end Marcos Emhof off the field piggyback. 
</P>
<P>
 Excited? You bet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were embarrassed that first week," Coleman said. "We took a good look at 
ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 The Tritons (1-2) got an eyeful, as well. 
</P>
<P>
 On the next series, Brodie Riederich nailed Carlin for a loss, again turning 
the ball over and clinching the victory. It was just another big play in a 
evening full of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison's Ogas intercepted a pass in the end zone to deny the Tritons a 
touchdown in the first half. Defensive back Andrew Bergsetter swooped in for a 
sack, forced a fumble and recovered the ball to stop another drive in the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers also blocked a field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the first week, I would not have expected this kind of performance," 
White said. "But we moved a few guys around." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Lachapelle, who now splits time at linebacker and safety. He personally 
killed one Triton drive, with two tackles and a near interception. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Edison's offense was pretty much limited to the running of tailback 
Bradley Lisotto. He gained 173 yards in 22 carries. His 40-yard run set up a 
seven-yard touchdown run by Alex Forero in the second quarter. It gave the 
Chargers a 7-7 tie at halftime.

PREP EXTRA / SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; NEWPORT HARBOR CONTROLS BALL AND 
FOOTHILL IN 28-7 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Newport Harbor's final drive of its 28-7 victory over Foothill typified its 
game-long domination of the Knights. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sailors (3-0) held the ball for more than nine minutes during one drive in 
the fourth quarter. And Newport Harbor culminated the 14-play, 55-yard drive by 
converting a fourth down and 32. 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Edon Kagasoff took a pitch from quarterback John Giordani, who 
threw three touchdown passes, and raced around the right end for 35 yards and 
the game's final score. Giordani completed eight of 15 passes for 150 yards and 
Kagasoff gained 94 yards in 17 carries to lead a balanced attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor's defense was equally effective, allowing only 39 yards 
passing, 154 total yards and no points. 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill's only points came early in the second quarter. Newport Harbor punter 
Matt Riggle mishandled a snap inside his five, and after the Knights blocked 
the punt, Jeff Svicarovich recovered the loose ball in the end zone to give 
Foothill a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights (1-2) appeared to seize the momentum when defensive back Matt 
Bower intercepted a Giordani pass at the Foothill 12 with 6 minutes 45 seconds 
remaining in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 But Newport Harbor's defense responded when Scott Sanderson made his second 
interception, giving the Sailors the ball at the Foothill 23. 
</P>
<P>
 Five plays later, Newport Harbor tied the score, 7-7, when Giordani completed 
a play-action, seven-yard touchdown pass to Dan McDonough with 4:50 remaining 
in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonough also made the next big play for Newport Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 With Foothill facing a fourth and four at its 23, punter Mike Boyes bobbled 
the snap inside the 10 and McDonough led a host of Sailors who tackled Boyes at 
the nine. 
</P>
<P>
 Two plays later, Giordani tossed a nine-yard touchdown pass to Mike Freeman, 
and the 6-foot-1, 225-pound tight end bowled over three defenders to reach the 
end zone with 1:42 remaining in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor scored on its first possession of the third quarter when 
Giordani hooked up with Jon Benzinger for a 57-yard touchdown pass, and Jeff 
Pardy's conversion pushed the score to 21-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor's defense took over from there. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sailors forced four Foothill turnovers, and the Knights turned the ball 
over on downs twice. Foothill quarterback Mike Ford struggled against the 
Sailors, completing three of 15 passes with three interceptions. Last week, 
Ford passed for 215 yards in a loss to Woodbridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our defense did a great job," Newport Harbor Coach Jeff Brinkley said. "They 
have a big physical team, and that's what we'll see in league. So it was good 
to see us play well."

PREP EXTRA / SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; ANAHEIM'S DROUGHNS AGAIN IS KEY IN 20-7 
UPSET OF IRVINE; FOOTBALL: JUNIOR RUSHES 31 TIMES FOR 278 YARDS AND THREE 
TOUCHDOWNS AGAINST THIRD-RANKED VAQUEROS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The clock ticked down to zero and Irvine Coach Terry Henigan turned to his 
team and yelled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Go over and congratulate them," he said. "They kicked our butts." 
</P>
<P>
 Nice to see Henigan doesn't watch a game through rose-colored glasses. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim did exactly what Henigan said. The Colonists, who have a one-man 
attack in Reuben Droughns, knew how to use him in their 20-7 upset of No. 3 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Droughns right. Droughns left. Droughns right up the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a simple game plan, and the Colonists executed it -- and executed the 
Vaqueros. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anaheim junior rushed 31 times for 278 yards and three touchdowns Friday 
at Glover Stadium as the Colonists (3-0) made believers out of at least one 
Orange County power. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to gain our respect," Droughns said. "You've got to admit it -- 
everyone doubted us. No one thought we could do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Especially against Irvine (2-1), which is ranked No. 3 in the State Division 
II rankings by Cal-Hi Sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just happy to be on the same field with a team of (Irvine's) caliber," 
Anaheim Coach Allen Carter said before the game. "We just hope to have a 
reasonable score and give a good account for ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine scored the game's first touchdown when Scott Larsen connected with 
Jamie Bertolli on a 35-yard scoring pass in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Droughns didn't do anything special in his first eight carries. Then on the 
ninth, on first and 10 from the 16, he went 59 yards. Four plays later, 
Droughns rushed seven yards for the score. The point-after was blocked and the 
Colonists trailed, 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
 But Droughns came back on the next drive. Beginning from the Anaheim seven, he 
capped a 93-yard drive by breaking three tackles and scoring from 17 yards. 
Rudy Herrera's pass to Robert Droughns made it 14-7 with 35 seconds left in the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Droughns had a little help on the 10 play drive -- his brother, Robert, ran 
for 37 yards on the second play of the series.  
</P>
<P>
 Droughns had 172 yards at halftime, but had his best single effort ahead of 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 After Robert Droughns recovered a fumble at the Irvine 44, Reuben Droughns' 
final touchdown was a 30-yard run that should be required viewing for future 
Anaheim tailbacks. He went right, was in the grasp of Brian Flynn five yards 
behind the line of scrimmage, but circled back to the left, eluding another 
tackler. He ran along the left sideline, then cut back right at the end. It was 
20-7. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense got involved in the heroics, too. Irvine was forced to punt on the 
opening series of the second half; Larsen's punt hit an Anaheim defender in the 
back -- and Irvine recovered at the Colonist 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine moved inside the 10 and had a second-and-goal situation at the two. The 
Vaqueros rushed three times -- Russ Diehl was stopped once and Chris Austin was 
stopped twice, about four inches from the goal line.

PREP EXTRA / SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; WIDEOUT SPURS NARROW VICTORY; FOOTBALL: 
VILLA PARK RECEIVER SEAN ADAMS CATCHES SEVEN PASSES FOR 98 YARDS DURING 15-14 
VICTORY OVER FOURTH-RANKED TRABUCO HILLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Friday night's game between Villa Park and Trabuco Hills, a stirring 15-14 
upset victory by Villa Park at El Modena High, hinged on the performances of 
two exceptional receivers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spartans rode the speed and long reach of wideout Sean Adams, who hauled 
in seven of Sean McMahon's 12 pass completions for 98 yards to rein in the 
fourth-ranked Mustangs. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest play was a 12-yard touchdown catch with 1 minute 57 seconds to 
play in the game. Franklin Haynes then hurtled over the Trabuco Hills goal line 
for the two-point conversion that gave Villa Park the winning margin. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no question we would go for the two points," Villa Park Coach Pat 
Mahoney said. "That's the way we play." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustangs' workhorse was Laquent Hobbs, who ran for 50 yards, caught five 
balls for 70 yards and scored both of the visitor's touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahoney knew the formula his team needed to win. Simply, stop giving the ball 
away. "We had been behind in turnovers the first two games," Mahoney said. 
"We'll need to be ahead at the end of the game to be in the game." 
</P>
<P>
 The no-faults policy paid early dividends as Villa Park -- which had no 
fumbles or interceptions for the game -- had the first half's only score. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking the ball on their own 35 with 5:57 remaining in the second quarter, 
Spartan quarterback McMahon found his passing touch. A 13-yarder went to Stan 
Stremick and Adams caught a 37-yard bomb, out-running three defenders to reach 
the Mustang eight-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 After Tony D'Amato struggled for a yard, McMahon then sprinted to his right, 
buying enough time to find Kris Fisher alone in the end zone for the touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Trabuco Hills snapped out of its lethargy in the second half, however. The 
Mustangs halted Villa Park on its initial possession of the third quarter, then 
went 57 yards in seven plays for the tying touchdown, courtesy of J.C. 
Pintsak's 11-yard toss to Fobbs. 
</P>
<P>
 And after surviving an interception and 50-yard return on the quarter's final 
play by the Spartan's Bo Barnes -- who injured his knee while getting tackled 
-- Trabuco Hills nearly swept its way to victory in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting on it's own three, the Mustangs ran around right end on four of their 
first six plays to reach the Villa Park 39. On the seventh play, Fobbs caught 
Pintsak's pass on the five and took it in from there. 
</P>
<P>
 But Trabuco Hills could not stop Villa Park, and Adams, when it had to, 
allowing the Spartans to run off more than six minutes on their winning drive.

PREP EXTRA / SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; MATER DEI DOMINATES HAWTHORNE

<P>
 Mater Dei scored 38 points in the last eight minutes of the first half and 
rolled to a 52-11 victory over Hawthorne Friday night at Santa Ana Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The second-ranked Monarchs (3-0) showed no weaknesses, forcing seven 
turnovers, dominating special teams play and were nearly flawless on offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawthorne, ranked second in Division II, stayed with Mater Dei through the 
first quarter, but collapsed in the second. 
</P>
<P>
 The assault began when Rod Perry caught a 43-yard touchdown pass over the 
middle from John Flynn, giving the Monarchs a 14-0 lead with 8 minutes 11 
seconds left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 After Hawthorne failed to gain a first down, Perry set up Mater Dei's third 
score when he returned the punt 27 yards to the Cougar 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Three plays later, Steve Bodnar scored his second touchdown of the game on a 
14-yard pass from Flynn. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei then hammered Kelvin Hunter on the ensuing kickoff, separating him 
from the ball, which was recovered by Douglas Odom at the Hawthorne 15. 
</P>
<P>
 On the next play, David Castleton caught a 15-yard scoring pass to make it 
28-0 with 4:03 remaining in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei lineman Brad Williams swatted away a pitch out, picked it up and 
returned it 15 yards for the touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawthorne then fumbled the kickoff and Flynn hit Castleton on an 11-yard slant 
for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Cougar turnover set up the last of the second-quarter barrage as 
Patrick Shinnefield booted a 49-yard field goal as the first half whistle 
sounded giving Mater Dei a 45-0 lead.

</P>
<P>
 As the final seconds ticked off the clock in Santiago's 14-3 victory over 
Buena Park Thursday, Tom Sokanthong knelt and kissed the grass at Buena Park 
High. 
</P>
<P>
 Sokanthong, a senior running back, had been on the field for every one of 
Santiago's 15 consecutive losses over the past three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "It felt incredible," said Sokanthong, who led the Cavaliers with 60 yards 
rushing. "I went through every loss, but I knew with the new coach (Ben Haley), 
we'd improve. I love my team." NOTHING TO CHEER ABOUT 
</P>
<P>
 The Century High cheerleading squad rooted the Centurions to a 39-13 Friday 
victory at Ocean View, but they did it without the services of member Molly 
Guillian, who fell during a pregame stunt and was treated on the field by 
trainers while the coin flip was being conducted. According to Century trainer 
John Beaumont, Guillian suffered a broken arm and was treated at a local 
hospital. BACK, BACK, BACK 
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar's J.J. DiCesare broke Gordon Moss' 12-year school record 
Thursday night (by 13 yards) with a 76-yard punt against Kennedy. A clipping 
penalty added another six yards. The result? DiCesare kicked from the Sea 
Kings' 12 and Kennedy took over at its 12. ON THE RECORD 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough to say, but you can't count him out." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Allen Carter, Anaheim coach, after being asked if Reuben Droughns was the 
best running back in the county. LOOKING AHEAD 
</P>
<P>
 "Seinfeld" will get a challenge Thursday night when third-ranked Irvine plays 
second-ranked Mater Dei at Santa Ana Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the second time in three weeks the Monarchs have played a team ranked 
third; they beat Esperanza, 38-28, in Week 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the Vaqueros lost to Anaheim, 20-7, Friday, they are aiming for a 
county-record fourth consecutive Southern Section championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Another epic battle -- and maybe historic if there's an upset -- takes place 
Thursday when Los Alamitos plays host to a skilled Pasadena Muir team. The 
Griffins have a 38-game unbeaten streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Another streak could come to an end, too, Thursday with an upset at Newport 
Harbor High. Ocean View -- with a 32-game losing streak -- squares off against 
host Estancia, which ended a nine-game skid last week. CONCERNED CHARGERS 
</P>
<P>
 El Toro sophomore Merle Sango scored his third touchdown of the season Friday, 
but he would gladly give each back if his best friend, Tomas Mejia, could watch 
him play. 
</P>
<P>
 Mejia was one was one of four Charger cross-country runners who were seriously 
injured in an automobile accident Aug. 26. Mejia remains in a coma at Western 
Medical Center in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think about him all the time," Sango said. "I'm scoring all my touchdowns 
for him and praying that everything will turn out all right." 
</P>
<P>
 Contributions to help the four families defray medical and rehabilitation 
costs can be made by calling El Toro High at (714) 586-6333. THE MUNCHIES 
</P>
<P>
 Edison led, 14-7, with three minutes left, but San Clemente was driving. The 
public address announcer at San Clemente reminded fans that, "There are 
half-price chicken burgers and hot dogs left." 
</P>
<P>
 On the sideline, Edison wide receiver Tom Bertron turned to lineman Tyler 
Lehto and said, "You hear that? Half-price burgers. You want to go get one?" 
</P>
<P>
 Edison won, 14-7, but Bertron went hungry. Friday's Best

 Jerome Owens ran for 183 yards and scored three touchdowns Friday night to 
lead Brea-Olinda past Troy, 28-7, in a nonleague game at Brea-Olinda High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats (2-1) scored 28 points after falling behind, 7-0, after Troy 
scored on its first possession.But the Warriors (2-1) were unable to stop Owens 
all night and the junior running back scored Brea's final three touchdowns to 
blow the game open, scoring on two three-yard runs and a one-yard plunge. 
</P>
<P>
 Owens' longest run from scrimmage was 27 yards. He also completed a 31-yard 
pass to Andy Wirz during the Wildcats' final scoring drive. During the 10 play, 
88-yard drive, Owens was responsible for 72 of those yards. 
</P>
<P>
 In a battle of running backs, Troy's Larry Montgomery ran for 93 yards in 22 
carries. The teams combined to pass for only 125 yards in 20 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 Troy's touchdown came on a two-yard run by Ryl Relatores. Brea answered with a 
38-yard run by quarterback Matt Kalcevich, who rushed for 84 yards in nine 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Troy's last threat was stopped by an interception at the goal line by Mike 
Beamer with three minutes remaining in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Kalcevich, who threw for only 54 yards on seven attempts, had runs of 38 and 
32 yards and finished with 84 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats shut down Troy's passing game, limiting the Warriors to 40 yards 
in 11 attempts. TONY ALTOBELLI

PREP EXTRA / SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; SANTA MARGARITA TOPS HUNTINGTON BEACH 
FOR FIRST VICTORY

<P>
 Santa Margarita forced five Huntington Beach turnovers and picked up its first 
victory, 17-7, Friday night at Saddleback College. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles started junior transfer quarterback Kevin McNeil.On his first and 
only pass of the game, he connected on a seam pass to Brian Griffin, who headed 
down the sideline for a 63-yard touchdown with 3:05 left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Two plays later, Oiler quarterback David Yadrick returned the favor, and tied 
the score, 7-7, when he hit tight end Billy Campbell for a 78-yard touchdown 
with 1:39 left in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Margarita took a 10-7 lead with 5:40 left in the half on a 22-yard field 
goal by Ryan Korinke. An interception by Griffin set up the score. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles' final score came on a controversial call as defensive back David 
Munoz intercepted a pass from Yadrick with six seconds remaining in the half 
and returned it 43 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Oiler players and coaches thought the ball had bounced. So did Munoz, who sat 
on the ground momentarily before heading for the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't had any breaks in a while," Santa Margarita Coach Jim Hartigan 
said. "Tonight, we got some and we created some. It's just great to get a win." 
</P>
<P>
 McNeil, who transferred from the New Mexico Military Institute and played last 
week for Santa Margarita's junior varsity team, led the Eagles' running game 
with 16 carries for 41 yards. Griffin and Munoz each had two interceptions.

PREP EXTRA / SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; GARDENA SERRA OVERWHELMS DANA HILLS, 
33-11 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Something happened to that successful formula Dana Hills used in the first 
half of its nonleague game Friday night against Gardena Serra. 
</P>
<P>
 And when Serra realized it had the Dolphins (0-3) on the run, it turned up the 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 The speedy Cavaliers rallied to rout Dana Hills, 33-11, in front of 
approximately 3,000 at Serra. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Hills led, 11-6, at halftime, but Serra shut out the Dolphins, 27-0, in 
the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cavaliers (2-1) relied on several big plays in the second half, with 
running backs Ademole Turner and Ricky Boyer providing the biggest. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner returned a fumble by the Dolphins' Randy Hein 98 yards for the go-ahead 
touchdown with 7 minutes 6 seconds to play in the third quarter. That gave 
Serra a 12-11 lead, which is all it would need. Turner also scored Serra's 
first touchdown with a 50-yard run in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyer gained 134 yards in only eight carries, and dashed the Dolphins' hopes 
of a rally with a 94-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter. The extra point 
gave Serra a 27-6 lead with 10:06 remaining in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolphin quarterback Scott Maynard completed 12 of 28 passes for 118 yards with 
one touchdown and one interception. He combined with John Morgan on a 40-yard 
touchdown pass with 1:22 to play in the second quarter. Eric Knip completed a 
two-point conversion to Ilan Katz to give Dana Hills its 11-6 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Knip opened the game's scoring with a 40-yard field goal at the 2:32 mark of 
the first quarter. After halftime, however, Dana Hills could not move the ball 
consistently. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Hein rushed 15 times for 57 yards to lead Dana Hills.

 Century turned three Ocean View turnovers into touchdowns and knocked off the 
Seahawks, 39-13, in a nonleague game Friday at Westminster High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View did not get past the Century 40-yard line until the final seven 
minutes of the game and managed only 149 yards in offense.The Seahawks have 
lost 32 consecutive games, the longest losing streak in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither team scored in the first quarter, but the Centurions took command in 
the second quarter with three touchdowns in a seven-minute span. 
</P>
<P>
 Century's Richard Roa set up the first, recovering a fumble by running back 
Calvin Silva at the Seahawk 6. Robert Villegas plunged in from the one three 
plays later and Century led, 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
 On their next possession, Centurion quarterback Stanley Villanueva completed a 
57-yard pass to Ignacio Vega to the Ocean View 22. The Centurions scored when 
Villanueva found Jorge Rodriguez in the flat for a 20-yard touchdown. Oscar 
Salcedo increased the Century lead, intercepting a Ted Norman pass on the next 
play from scrimmage and returning it 31 yards for a 19-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Century padded the lead to 32-0 in the third quarter. Villanueva connected 
with Rodriguez on a 40-yard scoring play, and Luis Ramirez added a touchdown on 
a 31-yard fumble return. ERIC MADDY

<P>
 Bachy Gonzalez and Jeff Perry paced an Estancia ground game that ran past 
visiting Calvary Chapel, 24-6, at Newport Harbor on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez led all rushers with 99 yards in 14 carries, while Perry collected 
both of the Eagles' rushing touchdowns from a yard out. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defense has played good all three weeks and it's getting better," 
Estancia Coach John Liebengood said. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvary Chapel (2-1) started slowly, turning the ball over on its 1-yard line 
on its first possession. Perry converted the first of his one-yard scoring 
efforts just two plays later, giving Estancia a 7-0 lead just 4 minutes 11 
seconds into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry lost control of the ball at the goal line late in the second quarter, 
but Joe Flores pounced on it in the end zone to put Estancia ahead, 21-0, just 
before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Estancia's William Trabazo returned a fumble 60 yards for an apparent 
touchdown just before halftime, but the play was nullified when Calvary 
Chapel's Mark Echan was ruled to have been tackled before he lost the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Nash scored on a 35-yard run on the next play for Calvary Chapel (2-1). 
Nash finished the game with 93 yards rushing in 17 carries. MATT FARMER

<P>
 La Quinta not only defeated Aliso Niguel, 14-7, Friday night, but the Aztecs 
helped Coach Fred Valko's wish come true: "We just have to get into the end 
zone," Valko said before the game. 
</P>
<P>
 After 42-0 and 31-0 losses to Westminster and Estancia in the season's first 
two games, La Quinta didn't waste any time Friday scoring its first points of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Alejandro ran the opening kickoff 79 yards to Aliso Niguel's one-yard 
line. Three plays later, Larry Tiger scored, 95 seconds into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 With 33 seconds left in the half, La Quinta added a touchdown on a three-yard 
pass from C.J. Livernois to James Nguyen, capping a seven-play drive. The drive 
started when La Quinta's Mike Daniels recovered Joe Valenti's fumble on Aliso 
Niguel's 25-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 Aliso Niguel threatened just before halftime when Scott Nemeth connected with 
Valenti on a 45-yard pass to La Quinta's 32-yard line with five seconds 
remaining. Nemeth's first-down pass fell incomplete at the gun. 
</P>
<P>
 The only other score came with just over six minutes to go in the game. 
Valenti ran it in from the nine on fourth and three. Aliso Niguel was aided by 
a pass interference call that gave the Wolverines a first down at the 15-yard 
line. CATHY LALKO

 The stakes have changed, but the Mission Viejo-El Toro rivalry remains the 
same. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo has moved from the South Coast League to the Sea View League 
this year, but that didn't lessen the intensity as El Toro eked out a 10-3 
victory Friday night in front of 2,500 at Trabuco Hills High. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Chargers (2-1), it was their second straight victory over the Diablos 
(1-2), who lead the overall series, 13-10.  
</P>
<P>
 "I would've liked to score some more points offensively but defensively we 
were real good tonight," Chargers Coach Mike Milner said. "Going in I knew we 
were ready to play." 
</P>
<P>
 But among those not ready was Mission Viejo back Todd Fielding, who was 
nursing a sprained right ankle. Without him, the Diablos netted had minus-three 
yards rushing but avoided the shutout on Mark Fiore's 20-yard field goal with 
9:07 left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 It appeared the first half would go scoreless until the Chargers, who were 
punting, got the ball back at the Diablos' 37 after Mission Viejo was penalized 
for too many men on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Brian Wilson wasted little time in passing to Josh Tiplady for 
nine and 40 yards. Then with 53 seconds remaining, he threw 14 yards to Merle 
Sango, who made a spinning catch. Chad Johnson's extra point made it 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's 26-yard field goal -- after an 11-play, 53-yard drive to open the 
second half -- gave El Toro a 10-0 lead. Then the defense did the rest. MICHAEL

 Marina quarterback Matt Roberson passed for 133 yards and a touchdown, and 
running back Micah Harrison rushed for 49 yards to lead the Vikings to a 23-12 
victory over Sunny Hills Friday night in a nonleague game at Buena Park High. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings (3-0) scored on their first possession of the game as kicker Peter 
Mignosa drilled a 42-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers stumbled in the first quarter, however, committing a series of 
errors. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunny Hills quarterback Greg Garand fumbled two snaps and had two passes 
intercepted in the quarter. The Lancers had six turnovers in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings capped a six-play, 50-yard drive after Garand's second fumble as 
Roberson scrambled five yards for the touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers scored with one second left in the first half, as Gerand ran a 
10-yard sweep into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sunny Hills' offense gained momentum in the third quarter, putting 
together an 11-play, 75-yard drive. Garand scored again, on a one-yard dive 
into the end zone, to bring the Lancers to within four points. 
</P>
<P>
 On a fourth-and-three play from midfield, the Vikings gained a first down on a 
fake punt. On the next play, Roberson hit wide receiver Joe Borzoni with a 
35-yard touchdown pass to cap a four-play, 46-yard drive. MICHAEL LYNCH

ERRORS

<TEXT>
<P>
 The mistakes came early and all too often Friday night for Laguna Beach, as 
visiting Orange Lutheran rolled to a 45-7 nonleague victory at Guyer Field. 
</P>
<P>
 Two lost fumbles early in the first quarter put the Artists behind, 14-0, six 
minutes into the game.Orange Lutheran quarterback Joe Juliano opened the 
scoring with a 10-yard run. Minutes later, the Lancers recovered a second 
fumble on the Artists' 25, to set up Matt Stratton's eventual one-yard plunge. 
</P>
<P>
 Juliano teamed with Dan Young on a 50-yard pass play to put Orange Lutheran in 
scoring position at the Artists' 19. Stratton's 16-yard run set up his second 
touchdown -- from the one for a 21-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Stratton rushed for a game-high 146 yards as the Lancers rolled up 360 yards 
in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Lutheran's Carlos Glade returned another loose ball to the Artists' 30. 
Three plays later, Orange Lutheran's Che Holloway ran five yards for a 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Juliano had a hand in the final 14 points of the first half, running in a 
score from the 20, and throwing for another. His 17-yard strike to Aaron Kenny 
came after Orange Lutheran called a timeout with eight seconds left in the 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach scored in the third quarter on Aaron Chesley 11-yard run. 
Stratton's 38-yard field goal closed out Orange Lutheran's scoring. RICK

PREP EXTRA / SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; FOUNTAIN VALLEY CLOSE FOR MUCH OF GAME, 
BUT CAN'T STOP OCEANSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Fountain Valley never looked in sync Friday night, but somehow it was able to 
stay close to a bigger and quicker Oceanside team for nearly three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Oceanside (2-1) converted on a fake punt with two minutes left in the 
third quarter, the demoralized Barons lost contact and never regained it, 
losing, 24-10, to the ninth-ranked team in San Diego County in front of about 
2,000 at Oceanside High. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley trailed, 17-10, when Oceanside punter Joey Bombolis threw to 
wideout David Reyes for 23 yards on a fourth and six on Fountain Valley's 
47-yard line. Three plays later, Oceanside running Marcus Cedra bulled in from 
the 10 and made it 24-10 with 25 seconds left in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley Coach George Berg called the trickery more of an alert play 
than a fake punt. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't have enough guys on the field," Berg said. "It's tough to cover 
somebody when you don't have enough players on the field." 
</P>
<P>
 The Barons (1-2) played the rest of the game as if they were shorthanded. They 
recorded only one more first down and that was given to them on an Oceanside 
pass interference penalty on fourth down. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley actually led, 10-9, with 7:36 left in the third quarter when 
quarterback Chris Ponchak dived over from the two on an option run. But 
Oceanside quarterback Jeremy Westbrook (7 for 19, 193 yards, two touchdowns) 
struck quickly by hitting William Layne on the sideline. Layne avoided a 
defender and raced 54 yards for the touchdown. A halfback option pass gave 
Oceanside a two-point conversion and a 17-10 lead.

O'BRIEN TAKES ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN STRIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marc O'Brien isn't too impressed with his early-season success at quarterback 
for Fullerton College. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien, a sophomore from Valencia High, completed 17 of 22 passes for 275 
yards for two touchdowns and rushed for another to help the Hornets to a 39-39 
tie with Mt. San Antonio two weeks ago. Mt. San Antonio was the No. 1 team in 
the J.C. Grid-Wire national rankings. 
</P>
<P>
 The tie earned unranked Fullerton and O'Brien some early-season attention, but 
he has kept it in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people were making a big deal out of the first game," O'Brien said. "But 
we have nine games left and if I have a bad game I'm right back on the bench." 
</P>
<P>
 Being on the sideline at Fullerton is something O'Brien knows plenty about. He 
was a two-year starter at Valencia High before coming to Fullerton. He had 
helped the Tigers to a Southern Section semifinal game as a junior in 1990. In 
1991, Valencia went 14-0, and won a section title. 
</P>
<P>
 "At Valencia they don't even know how to spell the word 'loss,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien got letters from several colleges while in high school but no 
scholarship offers, so he came to Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 At Fullerton, O'Brien competed with Josh Nelson for the starting job. O'Brien 
lost out and decided to be a redshirt because Nelson was also a freshman. 
O'Brien spent last season watching Nelson and learning more about the Fullerton 
system. This fall, Nelson moved to the University of Mississippi where he is 
starting and O'Brien moved into the Hornet lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike many quarterbacks, O'Brien works out often with weights. He started 
lifting in high school because Valencia Coach Mike Marrujo stresses it.  
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien continued working out at Fullerton and was lifting as many as six days 
a week during the off-season, but he has cut back to three days during the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien's father, John, also has helped push him to hit the weights and the 
books. The elder O'Brien can still bench-press more than his son and often 
reminds Marc of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad's a lift-a-holic," Marc said. But it's not just muscle being stressed 
at the O'Brien home. Mark plans to major in engineering at a four-year college 
and has concentrated on math at Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 "Math's not really my thing," Marc O'Brien said. "But my dad has his master's 
in math so he has helped me a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 In today's Mission Conference games: 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino (1-0) vs. Fullerton (0-0-1), CS Fullerton, 7 p.m. -- This figures to 
be a game dominated by offense. El Camino, ranked 15th in the nation by the 
J.C. Grid-Wire, beat Rancho Santiago, 55-28, two weeks ago. Both teams had a 
bye last Saturday. Fullerton Coach Gene Murphy said his team must get pressure 
on El Camino quarterback Steve Sarkisian, who threw for 433 yards against 
Rancho Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago (0-1) vs. Palomar (1-0), San Marcos HS, 1:30 p.m. -- Palomar, 
the defending J.C. Grid-Wire national champion, comes in with a 22-game winning 
streak. Rancho Santiago must improve on defense to have a chance. The Dons gave 
up 609 yards and 55 points in a loss to El Camino two weeks ago. Palomar had 
685 yards in its 58-24 victory over Los Angeles Pierce. Ernie Wilson rushed for 
127 yards for Rancho Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
 Cerritos (1-0) at Saddleback (0-1), 7 p.m. -- Saddleback played poorly for a 
half in its 21-20 season-opening loss to Long Beach last Saturday. But the 
Gauchos' offense and defense showed improvement in the second half. Cerritos 
beat Orange Coast, 35-31, in its opener.  
</P>
<P>
 Golden West (0-1-1) at San Diego Mesa (0-1), 6 p.m. -- Golden West rallied for 
a 35-35 tie against Pasadena last week. The Rustlers, usually a conservative 
offensive team, had 555 yards in total offense against Pasadena. Quarterback 
Brian Schneider was 25 of 51 for 354 yards and three touchdowns.

GRAGNANO TO START FOR CHAPMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Quarterback Curtis Robinson may have had the most impressive performance in 
Chapman football history last Saturday, but he won't get the start tonight in 
the Panthers' home opener against Claremont-Mudd. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, who accounted for more than half of Chapman's total offense and all 
of its touchdowns in a 30-13 victory over Whittier, suffered a mildly separated 
shoulder on the second play of the game. He practiced sparingly this week and 
his status is day to day, Chapman Coach Ken Visser said. 
</P>
<P>
 That means Todd Gragnano will start. Gragnano played in three series during 
the Whittier game, completing six of 13 passes for 87 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 He led the Panthers on a short drive that ended with a 27-yard field goal by 
Bill Hamlin in the second quarter and moved the ball from the Panther 20 to the 
Whittier two-yard line before the drive stalled. 
</P>
<P>
 On second and goal from the five, Dave Poltl caught Gragnano's pass but was 
knocked out of the end zone. Hamlin's 22-yard field goal attempt was blocked. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the night, Gragnano, a former Los Alamitos standout who played at 
Nebraska, was relegated to watching Robinson. Robinson passed for 171 yards and 
two touchdowns and rushed for 101 yards and two more scores. 
</P>
<P>
 "Robinson was hot and you don't want to mess that up," Visser said. "When 
someone's on a roll, you let him keep going." 
</P>
<P>
 Whoever is playing quarterback figures to test Claremont-Mudd, which gave up 
453 yards in total offense in a 37-34 loss to Cal Lutheran on Saturday. The 
Stags, however, are much improved over last season when they went 1-6-1 and 
ended 22-game losing and 25-game winless streaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback John Shipp, a former Westminster High and Golden West College 
player, gained 428 yards in total offense against Cal Lutheran. He passed for 
377 yards and four touchdowns and rushed for 51 yards, including a one-yard 
touchdown that gave the Stags a 34-30 lead late in the game. Notes 
</P>
<P>
 An overflow crowd is expected for the 7 p.m. game against Claremont-Mudd. The 
stadium holds about 2,500 and all the tickets were sold by noon Friday. . . . 
President Jim Doti, Trustees George Argyros and Ernie Chapman, who played for 
the last Panther football team in 1932, are scheduled to perform the ceremonial 
coin toss before the game.

ETHNICITY OF O.C. HEALTH BOARD FOCUS OF PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County Board of Supervisors is the target of a federal civil rights 
investigation into allegations that it excluded Latinos from serving on the 
governing board of a new agency responsible for health care services to the 
county's poor. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services officials said the investigation 
was prompted by a complaint filed last year by local Latino leaders, who were 
angered that the seven-member board appointed to manage Orange County's OPTIMA 
program lacked even a single Latino, even though several were recommended to 
the supervisors for consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 Since a "substantial number" of the estimated 300,000 county residents OPTIMA 
expects to serve will be Latino, officials with the League of United Latin 
American Citizens complained to federal officials that the supervisors' 
appointment process "constitutes discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
 In a Sept. 14 letter to LULAC in Santa Ana, federal officials stated they 
would investigate the charges, and advise LULAC of their findings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finally, there will be public access to what we think is a very secretive and 
discriminatory process," said Arturo Montez, president of LULAC's Santa Ana 
chapter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Board of Supervisors will now have to explain to the people of Orange 
County the process they use to appoint people for service on boards and 
commissions. I think we'll find that those appointments are not a reflection of 
the electorate." 
</P>
<P>
 Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley said Friday that he had not been 
notified of the investigation, but was "confident that the allegations were not 
true." 
</P>
<P>
 "I spent a helluva lot of time on this process," Riley said. "I don't know of 
any other project on which I have spent more time. When we were reviewing 
candidates, I was not looking at nationality, or whether they were Catholics or 
Jews. I was thinking about who was the best qualified." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Latino leaders first raised objections to the board's ethnic 
makeup last August, when some doctors urged supervisors to review the selection 
process and add a Latino physician to the agency's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Dr. Robert R. Beltran sent a letter to supervisors in which he 
expressed outrage that none of the seven chosen for the OPTIMA board were 
Latino physicians experienced in working with the heavily Latino population of 
county Medi-Cal patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "This (OPTIMA) board will be overseeing (the provision of health care to) a 
populace which will be comprised of not less than 80% Hispanics," Beltran wrote 
to the supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 OPTIMA is designed as one of the country's largest county health maintenance 
organizations. The system promises more efficient delivery of health care to 
the poor and depends largely on attracting the services of physicians by 
offering prompt and reliable payment -- something doctors have long complained 
that Medi-Cal fails to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder, a prime backer of the OPTIMA experiment, could 
not be reached for comment Friday. However, she has previously indicated that 
Latinos "had the opportunity to participate, and they were not at the table." 
</P>
<P>
 Of 128 people who applied for positions on the OPTIMA board, only three were 
Latinos, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley said Friday that he would stand by the board's selection process and 
would not support any attempt to reopen the matter. Of the Latinos who did 
apply, Riley said he believed all were given "fair consideration." 
</P>
<P>
 "It appeared to me that the process was open to any interested party," Riley 
said. "If the process was reopened, I would think the current board members 
would have every right to object. In my opinion, there could not have been a 
more fair evaluation." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with the federal Department of Health and Human Services' Office for 
Civil Rights declined to comment Friday on the letter acknowledging its intent 
to investigate the selection process. 
</P>
<P>
 LULAC's Montez, however, said the supervisors' process of selection amounted 
to a "policy of exclusion" for Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we first came forward with our concerns about this," Montez said, "they 
took a very hostile attitude." How New Health Plan Works 
</P>
<P>
 The OPTIMA Plan, targeted to go into effect in mid-1995, will replace Medi-Cal 
benefits and is expected to serve more than 250,000 people in Orange County. 
The plan at a glance: 
</P>
<P>
 * Eligibility: Those who qualify for Medi-Cal will be eligible for OPTIMA. 
</P>
<P>
 * Managed care: As in a health maintenance organization, patients will be 
assigned a primary care physician, who in turn will refer them to specialists. 
</P>
<P>
 * Patient contribution: Will depend on ability to pay, as with Medi-Cal. 
</P>
<P>
 * Doctor fees: Primary care physicians will receive a flat monthly fee per 
patient seen, regardless of the number of patient visits. Fees have not yet 
been established. Under Medi-Cal, doctors are paid by the state after treating 
each patient. 
</P>
<P>
 * Funding: Medi-Cal is expected to allocate more than $450 million to OPTIMA 
to start with, about the same as Medi-Cal costs in 1991.

RODNEY KING'S LAWYERS BILL CITY: $4 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN L. MITCHELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Attorneys for Rodney G. King are asking the city to pay $4.4 million in legal 
fees to settle the bill for King's civil rights lawsuit -- an amount exceeding 
the $3.8 million that a jury awarded King last spring to compensate him for the 
1991 beating by Los Angeles police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The lion's share of the bill is from attorneys Milton Grimes ($2 million) and 
Steven A. Lerman ($1.2 million), who at various times have each been King's 
primary counsel. In addition, civil rights attorney John Burris and medical 
malpractice attorney Federico Sayre have each billed the city for $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials, who believe that they should pay no more than $1 million in 
legal fees, say the claims are preposterously high, are duplicative and in some 
cases represent work that was irrelevant to the case. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, some attorneys for King are asking to be compensated for the 
hours they spent in interviews with the news media, in appearances on the Oprah 
Winfrey and Phil Donahue television shows and, in one case, attending the 
premiere in Oakland of a three-hour movie about Malcolm X. 
</P>
<P>
 Under federal law, plaintiffs who prevail in civil rights cases are entitled 
to have legal fees paid by the defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 In a court hearing scheduled for next month, U.S. District Judge John G. 
Davies, who heard the King civil rights suit, will determine how big the legal 
tab should be.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's an incredible, staggering amount of money to ask for," said Don W. 
Vincent, supervising deputy city attorney.  
</P>
<P>
 Even veteran civil rights attorney Stephen Yagman, who has made a career out 
of suing law enforcement agencies on behalf of beating victims, believes that 
the fee requests are out of line.  
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody should hold their breath on this one," Yagman said. "It's not in the 
cards that the court is going to award that amount in legal fees. . . . It 
seems to me that the amounts are a bit inflated." 
</P>
<P>
 The case holds a different reality for those who represented King during the 
three years between the time the civil suit was filed and the verdict was won 
after a 2 1/2-month trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of blood, sweat and tears between the lines of these fee 
motions," said Lerman, who at one point was fired by King but is now again his 
chief lawyer. "I only wish that I could be compensated for the emotional effort 
I put in the Rodney King case. . . . The case took over my life. I had to put 
the rest of my practice on hold."  
</P>
<P>
 Lerman was King's first attorney after an amateur video operator captured the 
famous beating March 3, 1991, that catapulted King into the world spotlight. 
The announcement of not guilty verdicts for four LAPD officers on criminal 
charges by a Superior Court jury in 1992 triggered the Los Angeles riots. In 
1993 a federal court jury convicted two of the policemen, Sgt. Stacey C. Koon 
and Officer Laurence M. Powell, of criminally violating King's civil rights. 
They are serving 30-month prison sentences.  
</P>
<P>
 While Lerman put together King's early medical evaluation-and-treatment team 
and laid the foundation for his lawsuit, much of his time was also spent 
dealing with the media. 
</P>
<P>
 But legal experts say the court is not likely to compensate attorneys for time 
spent answering questions from the press. 
</P>
<P>
 "It undercuts the notion that cases are to be tried in the court but not in 
the press," said Jeffrey Brand, a law professor at the University of San 
Francisco. "The test is whether it reasonably relates to the litigation." 
</P>
<P>
 After King fired Lerman, he hired Grimes. When numerous attempts at reaching 
an out-of-court settlement with the city proved unsuccessful, Grimes hired a 
team of nearly 20 lawyers, including Oakland civil rights attorney Burris and 
medical malpractice attorney Sayre. The change in legal teams and long delays 
led to increased costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Grimes' services being challenged by the city are travel with King 
around the country and expenses paid to tutor his client about African American 
history and culture -- an effort to prepare King for trial and make him a more 
attractive public figure. 
</P>
<P>
 Responded Grimes: "It was important for me to help give him a sense of his own 
self-worth, to help him gain some self-esteem and appreciation of who he was 
and what King has meant to people." 
</P>
<P>
 After winning the civil suit, King fired Grimes, concerned that his 
multimillion-dollar court award could be eaten away by excessive bills from 
lawyers, doctors, private investigators and others. He rehired Lerman, who said 
he will administer disbursement of King's jury award. The City Council has 
approved paying the award but King has yet to receive the check. 
</P>
<P>
 The city attorney's office has petitioned the judge to waive all legal fees, 
arguing that normal civil rights provisions should not apply in this case. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal civil rights laws require that attorney fees be paid to any victorious 
plaintiff. The intent is to compensate for the fact that civil rights cases are 
often unpopular, and attorneys are often hard to attract. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Atty. Vincent argues that the King case is an exception because it 
has always been attractive to lawyers as a potential gold mine. 
</P>
<P>
 King lawyer Burris said the city's position is hypocritical. After all, he 
argued, in its defense the city stressed that King was an unattractive 
defendant: an ex-felon who had contributed to his own beating by being arrested 
after a drunken high-speed chase. "This was not a slam dunk," Burris said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that the defense could have been less expensive if King had 
maintained a consistent counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the case had been properly managed at the outset, it would have required 
only three or four attorneys to try the case," he said.

PANETTA REASSIGNS SEVERAL TOP WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS; PRESIDENCY: CHIEF OF STAFF 
AVOIDS ANY FIRINGS. PRESS SECRETARY MYERS' JOB IS SAVED AFTER SHE LOBBIES 
CLINTON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. BRODER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta on Friday announced a long-awaited 
White House staff reshuffle in which a number of top officials were reassigned, 
while Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers won the added title of assistant to the 
President with a daring end run around Panetta. 
</P>
<P>
 After 88 days of White House suspense, intrigue, leaks and rumors of rolling 
heads, Panetta rendered his final verdict on Friday. Yes, he admitted, the 
Clinton White House had made errors, but he and President Clinton agreed that 
the solution was not to fire anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton in June replaced former Chief of Staff Thomas F. "Mack the Nice" 
McLarty with former California congressman and budget director Panetta, whom he 
gave a broad mandate to clean up the sloppy White House operation. 
</P>
<P>
 But when it came time to use the whip hand, Clinton and Panetta appear to have 
flinched, settling for an organizational shuffle rather than the wholesale 
house cleaning that many inside and outside the White House had recommended and 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
 And Panetta was undercut by Clinton himself, who responded to Myers' direct 
appeal to save her job by creating a more influential role for the first woman 
White House press secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the players involved in the shuffle are virtually unknown to the 
public, so much of the speculation before Friday's announcement centered on 
Myers. 
</P>
<P>
 After weeks of rumors that she would be forced out in an effort to solve 
Clinton's perceived communications problems, Myers engaged Thursday night in a 
bit of last-minute bureaucratic legerdemain to save her job by appealing over 
Panetta's head directly to Clinton, who rewarded his loyal aide with greater 
access, a bigger office and more money. She reportedly threatened to quit if 
she were demoted, as Panetta was proposing. 
</P>
<P>
 Several White House aides said Thursday that Panetta had decided that Myers 
should be replaced by the chief State Department spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, 
a veteran of numerous Democratic presidential campaigns and Senate offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta denied those reports on Friday, saying that he and the President have 
"full confidence" in Myers. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the younger staff members at the White House were delighted that the 
33-year-old Myers, a hip and sassy Valencia, Calif., native, was not to be 
replaced by yet another white male. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was seen as a huge win for Dee Dee," one staffer crowed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Myers' fate may not yet be settled. Officials said her newly enhanced 
status may be only a temporary face-saving move and that she may depart around 
the end of the year and be replaced by McCurry or someone else. 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta said her job was "permanent as far as the President and I are 
concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, McCurry said he was delighted and relieved to be remaining at 
the State Department, where he said he enjoys "one of the very best jobs in 
Washington." 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing the changes, Panetta lauded the dedication, hard work and long 
hours of the White House staff, but said that in addition to some noteworthy 
achievements, the staff had been responsible for quite a few foul-ups. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he didn't cite any specifics, the chief of staff may have been 
thinking of the botched travel office firings, the use of a White House 
helicopter for a golf outing, questionable contacts between the White House and 
Treasury Department over the Whitewater investigation and several legislative 
near-disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was . . . clear at the time I took this job that additional steps needed 
to be taken to improve the efficiency and the effectiveness of the White 
House," Panetta said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta promised that the reorganization will bring more "discipline," better 
"judgment" and greater "focus" to the Clinton White House. 
</P>
<P>
 A chief goal of the staff changes appears to have been to limit access to the 
Oval Office, which until now has been enjoyed by several senior staffers and 
longtime Clinton loyalists. 
</P>
<P>
 George Stephanopoulos, for example, will no longer be senior adviser to the 
President but rather executive assistant to the chief of staff, reporting to 
Panetta rather than Clinton. It was unclear whether his actual duties will 
change, because his political and policy advice is highly prized by the 
President. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Lindsey, a longtime Arkansas friend and former law partner of Clinton's, 
has been reassigned from a nebulous adviser's job to the White House counsel's 
office, where he will be a deputy. But nothing will prevent Clinton from 
picking up the phone to pick Lindsey's brain, as he does regularly. 
</P>
<P>
 Most other White House aides will likewise find their chain of command altered 
by Panetta, reporting to him through one of two deputies. Harold M. Ickes, 
currently deputy chief of staff, will become deputy chief of staff for policy 
and political affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House officials responsible for political and Cabinet affairs, 
public and intergovernmental liaison and paperwork flow will report to Ickes. 
</P>
<P>
 A new appointee, Erskine Bowles, will move from the directorship of the Small 
Business Administration to become deputy chief of staff for White House 
operations. The offices of scheduling, administration and personnel will report 
to Bowles, as will the new director of Oval Office operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowles replaces deputy chief of staff Philip Lader, who is taking Bowles' old 
job at the SBA. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark D. Gearan, formerly director of communications, will become coordinator 
for communications and strategy, reporting directly to Panetta. He's yielding 
his spacious West Wing office to Myers, who becomes a full assistant to the 
President, a promotion from her previous title of deputy assistant.

BILL TO OVERHAUL PHONE INDUSTRY DIES IN SENATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE HELM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A hotly debated measure to overhaul the nation's telecommunications laws died 
in the Senate on Friday, dealing the Clinton Administration another domestic 
policy blow and possibly delaying introduction of new telephone and cable 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 The House earlier this year passed a telecommunications reform bill by an 
overwhelming margin, and until a few weeks ago many observers had expected the 
Senate to pass a bill this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation, designed to introduce competition into telephone and cable 
television markets still controlled by monopolies, would have marked the first 
comprehensive reform of communications law in 60 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Local phone companies would have gained broad authority to offer cable TV 
programming, while cable TV companies would have been permitted to offer 
telephone service in all states -- though consumers would not have seen such 
services develop for several years. The powerful regional Bell telephone 
companies, such as Pacific Telesis, would have been allowed to offer 
long-distance telephone service. 
</P>
<P>
 There is general agreement that reforms that would spur competition are 
desirable in an age of rapidly advancing technology: They would create 
incentives for industry to invest billions of dollars in new facilities and 
services and eventually give consumers more choices and lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
 But there has for years been intense controversy over which markets should be 
opened to competition first and under what conditions. Senate Commerce 
Committee Chairman Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.) spent much of the summer trying 
to broker a compromise among the many warring factions, but he said Friday that 
time had run out for this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will be unable to pass comprehensive telecommunications reform legislation 
in this Congress," said Hollings, angrily blaming the bill's failure on 
obstinate regional Bell companies and partisan opposition from Senate Minority 
Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.). 
</P>
<P>
 The Bell companies, local telephone companies that were until 1984 part of 
AT&T, are eager to provide long-distance phone service in competition with 
AT&T, MCI and others. But they objected to provisions in the Senate bill that 
would have kept them from offering such services until competition developed in 
the local phone business, and they were also concerned about competition from 
cable. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration, which has made the development of an advanced 
information infrastructure a major part of its agenda, said it would continue 
to push for deregulation of the telecommunications industry through regulatory 
and other means. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a setback," said Larry Irving, assistant secretary at the National 
Telecommunications and Information Administration. "The regulatory certainty 
that would have driven investment won't be there. But the Information Highway 
is going to be built." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sooner or later Congress will pass legislation that memorializes the clear, 
irrevocable commitment to competition in all communications markets," added 
Federal Communications Commission Chairman Reed E. Hundt, speaking to an 
industry conference in Seattle via satellite from Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 Irving joined Hollings in blaming the Bell companies for their intransigence. 
"You don't need any forensic evidence to know who killed this bill," Irving 
said. "They played a bait-and-switch game, cutting a deal then coming back for 
something else. You can understand Hollings' frustration." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to sound corny but the biggest losers are probably the 
consumers," said Stephen Yanis, telecommunications analyst for Kidder Peabody. 
"Any of the versions (of the bill) would have led to more services and lower 
prices." 
</P>
<P>
 The telecommunications revolution won't grind to a halt. Many states already 
permit the type of competition that the federal legislation would have 
mandated. Phone companies are already improving their networks so they can 
offer such services as two-way television. Many cable companies are preparing 
to offer local phone service. And the Bell companies hope to gain entry into 
the long-distance business through the courts if they can't get there through 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 But change will likely come more slowly now. "There are 40 states that 
prohibit competitors in the local exchange," said Gerald M. Lowrie, senior vice 
president of AT&T and the companies chief lobbyist. "Without requirements for 
them to open up we'll have to slug it out (state by state). It will be a 
sluggish process." 
</P>
<P>
 A key difference between the House and Senate versions of telecommunications 
reform was a Senate provision that would have required Bells to offer "dial 
parity" before being allowed into the long-distance market. That means 
customers would be able to switch from their local phone company to a 
competitor without changing telephone numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollings accused Bell companies of lack of faith for jointly agreeing to 
central features of the bill and then turning around and pushing for further 
changes. BellSouth and Ameritech, in particular, sent letters to their 
shareholders or employees criticizing the legislation. Hollings said the rush 
of proposed amendments could not be handled before the Oct. 7 adjournment. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollings also blamed Dole for being unwilling to allow the bill to move 
forward without substantial, "non-negotiable" revisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Stowe, vice president of Washington operations for Pacific Telesis, the 
parent company of Pacific Bell, denied the Bells had blocked the bill. Rather, 
he said, they had sought compromise, adding that the chief executives of seven 
Bell companies were meeting with Dole to persuade him to reach a compromise 
when they heard of Hollings' decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bells' objections were not to the long-distance provisions, Stowe said, 
but to provisions that would allow cable companies to begin offering phone 
service one year after the law passes without immediately allowing phone 
companies to enter the cable industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The irony of blaming the Bell companies for the bill's failure, said Stowe, is 
that the Bells are the big losers. "The long-distance companies can get into 
local services if they get approval from the states," he said. "We can't get 
into long distance without legislation."

U.S. SEEKS DEALS WITH PRO-JUNTA HAITIAN ELITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH FREED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Senior U.S. officials have initiated large-scale business negotiations with 
some of the most powerful and wealthy Haitian supporters of the military 
overthrow of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, according to Haitian business 
and political sources. 
</P>
<P>
 The secret talks came this week at the same time the United States was 
dismantling the Haitian army and supposedly engineering a new political 
environment to undermine the power of the same anti-democratic elite. 
</P>
<P>
 In one case, the sources said, Lt. Gen. Hugh Shelton, head of the U.S. 
military force that began arriving Monday to pave the way for Aristide's 
restoration, talked with members of Haiti's Mev family about leasing a large 
waterfront plot for construction of fuel storage tanks and a pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mevs, one of the wealthiest families here, acquiesced in the Sept. 30, 
1991, coup and backed the brutal military regime financially, while using its 
connections to profit from the crisis surrounding the Aristide overthrow. 
</P>
<P>
 Other talks have centered on U.S. interest in acquiring land near the 
Port-au-Prince airport owned by the Madsen and D'Adesky families, who are among 
the bitterest foes of Aristide, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The land would be leased by the U.S. military to house troops and facilities 
supporting the 15,000-member occupation force during its stay in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the sources, Shelton not only offered to pay rent for the Mevs' 
land but also proposed turning the storage tanks and the pipeline over to the 
family once U.S. forces are pulled back. 
</P>
<P>
 The Madsens and the D'Adeskys would also keep, free of charge, any 
improvements made to the property. Prices haven't been settled and the deals 
are not yet completed, the sources said, but they could run into the millions 
of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the families could be reached for comment. Stanley Shrager, spokesman 
for the U.S. Embassy, said that while he had no specific knowledge of the 
negotiations, "they are pragmatic and don't imply endorsing any particular 
person or group." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mevs have said they recognize that Aristide has to come back if Haiti is 
to have peace -- a posture that diplomats and other experts say is simply an 
attempt to curry favor with the United States and "position themselves," in the 
words of one Haitian political figure, "to make a buck." 
</P>
<P>
 The Madsens and D'Adeskys, on the other hand, have unambiguously opposed the 
return of Aristide, whose populist and sometimes demagogic politics is seen as 
a threat to the power of what American diplomats call MREs, or Morally 
Repugnant Elite. 
</P>
<P>
 Another powerful family -- one that approached the Americans this week -- is 
headed by Fritz Brandt, who arranged hundreds of millions of dollars in 
assistance to Haiti's military, including the financing of fuel shipments in 
defiance of an international economic embargo. He has also urged the Haitian 
military to resist Aristide's return to the bitter end. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Brandt told a friend that he does not believe the exiled president 
would come back, even when U.S. soldiers began arriving Monday to enforce an 
agreement calling for the resignation of Haiti's military dictators and 
Aristide's restoration. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't until he saw (on television) Aristide receive a 21-gun salute 
during ceremonies in Washington last Wednesday that it dawned on him that 
Aristide is coming back," the friend said. 
</P>
<P>
 The members of these families, and of many more who supported the coup, had 
been singled out by the United States for sanctions that included revocation of 
their American visas and residence permits and suspension of their U.S. bank 
accounts and other American financial holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet their power seems unweakened. This week's negotiations, in fact, 
underlined the hold the elite has on Haiti and its resiliency in the face of 
severe sanctions and international condemnation. 
</P>
<P>
 The families now involved with the Americans are included in a virtual cabal 
with such tight control of the Haitian economy that the international embargo 
imposed to punish the coup supporters actually was an instrument of profit for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, the sanctions exempted food and related products, nearly all of 
which are imported and distributed here by the elite. The Mevs have a 
near-monopoly on sugar, vegetable oil, live chickens and propane. 
</P>
<P>
 They have also been in the cement-importing business with Lt. Col. 
Michel-Joseph Francois, the notorious head of the vicious and corrupt 
Port-au-Prince police. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brandts dominate trade in wheat and rice, the key imported food crops, and 
are also the most powerful bankers in the country, controlling credit and 
currency exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 The Madsens are major landholders and exporters and importers. Their many 
businesses include the bottling of 7-Up and Coca-Cola, Haiti's only brewery and 
its major rum distillery. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people have made enormous profits even as they defied the world," one 
Haitian businessman said. "Now, the Americans, instead of punishing them, are 
going to reward them." 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers say there is no choice for the Americans but an 
ends-justify-the-means policy. "Because of the size (of the elite's empire), it 
would be very difficult for them not to benefit," said a Haitian political 
source who is strongly critical of the role played by the families. 
</P>
<P>
 "They control . . . everything that is necessary for this economy to run. So 
they're going to make money, because the country needs what they have." 
</P>
<P>
 The families themselves, some of whose members told American reporters right 
up until Monday's U.S. troop arrival that they would fight to the death, seem 
to have easily modified their anti-American position. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're taking it nice," said a Haitian who associates with the elite. 
"They've always made a lot of money, and they don't know why they won't do it 
with the Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 When it was suggested that "the Americans" might not want to further such a 
cause, the Haitian guffawed: "Why? They speak English, have beautiful wives, 
nice dinner plates. American officers like good dinners, no?" 
</P>
<P>
 One fast-talking Haitian businessman who smuggled everything from perfume to 
propane tanks to gasoline in violation of the embargo and was given 
high-powered weapons by the military to help fend off American invaders now 
claims to be "happy as I can be." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to get rich," he said, waving his arms in exhilaration and grinning 
with delight. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Americans are going to bring in gasoline, pave the roads, cut tariffs -- 
and I'm going to import cars and sell them by the hundreds." 
</P>

IRATE JUDGE THREATENS TO BAR TV IN SIMPSON CASE; COURTS: ITO AGAIN DENOUNCES 
KNBC REPORTS. AS EVIDENCE HEARINGS CONTINUE, SEIZURE OF BRONCO IS RULED LEGAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON and ANDREA FORD, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito, infuriated by what he called a local 
television station's inaccurate and irresponsible reporting on the O.J. Simpson 
case, threatened Friday to bar the station from the courthouse and said he may 
shut down television coverage of the proceedings altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito's comments marked the second day in a row that he has angrily denounced 
reports stating that a pair of socks retrieved from Simpson's bedroom had been 
sent to a Maryland laboratory and subjected to DNA tests, and that those test 
results pointed to Nicole Brown Simpson as the source of blood on the socks. 
Sources have told The Times that the report, aired by KNBC-TV, was incorrect 
and that no DNA test results have been returned on the socks. 
</P>
<P>
 The flap over press coverage came amid a hearing on evidence in which both 
sides made gains. Ito ruled that a handwritten note from Nicole Simpson to her 
ex-husband should not be suppressed, but also found that police exceeded the 
scope of a warrant when they searched Simpson's home June 28. Because of that, 
he suppressed several other items seized that day, including a communication 
between Simpson and his business lawyer about Simpson's divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 With seven search warrants in dispute, Ito was unable to complete the 
arguments about evidence Friday, but said he expects to take up the matter 
again next week. Jury selection is scheduled to begin Monday, which will mark 
the official opening of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 It comes just over three months after Nicole Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman 
were found slashed to death in front of her Brentwood townhouse. O.J. Simpson 
was charged with both murders, but has pleaded not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 The case has attracted enormous publicity, and Ito has struggled to curtail 
some aspects of the public discussion regarding the case. Although he has 
complained about some reports in the past, this week's dispute was by far the 
most serious and marked the first time he has accused a mainstream news 
organization of making a factual error. 
</P>
<P>
 Joined by attorneys for both sides, Ito first disputed the KNBC reports about 
new DNA evidence during Thursday's hearing. But KNBC amplified its story that 
night, prompting Ito to attack the station and its reporter, Tracie Savage, at 
the opening of Friday's session. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very concerned because this news operation was put on notice yesterday 
that this was incorrect information," Ito said. "They have chosen not only to 
republish it but to embellish upon it. This is fundamentally unfair. It's also 
fundamentally wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking to put the reports to rest, Ito questioned Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia 
Clark about the stories, specifically about KNBC's contention that two 
different DNA tests have been performed on the socks and that they both pointed 
to Nicole Simpson as the source of the blood. One of those tests is known as a 
PCR test, while the other, more definitive analysis is called an RFLP test. 
</P>
<P>
 "KNBC news reporter Savage has reported erroneously that the sock has been 
submitted to a DNA lab for DNA testing," Ito said. "Is that (report) correct, 
Miss Clark. . . ?" 
</P>
<P>
 "That is incorrect," Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They also report incorrectly that two tests have been conducted, that PCR and 
RFLP tests have been conducted and that results have been returned," Ito 
continued. "That is also incorrect?" 
</P>
<P>
 "That is also incorrect," Clark responded. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, KNBC stood firmly behind its story. But in a release Friday, the 
station's management was more circumspect. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will be responding directly to Judge Ito regarding the issues that he 
raised in court today," the statement said. "We share Judge Ito's concern that 
the facts of this case be reported accurately, and we have reported accurately 
the information our sources have told us, just as we have reported accurately 
what happened in court today." 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the KNBC reports, Ito said he would convene a hearing next week 
to consider cutting off the station's access to the Criminal Courts Building 
and to evaluate whether TV coverage of the case should continue at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors and defense attorneys said they would accept whatever solution Ito 
proposed, but news organizations previously have fought for access to hearings 
in the case and are expected to contest this proposal as well. Legal experts 
warned that while Ito's anger is understandable, the judge may have little 
ability to strike back at KNBC. 
</P>
<P>
 Any broader proposal to pull the plug on the televised coverage would 
certainly draw a vehement protest not only from television stations but from 
newspapers and magazines. Because seating in Ito's courtroom is limited, many 
news organizations have been relying on the television coverage to prepare 
their reports on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem for Judge Ito is that to pull the plug on the television would be 
to deny the public access to the most accurate information about the Simpson 
case," said Peter Arenella, a UCLA law professor. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute also prompted defense attorneys to accuse the Los Angeles Police 
Department of conducting an organized attempt to deny Simpson a fair trial. 
They asked Ito to forward the matter to the state attorney general for 
investigation, or at least to seek an LAPD Internal Affairs probe into the 
source of some leaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark, whose office previously has blamed the LAPD for leaks, endorsed defense 
attorney Johnnie L. Cochran Jr.'s suggestion that an Internal Affairs 
investigation be launched. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Police Department, officials privately fumed at the suggestion that 
they were to blame, but released a statement late Friday saying that an 
internal investigation already is under way and that procedures are in place to 
prevent leaks -- including a requirement that test results be transmitted 
directly from the laboratories to Judge Ito.  
</P>
<P>
 "On Sept. 22, 1994, the department initiated an Internal Affairs Division 
investigation to determine if there is a possibility that information may have 
been inappropriately released by any member of the department to the media," 
the statement said. "As in all confidential personnel matters, the department 
cannot address any aspect of its internal investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD also called on prosecutors and defense attorneys to "join in this 
effort by discussing (it) with their personnel who are involved in any manner 
in this investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the first time that Simpson's lawyers have sought to stem the 
information being released about the case. In the weeks before and after 
Simpson's arrest, numerous news reports contained details about the case, 
frustrating defense attorneys who complained that potential jurors should not 
be exposed to that information. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's lawyers blamed the district attorney's office and the Police 
Department for disseminating the information in those reports, many of which 
first appeared in The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 But the latest dispute had added new intensity to the issue because of the 
contention that the KNBC reports were inaccurate and highly inflammatory -- 
especially coming so close to the beginning of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's not even dignify it as a news leak," Ito said of the KNBC report. "It's 
a fabrication." 
</P>
<P>
 As the hearing Friday continued, Ito ruled that a search of Simpson's home was 
reasonable and that a note from Nicole Simpson to her ex-husband was properly 
seized. That note, whose existence had previously been unknown either to 
prosecutors or defense attorneys, was read in court for the first time 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Written in Nicole Simpson's handwriting and attached to family videotapes, the 
note states: "O.J., I understand that this is probably too late, but I have to 
do it for myself and the kids, or I would never forgive myself. I'll call Cathy 
from now on, and will only call in an absolute emergency. Please believe me and 
return these calls immediately." 
</P>
<P>
 A police detective said he seized that note because he believed it suggested 
that Nicole Simpson was ending her relationship with her ex-husband, and thus 
possibly offered a motive for the killings. But Simpson's attorneys read the 
note differently, saying that Nicole Simpson was attempting to keep contact 
with her ex-husband even after their breakup. 
</P>
<P>
 That belies the theory that she was being stalked, said Robert L. Shapiro, one 
of Simpson's lead attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the note, Ito's ruling cleared the way for prosecutors to 
introduce a tape of a television pilot titled "Frogmen." That show features 
Simpson, who at one point holds a knife to a young woman's throat. Police have 
said that Simpson received special knife training from the Navy SEALS in 
preparation for that film, and they seized the tape believing that it would 
help demonstrate how Simpson could have committed the murders. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Ito ruled against the defense's efforts to strike those items, he 
agreed that a few others were taken illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 He ordered those items, which include a communication between Simpson and his 
business lawyer about his divorce from Nicole Simpson, suppressed. Ito also 
found that a note pad containing names and phone numbers should not be admitted 
into evidence, and he similarly ruled out the use of a videotape featuring 
highlights from Simpson's storied football career. 
</P>
<P>
 That defense victory was quickly overshadowed, however, when Ito ruled against 
a defense attempt to contest the seizure of Simpson's Ford Bronco. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bronco was parked outside Simpson's home when police arrived a few hours 
after the killings. One of the detectives said he spotted a small bloodstain 
near the door handle, and it was that stain that officers said was largely 
responsible for them deciding to jump the wall and enter Simpson's estate 
without a warrant. 
</P>
<P>
 When they returned later with a warrant authorizing a search of the car and 
home, they seized the Bronco and subsequently tested it for blood. They also 
seized a number of items from inside the vehicle, including receipts, notes and 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's lawyers argued that the material should not be admitted as evidence. 
The initial warrant was incorrectly drafted, said Gerald F. Uelmen, one of 
Simpson's attorneys. Uelmen added that drafting mistakes cannot be taken 
lightly because the 4th Amendment requires that warrants be issued only upon a 
showing of probable cause and "particularly describing the place to be 
searched, and the persons or things to be seized." 
</P>
<P>
 In the affidavit for a warrant to search Simpson's home and car, Detective 
Philip L. Vannatter described the Bronco as being parked "at the west side of 
the residence headed north on Rockingham Avenue." 
</P>
<P>
 Uelmen said that was incorrect, since it did not make clear that the car was 
on a public street but rather implied that it was on Simpson's property. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark responded by calling that "hair splitting" and by reminding Ito that 
Vannatter had been up all night when he drafted the affidavit. When Ito said 
Vannatter was an expert with long experience in criminal investigations who 
should know better than to make drafting errors, Clark answered: "He's also a 
human being, your honor." 
</P>
<P>
 After reviewing the affidavit and other court cases regarding warrants, Ito 
concluded that the statement about the Bronco's location was not enough to 
justify suppressing the warrant. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the defense did not prevail in that search warrant dispute, legal 
experts said Simpson's lawyers have effectively used the issue to bolster their 
claims of investigative incompetence and malfeasance. Already, Ito has found 
that Vannatter recklessly disregarded the truth in preparing one warrant, and 
Friday's rulings show that he believes other officers exceeded the bounds of a 
second one. 
</P>
<P>
 He deferred a decision about other specific items taken from the Bronco, 
however, promising to return to that topic on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides are next expected in court Monday morning, when the grueling task 
of picking a fair and impartial jury will begin. One thousand prospective 
jurors have been summoned, but about 700 already have indicated that they would 
have difficulty serving on a trial that could last as long as six months.

NEWS ANALYSIS; EXPERTS SEE LEGAL PROBLEMS IN A MEDIA BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Barring a television station from covering the hottest trial in America might 
satisfy Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito's desire to control inaccurate media 
coverage of the O.J. Simpson case. But it most likely would run afoul of the 
U.S. Constitution, legal experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito might be on firmer legal footing if he pulled the plug on courtroom 
television coverage altogether, they add -- but even that would not remedy the 
problem of leaks and inaccuracies that the judge has so bitterly denounced. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he wants to punish the media for leaks . . . he's not going to do that by 
barring" live television coverage, said Everette Dennis, executive director of 
the Freedom Forum for Media Studies at Columbia University. "The leaks are not 
coming in open court." 
</P>
<P>
 The judge suggested Friday that he might bar television station KNBC-TV from 
the courthouse, or even remove all the live television cameras, following what 
he called a fabricated Channel 4 report that DNA tests had linked Nicole Brown 
Simpson's blood to socks seized from the former football star's bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 That report, Ito said, is an example of irresponsible, inaccurate coverage 
that is prejudicing the rights of both Simpson and the prosecutors attempting 
to convict him of murdering his ex-wife and her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 UC Berkeley constitutional law professor Robert Post said, "To cut off one 
station because the judge feels it to be inaccurate would be highly suspect." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, there are three federal court rulings which specifically prohibited 
public officials -- the mayor of Honolulu, a Louisiana sheriff and a Los 
Angeles federal prosecutor -- from barring out-of-favor reporters from their 
news conferences. 
</P>
<P>
 The argument against a judge banning one station would be even stronger 
"because while there is not a constitutional right of access to a news 
conference, there is a constitutional right of access to a court hearing under 
the 1st and 6th amendments," Post said. 
</P>
<P>
 KNBC issued a terse statement Friday, saying only: "We share Judge Ito's 
concern that the facts of this case be reported accurately, and we have 
reported accurately the information our sources have told us, just as we have 
reported accurately what happened in court today." 
</P>
<P>
 And the station retained Rex Heinke, one of the city's most high-powered media 
lawyers, to represent it. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the station's legal rights may be, KNBC should apologize, said Steven 
Brill, editor in chief of American Lawyer magazine and founder of Court TV. 
</P>
<P>
 "They got it wrong," Brill said. "All of us (in the media) spend our lives 
trying to catch other people making mistakes, but we're terrible about 
admitting our own mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 Ito said he would hold a hearing next week on whether to ban KNBC-TV or all 
in-court television. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not the first time the judge has grappled with issues of media coverage. 
He has considered imposing a gag order. And in late August, in a closed meeting 
with lawyers in the case, Ito directed the attorneys to file all motions under 
seal to ensure that he sees the documents before they are described in the 
media.  
</P>
<P>
 On the question of TV in the courtroom, Ito appears to have more power to 
eliminate it than to bar one station. Several Supreme Court decisions have held 
that there is no absolute right to televise in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no constitutional right to have (live witness) testimony recorded 
and broadcast" and the "requirement of a public trial is satisfied by the 
opportunity of members of the public and the press to attend the trial and to 
report what they have observed," the high court said in the 1978 case Nixon vs. 
Warner Communications. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, during the past two decades, there has been a steady loosening of 
restrictions on live television coverage of trials and pretrial proceedings. 
There are now cameras in courtrooms in virtually every state, including 
California, though they are still prohibited in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
 California trial judges have broad discretion to decide whether to allow 
television coverage of courtroom proceedings under California Rule of Court 
980, originally adopted in 1966 and last revised in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 There are very few cases interpreting the judge's authority under the rule. In 
1990, a California appellate court held that a San Diego judge who granted 
television stations permission to film the preliminary hearing of accused 
murderer Betty Broderick could not restrict their right to televise the 
testimony of certain witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rule does not authorize a judge to become the editor of a television 
station's news broadcasts of a previously recorded judicial proceeding." The 
appeals court did not, however, make a broad ruling that the trial judge had 
violated the station's constitutional rights. The court said that Rule 980 lets 
judges bar live television coverage where it would "interfere with the rights 
of the parties, diminish the dignity of the court, or impede the orderly 
conduct of the proceedings." 
</P>
<P>
 That decision indicates that Judge Ito "would have a problem, legally, in 
retracting his Aug. 2 order permitting live coverage," said Los Angeles lawyer 
Douglas E. Mirell, who is monitoring the case for the American Civil Liberties 
Union. "Absolutely nothing" has happened since then to indicate any of the 
three criteria for halting live coverage has occurred, Mirell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All that Judge Ito has expressed concern about are events that have occurred 
outside the courthouse. Nothing about the electronic coverage of the 
proceedings themselves has been the subject of complaint by the parties to the 
case," Mirell added. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis of Columbia University agreed. He said what is happening in the Simpson 
case is reminiscent in some respects of the massive media coverage precipitated 
by the kidnaping of Charles and Anne Morrow Lindbergh's baby in 1932. 
</P>
<P>
 "Up till that time, still cameras were allowed in the courtroom," Dennis said. 
But the obstreperous conduct of photographers who leaped in front of defendant 
Bruno Hauptman and continually used "blinding flash cameras" led to a ban on 
cameras that lasted almost 40 years, Dennis said. He emphasized that in 
contrast to the Simpson case, the offensive media conduct in the Lindbergh case 
occurred in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dennis said he understood Ito's frustration. "It must be a horrendous 
thing for a judge who is trying to be fair-minded and to impanel a jury to see 
this constant drumbeat of publicity, particularly factually inaccurate claims 
about evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure there is anything he can do to control this in the long run," 
Dennis said. "Ito is like one guy standing against a tidal wave. . . . It could 
get worse." 
</P>
<P>
 And that is why at least one attorney said he would not be troubled if Ito 
removed the cameras. "Someone has to take control of this case," said Los 
Angeles criminal defense lawyer Barry Tarlow. 
</P>
<P>
 "Judge Ito is in an extraordinarily difficult situation and he is acting 
intelligently if he is attempting to impose a sanction on those members of the 
media who act irresponsibly. It is not the role of courts to boost television 
ratings," added Tarlow, who contended that Simpson has been the victim of a 
series of inaccurate leaks by police. 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran defense lawyer Barry Levin expressed similar concern. "Judge Ito is 
trying to do everything in his power to make sure the parties get a fair 
trial." He said Ito's threats "may have a chilling effect on reporting, but it 
may have a positive effect on (reporters) checking sources." 
</P>
<P>
 But Brill expressed doubt that Ito would halt live coverage. "I think he 
understands the ultimate irony here is that more people have seen him denounce 
the KNBC report than saw the KNBC report because there was a camera in the 
courtroom," Brill said. "If you didn't have the camera in the courtroom, you'd 
only have the KNBC report on television and I think the judge understands 
that."TELEVISION BROADCASTS

 Betty Spates thought it was a car backfiring, the muffled pop she heard 
seconds before her lover rushed in. He scrambled into the kitchen from outside, 
white as a sheet, she says, hair standing straight up on his head as if he'd 
stuck his finger in a socket. She knew something was wrong. But even after 
seeing Loyd Jowers clearly shaken, clutching a rifle and looking like he'd 
wrestled with Death himself, she says, she did not realize the enormity of what 
had taken place. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor did the 17-year-old black girl make the connection a short while later 
when she returned to her job across the street and saw co-workers weep over 
news that the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. had been killed. As astounding as it 
seems, Spates says she didn't know who King was and had no idea the Nobel 
laureate had been staying at a motel a block away, almost directly behind 
Jowers' restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 For a myriad of reasons, Spates says she kept quiet for a quarter century. 
Today her story is one of the cornerstones of an effort to get James Earl Ray, 
King's convicted assassin, out of prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Local prosecutors scoff at her tale as they strenuously resist efforts to 
reopen the case. But Ray's London-based attorney, William Pepper, says Spates 
is part of the proof that there was a broad-based conspiracy to kill King. He 
contends the plot involved the Mafia and possibly FBI agents and Memphis 
police. He accuses the authorities of a cover-up. 
</P>
<P>
 The murder of King on April 4, 1968, stands with the assassination of 
President John F. Kennedy as one of the political tragedies of the 1960s that 
forever changed America, driving a stake through the heart of a nation's 
innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 The slaying sparked riots in more than 100 cities and left the civil rights 
movement in disarray. Almost immediately came charges of cover-ups and 
government complicity. The suspicions have not waned with time. A number of 
King's prominent former associates and one member of the FBI team that spied on 
King now champion Ray's innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 The official version of King's death has always been that he was killed by 
Ray, who acted alone. The enigmatic drifter and small-time thief confessed to 
the murder in 1969 and was sentenced to 99 years in prison. But then he 
immediately recanted, claiming he had been coerced. Since then, he has tried 
unsuccessfully to get a trial, insisting that a mysterious smuggler known as 
Raoul framed him and likely was the true assassin. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with Spates' story, Ray's defense has gone beyond Raoul to posit a 
scenario of how King might have been killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, the men who branded Ray the lone assassin don't think much 
of all this. "It's a bunch of crap," huffed N.E. Zachary, the retired chief 
homicide detective who handled the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The question now is whether Pepper will ever get to make his case in court. 
Ray had been preparing for an extraordinary hearing at which he was to present 
evidence to show why he could not have killed King. A Shelby County criminal 
courts judge rejected his motion for a trial but granted the hearing to allow 
Ray to build up a record for his appeal to federal courts. In a 2-1 decision 
last week, the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals ruled that the judge had 
overstepped his authority in granting the hearing. Ray's lawyers have filed an 
appeal with the state Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 If the hearing is held, Pepper said, it would be a "a major breakthrough. From 
beginning to end we're going to walk the court -- and the rest of the nation, 
to the extent that the media allows us -- through the assassination of Martin 
Luther King and establish James Earl Ray's actual innocence. . . ." Jim's Grill 
in Memphis 
</P>
<P>
 Key to Ray's case are Loyd Jowers and Betty Spates. Jowers, now 67, is a 
one-time Memphis police officer and taxi company owner who admits to playing a 
role in the murder, although in a pointedly different capacity than the one 
Spates' story suggests. Jowers, a white man, claims he acted as a middleman to 
hire the killer, and is seeking immunity from prosecution in exchange for 
telling authorities all he knows. 
</P>
<P>
 Jowers and Spates met in 1967 when she and her two sisters applied for work at 
his restaurant. Jowers told Spates she was too young. She was old enough, 
though, to begin an affair with the married, 41-year-old Jowers that lasted for 
years, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 When she went into the kitchen at Jim's Grill the evening of April 4, 1968, 
Spates says, she was looking to catch Jowers fooling around with another woman. 
Instead, she says, she saw him come in alone from the bushy field out back with 
mud on his pants as if he'd been kneeling. It was the second time that day 
she'd seen him behind the kitchen with a rifle, she says. But this time he 
seemed frightened. "I asked what's wrong," she recalls. "Then he asked me would 
I ever do anything to hurt him." 
</P>
<P>
 She said it took a while for her to realize that someone important had died 
that day and that she might be able to shed some light on the case. By that 
time, things were so tangled up in knotty issues of race and love and loyalty 
and fear that she says she chose to forget that it had happened. For 26 years 
she has tried to block it from her mind. 
</P>
<P>
 It was for people like Spates that the civil rights leader had given his life. 
She was poor and unschooled, three years removed from the cotton fields of 
Mississippi and trying to make ends meet in the still-segregated South when 
King was shot down. The civil rights movement was an abstraction to her. "I was 
already living with a white man," she says now. "I already had my freedom."  
</P>
<P>
 Pepper said his investigation into King's death led him to Spates six years 
ago, after he'd heard rumors of Jowers' involvement. In 1992, he succeeded in 
getting her to tell all of what she remembers. 
</P>
<P>
 At about the same time, Pepper took a deposition from a cabdriver who said he 
stopped by Jim's Grill the day after the assassination. He said Jowers showed 
him a rifle with a telescopic sight hidden behind the bar.  
</P>
<P>
 Until then, Jowers had been a mere footnote in the King assassination 
investigation files, just another person interviewed by authorities about what 
they saw that day. Lewis Garrison, his attorney, said that after Jowers 
realized witnesses were willing to make statements linking him to the murder, 
he offered to divulge everything he knew in exchange for immunity. 
</P>
<P>
 When prosecutors stalled on the immunity request, he appeared on ABC's 
"PrimeTime Live" in December to say he was asked by a friend to hire a gunman 
to kill King. Jowers would say little more, except to add that the man he hired 
was not Ray. The friend was later identified by another friend of Jowers as 
Frank Liberto, a Memphis produce supplier with alleged ties to the New Orleans 
Mafia, who has since died.  
</P>
<P>
 If the purpose of the interview was to pressure prosecutors to grant immunity, 
it didn't work. Shelby County Dist. Atty. Gen. John Pierotti did reluctantly 
agree to investigate, complaining that it was a waste of time and money, but he 
said immunity was out of the question. Meanwhile, the media bombardment on 
Jowers' home was so heavy that he moved, reportedly to the Ozarks. 
</P>
<P>
 There is something approaching corroboration of part of Jowers' story: In 
1968, a witness told police he overheard a man on the telephone hours before 
King's death seemingly discussing a murder for hire. The man was Liberto. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kill the S.O.B. on the balcony and get the job done." That's what John 
McFerren told police he heard Liberto say. McFerren had driven into Memphis to 
buy supplies for his general store. He walked near the office of LL&L Produce, 
where the owner, Liberto, was sitting with his back to the door talking on the 
telephone. "Don't come out here," McFerren heard him say a little later. "Go to 
New Orleans and get your money. You know my brother." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1968, what were the police and the FBI to make of these stray snatches of 
conversation, words taken out of context? Not much, as it turned out.  
</P>
<P>
 Zachary, the retired homicide inspector, said an investigation showed the 
conversation was unrelated to King's death. Today, he doesn't hide his contempt 
for McFerren, a black man whom he calls a "nut" and a "troublemaker" for the 
civil rights movement, in which McFerren played an active role in the 1950s and 
'60s. "If there was an uprising or anything concerning civil rights or the 
movement at the time," Zachary said scornfully, "he was there waving his flag." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, after 26 years of being "hung out to dry," in Pepper's words, McFerren is 
being viewed, at least by Ray's supporters, as a possible key to unlocking the 
mysteries surrounding King's murder. An Unlikely Suspect 
</P>
<P>
 King had been late for dinner. After holding meetings all day at the Lorraine 
Motel, the civil rights leader and his associates started assembling to leave. 
In a fresh white shirt and tie, "Doc," as his friends called him, was standing 
on the balcony at 6:01 p.m., leaning over the green iron rail chatting with 
friends in the courtyard below, when suddenly a blast ripped the brisk April 
air. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosea Williams heard a thud on the balcony above him. He looked up to see 
Doc's foot sticking over the ledge. 
</P>
<P>
 In the official police and FBI version, Ray had rented a room in a flophouse 
above Jim's Grill with windows overlooking the Lorraine. Zachary figures Ray 
was prepared to stay for several days, when he suddenly spotted King on the 
balcony only a few hours after renting the room. He rushed down the hall to the 
communal bathroom where he'd have better aim. With a single shot from his 
Remington 30.06 rifle from about 200 yards away, Ray shot King. Then he quickly 
gathered his belongings and fled.  
</P>
<P>
 As pandemonium broke out, some in the courtyard thought that the shot came 
from bushes across the street. Police affidavits and media accounts refer to a 
furtive figure dressed in white that at least three people claimed to have 
seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, police found fresh footprints behind Jim's Grill. But city officials 
ordered the lot cleared and the bushes cut down early the next day, destroying 
whatever other evidence there might have been. By then, authorities had already 
settled on their scenario: Overwhelming circumstantial evidence linked the 
murder to Ray. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back, Ray seems in some ways an improbable suspect. He'd been in and 
out of prisons, but never before had he been associated with such a violent 
act. Since breaking out of Missouri State Prison almost a year earlier, he had 
bounced around the country, making forays into Canada and Mexico, financing his 
travels with robberies and odd jobs. But in the weeks before King's death, 
Ray's movements seemed guided by a new sense of purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 He had gone from Los Angeles to Selma, Ala., to Atlanta, then to Memphis; King 
had been in each city at or about the same time. Adding to the impression Ray 
was stalking King was the Atlanta road map police found among his possessions. 
It featured circles drawn near King's home and the office of the Southern 
Christian Leadership Conference which King headed. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after King was killed, a man said he saw Ray rushing down the hall 
of the flophouse carrying a bundle. Other witnesses saw a man drop the bundle 
in an open doorway nearby before driving off in a car. Among a number of easily 
traced items police found in the bundle was a rifle with Ray's fingerprints. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who dispute the lone assassin theory note that the key witness who saw 
Ray flee was an alcoholic who gave inconsistent stories. Several people said 
the witness was so drunk at the time of the shooting he was incoherent. 
</P>
<P>
 Secondly, the conspiracy theorists say, it is improbable that a fleeing killer 
would drop his weapon in plain view. Pepper says the rifle was planted by the 
true killers to link the murder to Ray. He denies that it was the one that 
killed King. Ballistics tests have been inconclusive. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Pepper has raised questions about whether the bullet in evidence is the 
same one that was removed from King's body. While witnesses to the autopsy say 
the slug was in good condition when it was extracted, the bullet returned from 
the FBI laboratory in Washington was in three badly damaged pieces. What 
happened to it remains a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 Zachary has a possible explanation for why Ray may have deposited the items 
where he did. Just down the street from where he had parked was a fire station 
where members of a police tactical unit were taking a break. 
</P>
<P>
 As Ray hustled to his car, Zachary surmises, he saw the police pile out of the 
station. "That's the reason why he had to throw the evidence away," he said. 
"If he hadn't throwed his evidence away we'd still be looking for who killed 
Martin Luther King." The FBI Accused 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Zachary's confidence that authorities arrested the right man -- and 
despite then-U.S. Atty. Gen. Ramsey Clark's immediate declaration that King was 
killed by a lone assassin -- there were allegations of conspiracy from the 
start. Some of King's associates suspected government complicity. There was too 
much that seemed out of the ordinary about that visit to Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, there was the controversy that led King at the last minute to 
stay at the Lorraine instead of a more secure high-rise Holiday Inn. It came 
out later that the FBI had planted items with the media criticizing King for 
staying at a white-owned hotel the previous week. The FBI-planted press release 
called King a hypocrite and specifically said he should stay at the black-owned 
Lorraine Motel. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, after at first denying that King had been under surveillance in Memphis, 
authorities later disclosed that an undercover police officer was part of 
King's entourage when he was killed and that the police and the FBI were using 
the firehouse across from the motel as a spying station. Two black firemen were 
reassigned from the station the day of the shooting, supposedly because of 
death threats. Less than two hours before the murder, a black police officer 
who was part of the spying detail also was removed with the same explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Andrew Young and other civil rights 
campaigners were not aware of any of this. But they did know one thing: The 
police had been unusually scarce throughout the day -- an all-black security 
detail that had been assigned to King had been withdrawn the previous 
afternoon. But within seconds after the shooting a dozen police officers 
suddenly materialized. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Lowery, executive director of the Southern Christian Leadership 
Conference, said there is consensus among King's old associates that FBI agents 
were involved in the killing. "We know that J. Edgar Hoover had a passionate 
hatred for Dr. King," he said. "(He) would have done anything to discredit if 
not kill Martin Luther King." 
</P>
<P>
 King had begun to deal with issues of economic disparity and had come out 
against the Vietnam War. Believers in a conspiracy argue that this made him a 
greater threat to those in power. Further, they note, Frank C. Holloman, then 
Memphis director of fire and safety, was a retired FBI agent who had served as 
an aide to Hoover. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1979 a congressional investigation acknowledged the possibility of a 
conspiracy but did not find conclusive proof. Investigators did agree with law 
enforcement authorities on one crucial point: Ray was the triggerman, even 
though they could not say exactly why he did it or if he had help. The only 
motive they found was a $50,000 bounty allegedly offered for King's murder by a 
St. Louis segregationist group. No one knows if Ray knew of the supposed 
reward. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1960s, Ray supported segregationist George C. Wallace's 1968 
presidential campaign and white racist regimes in South Africa and Rhodesia, 
now called Zimbabwe. Despite this, and despite testimony that he hated black 
people, one of the noteworthy characteristics of his campaign to get out of 
prison is the support he has received from King's former associates. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson wrote the foreword to Ray's 1992 book, which argues that government 
forces killed King. Williams, now a county commissioner in Georgia, testified 
on Ray's behalf at a parole hearing last May. The Rev. James Lawson of Los 
Angeles, whose invitation brought King to Memphis, performed Ray's wedding 
ceremony in prison in 1978 and has started a fund to help pay for Ray's 
defense. Even the American-born Pepper is a former friend of King who was 
involved in a 1967 effort to draft him as a third party presidential candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Dr. King were alive and you had the same circumstances, King would be as 
concerned for the incarceration of a poor thief for a crime he did not do as he 
would be for unpacking the truth about the killing," said Lawson, pastor of the 
Pullman United Methodist Church. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ray's often-told account, his movements leading up to King's murder were 
directed by Raoul, whom Ray claims to have met by chance in a Montreal bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Raoul supposedly rendezvoused with Ray in Memphis at Jim's Grill, told him to 
rent a room upstairs and had him bring the gun and other items he'd previously 
instructed him to buy. Then Raoul, saying he planned to meet with underworld 
associates, asked Ray to leave. Driving back to the flophouse later, the 
escaped convict claims he saw the area swarming with police. Over the radio he 
learned of King's death and that police were looking for a white man driving a 
white Mustang. That's when he decided to flee. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Murtagh, a former Atlanta-based FBI agent who is conscience-stricken 
over his own participation in the bureau's anti-King campaign, sides with those 
who believe Ray was framed. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray's description of his dealings with Raoul mirrors standard FBI operating 
procedures, he said. Informants are not allowed to see the big picture and 
can't prove they have contact with the bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Raoul was feeding (Ray) the rifle and all the other things and making 
sure he handled them and that his fingerprints were on them and probably 
advising him on what to do with it," Murtagh said. "And while he was carrying 
out that function, I think Raoul or some other operative was probably involved 
in the shooting that killed King." He admits this is conjecture, but said: "I 
know the system." 
</P>
<P>
 But not everyone who believes in a conspiracy is willing to accept that Ray 
was wholly ignorant of the plot. "I don't think James Earl Ray is innocent," 
Lowery said. But he added: "Only an idiot or imbecile would believe that (he) 
acted alone. . . . He's a little two-bit punk-type, petty robber and thief and 
there's no way in the world he could pull this off." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Zachary said the possibility of a conspiracy bothered him at first. "But 
when you step back and analyze the thing it was not a big deal what he did, no 
big deal that one person couldn't pull this off." 
</P>
<P>
 Philip H. Melanson, a political science professor at the University of 
Massachusetts who has written two books about the assassination, notes 
inconsistencies in Ray's accounts. He believes Ray has lied on occasion -- 
including perhaps about the mysterious Raoul -- possibly to obscure the nature 
of his relationship with his handlers. 
</P>
<P>
 And there are a number of unanswered questions, such as: Why were the four 
aliases Ray used in the months before and after the shooting the real names of 
men who resembled Ray and who lived near each other in Toronto -- a city Ray 
claims he never visited before King was killed but to which he fled after the 
murder? 
</P>
<P>
 Dumb chance? Or were the aliases supplied to him? And, if so, by whom? 
</P>
<P>
 And why did Ray undergo plastic surgery three weeks before King was killed -- 
surgery that, according to some investigators, made him look more like the men 
whose identities he claimed? 
</P>
<P>
 And how is it that Ray, after escaping to Canada, was able to quickly get a 
passport and then afford air travel to London, Portugal and then back to London 
again, where he was arrested? 
</P>
<P>
 Pepper says Ray was "for the most part" an uninformed pawn -- "an escaped 
convict on the run just trying to stay away from being caught and survive. As a 
result of that, he followed a predictable course of behavior. He did not ask 
questions and he received money from time to time for things he was asked to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 While Pepper says the New Orleans Mafia was involved in the killing, he 
declines to name who he believes was responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will only address aspects of the killing and contract to the extent that I 
can put proof on the stand," he said. "It's a still-evolving situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Pepper does, however, outright accuse the FBI of engaging in a cover-up. "What 
the bureau did in my view was scandalous," he said. "They did not contact a lot 
of witnesses. They interviewed other witnesses improperly -- the reports do not 
reflect the true interviews." 
</P>
<P>
 Among witnesses he claims the FBI interviewed but kept secret are two men who 
saw a man in a white 1966 Mustang drive away from the area shortly before the 
shooting occurred. This could support Ray's contention that he'd gone to get a 
tire fixed when King was killed. Painting Ray as a Liar 
</P>
<P>
 By far the most damning statements against Ray have come from the attorney who 
represented him when he pleaded guilty in 1969, the late Percy Foreman. In 
court and congressional testimony over the years, Foreman said Ray admitted 
fabricating Raoul and alleged that Ray purposefully left his fingerprints on 
his rifle because he wanted credit for the killing. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a racist, he is a racist, and has been one all his life," Foreman said 
of Ray in 1974. "He thought everybody thought like he thought, and he thought 
the killing of Martin Luther King would make him the champion of the white 
race, that he would be the most popular man in America."  
</P>
<P>
 Despite Ray's contention that Foreman coerced him into pleading guilty in 
1969, Foreman maintained Ray did it willingly to escape the death penalty. "He 
said there was no penitentiary in this country that could hold him, and if I 
could save his life, he would tend to the rest," Foreman said in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepper calls Foreman a liar. Noting that the famed attorney had "unsavory 
connections" and had represented organized crime figures, Pepper suggested that 
Foreman, too, had been involved in the plot to cover up the trail leading to 
the true assassins.  
</P>
<P>
 Someone else who is convinced of Ray's guilt is his ex-wife, Anna Ray, whose 
divorce after 15 years of marriage became final last year. She spent most of 
the years they were together working to help get him released. Now she works to 
make sure he doesn't get paroled. 
</P>
<P>
 The former trial sketch artist said she believed in Ray's innocence when they 
married. She'd met him while covering his hearings for a television station. 
"He seemed like a very sweet, kind person -- very meek, sort of backward, and 
just real charming," she said, "the kind of guy that brings out your maternal 
instincts." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, however, she said she got to see his cold side and learned of his 
worship for Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany. And then, in an offhand comment 
during an argument, she said, Ray admitted killing King. He denies it. 
</P>
<P>
 King's murder is one of the most exhaustively investigated crimes in American 
history. But, as congressional investigators conceded in 1979, the full story 
is yet to be told. Interlocking theories and suppositions converge and separate 
into infinity. Revelations come in pieces -- some assembly is required -- and 
the parts don't always fit. 
</P>
<P>
 What is one to make of Jowers' claim that he hired the gunman, for example, 
when the man he finally fingers hardly seems believable as King's assassin? 
</P>
<P>
 While Jowers has kept mum, a friend who claims Jowers told him the full story 
named Frank Holt as the triggerman. Holt, a black man now homeless and living 
in Orlando, Fla., was tracked down first by the Nashville Tennessean newspaper 
and then by Pepper. Under hypnosis, he denied killing King. He also passed a 
lie detector test administered on behalf of the Tennessean. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierotti, the prosecutor, was quick to say this proves Jowers' claim was a 
hoax. But Pepper contends Jowers fingered Holt only because he assumed the man 
was dead or impossible to find. The lawyer suggests Jowers pulled the trigger 
himself and pocketed the $10,000 he supposedly was paid to hire a killer.  
</P>
<P>
 And what is one to make of Betty Spates, who claims to have known all these 
years that the wrong man was imprisoned for killing Martin Luther King Jr.? 
</P>
<P>
 She remained silent partly out of fear, she said: Jowers had kept in touch 
over the years, always reminding her he knew where she lived and worked. She 
also said there have been threats on her life. And then there was the attitude 
of the police. Spewing racial slurs, one policeman who came to conduct 
interviews at Jim's Grill after the shooting told blacks to stay out of the 
way, Spates recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since the police told us we didn't know anything, we decided we didn't know 
anything," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Should Ray succeed in getting a trial, a jury will have to decide how much 
credibility to afford the witnesses. Pierotti claims to have in his files an 
unsigned affidavit allegedly based on statements Spates made about the case in 
1969 giving a different account of what took place. Although Spates disavows 
the statement, it could -- if it exists -- be particularly damaging in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of Pepper's new evidence was gathered during production of a mock trial 
presented on HBO last year, in which a jury picked for the show found Ray 
innocent. The production provided the funds and the forum for Pepper to conduct 
an investigation. But, on the flip side, the media's interest in the case has 
attracted people eager to peddle dubious information and has made it easier for 
skeptics to question the motives of witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to filmmakers and television producers who have been in contact with 
potential witnesses, Pepper said, "I don't know if they've been putting words 
in (some) people's mouths." 
</P>
<P>
 Spates, in fact, alleges that Jowers and Kenneth Herman, a private 
investigator, approached her last December -- about the time Jowers appeared on 
national television -- and asked her to lie. If she falsely claimed that Jowers 
had hired a black gunman to kill King, she says, they told her she could split 
$900,000 in media profits. Herman denied the allegation. Jowers is still in 
hiding and can't be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 While it remains to be seen whether Ray will get his trial, "one thing is for 
certain," Pepper said. "If James Earl Ray had gotten his trial back then . . . 
I don't think it would've taken a great lawyer to prove that he was innocent." 
</P>
<P>
 One way or another, the attorney said he is determined to make his case in 
court. In addition to the hoped-for hearing in state court, he has asked the 
Justice Department to open an investigation, and has filed a civil lawsuit 
against Jowers, contending that Ray is entitled to $46 million in damages 
because the retired restaurateur is responsible for Ray's long incarceration. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowery, the leader of the civil rights organization King founded, also wants 
to see the Jowers connection investigated. He, too, has asked for a new federal 
probe and for the release of congressional records pertaining to the 
assassination that have been sealed until 2028. "We believe that the truth has 
yet to be told," he said.

ARISTIDE AGREES TO CALL IN PARLIAMENT FOR AMNESTY VOTE; CARIBBEAN: THE EXILED 
HAITIAN PRESIDENT IGNORES AIDES' ADVICE, WILL ALLOW LAWMAKERS TO DECIDE FATE OF 
JUNTA LEADERS. MEANWHILE, CLINTON SAYS THE U.S. OPERATION IS 'GOING WELL.'

<P>
 Exiled Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, apparently holding out an 
olive branch to his political foes, agreed Friday to call a special session of 
the island nation's Parliament to vote on amnesty for the leaders of the bloody 
coup that deposed him three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 With about 15,000 U.S. troops poised to referee, Aristide and Lt. Gen. Raoul 
Cedras, the chief coup plotter, jockeyed for position in advance of Oct. 15, 
the date the military regime is scheduled to give up power so Aristide can 
regain the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome of the high-stakes political contest could shape Haiti's future 
and determine whether the U.S. occupation ends as peacefully as it began. 
</P>
<P>
 Going against the advice of some of his closest aides, Aristide agreed to 
allow Parliament to consider a pardon for Cedras, Lt. Gen. Philippe Biamby, Lt. 
Col. Joseph-Michel Francois and other coup leaders for crimes committed during 
and after the insurrection that drove Aristide from power Sept. 30, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Barnes, Aristide's Washington attorney, confirmed that the exiled 
president will soon summon Parliament to consider an amnesty bill. That would 
allow the lawmakers to decide if Cedras and his followers will be able to 
remain in Haiti without fear of arrest. Aristide would issue the call from 
Washington, where he is living pending his return to Haiti, and is not expected 
to attend the parliamentary session in Port-au-Prince. 
</P>
<P>
 The disclosure came as President Clinton declared the first five days of the 
U.S. operation in Haiti a success. He said conditions have improved enough to 
permit the first contingent of refugees to return home from the U.S. naval base 
at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 "In short, our mission is going well," Clinton said. "I am very proud of the 
competence and the discipline our troops and their commanders have 
demonstrated." 
</P>
<P>
 Also Friday, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said he plans to fly to 
former President Jimmy Carter's home in Plains, Ga., today for a private 
meeting to patch up misunderstandings over Carter's negotiations with Cedras 
and Biamby last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter was critical of U.S. policy on Haiti and of Christopher personally in a 
series of interviews after his return from Haiti. For his part, Christopher is 
known to believe that the former President exceeded his authority in 
negotiating a deal that made far more concessions to the military leaders than 
the Administration had wanted to give. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Carter's seven-point agreement that raised the amnesty issue, which may 
hold the key to Haiti's immediate political future. Cedras has vowed to stay in 
the country and remain part of its political life. Aristide wants to force the 
military leaders into exile. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedras wants a broad amnesty covering acts by him and by all other members of 
the military during or after the coup. Aristide has offered amnesty for 
"political" crimes such as treason and insurrection, but not for "common" 
crimes such as murder, rape and embezzlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedras and his followers could remain in Haiti without fear of arrest under 
the broad plan he favors but probably would have to go into exile under 
Aristide's narrow proposal. U.S. officials are hoping that the Parliament can 
come up with a middle ground that would be generous enough to help reconcile 
Haiti's hostile factions but still would make it so uncomfortable for Cedras 
that he would leave the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide probably will ask for the narrow interpretation when he calls 
Parliament into session. But the lawmakers are not required to follow his lead. 
Aristide had difficulty getting legislation through Parliament even before the 
coup. 
</P>
<P>
 Further complicating matters are questions about the current makeup of 
Parliament. Most members were elected in 1990, before the coup. But the 
military government conducted elections in 1993 that are not recognized 
internationally. For the vote to have any validity in the rest of the world, 
the legislators elected in 1993 would have to be excluded. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, several dozen lawmakers fled Haiti after the coup and now live in 
the United States. The Administration has offered to help these 
representatives, not all of them backers of Aristide but all critical of the 
military, return to vote, but they have not yet indicated if they will go. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide's key advisers recommended against any sort of amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean-Claude Martineau, Aristide's official spokesman, said: "President 
Aristide has to establish in Haiti the rule of law and it will make it 
difficult for him to do this if the military steps down but can stay in the 
country with their assets. These three guys are richer than the whole nation. 
What are they going to do? They can disrupt everything. They can finance 
terrorism. They have killed so much in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, when the Administration first argued that Parliament could only 
be called into session by Aristide, it was widely believed that he would block 
amnesty by refusing to summon the lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) and other members of Congress pressured Aristide to 
seek amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
 During an hourlong meeting on Capitol Hill, Nunn, who was a member of Carter's 
negotiating team, told Aristide that the House and the Senate will be 
influenced by Aristide's decision on amnesty when they vote, probably next 
week, on legislation setting a time limit for the U.S. occupation of Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next 72 hours are crucial," Nunn told reporters after the meeting. 
"President Aristide's leadership over these 72 hours will have a real effect on 
the flexibility that the Senate and the House of Representatives give to 
President Clinton." 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide and his backers fear that Cedras will try to hold power through some 
sort of ruse. Burton Wides, an Aristide lawyer, predicted that a few days 
before the Oct. 15 deadline, Cedras and his supporters will begin to charge 
violations of some of the terms of the transfer of power agreement and will 
claim that gives them a right to retain their positions. 
</P>
<P>
 If that happens, he said, Clinton will again be faced with the choice of using 
military force in Haiti or backing down. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials say there is no possibility that the U.S. government 
will allow Cedras and his backers to thwart Aristide's return to power. U.S. 
forces have overwhelming military superiority, should the Administration decide 
to use it. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide and his camp do not question Washington's military might. But after 
three years of exile in which the George Bush Administration and the Clinton 
Administration talked of restoring him without taking decisive action until 
recently, Aristide is afraid that the United States will shy away at the last 
minute from using force if the military leaders try to retain power. 
</P>
<P>
 An Administration official said there is no doubt that the United States will 
use as much military force as is necessary to make sure Aristide regains the 
presidency. But he admitted that, in light of recent events, Aristide's fear of 
a sellout was "not entirely paranoia."

SOME SENATORS SEEK SPECIAL SESSION ON HEALTH REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN TUMULTY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a last, desperate effort to rescue health reform legislation, a core group 
of Democratic senators is putting intense pressure on Majority Leader George J. 
Mitchell (D-Me.) to take the extraordinary step of bringing the Senate back 
into session after the November election to consider one of several scaled-back 
alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Several reported, however, that Mitchell -- who gave up a Supreme Court 
nomination so that he could lead the fight for the health bill -- feels 
defeated and has concluded that there is no reason to prolong the battle. 
</P>
<P>
 It was widely believed that Mitchell was prepared to formally pull the plug on 
the entire health reform effort Friday, but his office made an abrupt afternoon 
announcement that he would make no statement. He later declined requests for 
interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 One senator, speaking on the grounds that he not be identified, said Mitchell 
continued to vacillate because there was "a fraction of a fraction of a chance" 
that he might consider a post-election session. 
</P>
<P>
 The "lame-duck session," called that because it would include senators whose 
replacements had already been chosen by voters, is held only rarely -- and 
generally for the most urgent of unfinished business. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent was in 1982 and dealt with budget and appropriations 
legislation. In other instances, they have been called because of war or for 
such unusual purposes as censuring the infamous Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy, and 
making up for delays caused by the Watergate investigation and President 
Richard Nixon's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 According to several sources, the idea for holding such a session to deal with 
health care originated Thursday among a group of the most ardent reform 
advocates, including Sens. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), Harris Wofford (D-Pa.), 
John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV (D-W.Va.) and Tom Daschle (D-S.D.). 
</P>
<P>
 "Would I be willing to do it? You bet!" Rockefeller said when asked about the 
possibility of staying in session past the election to consider health reform. 
"I want an accounting. I want a vote. The American people deserve to know who 
stands where." 
</P>
<P>
 A lame-duck session also is said to have support that extends well beyond that 
group of Democrats to include some moderate Republicans. "There's a lot of us 
who would like to do this," one Democrat said. "We're going into this election 
having spent all this time on it, and we have zero." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) said he would like to hold a test vote, putting a 
limit on debate, immediately before adjournment. "Then take it out to the 
voters and let them question their candidates," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, it would take 60 votes to put a limit on debate, the test vote that 
would set the stage for a lame-duck session. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've come to the conclusion we can't get 60 votes for the Ten Commandments," 
conceded Sen. John B. Breaux (D-La.), a leader in a bipartisan effort to draft 
a scaled-back health bill. "In today's atmosphere, I don't think we could pass 
a single-line health bill." 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear precisely which of two bills would be considered. Both fall well 
short of the sweeping overhaul that President Clinton originally proposed a 
little more than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 One, which bills itself as the "mainstream" alternative, is the only one that 
lays claim to significant bipartisan support. 
</P>
<P>
 It would expand coverage to roughly 94% of the population -- from the current 
85% -- through a combination of government subsidies and incentives. It also 
seeks to end widely condemned insurance industry practices, such as those that 
make it difficult for people with poor health records to get coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 The other bill would make more minimal changes in insurance practices and 
would focus on subsidies for pregnant women and children. That bill is being 
pushed by a generally liberal group of Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell, however, has several powerful reasons to put the issue of health 
reform behind him -- something he can accomplish only by officially pronouncing 
it dead for the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Senators who have consulted with him say that he is determined to remove it as 
a distraction, so that the Senate can concentrate on other measures -- such as 
international trade legislation -- in the two weeks that remain before the Oct. 
7 adjournment target. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, with many Democrats facing difficult reelection battles and the 
outside prospect that the Senate could actually fall into GOP control, he is 
anxious to adjourn as soon as possible to allow them as much time as possible 
to campaign in their home states. 
</P>
<P>
 It is far from certain whether there would be any sentiment in the House for 
returning to Washington after the election to continue the health care battle. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) was already discussing the 
sort of bill that he envisioned producing in the next session of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the legislation would embody many of the same goals as the Clinton 
plan: expanded coverage, cost containment and less shifting of health costs 
onto the privately insured. However, Foley stopped short of saying Congress 
would strive for the President's most basic hope -- guaranteed coverage for 
every American. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the fact that the public appears more relieved than angry at the 
apparent failure of the health reform effort, Foley suggested that Republicans 
will ultimately pay a political price for having blocked health legislation 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're going to benefit from having had the debate of the last year, 
and I think the public is going to (understand) who was interested in moving 
the health reform issues and who is now boasting about having blocked the 
improvement in the health opportunities of the American people," he said.

DEFENSE; FRANCE TAKING TENTATIVE STEPS BACK INTO NATO MILITARY FOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TYLER MARSHALL and SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Atlantic Alliance defense ministers gather Wednesday in the Spanish city 
of Seville for their annual informal meeting, there will be a new face at the 
table -- that of French Defense Minister Francois Leotard. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not that Leotard is new to the job. He has held his post since the 
French right returned to power in elections 18 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 What is new is that a French defense minister is in Seville at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Leotard's participation in the three-day gathering marks the first 
time France has attended such a meeting since the late President Charles de 
Gaulle pulled his nation out of the military side of the 16-member North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization in 1966 amid accusations that the alliance was 
little more than a tool for American domination of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to send Leotard to Seville represents the latest in a series of 
gradual, low-key French steps back toward the NATO fold rather than any sudden, 
dramatic U-turn.  
</P>
<P>
 Few predict the move signals any swift full French re-integration into NATO's 
military structure. That would surely be seen as compromising the unfettered 
independence of the French military deterrent, an idea that remains a strict 
political taboo in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, both here at NATO headquarters and in Paris, Leotard's presence is 
considered significant. 
</P>
<P>
 "It means something," said Dominique Moisi, deputy director of the French 
Institution of International Relations in Paris. "It means the French are aware 
that their previous policy was leading them to self-exclusion, that if they 
wanted to have some influence . . . they had to be present." 
</P>
<P>
 Added a senior NATO official: "This is a step in the right direction. It shows 
a new attitude on the part of France." 
</P>
<P>
 It is also likely that Leotard's presence will be more than merely symbolic. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not just going to Seville to listen, he's going to take the lead in 
discussions about Bosnia-Herzegovina (where France has the single largest 
contingent of U.N. peacekeepers) and on security concerns in the 
Mediterranean," the NATO official said. "He'll be trying to say that Algeria is 
a security concern for all of Europe." 
</P>
<P>
 Both for NATO and for France, this increasingly active French role is 
important. 
</P>
<P>
 For the alliance, participation not only would add the clout of what by 1997 
will be Western Europe's largest national military force. It would also boost 
NATO's profile in the politically volatile Mediterranean and provide it with 
valuable experience in peacekeeping -- central to NATO's future. 
</P>
<P>
 For France, closer cooperation with NATO is a way to avoid an isolation that 
had threatened to marginalize in the post-Cold War climate. 
</P>
<P>
 De Gaulle's vision of France as a powerful, nuclear "third force," independent 
of both superpowers, may have been viable in the Cold War. But in the uncertain 
security environment of the 1990s, Paris has begun to realize it can exert 
greater influence from within NATO than from the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Leotard's presence in Seville stands as the culmination of this thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 The evolution, however, has been gradual. France has always maintained a 
representative at NATO military headquarters in Mons, Belgium, while French 
observers have long attended NATO military committee meetings.  
</P>
<P>
 But it was only with the end of the Cold War that this tentative cooperation 
intensified. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been especially visible in the Balkans, where French aircraft help 
enforce the NATO-enforced "no fly" zone over Bosnia and two French frigates are 
part of a NATO-Western European Union naval task force in the Adriatic imposing 
a U.N.-ordered embargo against Serbia and Montenegro. 
</P>
<P>
 France was instrumental in NATO's decision to enforce a U.N. weapons exclusion 
zone around Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the rapprochement has not come without resistance in Paris. NATO 
officials here recall earlier this year the surprise when the chief of the 
French defense staff, Adm. Jacques Lanxade, showed up at an alliance meeting of 
defense staff chiefs.  
</P>
<P>
 "About 15 minutes after the meeting began, he received a message from the 
(French) president's office," recalled one NATO official. "He left 
immediately."

ENVIRONMENT; DROUGHT TURNS PARTS OF BRAZIL TO DESERT; LIVESTOCK AND CROPS 
DYING; FIRES CONSUMING THOUSANDS OF ACRES.

<P>
 When Ambassador Mohamed Abdel-Wahab woke one morning last week in this nation 
synonymous with dense rain forests and huge rivers, he could have sworn he was 
back in Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dryness was unbelievable," said Abdel-Wahab, who had arrived in Brazil's 
capital just days earlier. "I couldn't breathe. My wife couldn't breathe. It 
felt like it was even worse than the Sahara." 
</P>
<P>
 He was right -- the humidity was 9%, even lower than in the famous desert. 
</P>
<P>
 But his temporary discomfort is proving to be a graver problem for Brazil. 
Major regions of the country are in the midst of a months-long drought. It has 
wiped out large stocks of cattle and spawned huge forest fires. It also is 
imperiling the soybean, rice, snap bean and sugar cane crops. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardest hit has been the state of Sao Paulo, heart of the nation's cattle and 
agriculture regions. Aside from a shower last week, much of the state has been 
without rain for four months. More than 80,000 cattle have perished in the last 
two weeks, milk production is down by 20%, and officials estimate agriculture 
in the area has suffered $250 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Oriealeo Brunini, coordinator of the state Agro-Meteorological Service, said 
the drought has stunted sugar cane, and the parched soil cannot be prepared for 
other crops, resulting in temporary layoffs of hundreds of seasonal workers. 
"We don't know how bad it's going to be, but it is bad," Brunini said. "The 
coffee crop could also be affected." 
</P>
<P>
 That could be a serious blow to the world's largest coffee-producing nation. 
More than 40% of next year's crop has already been wiped out by a June frost. 
</P>
<P>
 The drought has been so deep that the water level in Paraibuna Dam has dropped 
the equivalent of the height of a 30-story building, revealing ruins of bridges 
and old colonial structures in Redencao da Serra intentionally flooded by the 
dam in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 The drought has also hit tourism in the picturesque city, which has dropped 
70%, said Mayor Thomaz Dias, whose city lies 100 miles east of Sao Paulo. "We 
live principally off the use of the dam," Dias said. "With the drought, we are 
forced to live with this desert." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby residents of Artur Nogueira, Sumare, Hortolandia and Campinas have gone 
to water rationing.  
</P>
<P>
 In the state's Rio Preto region, raging fires have burned an area the size of 
2,000 football fields, including 8,000 yards of communications wire and 55 
transmission towers. The resulting smoke and dust have pushed up pollution 
levels in the city of Sao Paulo so much that residents now report to work with 
dust masks. 
</P>
<P>
 Farther south, the Pantanal's Mato Grosso do Sul, a 125,000-square-mile area 
known for its flora and fauna, has been so parched that some parts have 
converted to desert, permanently. 
</P>
<P>
 In areas once covered by annual floods, all that is left are skeletons of fish 
and small alligators. Fish flap desperately for oxygen in vanishing pools. 
Antonio Castro Lima said residents took five tons of dying fish from a pond on 
his ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 In Brasilia, low humidity caused government offices and schools to shut; 
hundreds of children were admitted to hospitals for respiratory problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, an 8-day-old blaze has torched more than half of the 75,000-acre 
Brasilia National Forest and now threatens the city's water supply as it edges 
to the Santa Maria Dam, one of Brasilia's two primary water sources.

PRE-ELECTION BATTLE OVER HAITI SHAPING UP IN CONGRESS; POLITICS: LEGISLATORS 
MAY SET DEADLINE FOR TROOP WITHDRAWAL. DEMOCRATS FEAR VOTERS' ANGER IF 
INTERVENTION GOES WRONG AND AMERICANS SUFFER SERIOUS CASUALTIES. 
</P>

<P>
 U.S. forces may have landed in Haiti without bloodshed, but in the weeks ahead 
a much fiercer battle over America's latest military intervention is likely to 
be fought in Congress, where lawmakers are growing impatient with what even a 
Democratic loyalist derisively described as President Clinton's "crisis 
mismanagement." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, no U.S. military intervention in recent years has been launched with 
so little congressional support -- a fact plainly apparent as Democrats running 
for reelection in November anxiously seek to distance themselves from a foreign 
policy situation that many fear could become for Clinton what the failed 
hostage rescue mission in Iran was for Jimmy Carter, the last Democrat to 
occupy the Oval Office before Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 It used to be that on tough issues like the use of military force, Congress 
looked to the President for cover. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, a Democratic leadership aide predicted grimly, it is from the 
President that most Democrats will be seeking political cover "if things go 
wrong and the nightly news is filled with pictures of body bags coming home 
from Haiti." 
</P>
<P>
 For Democrats, "There is no upside to this occupation in the short run because 
anything that goes wrong is going to be all over the headlines and the 
television news, while anything that goes right between now and the election is 
just going to be perceived as a slow and incremental step in a policy whose 
objectives will take a long time to succeed," said congressional scholar 
Stephen Hess of the Brookings Institution. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the aim of the U.S. occupation is to bring democracy and stability to 
a land as poor and violence-prone as any in the Western Hemisphere, success 
"will come after months or years, whereas failure, in the CNN age, could happen 
overnight," a senior Democratic foreign policy analyst said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's painful experience in Somalia, many lawmakers note, showed how 
quickly American resolve could dissolve in the post-Cold War era when U.S. 
forces are inserted into chaotic civil conflicts without a clear sense of 
mission or any obvious national security interest to defend. 
</P>
<P>
 Scenes of a dead U.S. soldier being dragged through the streets of Mogadishu 
by angry mobs led to abortion of the entire mission to Somalia, and now 
Americans have "once again been injected into an incredibly violent society, in 
whose combustible atmosphere it is hard to imagine that casualties won't 
occur," Hess agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 And if casualties occur between now and the midterm elections Nov. 8, Congress 
can be expected to move quickly to extricate the troops from Haiti by passing 
legislation to cut off the funding for their deployment, as it did in Somalia, 
many lawmakers warn. 
</P>
<P>
 As it stands, congressional support for the Haiti mission is too thin "to pass 
the Dover test," said Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio), referring to the Dover, Del., 
Air Force base where the bodies of any U.S. soldiers killed in Haiti will be 
flown. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can sustain perhaps a few casualties" -- but anything more than a handful 
is likely to trigger a congressional panic because of the consensus that the 
internal strife in Haiti threatens no national security interest worth 
upholding with American lives, Glenn added. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there are casualties, you will see moves to put a time limit on the 
occupation," said Rep. Dave McCurdy (D-Okla.). 
</P>
<P>
 Already, moves are afoot in both the House and Senate to fix a deadline for a 
troop withdrawal -- something for which Democrats in particular would like to 
be able to take credit before the November elections. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Senate, Republican Hank Brown of Colorado said he will seek a vote on a 
non-binding resolution urging a withdrawal from Haiti no later than Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the House, where all 435 members are up for reelection at a time when 
polls suggest that voters are more inclined to vote against incumbents than 
ever before, Democrats and Republicans alike say they will back legislation to 
mandate a withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is strong support for a resolution that would define the scope of the 
mission, include a date certain for withdrawal and deal with the War Powers 
Act," conceded Rep. Bill Richardson (D-N.M.), who is keeping close tabs on his 
colleagues' views about Haiti in his role as one of the Democratic leadership's 
chief vote counters. 
</P>
<P>
 Maneuvering to preempt the Republicans, the chairman of the House Foreign 
Affairs Committee, Rep. Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.), is already negotiating 
informally with the Administration to include a withdrawal date in legislation 
that he plans to draft next week. 
</P>
<P>
 To stand a chance of passing, the legislation "will have to set a time limit, 
but one that we hope will at least give the Administration enough time to get 
something done," a committee aide said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton has not indicated what kind of time limit he favors, but other 
Democrats say they would like to see U.S. troops hand over their peacekeeping 
duties to a multinational force and begin withdrawing by no later than next 
March. 
</P>
<P>
 One way or the other, the issue will be resolved by a vote on the floor before 
Congress adjourns for the year on Oct. 7, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley 
(D-Wash.) predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if all goes as well as Clinton's congressional allies hope, and Haiti 
does not turn into a foreign policy disaster, the confusion, drift and dizzying 
series of U-turns taken by the Administration have "created in . . . (their) 
wake a deep and dangerous estrangement" between Congress and the White House, a 
senior Democratic source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming after two years of divisive battles over the budget, health care 
reform, the crime bill and the North American Free Trade Agreement, Clinton's 
handling of Haiti marks what even his closest allies on Capitol Hill privately 
concede is a new low watermark in his relationship with Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 As he prepared to go the polls to face an angry electorate for the first time 
since Clinton captured the White House two years ago, one Democratic 
congressman summed up the estrangement this way: "The honeymoon was over a long 
time ago, and now a lot of people are talking about a divorce." 
</P>
<P>
 Former President Carter materialized during the height of the Haitian crisis 
to mediate the agreement that allowed U.S. troops to enter Haiti without force, 
but the memory of the defeat to which he led his party in 1978 has been 
haunting congressional Democrats like an unwelcome ghost as the midterm 
election approaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sense of impending doom and the demoralization is palpable," Rutgers 
University political scientist Ross K. Baker said. "There is a real tendency 
now by Democrats to see their own President as a liability in a way that I 
haven't seen since Carter's campaign in '78." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of this reflects Clinton's low standing in the polls as well as the fact 
that, after having begun in high hopes of passing health care and welfare 
reform, this has turned out to be a year devoid of all but a few major 
legislative accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's defenders note that it is unfair to saddle Clinton with all of 
the blame: The Republicans certainly have tried to defeat and embarrass the 
President at almost every legislative turn, and the media have consistently 
overplayed Clinton's weaknesses while failing to give him due credit for his 
successes, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is also clear that most Democrats now regard Clinton as a liability. 
Everyone, Baker added, "is looking at Mike Synar," the Oklahoma Democrat and 
erstwhile Clinton ally who lost his congressional primary to a 72-year-old 
retired high school principal who spent less than $17,000 on his campaign. 
"Everyone is looking at Synar and saying, 'That could be me.' "

EDUCATED EXILES IN MIAMI TO RETURN WHEN IT'S SAFE; REBUILDING: SKILLS OF THESE 
PROFESSIONALS SORELY NEEDED IN HAITI. BUT MANY STILL FEAR THE WRATH OF THE 
MILITARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As U.S. troops disarm parts of the Haitian military and set the stage for the 
return of ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, hundreds of Haitian exiles 
here -- including a vital cadre of educated professionals -- are watching for 
signs that it is safe for them to go home. 
</P>
<P>
 But many are less than sanguine about seeing those signs any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "While Aristide might be well-protected when he goes back, we would not be," 
said Roger E. Biamby, an Aristide adviser now running a job-training program 
sponsored by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Miami in Little Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "After each change of government in Haiti, people go back, some to run into 
persecution," he said. "We have been burned before. So now Haitians are going 
to be a lot more careful. Going back is going to be a gradual thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Many Haitians here applaud the U.S. intervention in their homeland, but almost 
all express outrage over Sunday's agreement between Washington and Haiti's 
military leaders. The pact, negotiated by a delegation from Washington led by 
former President Jimmy Carter, has U.S. soldiers sharing law-and-order duties 
with the Haitian police and military, while allowing the leaders to remain in 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "U.S. troops are allied with the (Tontons) Macoutes," Biamby said, referring 
to the plainclothes private army of thugs who terrorized Haitians, first for 
dictator Francois (Papa Doc) Duvalier, then for his son, Jean-Claude (Baby 
Doc), and lately for the Haitian military who overthrew Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 Haitian exiles gathered peacefully Friday afternoon in downtown 
Miami to denounce the deal brokered by Carter and his fellow envoys, retired 
Gen. Colin L. Powell and Sen. Sam Nunn (D.-Ga.).  
</P>
<P>
 "Jimmy Carter Is a Traitor," proclaimed one sign. 
</P>
<P>
 "No Amnesty for the Rapists," another said. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatively few of Miami's 70,000 Haitians plan to return to Haiti to live. 
Most, whether they fled the country for economic or political reasons, by 
rickety boat or by airplane, are better off here. Most have families and roots 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been here for 17 years," said Tony Canova, 51, who runs a day-labor pool 
and who was wearing a straw hat on which was written "I love Titid," which is 
Aristide's nickname. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to go back to visit, but not to live," Canova said. 
</P>
<P>
 But a core group of highly educated Aristide supporters -- people with the 
type of skills needed to rebuild a Haitian society left in tatters after years 
of military repression and an international embargo -- do plan to return. They 
just do not know when. 
</P>
<P>
 Reginald de Landsheer, 34, a physician who was threatened and left his 
homeland and his medical practice weeks after Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras seized 
power on Sept. 30, 1991, said, "Before I go back, I want to know there is an 
atmosphere of security."  
</P>
<P>
 Security is problematical in Haiti. While U.S. troops have begun to fan out 
through the countryside in search of weapons in the hands of the military 
government's plainclothes forces, many Haitians are skeptical that complete 
disarmament can be accomplished. And revenge is a Haitian tradition as powerful 
as voodoo. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the Macoutes are not disarmed, then there will be another coup," Biamby 
said, echoing the sentiments of those who say they will return if they are 
assured the Macoutes are no longer a threat. "They will kill the president. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those men should be locked up, tried and sent to jail, or else we'll have 
chaos down the road," he added. "What message does it send when the worst that 
can happen (is) that you go into exile with millions of dollars? Blanket 
amnesty is immoral." 
</P>
<P>
 Biamby, who is not related to Brig. Gen. Philippe Biamby, one of the generals 
whom pro-Aristide Haitians want to see leave the country, fled the Duvalier 
regime in 1963. He lived in Miami until returning to Haiti in 1990 to work on 
Aristide's election campaign. He was in Miami trying to sell his house when the 
coup against Aristide took place. He has not been back since. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would be dead if I had gone back," he said. "The Macoute criminals would 
kill me." 
</P>
<P>
 De Landsheer was in his Port-au-Prince office in October, 1991, when the 
police came, hauled him down to the police station, slapped him around and, he 
said, "put (me) in a state of panic." 
</P>
<P>
 De Landsheer's brother, Patrick, an Aristide supporter and one of the owners 
of Radio Cacique, was already in hiding after the station was closed and his 
life was threatened. A few weeks later, both De Landsheers were in Miami too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I left with my wife, two children, two suitcases, $3,500 cash and a bottle of 
rum," said Reginald de Landsheer. The money and rum are gone, his wife and 
children are with relatives in New York, and he spends his time studying for 
the Florida medical boards. 
</P>
<P>
 With the U.N. embargo still in place, there are no direct flights to Haiti and 
no easy way to get there. But the De Landsheers and Biamby want to return as 
soon as it is safe.

UKRAINE REACHES ACCORD WITH IMF TO START MARKET REFORMS; EUROPE: NEW PRESIDENT 
SIGNALS READINESS FOR ECONOMIC OVERHAUL IN EXCHANGE FOR FINANCIAL BACKING FROM 
WEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY MYCIO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The new Ukrainian government reached a preliminary accord Friday with the 
International Monetary Fund to launch market reforms in one of the weakest and 
most Communist economies of the former Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 The handshake agreement was the first clear sign that President Leonid Kuchma, 
who took office two months ago, is ready to move ahead with a promised economic 
overhaul in return for financial backing from the West. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence de Milner, the IMF representative in Kiev, announced the agreement 
after meetings between an IMF official, Peter Hole, and Ukrainian Economics 
Minister Roman Shpek. If approved by Ukraine's Cabinet and the IMF's board, De 
Milner said, the deal could be signed and an initial credit of $350 million 
released as early as next month. 
</P>
<P>
 In return for the loan, which will bolster its central bank reserves, Ukraine 
pledged to tighten fiscal and credit policy, balance the budget, liberalize 
prices and exchange rates and ease trade restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps because the deal is controversial within the government, details were 
not spelled out, and no Ukrainian official appeared with De Milner to brief 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 The IMF program is certain to be unpopular among lawmakers in the 
Communist-dominated Parliament, among rust-belt industrial directors spoiled by 
easy government credits and among a semi-criminal elite that is profiting 
handsomely from Ukraine's economic troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kuchma, the former director of the Soviet Union's largest missile factory, 
has indicated that he will bypass Parliament if it balks. 
</P>
<P>
 He told the Interfax news agency this week that his economic stabilization 
program, to be announced Oct. 4 and expected to conform to the IMF deal, is not 
subject to lawmakers' approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Ukraine's Soviet-vintage prime minister, Vitaly Masol, may also resist the IMF 
deal. Masol was appointed by Leonid Kravchuk, Kuchma's predecessor, to win 
Communist support in an unsuccessful reelection bid. But Kuchma has been 
packing the Cabinet with his own appointees, and some politicians believe that 
Masol's days are numbered. 
</P>
<P>
 Ukraine, with 52 million people, was an industrial powerhouse and the 
breadbasket of the Soviet Union. It quickly became a basket case after 
declaring independence three years ago and losing its cheap sources of energy 
from Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 Its economic troubles have deepened in the last six months while the executive 
and legislative branches focused on their own elections. Masol announced last 
week that the government was bankrupt and unable to pay its foreign debts, 
mostly to Russia and Turkmenistan for energy. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report this week, the International Labor Organization said that Ukraine 
has "the highest level of hidden unemployment in Eastern and Central Europe, 
the lowest minimum wage, possibly the greatest degree of poverty and the most 
alarming growth of open unemployment." 
</P>
<P>
 Inflation, which had been reined in from 80% a month last fall to less than 2% 
in August, is roaring again after Parliament approved a round of agricultural 
credits. 
</P>
<P>
 The measures prescribed by the IMF are expected to cause an additional burst 
of inflation as price controls come off. But De Milner said the program also 
includes measures to protect the poorest from high prices and unemployment.

IRA LEADER GRANTED VISA FOR U.S. VISIT; NORTHERN IRELAND: GERRY ADAMS LEAVES 
TODAY ON A 14-DAY TOUR INTENDED TO CAPITALIZE ON GROUP'S AUG. 31 CEASE-FIRE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gerry Adams, leader of the political arm of the outlawed Irish Republican 
Army, has been granted a visa by the U.S. Embassy in London for a 14-day visit 
to the United States, embassy officials announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams' Sinn Fein party said he will depart today for Boston, where he is 
expected to meet with Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) and then visit eight 
other U.S. cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The visa specified that Adams should not participate in fund-raising 
activities for Sinn Fein or the IRA while in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. tour is part of an international effort by Sinn Fein to capitalize on 
the IRA cease-fire announced Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Last February, over stiff opposition from the U.S. Embassy here, Adams was 
granted a visit by the State Department and received heavy media coverage 
during a 48-hour trip to New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, with the current IRA cease-fire in place, the British offered only 
mild protests against the granting of a visa. 
</P>
<P>
 In another development, Prime Minister John Major said Friday that the British 
government could hold talks with Sinn Fein by Christmas -- if the IRA makes it 
clear that its cease-fire is permanent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sinn Fein is very nearly there," Major told the British Broadcasting Corp. 
"They could settle the matter immediately by making it clear that what they 
have said is meant to convey that they have given up violence for good. 
</P>
<P>
 "It isn't just a semantic matter; it isn't just a matter of persuading me. I 
think the people of Northern Ireland want to hear that message as well. Once 
that has happened, we are on a path where in due course Sinn Fein can join the 
political talks." 
</P>
<P>
 Last December's Downing Street Declaration issued by Major and Irish Prime 
Minister Albert Reynolds promised Sinn Fein a place at all-party peace talks -- 
designed to end 25 years of sectarian violence -- three months after a 
successful cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Major has refused to indicate when that three-month period starts, insisting 
that the IRA must renounce violence permanently. This has placed him at odds 
with Reynolds, who believes that the period should date to Aug. 31 if the IRA 
cease-fire continues to hold. 
</P>
<P>
 Pro-British paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland have not observed the 
cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, Adams will arrive in the United States on a wave of political success to 
conduct his tour, which will include Los Angeles and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Government sources here said they were assured that President Clinton will not 
receive Adams at the White House, but the Irish republican leader will see 
other political and business figures. 
</P>
<P>
 A Pro-British delegation from Northern Ireland met with Vice President Al Gore 
and National Security Adviser Anthony Lake on Thursday in an effort to present 
their case to U.S. leaders before Adams presents his. 
</P>
<P>
 Those unionists insist that Northern Ireland should determine its future links 
to Britain by a vote within the province, where unionists now hold a majority 
and presumably would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
 Sinn Fein argues that Northern Ireland's future should be determined by a vote 
of the entire island of Ireland -- which would probably choose unification.

PINATUBO VOLCANIC DEBRIS KILLS 13 IN PHILIPPINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Steaming avalanches of volcanic debris cascaded down the slopes of Mt. 
Pinatubo on Friday, swamping more than a dozen villages and killing at least 13 
people, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven people were missing after the volcanic muck swept through 14 villages 20 
miles southeast of Pinatubo, Defense Secretary Renato de Villa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine people died in Bacolor and four bodies were recovered in nearby Porac, 
said Lucia Gutierrez, a social welfare officer in Pampanga province. The towns 
are about 40 miles north of Manila. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 1,000 houses were buried in the avalanche, regional disaster 
officials said. Volcanic debris is like quicksand when wet but hardens like 
cement as it dries. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said as many as 29,733 people were affected but only about 20% had 
been evacuated to government shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It came suddenly," said Lucas Nuque, a minibus driver from Bacolor who was 
among hundreds of people seeking shelter in San Fernando, a few miles north of 
Bacolor. 
</P>
<P>
 Raymundo Punongbayan, director of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and 
Seismology, said he suspects the avalanche was caused by a breach in a lake 
formed in the upper slopes of the volcano during the 1991 eruption. 
</P>
<P>
 Mt. Pinatubo's eruption in June, 1991, believed to be the biggest volcanic 
eruption this century, killed at least 800 people and spewed ash that altered 
weather worldwide.

U.N. MOVES TO EASE YUGOSLAVIA SANCTIONS; BALKANS: TRAVEL AND SPORTS CURBS WOULD

 In a mood to show steel and gentleness at the same time, the U.N. Security 
Council passed a pair of resolutions Friday night to punish the Serbs of Bosnia 
while taking the controversial step of rewarding the Serbs of today's rump 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
 The council, by an 11-2 vote, with two abstentions, approved a resolution 
setting up a procedure to ease sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro -- all 
that is left of what was once the Yugoslav republic. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote amounted to a concrete show of gratitude to Serbian President 
Slobodan Milosevic for announcing a halt in supplies of arms and other goods 
from Yugoslavia to the Serbs fighting a civil war in neighboring 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and for allowing the United Nations to station monitors on 
the border between Serbia and Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Haris Silajdzic, prime minister of beleaguered Bosnia, denounced the 
resolution as a premature reward for subterfuge. Despite public claims to the 
contrary, he said, Yugoslavia is still providing supplies to the Bosnian Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten ambassadors from Islamic states addressed the council and scolded its 
members for rewarding Milosevic while ignoring the victims of the civil war.  
</P>
<P>
 Pakistan and Djibouti, both Muslim countries, voted against the resolution. 
Nigeria and Rwanda abstained. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the resolution, a few sanctions would be lifted for 100 days as soon as 
U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali confirms from U.N. monitors that 
Yugoslavia really has closed down its border to arms shipments. 
</P>
<P>
 With these sanctions out of the way, Serbia and Montenegro would be allowed 
commercial air flights from abroad, ferry service to Italy and the right to 
take part in international sports and cultural programs. The main economic 
embargo against trade with Serbia and Montenegro, however, would remain in 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's second resolution, passed by a 14-0 vote, with China abstaining, 
condemns the Bosnian Serbs for their recent refusal to approve a peace pact 
that would have forced them to withdraw from large areas of the territory they 
have seized in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 As punishment, the council ordered a halt to all trade with the Bosnian Serbs, 
a blockage of payment of dividends to them, a freezing of their assets in other 
countries, a ban on boats trying to reach Bosnian Serb-controlled towns by 
river and a prohibition against any Bosnian Serb official or prominent 
supporter entering another country. 
</P>
<P>
 The Security Council also passed a third resolution -- by a vote of 15 to 0 -- 
calling on the Bosnian Serbs to halt their ethnic attacks on Muslims and allow 
U.N. and Red Cross official complete access to Banja Luka, Bijeljina and other 
towns under Bosnian Serb control. 
</P>
<P>
 In a luncheon with a few reporters, Bosnian Prime Minister Silajdzic argued 
that Yugoslavia had done nothing to deserve any easing of international 
sanctions. He rejected Milosevic's claim that Serbia has stopped the flow of 
arms and other goods to the Bosnian Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Silajdzic said his government stands by its acceptance of the peace proposal 
even though it considers the plan, which would give about 49% of Bosnia to the 
Serbs, to be unjust. The plan was emphatically rejected by the Serbs, who now 
control 70% of Bosnia.

AMERICAN FINED IN SINGAPORE FOR ABUSE 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The father of an American youth arrested last year for vandalism and mischief 
was fined Friday for using abusive language against a policeman, a university 
lecturer and a condominium resident. Prosecutors decided not to proceed on two 
charges of assault. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Freehill, 51, a company regional director, was sentenced to a $2,500 
fine or 10 weeks in jail. He paid the fine. The court returned his confiscated 
passport. 
</P>
<P>
 Police sources said Freehill's case was unrelated to the vandalism case 
involving his son, Stephen, 17, who was arrested for spray-painting cars in the 
company of American Michael Fay, 19, and other youths last September. 
</P>
<P>
 Fay received four strokes of a cane on May 5, served 83 days in prison and 
paid a $2,340 fine for vandalism and other offenses. His caning sentence was 
reduced to four strokes from six after clemency appeals from President Clinton.

BRUTALITY SCANDALS SPARK REVIEW OF GERMAN POLICE; JUSTICE: MANY QUESTION THE 
WAY AUTHORITIES TREAT MINORITIES, ASK IF OFFICERS SHOULD BE BETTER INTEGRATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 A string of police-brutality scandals has prompted wide reconsideration of the 
way German authorities treat minorities and raised the question whether there 
might be less racial violence if officers here in Western Europe's 
most-populous nation were better integrated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's great -- now even the conservative newspapers are putting this 
issue on the front page," said Manfred Mahr, a policeman himself and founder of 
a watchdog group called the Federal Working Group of Critical Police Officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Police brutality directed at minorities and foreigners residing in Germany is 
nothing new, but it has been made sensational in recent months by incidents 
such as these: 
</P>
<P>
 * In Berlin, an entire city police unit was dissolved when it was learned that 
some members had been harassing residents and buying their own equipment, 
particularly wooden clubs, which would deliver more punishing blows than the 
standard-issue rubber clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Hannover, a 16-year-old Kurdish youth was fatally shot in the back by an 
officer while hanging up posters for a banned political group; police say an 
officer's side-arm discharged accidentally while the victim fled. But a study 
showed the gun had been fired from less than a foot away. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Berlin, there were 51 reports of unprovoked assaults on Vietnamese 
curbside cigarette peddlers under investigation as of late August; the peddlers 
often trade in illegally imported tobacco and are frequent subjects of police 
sweeps. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Bernau, just north of Berlin, seven police were suspended for beating 
Vietnamese peddlers, including one who claimed a customs official had attempted 
to rape him. 
</P>
<P>
 * In July, the human-rights group Amnesty International pointed to a "clear" 
rise in the incidence of police brutality in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
 But the case that, more than any other, has brought police misbehavior into 
the news here has been the resignation of Werner Hackmann, who as interior 
minister was the top law-and-order figure for the city-state of Hamburg. He 
left office last week amid criticism over the handling of the police beating of 
a 44-year-old Senegalese man. 
</P>
<P>
 The police in that incident were drunk; the African wound up in the hospital. 
He said he believes that officers attacked him because he was wearing a "No 
room for Nazis" sticker on his cap. In May, the officers appeared at a closed 
internal hearing and were let off with fines. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, Hackmann defended the handling of the case, as he had on occasions 
when police in Hamburg -- a rough-and-tumble port city -- were accused of 
racial violence. But then another officer came forward saying that his 
colleagues had beaten 11 more foreigners in the basement of a lock-up near 
Hamburg's central train station. Hackmann decided to quit. 
</P>
<P>
 In doing so, he made the surprising admissions that he was "deeply ashamed" of 
the police and that violence was rising to unacceptable levels. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked myself whether I should let myself suffer through this any longer, or 
whether it might be better to resign, and to send out a signal that would wake 
people up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahr observed that this "was the first time in German history that an interior 
minister said, 'Yes, there is an exaggerated esprit de corps, there is 
xenophobia within the police, and there are mechanisms that keep the police 
from being properly controlled.' This is very important." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Hackmann has sent his wake-up signal. Suddenly, police are on the 
evening news -- not just in the pages of the left-wing press. In Hamburg, 
authorities suspended 27 officers from one particularly notorious precinct and 
said they will reopen 120 closed brutality complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 Mainstream politicians are now demanding that every officer be issued a name 
tag -- something that until now, only small groups such as Mahr's had sought. A 
Hamburg legislative committee is being set up to review police training; at a 
coming nationwide meeting of state interior ministers, police xenophobia is to 
be the top agenda item. 
</P>
<P>
 Some mainstream politicians have begun calling for the stepped-up integration 
of police forces in Germany -- which tend to be overwhelmingly white -- on the 
assumption that this would increase interracial understanding and reduce 
racially tinged violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Police unions agree that the forces should be more diverse -- but because they 
believe that this will help fight crime in ethnic neighborhoods, not because it 
will curb brutality. 
</P>
<P>
 On the contrary, Mahr said, "a Turkish officer may feel he has to be even more 
brutal in encounters with Turks, because he knows the other officers will be 
watching him. We in Germany should learn more about the American experience, 
and then we'll learn that greater integration isn't synonymous with reduced 
brutality."

 A Senate committee approved a bill Friday to help clear the way for the 
government to compensate Persian Gulf veterans struck by disabling, unexplained 
illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure, backed by the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs with 
bipartisan support, also would allow the Department of Veterans Affairs to find 
out whether the veterans' spouses and children are suffering from similar 
ailments. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee also voted to limit cuts in the VA work force to 10,000 
positions. The Office of Management and Budget had proposed trimming 27,000 
jobs from the VA over five years.

GOP FILIBUSTER STALLS REFORM OF FUND RAISING; POLITICS: CAMPAIGN FINANCING 
LEGISLATION HITS ROADBLOCK ON WAY TO CONFERENCE COMMITTEE. REPUBLICANS ACCUSE 
DEMOCRATS OF CYNICISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With time running out and bills stacking up, the Senate was hogtied by a 
Republican filibuster Friday as lawmakers plunged once more into partisan 
rancor over the Democrats' version of legislation to reform the way political 
campaigns are financed. 
</P>
<P>
 Driven by their fear of an angry electorate that increasingly sees Congress as 
a dysfunctional institution, Democrats were pressing hard for passage of 
campaign finance reform. It is one of the few major items on President 
Clinton's legislative agenda that still stands a chance of clearing both the 
House and the Senate this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Republican senators, charging that the Democrats' idea of campaign reform 
was little more than a cynical attempt to preserve their party's numerical edge 
in Congress, fell back on an obscure version of the filibuster to keep the 
legislation from going to a conference with the House until next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody who has ever watched a football game knows what's going on here," 
said Sen. David Boren (D-Okla.), "They are running out the clock in an effort 
to kill this bill." The Republican strategy was to deny the Democrats any 
significant legislative achievements before the Nov. 8 midterm elections, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill seeks to curb the runaway costs of congressional campaigns with 
limits that would cap spending for Senate campaigns at between $1.2 million and 
$5.5 million, depending on population of the state, and between $600,000 and 
$800,000 per House race. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates who comply would receive matching funds financed by voluntary 
taxpayer contributions, fees imposed on PACs and other lobbyists and by a tax 
levied against the campaign receipts of lawmakers who don't comply. 
</P>
<P>
 Blasting the Republicans for their "unprecedentedly obstructionist tactics," 
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) forced his colleagues into a 
rare overnight session Thursday to make life as miserable as possible for the 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican senators took turns speaking and catnapping on cots in a marbled 
anteroom off the Senate chamber. They were using a series of procedural motions 
to keep the bill, passed by the Senate months ago, from finally moving to a 
long-stalled conference with the House. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican filibustering has become a "common tactic," Mitchell complained as 
the debate dragged into its second day Friday, but "never before in the history 
of the Senate have we had a filibuster on trying to go to conference with a 
bill." 
</P>
<P>
 But even after the nearly sleepless night, Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, 
the GOP's chief point man on campaign finance, was making no apologies for 
trying to kill what he called "this turkey of a bill." McConnell said 
Republicans opposed the bill because it will divert tax dollars to politicians' 
campaign coffers while selectively restricting the kinds of fund raising that 
most benefit the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
 "I make no apologies for trying to kill . . . an entitlement program for 
politicians," McConnell said.  
</P>
<P>
 Even if the measure gets to conference, it faces another formidable obstacle: 
A major division between House and Senate leaders over how far the bill should 
go in banning campaign contributions from political action committees. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate version bans PAC contributions entirely. The measure approved by 
the House, whose members are much more dependent on special interest money for 
their campaigns, retains the current limit of $10,000 per PAC in a two-year 
election cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 While the filibuster ground work in the Senate to a halt, lawmakers in other 
parts of the Capitol were near agreement on another reform bill that would 
greatly tighten regulations on lobbyists and ban them from buying gifts, or 
even picking up the meal tabs, for members of Congress and their staffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost as divisive as campaign finance reform, the House and Senate 
differences over the gift ban were tentatively worked out Thursday night. The 
measure would bar members of Congress from receiving any meals, entertainment, 
travel or other gifts from lobbyists and impose a $20 limit on such gifts from 
other sources, except for a lawmaker's personal friends or family. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't get much more restrictive than this," said Sen. Carl Levin 
(D-Mich), who worked out the compromise with Rep. John Bryant (D-Tex.). 
</P>
<P>
 Congressional aides warned, however, that it could still be vulnerable to 
stalling tactics on the House and Senate floors because, like campaign finance 
reform, the gift ban must overcome a lot of opposition, both overt and covert, 
from Democrats and Republicans alike. 
</P>
<P>
 However, with polls showing that the public's confidence in their elected 
officials has sunk to new lows, fears of voter retribution in November have 
forced most Democrats to reluctantly go along with the strict new campaign and 
lobbying limits being pushed by freshman lawmakers and other reformers.

AMES' DAMAGE MAGNIFIED IN CIA INQUIRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WALTER PINCUS, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The CIA inspector general's investigation of confessed spy Aldrich H. Ames has 
found that the veteran counterintelligence officer exposed 55 clandestine U.S. 
and allied operations over nine years, far more damage than previously 
admitted, according to sources familiar with a draft of the inspector general's 
findings. 
</P>
<P>
 The 400-page classified document, prepared under the direction of Inspector 
General Frederick P. Hitz, attempts to explain what happened as a result of 
Ames' duplicity and how the longtime officer was able to avoid detection while 
supplying highly sensitive information to Moscow, including the identities of 
more than 34 secret U.S. and allied agents, these sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The inspector general's report puts the blame initially on the "almost 
complete indifference of senior CIA supervisors" who, beginning in 1986, failed 
to recognize the importance of their losses and did not put "adequate 
resources" into the internal search for a Soviet mole. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, however, focuses solely on the CIA's loss of agents and the Ames 
case, sources said, and does not take into consideration CIA performance in 
other worldwide operations being run by these same officials, including covert 
wars in Afghanistan, Angola, Cambodia and Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
 This broad criticism of the highest ranks of the intelligence agency comes at 
a time when the future of the CIA is uncertain. It is racked by internal 
turmoil caused by budget cuts, uncertainty about its post-Cold War mission and 
allegations of racial and sexual discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior CIA official said Friday that the inspector general's report on Ames 
represents "the end-game" in an unprecedented agency scandal that has "shaken 
this organization badly." The 55 clandestine operations exposed by Ames, 
according to the report, is about double the number that the CIA previously has 
publicly admitted. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowledgeable sources said that the inspector general's report could lead to 
the reprimanding, early retirement, or even dismissal of a number of important 
agency officials.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; BROWN'S VIEWS LIKE BROTHER'S, WILSON SAYS; NEW 
AD ABOUT DEATH PENALTY IS MOST DIRECT ATTEMPT YET TO LINK CHALLENGER TO FORMER 
GOVERNOR'S LEGACY. HER CAMP DENOUNCES IT AS MISLEADING AND UNFAIR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson's campaign, in its most direct attempt yet to link Democrat 
Kathleen Brown to the legacy of her older brother, unveiled a television ad 
Friday that says Brown holds "the same position on the death penalty as her 
brother, Jerry Brown." 
</P>
<P>
 Television viewers are left to guess at precisely what that position is. The 
ad says only that former governor Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. "appointed 
dangerously lenient judges like Chief Justice Rose Bird, who voted to overturn 
68 out of 68 death sentences." 
</P>
<P>
 It concludes: "With the same view on capital punishment as Jerry Brown and 
with close ties to the criminal defense lawyers, Kathleen Brown will appoint 
more lenient judges. In times like these, can we afford the risk?" 
</P>
<P>
 The ad provoked outrage in the Brown campaign, where press secretary John 
Whitehurst accused Wilson of "using symbols from the past to falsely 
characterize her position" and called the ad "misleading, unfair and cynical." 
Brown has said that despite her personal opposition to capital punishment, she 
would carry it out if elected governor. 
</P>
<P>
 "In terms of her judicial appointments," Whitehurst said, "the qualification 
is that they will uphold the law. Period." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's brother also called the ad deceptive propaganda. 
</P>
<P>
 During his two terms as governor, he said, his views were similar to his 
sister's current stand -- despite his personal objections, he did not rule out 
the death penalty and vowed to make decisions on a case-by-case basis. (He 
never had to make such a decision as governor because the state's death penalty 
law had been declared unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court). 
</P>
<P>
 But in recent years, Jerry Brown said, he has taken a harder line that 
distinguishes him from his sister. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe the death penalty is right. It is basically a device by which 
people like Wilson intimidate the population and keep themselves in power," he 
said Friday. "My sister is her own person. She's got her own perspective. My 
ideas and my thoughts are separate. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father (former Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown Sr.) opposed the death penalty 
and executed more people than Wilson and (former Gov. George) Deukmejian times 
a factor of 15. So being against it doesn't necessarily mean that you can't 
carry it out," he said, adding: "If Wilson's so anxious to discuss these 
things, why doesn't he debate her?" 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Schnur, Wilson's press secretary, defended the ad, which began airing 
statewide Friday night. He stood by the assertion that Kathleen and Jerry Brown 
think alike, saying that -- at least while Jerry Brown was governor -- it was 
true. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the context of running for governor and serving as governor, he made the 
precise same argument" as his sister, Schnur said, offering 20-year-old news 
clippings as proof. "Kathleen and Jerry Brown not only have the same position 
on the death penalty, they articulated it in the precise same way." 
</P>
<P>
 Schnur continued, "Throughout this campaign, Kathleen Brown has gone out of 
her way to use her family as a selling point for her candidacy. Well, sometimes 
you have to take the bad with the good. Especially if your family has a genetic 
predisposition against the death penalty, the way her family does." 
</P>
<P>
 Whitehurst, the Brown spokesman, said the ad was a diversionary tactic 
designed to steal attention away from the topic of debates. All week, Brown has 
challenged Wilson to debate her at a scheduled event on Oct. 16, while Wilson 
has proposed another date with a format more to his liking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why is Pete Wilson debating Jerry Brown's record instead of Kathleen Brown as 
a candidate?" Whitehurst asked. Political Scorecard 
</P>
<P>
 45 days to go before Californians go to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 THE GOVERNOR'S RACE 
</P>
<P>
 * What Happened Friday: Gov. Pete Wilson signed two economic development bills 
in Sacramento and unveiled an ad that links state Treasurer Kathleen Brown to 
her brother, former Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. Brown attended a luncheon 
in Santa Barbara, where she discussed her plan to revitalize California's 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 * What's Ahead: Today, Brown plans to speak to the California Conference of 
Machinists in Universal City and to attend an education round table in Fresno. 
Wilson will sign legislation all weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 THE SENATE RACE 
</P>
<P>
 * What Happened Friday: Sen. Dianne Feinstein returned from Washington and 
attended a fund-raising dinner in San Francisco with Vice President Al Gore. 
Rep. Mike Huffington also returned from the capital, but held no campaign 
events. 
</P>
<P>
 * What's Ahead: Feinstein plans to attend a women's political event in San 
Francisco today. Huffington is scheduled to campaign in Auburn, Placer County 
and Yuba City before attending a fund-raiser in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 NOTABLE QUOTE 
</P>
<P>
 "Kathleen Brown says she opposes the death penalty, but says she'd enforce the 
law. The last person to say that was Rose Bird, and she voted to overturn 68 
death sentences in a row after Jerry Brown appointed her chief justice."

ARMY TO CHECK SAFETY AT INCINERATOR SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Army said Friday it will send a team from its safety center to investigate 
charges of unsafe conditions at its new chemical weapons incinerator in Toole, 
Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 The Army said the move was being taken in the wake of allegations by Steve 
Jones, a former senior safety inspector at the site. Jones charged that the 
safety programs were so deficient that they pose a risk of "catastrophic 
release" of nerve gas into the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said in an interview with the Washington Post that he was dismissed 
because he refused to sign a paper saying the risks of safety problems at the 
site were acceptable.

COMPUTERIZED CHILD PORNO RING BROKEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Mexican and U.S. investigators have broken up a high-tech child pornography 
business that distributed its materials via computer from this border city to 
thousands of subscribers in the United States and Canada, authorities said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged organizer of the ring, a U.S. citizen from the Chicago area, is 
imprisoned in San Diego on federal charges of transportation of child 
pornography.Mexican police arrested him in Tijuana and deported him into the 
custody of U.S. Customs Service agents. 
</P>
<P>
 The international investigation originated in New Jersey early this year and 
led to the California border, where authorities from both nations are still 
seeking at least two more suspects, said Pedro Raul Vidal Rosas, the attorney 
general of Baja California. 
</P>
<P>
 "This agency has worked with North American authorities to resolve a difficult 
and inhuman case of explicit child pornography," an indignant Vidal told 
reporters at a news conference, describing the ring as "a vile enterprise." 
</P>
<P>
 The accused ringleader, 50-year-old Robert Copella, allegedly charged $250 per 
subscription -- plus additional charges -- to a computer bulletin board that 
transmitted hard-core pornographic photos through electronic mail or other 
digital means, authorities said. There were at least 2,000 subscribers who paid 
for images of sex acts involving young children and even babies, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 After a warrant was issued for Copella's arrest in Chicago last year, 
authorities said, he fled to Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 Computerized international enterprises have become increasingly common because 
they are lucrative and hard to detect.

GSA CHIEF DEFENDS STOCK SALE, CHARGES SMEAR EFFORT; FINANCE: ROGER JOHNSON SOLD 
$2 MILLION WORTH OF SHARES IN IRVINE COMPUTER BUSINESS HE ONCE RAN. SEC 
OFFICIAL SAYS DEAL'S TIMING DOES NOT APPEAR TO VIOLATE FEDERAL RULES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Complaining that he is the target of a smear campaign by disgruntled 
Washington insiders, General Services Administration chief Roger Johnson spent 
much of Friday defending his recent sale of more than $2 million worth of stock 
in the Irvine computer business he once ran. 
</P>
<P>
 The way Johnson sold 184,000 shares of Western Digital Corp. in January and 
February was questioned in a newspaper report published earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said Friday that his stock dealing, which appears to have earned him 
at least $1.4 million before taxes, was completely aboveboard. 
</P>
<P>
 And a Securities and Exchange Commission official in Los Angeles agreed that 
its timing does not appear to have violated any federal rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Before being appointed GSA administrator, Johnson was chairman of Western 
Digital. Over the years, the company awarded him stock options -- a 
time-honored form of compensation that ties top managers' pay to long-term 
performance. Western Digital periodically gave options to executives instead of 
cash bonuses or other performance rewards. Holders have the right to buy a 
certain number of shares at a future date for the then-prevailing market price. 
</P>
<P>
 If the price of a stock rose because the company was doing well, the 
executives would be able to exercise their options, buy the shares for the 
lower price and immediately sell them at the new market price, pocketing the 
profit. If the price fell, they could simply let the options expire. 
</P>
<P>
 Western Digital normally gives executives three months in which to exercise 
their options or risk losing them. But SEC rules would have blocked any such 
sale by Johnson: former chief executive officers of publicly traded firms are 
prohibited from selling and buying their company's stock in the first six 
months after they leave so they cannot take advantage of any potential inside 
information about a company's financial condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said that when he submitted his resignation, Western Digital's board 
of directors told him they would waive the company's 90-day rule and give him 
until March, 1994, to use his options. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't ask them for an extension," Johnson said. "They just gave it to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Western Digital spokesman Robert Blair said Friday that company policy 
prohibits commenting on the situations of former employees, so he would not 
respond to Johnson's statement that he did not ask for the extension of his 
options. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial experts say companies write their own rules about how stock options 
may be used. And to change the expiration date or the price at which the option 
may be exercised is not uncommon. 
</P>
<P>
 Had he been held to the 90-day rule and free to exercise the options, Johnson 
would have realized less than $200,000 in profit from the sale of his shares. 
</P>
<P>
 But Western Digital shares soared in the next six months, and Johnson, who 
acquired the stock at prices ranging from $4 to $4.125 a share, sold it during 
a six-week stretch when it ranged from $12.875 to $15.125 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson sold the shares about seven months after leaving Western Digital. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson charged Friday that the article, published in New York Newsday, was 
prompted by political enemies who are conducting a campaign to discredit him 
and derail his efforts to streamline the GSA. He also complained that the 
article quoted only unidentified sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, a Republican, bolted the party to support Bill Clinton's presidential 
bid.

REV. JACKSON BLASTS TV ON LACK OF DIVERSITY; MEDIA: BOYCOTT IS THREATENED IF 
MINORITIES' VISIBILITY IS NOT IMPROVED. NETWORKS SAY THEY WILL RESPOND TO 
CRITICISMS AT CONFERENCE TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rev. Jesse Jackson on Friday repeated his attack on the television 
industry's record of cultural diversity, threatening to punish the networks 
with viewer boycotts if they do not immediately launch plans to improve the 
visibility of minorities in front of and behind the camera. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, executives from ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox said they will respond to the 
concerns of Jackson and several media watchdog organizations at a conference 
today at the Los Angeles Convention Center titled, "What's Wrong With This 
Picture?: Organizing to Win Cultural Diversity in Television and Film." 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference following a student rally at George Washington High 
School in South-Central Los Angeles on Friday, Jackson accused the 
entertainment industry of "institutional racism." 
</P>
<P>
 "If our military in Haiti is red, brown, black and white, and when we pay our 
taxes we're red, brown black and white, why can't the media, which has so much 
power in our culture" be similarly representative, Jackson asked. 
</P>
<P>
 The appearance served as a preview for the conference -- sponsored by the 
Rainbow Coalition's Commission on Fairness in the Media -- to detail what 
Jackson termed a lack of minorities in positive roles on television series and 
a significant absence of African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, Native 
Americans and women among network news anchors, on prime-time entertainment 
writing staffs and in key decision-making positions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Moral appeals haven't worked, government regulation hasn't worked," Jackson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he had threatened last July that the conference would target 
offending networks for a viewer boycott, Jackson said in an interview that the 
gathering now is primarily intended to inform participants of the "definite 
patterns" of racial exclusion, to put the networks on notice, and to form a 
battle plan if conditions do not change. 
</P>
<P>
 "We intend to meet with each of the network executives," said Jackson. "If 
they have a plan to be open and free, we will work with them. If not, we intend 
to use our consumer and viewer strength to open up the airwaves to be free and 
fair." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson said the boycotts of stations and advertisers would most likely take 
place during the November sweeps periods, when networks put on special 
programming. 
</P>
<P>
 Other highlights of the conference include an opening address by George 
Gerbner, dean emeritus of the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School of 
Communication, who will deliver his results of a 20-year monitoring survey of 
stereotypes in network television shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Also participating in the conference are leaders from several ethnic media 
watchdog groups, including the Media Action Network for Asian Americans, the 
National Hispanic Media Coalition, American Indians in Film and the Assn. of 
Asian Pacific Artists.

SERIES OF CRASHES ON GOLDEN STATE FREEWAY KILL 1, HURT 9

 A woman died and nine others were injured Friday in a series of collisions on 
a rain-slick portion of the Golden State Freeway near Pyramid Lake, leaving 
northbound commuter traffic backed up for hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The accidents, involving 11 vehicles, started about 3:20 p.m. just south of 
the Vista del Lago exit, authorities said. The cause remained under 
investigation Friday evening, but police and witnesses said slick roads may 
have caused three closely grouped collisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just started to rain for a few minutes and then, boom, all of a sudden 
there was a big accident," said Raymond Acosta, one of several motorists who 
provided first aid to victims at the remote location -- about 20 miles north of 
Santa Clarita -- until authorities arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Although precise details of the accident were not immediately available, a van 
that slid and rolled over may have started a chain reaction, said Gladys 
Lamoreaux, who was driving one of three big rigs involved in the collisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Two tractor-trailer trucks and several other vehicles collided several hundred 
feet behind the van, and a car and another big rig collided about a quarter of 
a mile south while slowing for traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 A female passenger believed to be in her mid-30s died at the scene after she 
was thrown through the windshield of a maroon Nissan Maxima sandwiched between 
several other vehicles, authorities said. Motorists who administered first aid 
said she was briefly conscious. The woman's name was being withheld by 
authorities until her family is notified. 
</P>
<P>
 Another woman in the rear seat of the Nissan was taken by helicopter to Henry 
Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in Valencia with head injuries, said Capt. John 
Everett of the Los Angeles County Fire Department. The driver of the Nissan and 
seven occupants in other cars were also hospitalized with minor to severe 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 About two-tenths of an inch of rain fell in parts of northern Los Angeles 
County, according to the National Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides of the freeway were closed while patients were airlifted by 
helicopter. The northbound lanes remained closed until 4:45 p.m. All lanes were 
reopened by 7:45 p.m.

POLL SHOWS FOLEY TRAILING GOP RIVAL FOR SEAT 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) trails his Republican challenger by 19 
percentage points with less than seven weeks before the Nov. 8 congressional 
elections, according to a new opinion poll. 
</P>
<P>
 George Nethercutt, an attorney and former chairman of the Spokane County 
Republican Party, is favored by 58% of voters, compared to 39% for Foley, said 
the survey conducted for KHQ-TV of Spokane. 
</P>
<P>
 Foley, who has served in Congress since 1965, faces the possibility of 
becoming the first sitting House speaker to be turned out of office. 
</P>
<P>
 He has faced criticism in his largely rural district for his support of 
gun-control legislation and was one of the lead plaintiffs in a lawsuit seeking 
to overturn Washington state's term-limit initiative, which would have forced 
him to step down in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 The telephone survey of 500 registered voters in Foley's 5th Congressional 
District had a margin of error of 4.4 percentage points.

DESERT BILL, THREATENED BY GOP, INCHES AHEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Senate on Friday overcame a procedural hurdle blocking consideration of 
the California desert protection bill, but the fate of the massive land-use act 
remains uncertain as opponents weigh further delaying tactics for next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate voted 73 to 20 to inch the legislation forward, but proponents face 
the prospect of a jammed Senate calendar and a crush of mandatory, 
end-of-session business to complete before adjourning. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans, led by retiring Sen. Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming, have the 
California Desert Protection Act tied up in parliamentary knots, refusing to 
allow the bill to go to a House-Senate conference committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Both houses of Congress have already passed versions of the bill by 
comfortable margins. 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents could choose to require two more cloture votes and hours of 
additional debate, putting the bill's final passage in serious doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsors of the measure need 60 votes to break through the delaying tactics, 
and Friday's vote shows that they clearly have sufficient sentiment on the 
merits of the bill. But opponents could kill the bill by continuing to delay 
its going to conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesmen for Wallop said the senator had not decided on his strategy on the 
bill for next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the sponsor of the bill, said, "Games are 
being played with the desert bill's future. There are some who don't want to 
see any piece of legislation move forward." 
</P>
<P>
 The bill is politically important for Feinstein, who would like to point to a 
legislative victory as she wages her tense reelection battle with Rep. Mike 
Huffington (R-Santa Barbara).

OFFICER IS WOUNDED IN GUNFIGHT; SHOOTING: POLICE SERGEANT HIT IN EXCHANGE WITH 
MAN WHO ALLEGEDLY FLED SCENE OF CAR ACCIDENT. SUSPECT IS IN CUSTODY.

<P>
 A uniformed Santa Monica police sergeant who stopped to aid motorists at a 
traffic accident was shot Friday in a gunfight with a man who had fled the 
accident scene, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police apprehended a man suspected of being the gunman about half an hour 
after the 8:15 p.m. shooting, said Officer Miguel Quintero of the Los Angeles 
Police Department. Authorities identified the suspect as Brian Joff, but would 
not release the name of the Santa Monica police sergeant. 
</P>
<P>
 The sergeant was on his motorcycle conducting a follow-up investigation of a 
hit-and-run accident that had occurred in Santa Monica when he was flagged down 
by motorists near Coldwater Canyon Avenue and Magnolia Boulevard, said Police 
Lt. John Dunkin and Officer Sandra Castello. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after 8 p.m., witnesses said, a man with long hair and a tattoo on his 
shoulder was driving north on Coldwater Canyon Avenue at a high rate of speed. 
The man, who was driving a gray Ford Mustang, collided with another car and 
then came to a stop, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He got out real fast and grabbed his dog and a backpack," said Donald McCall, 
16, who was waiting at the intersection with a friend for a ride to the 
Taft-Crenshaw high school football game. 
</P>
<P>
 People at the scene stopped the uniformed Santa Monica sergeant as he drove by 
and directed him to where the Mustang driver had fled -- toward a Ralphs market 
parking lot at Coldwater and Magnolia. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunkin said the sergeant made eye contact with the Mustang driver near the 
parking lot. The man turned and ran west, Dunkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 A few hundred yards west of the parking lot, the two men exchanged gunfire, 
Officer Castello said. The gunman allegedly shot the sergeant twice -- one shot 
passing through the his neck. Another shot, in the upper body, was blocked by 
the sergeant's bulletproof vest, Dunkin said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Did it save his life? Yes it did," Dunkin said. "It's worth it's weight in 
gold." 
</P>
<P>
 The suspected gunman was captured by police a few blocks west near Fulton 
Avenue and Magnolia Boulevard. Police are still searching for a handgun.

WOMAN KILLED, 9 HURT IN CHAIN OF ACCIDENTS

 A woman died and nine others were injured Friday in a series of collisions on 
a rain-slicked portion of the Golden State Freeway, leaving northbound commuter 
traffic backed up for hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The series of accidents, involving 11 vehicles, started about 3:20 p.m., just 
south of the Vista Del Lago exit, authorities said. The cause remained under 
investigation Friday evening, but police and witnesses said slick roads may 
have caused three closely grouped collisions.

provided first aid to victims at the remote location -- about 20 miles north of 
Santa Clarita -- until authorities arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Precise details of the accident were still being pieced together Friday night, 
California Highway Patrol officers said. 
</P>
<P>
 A van that slid and rolled over may have started a chain reaction with the 
vehicles behind it, said Gladys Lamoreaux, who was driving one of three 
trailer-trucks involved in the collisions. Two big rigs and several other 
vehicles collided several hundred feet behind the van, and a car and another 
trailer-truck collided about a quarter of a mile south while slowing for other 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 A female passenger believed to be in her mid-30s died at the scene after being 
thrown through the windshield of a maroon Nissan Maxima sandwiched between 
several other vehicles, authorities said. Motorists who administered first aid 
said she was briefly conscious. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had her stabilized and got her airway clear, and then we moved down to the 
next person," said Brent Ward, an emergency-trained flight attendant who 
stopped to help. "The next thing we knew she was gone." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman's name was being withheld by authorities until her family is 
notified. 
</P>
<P>
 Another woman in the rear seat of the Nissan was airlifted to Henry Mayo 
Newhall Memorial Hospital in Valencia with head wounds, said Los Angeles County 
Fire Department Capt. John Everett. The driver of the Nissan and seven 
occupants in other cars were also hospitalized with minor to severe injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Motorists said the sudden afternoon rainstorm was heavy. The rain made the 
freeway hazardous after a long dry spell because of oil and other residue on 
the road, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm dropped about two-tenths of an inch of rain in parts of northern Los 
Angeles County and up to half an inch of moisture in Ventura County, said Ivory 
Small, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides of the freeway were closed while patients were airlifted by 
helicopter. The northbound lanes remained closed until 4:45 p.m., when the 
right shoulder and one lane were reopened. All lanes were reopened by 7:45 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The closure caused an hours-long traffic jam, with many motorists standing 
outside of their cars as they waited for the freeway to reopen.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PACOIMA; PROP. 187 OPPONENTS PLAN MARCH, RALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Opponents of Proposition 187, the controversial November ballot initiative 
that would restrict health and education benefits to illegal immigrants, will 
stage a march and rally today in Pacoima that will culminate with a speech by 
Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alarcon. 
</P>
<P>
 The event, sponsored by the Campaign for Human Rights in Pacoima, will begin 
at 10 a.m. at the Boys & Girls Club of Pacoima at the corner of Glenoaks and 
Van Nuys boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizer Franco Fernandez-Ruo said he expects 500 people to begin the march 
or join en route. 
</P>
<P>
 The Campaign for Human Rights is a coalition of local residents opposing the 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
 The march will proceed westward about a mile down Van Nuys Boulevard to a 
rally at Mary Immaculate Church, at the corner of Van Nuys Boulevard and Remick 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 At the noontime rally, Alarcon and Bert Corona of the Latino civil rights 
group La Hermandad Mexicana Nacional will speak about the damage they believe 
Proposition 187 will cause to California's economic, health and education 
systems if passed in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez-Ruo fears approval of the measure would permit school and health 
officials to report people they suspect are undocumented without any objective 
criteria. 
</P>
<P>
 "This could lead to the type of mass hysteria that we have already encountered 
in America in the McCarthy era and the mass internments of the Japanese and the 
Salem witch hunts," Fernandez-Ruo said Friday. "That's why we oppose this."

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; 17 GRADUATES SWORN IN AS FIREFIGHTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 When it was all over, the 17 new graduates from Burbank's firefighter training 
program gave each other high-fives and embraced while about 200 friends and 
family members applauded and cheered. 
</P>
<P>
 But then, before they could celebrate the start of their new careers, the 
sweat-soaked freshmen firefighters had to turn around and clean up the mess 
left by a demonstration of their newfound skills. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the Burbank Fire Department's 1994 graduation ceremony Friday, the 
recruits extinguished a burning car, doused a four-story inferno and conducted 
a simulated rescue. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the conclusion of an intense 10-week training program in which the 
recruits' physical and mental stamina, as well as their personal relationships 
at home, were constantly tested. But after being sworn in and issued their 
badges and belt buckles, they said it was worth the strain. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took me a while to figure out what I wanted to do in life, but once I 
decided I wanted to be a firefighter there was nothing else," said Edmondo St. 
Cyr, 30, the only African American among the recruits. "It's unexplainable, the 
good feeling you get when you do this type of work." 
</P>
<P>
 Like St. Cyr, who previously worked as an Alhambra firefighter, all but one of 
the recruits had previous firefighting experience, mostly as volunteer or 
part-time firefighters. They ranged in age from 21 to 32, and their prior 
careers ranged from cabinetmaker to surfboard shop manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank Fire Chief Mike Davis said more than 2,000 people applied when the 
Fire Department announced it was recruiting 19 firefighters last year. Through 
a long process of written, oral, medical and psychological exams, the 
department pared the pool down to 19 recruits, one of whom dropped out before 
the training course began and another who failed to complete it. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said the graduates will increase the department's ranks to 125 
firefighters -- a level from which it had dipped in recent years due to 
attrition. The department normally fills individual vacancies by hiring 
experienced firefighters, and only recruits and trains new ones when there is a 
greater need, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was our first graduating class since 1992, when we had four new 
firefighters in our class," Davis said. "This is an exceptionally high quality 
group. We were very fortunate to have people with so much prior firefighting 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
 While the recruits gave different reasons for wanting to become firefighters 
-- ranging from serving the public to the thrill of fighting the flames -- at 
least three were following in the footsteps of their fathers. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the fathers were on hand for the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he was a little boy he used to play with my uniform," Bill Garland, a 
Los Angeles County firefighter, said of his son Matt, a 23-year-old recruit. 
"He always wanted to be a firefighter, but he got real serious about it about 
three years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the graduates has already been assigned to one of Burbank's five fire 
stations and many of them were scheduled to start their first shifts today. But 
David Burke, 23, said he feels as if he's been on the job ever since he started 
at firefighters' boot camp 10 weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was during the dead of summer," he said. "We did our drills in the 
morning, then we had lectures and training all afternoon, then we'd go home and 
have up to six hours of homework every night. It was hard, but we all pulled 
together and we did it." STEVE RYFLE

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; POLICE SEARCHING FOR HATE-CRIME VANDALS

<P>
 Glendale police were searching Friday for the vandals responsible for 
spray-painting the city's only synagogue, the Temple Sinai, with swastikas. 
</P>
<P>
 The motive behind the hate crime remained unclear.But authorities believe it 
was committed between 2 a.m. and 7 a.m. on Thursday by someone who lives in 
Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to imagine someone coming from outside of the city to do it," said 
police spokesman Chahe Keuroghelian. "Why take time to do this in Glendale?" 
</P>
<P>
 The synagogue's rabbi, Carole Meyers, helped draft a plan to combat hate 
crimes that was publicized earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Strangers phoned the temple Friday to offer words of support before Sabbath 
service in the evening, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are asking the public for help in solving the case and are patrolling 
the area around the synagogue more frequently. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a felony to commit a hate crime against a place of worship, punishable 
by up to a year in prison, Keuroghelian said. VIVIEN LOU CHEN

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; LOCAL CAMPAIGN RAISES FUNDS FOR THE LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Mayor Karyn Foley stopped by Los Angeles County's tiny library branch 
here last spring to check out a best seller, she discovered just how popular 
the book was: 84 people in the county library system were already on the 
waiting list. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Hey wait a minute,' " Foley recalled. " 'By the time it filters down 
to me, it could be a year.' " 
</P>
<P>
 She said she realized then that the library would need to obtain more books. 
</P>
<P>
 "The clamor is for books," she said. "Wherever I go in town, people are 
telling me they want to see more books in the library." 
</P>
<P>
 County Librarian Sandra Reuben said she would like to help, but the county 
cannot afford to buy new books for its 87 branches. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year we weren't able to buy any books," she said. "We have no book 
budget." 
</P>
<P>
 The county this year established a special assessment district to fund 
libraries, but the Calabasas City Council opted not to join. 
</P>
<P>
 Foley said council members tried and failed to obtain guarantees that the 
$235,000 to be raised from Calabasas property owners under the assessment 
district would go back to the Calabasas library. 
</P>
<P>
 "It happened too fast for us to get total citizen input," Foley said. "We had 
a week's notice tops, or 10 days." 
</P>
<P>
 So began a local campaign to raise money for books, which, since late June has 
raised $1,100, Foley said. The money will go toward obtaining best sellers for 
the library. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the money is being raised at weekly book sales held Saturday mornings 
at the Farmers' Market in Old Town Calabasas.  
</P>
<P>
 Residents have also donated books, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Donations of used books have been tremendous," she said. "We have collected 
about 3,000 books. One person alone gave me 700 books from her husband's book 
collection when he passed away." FRANK MANNING

<P>
 A Cal State Northridge program that researches the spread of cancer has been 
awarded a $30,000 research grant from a private foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest grant, awarded earlier this month from the Joseph Drown Foundation, 
brings the total to $200,000 given by the organization to the university's 
Center for Cancer and Developmental Biology, program head Steven Oppenheimer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers will use the funding to examine how cell adhesion works in sea 
urchins. Scientists say cancer spreads in part because cells lose their ability 
to adhere to each other. JEFF SCHNAUFER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; SALES-TAX REVENUES SLIDE IN 1ST QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Calabasas' sales tax revenues dropped almost 13.6% over the first 
quarter of this year, reversing a 2.9% increase in the last quarter of 1993, 
according to city records. 
</P>
<P>
 The city took in about $272,000 in sales taxes during the first three months 
of 1994, said City Manager Charles Cate. That's down from about $315,000 for 
the same period in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a matter of some concern," Cate said. "We'll be monitoring the 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he believes the decline signals a downward trend, Cate answered that 
he hopes it's "an anomaly" caused by the Northridge earthquake.  
</P>
<P>
 He said he is waiting to see figures from the second quarter of this year, 
which could show a rebound. Those figures, he said, will be available next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the decline in first-quarter revenues is due to lagging auto sales, 
Cate said. Auto sales account for 30% of the city's total sales tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Porro, general manager of an Acura dealership on Calabasas Road, said 
business has dropped about 50% since construction began last December on the 
Ventura Freeway off-ramp to Parkway Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem is that motorists on the freeway don't see dealership 
because their view is blocked by a retaining wall, said Porro. A screen 
installed atop the retaining wall to deflect the glare of headlights has made 
matters worse, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cate said the city is working with Caltrans and the dealership to resolve the 
problem. The city, he said, has hired a private contractor to lower the glare 
screen to make the dealership more visible. 
</P>
<P>
 Cate said the city is bracing for the effects of the planned departure of 
Lockheed Corp., possibly as early as January. The firm pays about $20,000 
annually in utility taxes, but of greater concern is a projected decline in 
hotel bed taxes, Cate said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's two hotels pay about $400,000 annually in bed taxes, a figure that 
will decline significantly if Lockheed leaves, Cate said. FRANK MANNING

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS; FREEWAY SOUND WALL DISPUTE RESOLVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Canwood Street residents have settled a simmering dispute with two area 
businesses over the planned construction of a sound wall along the Ventura 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not what we wanted, but it was a compromise," said Tom Schlender, owner 
of one of the businesses, Warehouse Discount Center, on Friday."We'll live with 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighborhood residents began lobbying for the wall in 1985, when a truck and a 
car careened off the freeway and plowed through a chain-link fence, nearly 
hitting a neighborhood resident. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents began collecting noise readings and accident reports, and they 
enlisted help from local politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 But the two business owners, fearing the barrier would make their businesses 
hard to see from the freeway, insisted on a 500-foot opening in the wall near 
their establishments. The residents insisted on limiting the opening to 350 
feet, saying a larger opening would defeat the purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides failed to reach a compromise during a stormy meeting three weeks 
ago, said Mayor Joan Yacovone. She said representatives from both sides 
continued meeting until they reached the compromise Wednesday at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 They ended up agreeing that the opening would be 400 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Emotions were running very high three weeks ago," said Yacovone. "It's very 
nice to see them be able to work together." 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Roller, a transportation engineer for Caltrans, said Friday that 
construction on the 16-foot-high wall is expected to begin next April. 
Preliminary estimates place the cost at $800,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will have to help pay for the wall, under an agreement with Caltrans, 
he said. FRANK MANNING

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; HOLMES RECOGNIZED FOR HIGH ATTENDANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Holmes Middle School in Northridge has been recognized as having the highest 
attendance rate for a middle school in the Los Angeles Unified School District 
for the 1993-94 school year. 
</P>
<P>
 Runners-up from the San Fernando Valley were Frost Middle School in Granada 
Hills, which had the second-highest rate, Byrd Middle School in Sun Valley, 
which took fourth, and the fifth place Portola Middle School in Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
 School board representative Jeff Horton said that attendance is one of the 
best indicators of a school's success or failure. "It's basic and sound and 
relatively easy to measure," Horton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing really matters if the kids don't show up at school." 
</P>
<P>
 Holmes principal Ron Twombly attributed the 92.4% attendance rate at his 
school to the strong commitment of teachers and staff workers, and to 
recognition given to students with good records. 
</P>
<P>
 At Holmes, students with perfect attendance are recognized on a monthly basis 
and are awarded with tickets to amusement parks or ice cream parties. 
</P>
<P>
 School budgets are determined by student attendance, noted district budget 
director Mark Shrager. "Our primary concern is for the student: The better the 
student's attendance, the more they will get out of their educational 
experience," Shrager said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But in addition, by far the largest share (of a school's money) comes 
directly from student attendance," Shrager said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Valley schools that were recognized for their attendance rates were 
Castlebay Elementary School in Northridge, which had the third highest 
elementary school attendance in the district, and Woodland Hills' El Camino 
Real and Chatsworth high schools that had the fifth and third, respectively, 
best records among district high schools. MAKI BECKER

CON MAN SWINDLES RESTAURANTS WITH LIQUOR LICENSE SCAM; FRAUD: OFFICIALS SAY HE 
POSED AS AN AGENT WITH THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE CONTROL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A man posing as an agent with the state Department of Alcoholic Beverage 
Control swindled two San Fernando Valley restaurant owners out of more than 
$7,500 for phony liquor licenses, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 State police are continuing to search for the man and any additional victims, 
said Carl DeWing, an ABC spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 DeWing said the man approached his first victim on Sept. 19 at her Pacoima 
restaurant, telling her that he would grant her an alcohol license if she met 
him the following day at the Van Nuys State Building. 
</P>
<P>
 At their meeting, the phony agent took the ABC application forms he had given 
the victim and gave her what appeared to be an ABC license. He told her to give 
him $1,550 -- $1,200 for the license and $350 in tax -- DeWing said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim told authorities that the man took her money and the license and 
told her he would return with a receipt. When he failed to come back, the 
victim and her husband called police. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second instance, the man went into a North Hollywood restaurant and 
told the owner he was the ABC office manager in Van Nuys. He said if she gave 
him a good deal on a catering job, he would help her get what is known as a 
general license, which allows a restaurant to serve all alcoholic beverages. 
That license is available from the state for $17,200, DeWing said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man later took $6,862 in cash from the restaurateur and promised that her 
temporary license would arrive in the mail. The woman called police when she 
discovered that the man had given her a fake pager number. 
</P>
<P>
 "He obviously knew that there was a state ABC office in the Van Nuys building, 
and somehow he got the paperwork," DeWing said. "His description, though, does 
not match anyone in that office." 
</P>
<P>
 DeWing said the man, who said his name was Paul Medina, is a Latino male, 
about 5-foot-9, 160 pounds, with dark hair and eyes. He was seen driving a red, 
four-door Toyota. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're warning the public that this guy is out there claiming to be an ABC 
agent and making available phony alcohol licenses," DeWing said. "The public 
should know that ABC investigators do not solicit or accept cash for alcohol 
licenses."

CANOGA PARK MAN ARRESTED AFTER STANDOFF; CRIME: POLICE SAY THE GUNMAN HELD HIS 
GIRLFRIEND AND HER FOUR CHILDREN HOSTAGE FOR FIVE HOURS. NO INJURIES WERE 
REPORTED.

<P>
 An armed man held his live-in girlfriend and her four children hostage for 
several hours early Friday until police forced the gunman out of his home with 
tear gas, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no injuries during the five-hour standoff, which began about 3:30 
a.m., Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged gunman, Ron Adams, 43, lived with the victims in a two-bedroom 
townhouse on the 21000 block of Gresham Street, Police Lt. Steve Zipperman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams was booked on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several neighbors said Adams and his girlfriend, Paula Primo, 35, often 
argued, and that police had been at the couple's apartment twice in the past 
two months to intervene in domestic disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent incident began early Friday when Adams' girlfriend phoned 
police and said Adams was armed with a .38-caliber revolver, and "threatening 
to injure himself and others," Zipperman said. Police said Adams was apparently 
jealous. 
</P>
<P>
 When police arrived, they evacuated nearby apartments and called the SWAT team 
and a hostage negotiator, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the standoff, Primo's 17-year-old son and his teen-age girlfriend 
escaped from the apartment's garage where they had been living, police said. It 
was unclear whether they had been directly threatened by Adams. 
</P>
<P>
 After talking to police, Adams released Primo's 15-year-old son and 
11-year-old daughter, and finally, Primo, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't have any demands, he just wanted someone to listen to him," 
Zipperman said. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Adams refused to surrender about 8:15 a.m., the SWAT team fired four 
tear gas canisters through his window, forcing him outside, police and 
neighbors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors later said they often heard the couple fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't sleep at night," said Michele Thomas, who lives in a townhouse unit 
behind the couple. "You hear him being loud, you hear her, and then a child 
starts crying." 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's seven days in a week, they argue five," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 The apartment's resident manager, Vickie Smith, said Adams recently lost his 
job, but Primo had recently gotten a job. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the seven-year history of this building we've never had a police incident 
like this," Smith said. "No theft problem, no break-ins. Domestic disputes, 
yes, but nothing like this."

FOOTHILL DIVISION GETS NEW COMMANDING OFFICER; POLICE: CAPT. RONALD BERGMANN, 
TAKING OVER FROM RETIRING CAPT. GUS DRULIAS, PROMISES TO PROVIDE CONTINUITY IN 
COMMUNITY RELATIONS.

 Returning to the place were he began his career as a patrol officer 21 years 
ago, Capt. Ronald Bergmann officially took over as commanding officer of the 
Foothill Division of the Los Angeles Police Department on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergmann, 48, replaces Capt. Gus Drulias, who retired after more than 30 years 
of service to the LAPD and 10 months as head of the Foothill Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergmann, formerly commanding officer of Valley Traffic, said he is happy to 
be able to come full circle and lead the division that gave him his start. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he has no plans of retiring anytime soon and plans to work closely 
with Foothill residents to improve on the community policing efforts of 
Drulias. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Michael Windsor, who worked closely with Drulias at Foothill, said 
Drulias wanted to improve relations with the public, especially in light of the 
Rodney King beating in March, 1991, in Lakeview Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gus wanted to focus on improving the department as a whole, especially in 
community relations," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, Bergmann met with members of the Foothill Community 
Advisory Board to ease their fears about the change in administration.  
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing that residents in the community wanted to know was if I was 
going to be here longer than 10 months," Bergmann said. "They want some 
continuity." 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Dan Hoffman of the Valley Bureau, which oversees Foothill, said Bergmann 
brings a "sincere commitment to work with the community." 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Chicago, Bergmann came to Los Angeles 21 years ago after serving 
in the military. He has worked as a detective in the Hollywood Division and 
served for four years on the security planning commission for the 1984 Summer 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 Drulias, described by his peers as a well-respected officer, served in nearly 
every capacity during his 33 years with the department. He worked as a patrol 
officer, detective and in both vice and narcotics. Before heading to Foothill, 
he worked in the Van Nuys Division for three years.  
</P>
<P>
 According to officers, Drulias decided to retire after he was offered a 
lucrative job in the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a totally personal decision and has nothing to do with the department 
itself," Hoffman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers in the Foothill Division said Drulias was the consummate police 
officer, always careful to represent the department with pride. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gus Drulias is a gentleman," Hoffman said. "I've never seen him lose his 
temper. He's very cordial and always handles things in a professional manner." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Hoffman, Drulias was born to be a policemen. His brother and 
uncle were officers and his son works in the Van Nuys Division.

MAN KILLED BY METROLINK TRAIN IN APPARENT SUICIDE; NORTHRIDGE: WITNESSES TELL 
POLICE THAT DESPITE REPEATED HORN SOUNDINGS, THE PEDESTRIAN WALKED INTO THE 
PATH OF ONCOMING ENGINE. NONE OF THE PASSENGERS WERE INJURED.

<P>
 A San Fernando Valley man in his early 20s apparently killed himself Friday 
night by walking into the path of an oncoming Metrolink train that was bound 
for Moorpark, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told police that as the train neared Louise Avenue about 6:20 p.m. a 
man was seen walking along the center of the track, Metrolink spokesman Peter 
Hidalgo said. Repeated soundings of the train's horn did not deter the man, 
Hidalgo said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was walking eastbound and the train was westbound and he kept on walking 
right into the train," said Sgt. Rod Grahek, of the Los Angeles Police 
Department's Valley Traffic Division. 
</P>
<P>
 The train struck the man and threw him to the side of the tracks, Hidalgo 
said. "According to witnesses the individual did not expire until approximately 
half an hour later," Hidalgo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once it was clear the man was not moving from the track, Hidalgo said, the 
engineer attempted an emergency stop, but it took the 400-ton train about a 
quarter-mile to come to a complete halt. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the 300 passengers were injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the man's girlfriend, who was summoned to the scene, told 
police the man had been depressed and despondent and had talked of killing 
himself. He had two plans, she said. She said he planned to either jump off a 
freeway overpass or walk into the path of an oncoming train. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot take responsibility for someone who wants to take their life," 
Hidalgo said. "It's a very frustrating occurrence, especially when incidents 
like what occurred this evening cause significant delays for passengers on 
board the train." 
</P>
<P>
 The incident marks the seventh time this year a person was killed by a 
Metrolink train, Hidalgo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink trains have struck and killed 26 people since operations began in 
1992. Nine of those were determined to be suicidal, according to a Metrolink 
spokesman.

 ENVIRONMENT WORKSHOP: Both religious background and practical ideas to involve 
churches in environmental concerns will be presented next Saturday at an 
interdenominational workshop in Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Shantilal Bhagat, a Church of the Brethren official who edited a new 
resource packet for churches called "God's Earth, Our Home," will deliver the 
keynote talk at 10 a.m. for the daylong conference at Reseda First United 
Methodist Church, 18120 Saticoy St. 
</P>
<P>
 Other speakers will include the Rev. Bill Somplatsky-Jarman, associate 
director for environmental justice for the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.); 
Episcopal priest Peter Kreitler, co-founder of L.A. Clean-up; Victoria Loorz of 
World Vision, creator of an environmental start-up kit for evangelical 
churches, and Lourdes Arguelles, professor of gender and Chicano studies at 
Pitzer College in Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
 Carmen Twillie, who sang "The Circle of Life" in the Disney animated film "The 
Lion King," will join the Alkebu-lan Boys Choir in the opening worship service 
at the conference, which will begin at 9 a.m. The cost of the workshop is $10. 
</P>
<P>
 The deadline for registration has been extended to Thursday. For information, 
call (818) 344-7870. 
</P>
<P>
 SURF RIDERS: A notice in the newsletter of Grace Community Church -- a 
congregation in the fundamentalist tradition -- invited men "to catch some 
gnarly waves with your brothers-in-the-Lord" in a new surfing fellowship 
forming at the Sun Valley church. 
</P>
<P>
 "About 30 men responded at our first meeting last Saturday," said organizer 
Bruce Young of Simi Valley, who indicated that the good turnout may belie the 
sometimes stuffy image of the theologically conservative church. 
</P>
<P>
 The group planned to meet for an early breakfast this morning at a pancake 
house in Agoura, then proceed to Leo Carrillo State Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 SURF DUNKERS: At Zuma Beach today, ministers from Porter Ranch's Shepherd of 
the Hills Church will immerse 21 people in the surf during an 11 a.m. service 
called "an old-fashioned ocean baptism" by Senior Pastor Jess Moody. 
</P>
<P>
 Moody will be assisted by Associate Pastors Haus Miller, Patrick Moody and Rob 
Myers for the seashore rites near Lifeguard Station 7 at Zuma Beach. Songs and 
prayers will precede the baptisms. 
</P>
<P>
 GAY/LESBIAN ISSUES: A two-day Presbyterian conference on divisive issues of 
homosexuality and clergy ordination will begin Friday night at Glendale 
Presbyterian Church with prominent speakers from both sides of the issues. 
</P>
<P>
 President Richard Mouw of Fuller Theological Seminary and the Rev. Mel White, 
a former ghostwriter for Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell who later announced 
that he is gay, will be among the speakers at the conference organized by the 
Presbytery of San Fernando, the regional body of the Presbyterian Church 
(U.S.A.). 
</P>
<P>
 "We very intentionally have tried to make it a level playing field with 
respected people holding opposite views," said the Rev. Chet B. Gean of Reseda, 
who designed the program. "No vote will be taken, but maybe we can find greater 
consensus without people being so defensive on either side." JOHN DART

RELIGION / JOHN DART; SHIFTING FROM SALES TO SERMONS; NORTHRIDGE: A SEARCH FOR 
THE SPIRITUAL LED ROGER BARKLEY TO THE MINISTRY. HE SAYS HIS WIFE'S FAILING 
HEALTH HAS BROUGHT HIM VALUABLE INSIGHTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Businessman Roger Barkley and his wife gave up a combined yearly income of 
$200,000 so that he could enter the ministry, a career he began this month as a 
pastor in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, however, the Rev. Roger Barkley, 47, brings to the Congregational 
Church of Northridge not only insights from their sacrifice of material comfort 
for spiritual fulfillment but also the perspectives on life the couple gained 
from wife Amy's battle with cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Barkley, a confident non-believer 10 years ago, doubts he could have coped 
with the strain without his midlife spiritual discoveries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Faith has allowed me to find hope and happiness in the middle of a crisis," 
said Barkley, whose wife suffered a serious relapse recently after a good year 
following a major operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've learned to find joy in the moment, which now may be only an hour free 
of pain," he said. Although undergoing daily radiation treatments at present, 
Amy Barkley "has never been happier," he said. "We've talked about this a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 She was in the pews for her husband's first two Sundays in the pulpit, said 
Charles Dugan, a former trustee of the 350-member congregation. "She has a 
wonderful spirit," said Dugan, who was on the church's search committee for a 
pastor. "He's an energetic and sincere fellow who gives a very good sermon." 
</P>
<P>
 The odyssey that took the onetime sales manager for Del Monte foods to a 
seminary, then to the wooded, five-acre grounds of the church on Balboa 
Boulevard is not entirely unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seminary students looking to their second or third careers are very common 
these days," said Kendell Rice, director of enrollment services for the School 
of Theology at Claremont, where the average age of students is between 35 and 
38 years old. "It's a national phenomenon; they have a need to serve others." 
</P>
<P>
 But the story is unusual in that the Barkleys gave up a financially 
comfortable life in Orange County while well aware that her cancer, which at 
times seemed conquered, might return to thwart their quest. 
</P>
<P>
 When Roger and Amy, both divorced and caring for children, started dating, 
they quickly learned to avoid talking about religion. "She was faith-filled, 
and she and I totally disagreed on the subject," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That changed, he said, after he was "stopped in my tracks" while on a walk one 
day. "I didn't hear a voice, but I knew I was surrounded by the presence of 
God. 
</P>
<P>
 "In that moment, I came to understand two things: one, that we live in a sea 
of God, and, two, that no one religion or denomination has got the whole 
picture. Each group has a little of it. As we open ourselves up, we can be 
transformed." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he didn't tell Amy about his experience, but instead visited a 
succession of Protestant churches each Sunday. "I was turned off at every one 
-- by their rather polished sermons, academic in analysis, and by music that 
didn't appeal to me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, he tried the 3,000-member Huntington Beach Church of Religious Science, 
then pastored by the Rev. Peggy Bassett, who was prominent in the metaphysical, 
motivational denomination. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really spoke to me," Barkley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know it at the time, but that was the church that Amy usually 
attended," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barkley was then the Southern California sales manager for Del Monte, the food 
company's district manager of the year in 1987. "In 11 years with the company, 
I never missed a sales quota," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, he says now, he felt that something was lacking. "I felt 
hollow," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While continuing in his job, he took Religious Science classes at night and 
after three years became a licensed practitioner -- a pastoral counselor -- in 
the Los Angeles-based denomination. 
</P>
<P>
 While Barkley and his future wife were still dating, she underwent surgery for 
breast cancer in an operation that was deemed successful. 
</P>
<P>
 After they married in 1988 and he was studying Religious Science, the couple 
talked about his entering the ministry -- although his job and her work as a 
mortgage broker brought in about five times the income he could expect from 
pastoring a church. 
</P>
<P>
 They sold their home in Cypress in 1991 to finance his studies at Pacific 
School of Religion, an interdenominational seminary in Berkeley that is part of 
a Protestant-Catholic-Unitarian consortium called the Graduate Theological 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Amy Barkley had had no signs of cancer for about five years, but in Barkley's 
first semester the disease reappeared and doctors told her she had about two 
years left to live, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A suggested bone marrow replacement procedure was estimated to cost $240,000. 
Their insurance company was unwilling to cover it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I put on a fund-raising campaign and in four months time donations to the 
hospital reached $107,000," he said. Meanwhile, a compromise was reached with 
insurers to cover the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of his three years in the seminary, Barkley received a masters of 
divinity degree earlier this year. Although he had enrolled as a ministerial 
candidate from Religious Science, he had left that church body to join the 
United Church of Christ, a liberal Protestant denomination that is the 
principal supporter of the Pacific School of Religion. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the hardest decision of my life," he said. "Religious Science has a 
good deal to offer but in some ways I had run into a dead-end theologically," 
he said. Religious Science is noted for its eclectic approach to holistic 
thought and world religions without being tied solely to Christian tenets. 
</P>
<P>
 Barkley had several offers from churches that needed ministers, but he was 
urged to seek the Northridge post by the Rev. Reiss Potterveld, who had left 
that congregation in early 1993 to become vice president of Pacific School of 
Religion. 
</P>
<P>
 "This church seemed just right," Barkley said. With an average Sunday 
attendance of about 175 worshipers, Barkley said that it was a good place to 
try his ideas on church growth, and attracting "unchurched" people from the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first interviewed for the pastor's job in May, Amy was pretty 
healthy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, however, the cancer has spread and she undergoes daily treatments, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he frankly describes Amy as bald now, and overweight, from the 
powerful medicines she must take, "yet I love her more deeply and passionately 
than when she was younger and more shapely," he said. "Our love has deepened." 
</P>
<P>
 And in the face of his personal tragedy, he said, he is still excited about 
launching his life as a minister, the path his wife backed him in choosing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing God's business," the former sales executive said. "We're in 
partnership with God."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; LA MESA'S UNIFORM WAIT NEARLY OVER, OFFICIAL 
SAYS; SCHOOLS: PARENTS ARE TRYING TO BE PATIENT AND TO LAUGH OFF THE PROBLEMS, 
BUT SOME ARE WONDERING IF THEY SHOULD BUY THEIR CHILDREN DIFFERENT OUTFITS.

 A host of problems has kept school uniforms from reaching students at La Mesa 
Junior High, but a top official of the clothing manufacturer assured parents 
the wait is almost over. 
</P>
<P>
 The uniforms were on the minds of many of the 50 people at La Mesa's first 
Parent Advisory Committee meeting Thursday night -- the newly opened public 
school had been promoted as one of the first in the state to require student 
uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to laugh it off," said Lisa Gibson, a Canyon Country resident whose 
11-year-old daughter, Monica, attends La Mesa. "The hardest thing is you don't 
know whether to buy fall clothes for your child for school." 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson said she has received one pair of uniform pants since placing her first 
order for $150 worth of clothes in June. She placed a second order in August 
after hearing there was no record of her first order, and lately she said she's 
been on the phone every day trying to sort out the confusion between the two 
orders, each of which was billed to her credit card under a different name. 
</P>
<P>
 "I speak to a new and improved person every day," Gibson said, referring to 
extra personnel the clothing manufacturer has hired to answer thousands of 
incoming calls. 
</P>
<P>
 About one-third of the 500 students at La Mesa had received part or all of 
their uniforms when school started Sept. 8. The uniforms consist of a variety 
of boys and girls clothing in the school's colors of white, black and teal. 
</P>
<P>
 But almost none of the students are wearing them, since the school has made 
them optional until further notice. 
</P>
<P>
 Cherokee Inc. is a large clothing wholesaler that is entering the school 
uniform business for the first time this year, said Mike Singer, president of 
the company's uniform division. As a result, some unexpected glitches occurred 
in early August with computers processing orders for more than 20 California 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The company hired a second firm to process the orders, he said. But a 15-digit 
computer code providing each uniform's specifications had to be translated to a 
10-digit code to fit on a subcontractor's computer system. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble was compounded when a truckload of 9,000 uniforms was hijacked at 
gunpoint shortly before school opened.  
</P>
<P>
 Virtually all of the stolen uniforms have been remade and most of La Mesa's 
uniforms should arrive by next week, Singer said.

 In an off-beat ceremony reflecting its creative reputation, CalArts on Friday 
marked its 25th year, as well as the school's recovery from the Northridge 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A traditional ribbon-cutting ceremony turned into a Three Stooges sketch that 
left the school's president wrapped in yellow tape. That was followed by a jazz 
performance given from the back of a truck. 
</P>
<P>
 The event was a suitably quirky welcome-back to the highly renowned arts 
school founded by Walt Disney. 
</P>
<P>
 "My heart's quite full," said Steven D. Lavine, CalArts president. "It's such 
a miracle that we have this wonderful -- better -- building back." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 300 students, alumni, faculty and officials turned out for the 
ceremony, some dressed formally and others clad for art college in T-shirts, 
shorts and sandals. One student wore a black shirt with "Shift Happens: CalArts 
'94" printed across the front in cracked, white and yellow lettering. 
</P>
<P>
 It was one of several references to the Jan. 17 earthquake that battered the 
60-acre campus during its first week of the spring semester, hammering the 
500,000 square-foot main building that houses art and music studios, rehearsal 
rooms and administrative offices. 
</P>
<P>
 "The boiler moved 15 miles off its spot and we still can't find it!" quipped 
Jeff Libby, impersonating Moe Howard in a skit about the Three Stooges as the 
earthquake repair crew. "What are you people doing here? We're not finished 
yet!" 
</P>
<P>
 Repairs will indeed continue during the semester, but classes resumed earlier 
this month -- much to the relief of the college leadership. The campus had 
suffered about $30 million in damage and it was unknown whether CalArts would 
see its 25th year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those of you who were here Jan. 17 know that the last time the community 
gathered on these steps, it was because we couldn't go inside," said Lavine. 
"It is a heroic and wonderful story. This was an effort of this entire 
community and the surrounding community in Santa Clarita and the surrounding 
community in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Classes were halted for two weeks after the quake, and then were resumed in 
makeshift classrooms in buildings ranging from a synagogue to an abandoned 
aerospace facility. CalArts officials on Friday praised the efforts of 
businesses, government agencies and faculty members who provided classroom 
space, money and muscle to help the campus recover. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to believe that a few months ago, this place looked like Bosnia," 
trustee Joe Smith said in a speech. 
</P>
<P>
 CalArts received about $22 million from the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency and $4.4 million in private grants for earthquake repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,000 students attend the private college, which includes schools of 
art, dance, film, music, theater and critical studies. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney began planning CalArts in 1960, ultimately merging the Chouinard Art 
Institute and the Los Angeles Conservatory of Music in 1961. He died in 1966, 
but plans proceeded and the institute formed in Los Angeles. Construction on 
its new campus began in 1969, and the school moved to Valencia in November, 
1971. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison A. Price, a CalArts trustee who helped cut the ribbon Friday, 
suggested the school's founder would be pleased with how well the campus is 
rebuilding after the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Walt Disney was a constant tinkerer, who would rip out parts of his park to 
make improvements," said Price. "When I look back (at the earthquake), I wonder 
if he didn't have a hand in it."

LASORDA PACT RENEWED, NOT PERRANOSKI'S; DODGERS: MANAGER, 67, IS TOLD BY CLAIRE 
THAT THE TEAM'S EMPHASIS NEXT SEASON WILL BE ON YOUNG PLAYERS. PITCHING COACH 
IS REPLACED BY DAVE WALLACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Dodgers made some key decisions Friday, renewing the contract of Manager 
Tom Lasorda for next season but signaling a change in their pitching staff by 
firing longtime coach Ron Perranoski. It will be Lasorda's 19th year as the 
Dodger manager and 46th with the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Perranoski's firing was a surprise. In 14 seasons as the pitching coach, his 
staffs finished with the first- or second-best earned-run average in the 
National League nine times. But Fred Claire, executive vice president, said 
that the club plans to go with younger pitchers and thought it was time for a 
change. Perranoski will be replaced by Dave Wallace, who has been the minor 
league pitching instructor for about 12 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason we made the change is that we will have a lot of young pitchers on 
the staff, and no one knows then better than Dave Wallace," Claire said. "Dave 
is held in high regard and is well respected. He has worked hard with Ismael 
Valdes, Greg Hansell and Antonio Osuna and will be going to Arizona for the 
instructional league and to winter ball. Critical to the success of our team in 
1995 will be the performance of our young pitchers." 
</P>
<P>
 Claire's comments make the future tenuous for potential free agents Orel 
Hershiser, Kevin Gross and relievers Jim Gott and Roger McDowell, about whom 
Claire says he has made no decisions. "What I do know is that the Hansells and 
the Todd Williamses and the (Felix) Rodriguezes have vaulted to that status 
where they are going to move quickly," Claire said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his mediocre 58-56 record this season, the move to renew Lasorda's 
contract was not surprising. The Dodgers had been in first place for 87 days in 
the National League's West Division, a position they held when the season 
ended. The Dodgers appeared to be headed for their first postseason berth since 
1988, when Lasorda's team won the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they didn't want me back, I would have walked out of (Dodger owner Peter 
O'Malley's) office and thanked him for all the wonderful things he and the 
Dodgers have done for me," said Lasorda, whose contract was renewed for one 
season.  
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, I felt I wanted to manage again. I felt I could still do the job. If I 
didn't think that I could do for them exactly what they wanted me to do, I 
wouldn't have accepted it. If I thought I was hurting this club as the field 
leader, I would not be here. But I know one thing, I know I can still do the 
job for them."  
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda usually has managed on one-year contracts, and speculation began, as 
it has in recent years, that the 1994 season might be his last. The Dodgers had 
struggled through the 1992 season and achieved only average records the next 
two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 But O'Malley said before this season began that he did not blame Lasorda for 
the decline, instead pointing to player injuries and an interruption of talent 
in the minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the Dodgers say their flow of talent has resumed. And that, in part, was 
the subject of a meeting Lasorda had Friday morning with Claire. 
</P>
<P>
 "The primary thrust (of our conversation) is the direction we are taking as 
far as the young players," Claire said. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I am confident that Tommy can do a job and continue to do the job and is 
enthusiastic in leading the team with the knowledge that we will have a heavy 
emphasis on youth. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has had the opportunity (during the strike) to see the young players and I 
feel confident that we have the players who can come up here and do the job for 
us, just as they have in recent years." 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda, who turned 67 on Thursday, has a record of 1,480-1,338, tying him for 
15th in victories with Earl Weaver. He has two World Series championships, four 
National League pennants and six Western Division titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda's salary is believed to be between $800,000 and $1 million, but he 
said that money was not discussed in his meeting with O'Malley. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got this job, I told them I would pay them to do it," Lasorda said.

USC LOSES WASHINGTON IN ELIGIBILITY DISPUTE; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: TROJANS EXPECT 
QUICK RESOLUTION, BUT FRESHMAN TAILBACK WILL BE MISSED AGAINST BAYLOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As if he didn't have enough problems patching together his injury-stricken 
pass offense, USC Coach John Robinson confronted another Friday -- the loss for 
at least one game of tailback Delon Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 USC (1-1), which plays Baylor (3-0) tonight at the Coliseum, announced that 
Washington, a freshman, "will be withheld from further football competition 
until questions regarding his eligibility for intercollegiate competition have 
been resolved." 
</P>
<P>
 The three-paragraph announcement stated only that Washington's "initial 
eligibility . . . had been certified by the NCAA clearinghouse." 
</P>
<P>
 The release further stated: "The matter is being thoroughly investigated, and 
USC believes it will be promptly resolved." 
</P>
<P>
 A USC spokesman and Robinson said the university couldn't further discuss 
Washington's problem because of state and federal privacy restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 It is believed, however, that there is a problem with Washington's ACT test 
result, which qualified him for admission to USC. 
</P>
<P>
 After practice Friday, Robinson said, "I can't talk about it, except to say 
from what I know about it, it's something that can be cleared up quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 He said Washington would be at tonight's game but would not be in uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington, a 5-foot-11, 190-pounder from Kimball High in Dallas, was to have 
been the backup tailback, behind sophomore starter Shawn Walters, tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington, 18, was off to a fast start. He averaged 8.1 yards per carry in 
two games and had a 109-yard game in USC's opener, a 24-17 victory over 
Washington. He had a third-down, 34-yard run on USC's tying third-quarter drive 
in that game. 
</P>
<P>
 He scored a touchdown and gained 44 yards at Penn State two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Penn State game, Nittany Lion Coach Joe Paterno acknowledged 
Washington's skills, saying, "We know all about Delon Washington. Some people 
last year felt he was the best high school running back in the country." 
</P>
<P>
 The circumstances of Washington's decision to enroll at USC became a national 
story this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after Washington had told his older brother, Benny, that he had reduced 
his choices to Michigan, Colorado and USC -- the school his brother had once 
dreamed of attending -- Benny Washington was shot and killed at a Dallas car 
wash.  
</P>
<P>
 Within hours of the shooting, Washington called Robinson and told him he had 
decided to attend USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington's unavailability doubtless means extra duty for Walters, and 
another freshman, Rodney Sermons of Diamond Bar.  
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans were already short-handed in the backfield. A weeks-old hamstring 
injury plagues junior Leonard Green, who still isn't available. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson has been trying to piece together a pass offense to compete against 
an aggressive Baylor defense that has intercepted eight passes in three games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans, after an off week, are at least partially healed after their 
38-14 defeat at Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
 Baylor, led by true freshman quarterback Jeff Watson, has beaten Louisiana 
Tech, 44-3, San Jose State, 54-20, and Oklahoma State, 14-10. 
</P>
<P>
 USC, after opening with a 24-17 victory over Washington, played Penn State 
without two key wide receivers, Keyshawn Johnson and Ed Hervey. And quarterback 
Rob Johnson, hit in the back in the Washington game, played hurt. He was held 
out of last week's practices but seemed fit this week.  
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans had hopes of building an explosive pass offense this season. To 
replace departed All-American Johnnie Morton, USC recruited Keyshawn Johnson 
and fit him into the attack with returnees Hervey and Ken Grace.  
</P>
<P>
 But Rob Johnson, who could become USC's all-time passing leader this year, has 
thrown for only one touchdown and 350 yards in two games. Tonight, he has 
Keyshawn Johnson back. But Hervey is still sidelined because of a knee injury. 
Keyshawn Johnson sat out two weeks of practice and one game because of a thigh 
bruise that was bleeding into his knee.  
</P>
<P>
 If there's good news for USC in any of this, it's that freshman receiver Larry 
Parker from Bakersfield is not all that far away from being a starter.  
</P>
<P>
 Parker, 6-2 and 180, caught five passes for 40 yards at Penn State, with a 
long gain of 21, after not having played against Washington. Baylor has 
committed early to letting Watson lead the team. A six-foot, 205-pounder, he 
has completed 22 of 40 passes for 429 yards and five touchdowns.  
</P>
<P>
 Said Baylor Coach Chuck Reedy: "We thought there were four great high school 
quarterbacks in Texas last year. We recruited all four, and feel fortunate that 
Jeff is the one we wound up with." 
</P>
<P>
 In his most impressive game to date, Watson brought Baylor from behind twice 
last week in the victory over Oklahoma State.  
</P>
<P>
 Baylor's secondary is led by two NFL-sized safeties, Chris Lewis (6-3, 210) 
and Adrian Robinson (6-2, 210). They have three of Baylor's eight 
interceptions. USC Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Starting lineup changes: Terry Barnum has moved into the fullback spot ahead 
of David Dotson. Quincy Harrison, who had a 68-yard interception return at Penn 
State, has taken over at right cornerback, replacing Jerald Henry. Israel 
Ifeanyi starts at outside linebacker, ahead of Errol Small. Linebacker Donn 
Cunnigan and defensive end Elic Mahone are sidelined. USC TROJANS

UCLA READY TO MAKE CASE AGAINST DEFENSE; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: WASHINGTON STATE 
SHOULD FIND OUT IF UNIT IS REAL TODAY AGAINST BRUIN OFFENSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Half of today's game at the Rose Bowl offers an intriguing matchup: UCLA's 
high-powered offense, one of the Pacific 10's best, against Washington State's 
defense, one of the best in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The other half could be downright ugly, thanks to a shaky Washington State 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
 The 22nd-ranked Cougars have lost four fumbles, and quarterback Chad Davis has 
thrown four interceptions in winning both their games, mainly on the strength 
of a defense that has not given up a touchdown in 10 quarters, dating to last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a defense that knows its place and wants you to know it. Think defense in 
the Pac-10, and you think Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 "That bothers the hell out of us, and that's our motivation right now," said 
DeWayne Patterson, who holds the school record with 27 sacks. "That and being 
predicted for 10th place (in the Pac-10 by the media in the preseason poll). 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel like we have a good defense, just like Arizona has a good defense, 
but not too much offense, like Arizona doesn't have too much offense. We feel 
we're in the same predicament as Arizona, and we can't go on the sideline 
bitching about the offense turning over the ball. We've got to think we can 
still win." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington State has, against Illinois and Fresno State. The defense is ranked 
No. 1 in the Pac-10 against the run, giving up a little more than 22 inches per 
carry, and in passing efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 But it figures to have its hands full with the No. 18 Bruins, who have moved 
the ball against everybody -- even Nebraska, which beat them last week, 49-21. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we haven't been getting the ball in the end zone enough," said 
quarterback Wayne Cook, who has also thrown four interceptions in the last two 
games while trying to step up his game without J.J. Stokes as a target. "We've 
been able to move between our 20 and about their 30-yard lines, but not the end 
zone." 
</P>
<P>
 Long-distance field-goal tries by Bjorn Merten have resulted, eight of them in 
three games, six from 40 or more yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The possibility of having Stokes back for limited duty today excites Cook and 
perplexes Cougar Coach Mike Price. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to see our offense at its best," said Cook, who hasn't since 
Stokes suffered a bruised thigh muscle against Tennessee in the first half of 
the season opener. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to have to surround him," said Price of Stokes, adding, "We will 
have a certain package for J.J." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that Stokes is questionable for the game, and the decision on 
him won't be made until shortly before kickoff. If he plays, all sorts of 
possibilities open. For instance, the running game. 
</P>
<P>
 The running game? 
</P>
<P>
 "When you look at the Tennessee film, you could see three people roll toward 
him," offensive coordinator Bob Toledo said. "Then you look at the Nebraska 
film and that safety that would have been rolling toward J.J. was moving up to 
the line of scrimmage to play the run." 
</P>
<P>
 Given Washington's State's proclivity against the run, UCLA tailback Sharmon 
Shah, who has 382 running yards in three games, would prefer that the Cougars' 
defensive backfield was otherwise occupied. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA's defense, which carried the team at times last year in a Rose Bowl 
season, has fallen on hard times. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins were outmanned against Nebraska, which rushed for 484 yards, 
sending the Bruins to the bottom of the Pac-10 in defensive statistics. Only 
USC is worse overall. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA is feeling the loss of experienced defenders. Three juniors defected to 
the NFL -- nose guard Bruce Walton, linebacker Jamir Miller and safety Marvin 
Goodwin. Linebackers Brian Tighe and Andrew McClave did not return from 
off-season surgery. Safety Tommy Bennett has legal problems, and cornerback 
Carl Greenwood suffered a broken ankle against Southern Methodist. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really think that the first two games were more indicative of our defense," 
said Coach Terry Donahue, referring to victories over Tennessee and SMU, 
dismissing the effort against Nebraska's option offense as an aberration and 
declaring that the Bruins are more able against Pac-10 schools that like to 
throw. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in better shape to play anybody than Nebraska," Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
 What remains for UCLA is putting last week's rout into the archives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think UCLA will have to get their loss last Saturday out of their system 
before they take on the Cougars," Price said. 
</P>
<P>
 Have the Bruins done that? 
</P>
<P>
 "I honestly think that psychologically we're fine," Donahue said. "I think 
we're eager to get into Pac-10 play. I think the loss is behind us. 
</P>
<P>
 "(But) you don't know how teams will respond. Sometimes things like this can 
be the best thing to happen to you. Other times, it can be devastating. You 
just don't know until you keep playing." UCLA BRUINS

VALLEY / VENTURA HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL; HART TOO MUCH FOR WESTLAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a showdown of high-powered, pass-happy offenses, Hart High turned to its 
defense and running game Friday night to carve out a 20-7 nonleague victory 
over Westlake in one of the most anticipated high school football games of the 
early season. 
</P>
<P>
 Tailback Ted Iacenda gained 115 yards in 29 carries and quarterback Steve 
McKeon ran for 56 yards to propel Hart (3-0).McKeon also completed seven of 10 
passes for 121 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake (2-1), which averaged 45 points in its first two games, could not 
move the ball in the second half. Billy Miller, the Warriors' preseason 
All-American receiver, caught nine passes for 93 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a good running back and a great line," Hart Coach Mike Herrington 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the top individual efforts was turned in by Ronnie Jenkins of Hueneme, 
who rushed for 356 yards in 20 carries. Antwon Nelson rushed for 276 yards and 
three touchdowns to pace Chatsworth.

LAKER DEAL FINALLY BRINGS CEBALLOS ABOARD; PRO BASKETBALL: FORMER SUN SMALL 
FORWARD EXPECTS TO FIT IN NICELY AFTER BEING SWAPPED FOR FIRST-ROUND PICK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 His has been an unlikely path, starting at Dominguez High in Compton, where he 
played only one season of varsity basketball before moving on to Ventura 
College and Cal State Fullerton. When the Phoenix Suns drafted him in 1990, he 
was the 48th choice, one of the last players picked. 
</P>
<P>
 The most memorable moment of his four years there was his winning the 
slam-dunk contest during the All-Star weekend.  
</P>
<P>
 Friday, the course turned back to Southern California, to the team he grew up 
rooting for and playing for in pretend games. Cedric Ceballos became a Laker at 
last, a key to their future success as the new starting small forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "You dream the dreams," he said at a Forum news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 They became reality when Ceballos, the Lakers and the NBA hammered out a 
restructured contract that allowed a trade with Phoenix that had been imminent 
for days to become official. Ceballos will receive the $350,000 he gave back 
for 1994-95 salary-cap purposes over the final three years of his pact. And the 
Suns, as previously reported, will receive a first-round pick within the next 
three drafts, largely at the Lakers' discretion. 
</P>
<P>
 The price tag that would be too steep for most rebuilding teams became much 
easier for the Lakers because of that last point -- the protection that might 
allow them to escape from the deal relatively unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, if they finish within the top six in 1995 or the top four in '96, 
which, barring an epidemic of injuries would take beating big odds in the 
lottery, the Lakers have the choice to keep the selection and make the Suns 
wait until '97 to cash in. Around the Forum, the plan is to be picking in the 
20s by then. 
</P>
<P>
 One other factor helps the Lakers see it as a low-risk move -- they can make 
the decision on when to give up the pick. That is, if few undergraduates come 
out early after this season and the draft turns out to be one of the worst in 
recent years, a definite possibility, the Lakers can tell the Suns to go in '95 
with, say, the No. 6 pick. 
</P>
<P>
 For this, the Lakers get someone to address many of their needs now. 
</P>
<P>
 Only three teams had a worse shooting percentage last season. Ceballos 
finished sixth in the league at 53.5% and won the field-goal title the season 
before at 57.6%. 
</P>
<P>
 Only four teams were worse rebounders by percentage, and none had poorer 
numbers on the defensive boards. Ceballos is one of the best rebounding small 
forwards in the game, having averaged 6.5 in 1993-94 in only 30.2 minutes per 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 The 14.2-point average by Vlade Divac marked the second consecutive season 
that the Lakers had the lowest team-high in the league. How badly do they need 
accurate shooters? They took the second-most shots in the NBA and still came 
within half a point of failing to average 100 points for the first time since 
moving to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Ceballos is coming off a career-best average of 19.1 points, despite the 
limited time and being the fourth option in the Suns' offense at times behind 
Charles Barkley, Kevin Johnson and Dan Majerle. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's different playing with Phoenix and here, with the role," said Ceballos, 
who, at 25, fits nicely into the youth movement. "But when the opportunity was 
given to me at Phoenix, I took advantage of it when Charles, Kevin, Danny 
Ainge, all our big stars were out. Phoenix turned the burden on me, and I think 
I handled it well. I felt comfortable with it, I didn't have a problem with it 
whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jerry West, the Lakers' executive vice president: "We don't expect him to 
be anything except Cedric Ceballos, and that's awfully good. He's young and 
he's getting better." Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The entire starting lineup might be new -- sort of. Coach Del Harris said he 
plans to move Vlade Divac from center to power forward and Elden Campbell from 
power forward to center when training camp opens in Honolulu in two weeks.

BOXING / TIM KAWAKAMI; THIS GRAND EXPERIMENT NO LONGER HANGING ON THE ROPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a recipe for big and boundless things: Boxing needed a new home, and 
the newest major hotel-casino on the strip needed an identity. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in January, the MGM Grand in Las Vegas catapulted itself into boxing with 
an almost unlimited supply of cash, an uncynical, sometimes less than logical, 
belief in the greater merits of boxing, and a 15,000-seat arena that needed to 
be filled as often as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine months later, after some painful experiences, chaotic moments and 
bruising negotiations with the likes of Don King and Bob Arum, the MGM Grand is 
wiser, a little less free with the cash, but still gobbling up every big fight 
that surfaces.  
</P>
<P>
 In one two-week span in November, the MGM Grand Garden arena, site of the 
Julio Cesar Chavez-Meldrick Taylor card last week, will be the scene of two 
major attractions, the Michael Moorer-George Foreman heavyweight title bout 
and, in the most anticipated fight of the year, Roy Jones vs. James Toney. 
</P>
<P>
 But as its influence over boxing continues to wax in the midst of waning 
interest across the country, some wonder if the MGM can continue its pace. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad they have the staying power to overcome a couple of things that 
didn't turn out well in the beginning," said Dan Duva, the only one of the 
three major promoters who has not brought fights to the MGM. "I was concerned 
they wouldn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "But everyone knows they're not going to show a positive bottom line for the 
first year, and it's obvious they didn't intend to do that. Now the test is, 
'OK, we've invested all this money in this sport, now let's justify this 
investment by turning it into something profitable.' 
</P>
<P>
 "So the pressure's on now." 
</P>
<P>
 Others have tried to cash in on the fight game. In the mid-'80s, Donald Trump 
took most of the top fights to Atlantic City. And in Las Vegas, Steve Wynn went 
after big names, hoping to give his new Mirage hotel-casino a publicity boost 
-- and got burned by Buster Douglas and Michael Nunn. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the years, the most consistent site for top boxing has been Caesars 
Palace in Las Vegas, which still is involved in the heavyweight picture. But, 
one by one, boxing's harsh wind, and boom-or-bust economics, has blown each 
back to lesser roles. 
</P>
<P>
 Which leaves the MGM with its massive advertising budget, the only major 
indoor arena at a casino and the 40,000 people walking through the doors every 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 The MGM has put on nine fight shows already this year, will have the two in 
November and has plans for two or three lesser cards before 1994 is done. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I am, or the hotel is, God's gift to boxing," said Dennis 
Finfrock, the hotel-casino's vice president for special events and its main 
boxing executive. "But we're doing our part. We wanted to be players, and we 
are that. We know that boxing is a very, very precious commodity in the casino 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have a long way to go to establish ourselves as the very best ever 
in boxing. But we think we've taken some giant strides in nine months. 
</P>
<P>
 "And we're real proud of this fall lineup. It's probably one of the strongest 
in the history of the game, three mega-fights, all in a row. We're proud of 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 The MGM angered the other Las Vegas casinos right off the bat by scheduling 
its first card, Julio Cesar Chavez-Frankie Randall, the day before the Super 
Bowl and not long after Barbra Streisand's concert on New Year's Eve. These are 
two events when the casinos in town are certain to be packed, anyway, and when 
a major fight causes only confusion, rather than more cash in the coffers. 
</P>
<P>
 That triggered a boycott of MGM fight tickets by other casinos that only 
recently has been called off. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boxing's tough," said Finfrock, a self-described boxing fan, who got his 
first taste of notoriety, after a successful run as the Thomas & Mack Center's 
manager, when he was the interim athletic director at Nevada Las Vegas during 
the height of the Jerry Tarkanian vs. then-school president Robert Maxson 
controversy.  
</P>
<P>
 "There are millions of dollars at stake," he said. "The promoters out there 
are well established and entrenched, they have their own stables of fighters 
and their own way of doing business. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think now what you're seeing is that the other properties have pulled their 
horns in a little bit, they're letting us take the fights and seeing what 
happens." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the MGM has apparently broken at least even with its recently 
completed three-fight Chavez deal with King, it lost substantially in its two 
non-Chavez King cards last spring. It also took hits in its first Oscar De La 
Hoya card, May 27, and a few other shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, they started out making ridiculous deals," said Arum, who promoted 
the May 27 show, a profitable James Toney and De La Hoya-headlined card in 
July, and who is bringing both November shows to the MGM. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dennis' strength is that he is a good arena guy, and he really loves boxing. 
Now that he understands the business aspect more than he did when he first came 
on board, he's not going to make wrong decisions. They lost money on my May 27 
fight because they were so over anxious to get Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
 "After that I thought, 'Look, everybody can try to keep busting these guys' 
guts, but unless you show them a way that it can be profitable, they won't do 
it much longer.' Since then, we've arrived at a way where I get paid based on 
what the gate does, not what we hope for it to be, so they're essentially 
risk-free from now on." 
</P>
<P>
 Arum says that because of the Grand Garden's street accessibility -- other 
casinos can bring their top customers straight to the doors of the arena 
without having to take them through the MGM casino -- the other casinos are 
happy to let the MGM have the major shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Arum and Duva both disagree with one aspect of the MGM's optimistic, 
long-range plans -- its desire to acquire its own stable of house fighters. Why 
get entangled in too many levels of an already-complicated situation? 
</P>
<P>
 The MGM already has signed awkward Cuban emigre Jorge Luis Gonzalez, a 
heavyweight who Finfrock, against the second-guessing of almost everybody else 
in the boxing community, thinks has a solid future. But Finfrock, a former UNLV 
wrestling coach, is steadfast. Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations have brought both sides on the verge of signing for a third match 
between Humberto (Chiquita) Gonzalez and Michael Carbajal on Nov. 12, but the 
deal has been stalled by promoter Don King's inability to find an appropriate 
site for that date. With Las Vegas already booked for November, and both 
fighters looking to make close to $1 million for the bout, King has 
unsuccessfully sought a lucrative site fee from other locations. Without a site 
guarantee, the card -- which is supposed to include title defenses by Terry 
Norris and Genaro Hernandez -- probably will be too expensive to put on and 
might have to be delayed until next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've scheduled Chiquita to fight in November, either against Carbajal or 
somebody else," said Forum boxing's John Jackson, who is acting as Gonzalez's 
negotiator. Jackson said the Nov. 12 date will either become reality or be 
canceled next week, when King gets back from London, where his Oliver McCall 
challenges Lennox Lewis tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Medication appears to be breaking up what was diagnosed as a blood clot near 
the brain of World Boxing Organization junior-welterweight champion Zack 
Padilla, but further tests are scheduled. "As far as him boxing again, that's 
his decision," said Victor Valenzuela, who with Rudy Ayon manages Padilla. Top 
Rank, Inc., Padilla's promoter, has told Padilla that he should take as long as 
he needs to decide whether to retire or continue fighting. A California State 
Athletic Commission member told Padilla's camp that the commission will wait 
until Padilla is fully treated before it takes any action. Calendar

ACADEMIC ELIGIBILITY DEBATE FAR FROM OVER; NCAA: THE BLACK COACHES ASSN. STILL 
OPPOSES STANDARDIZED COLLEGE ENTRANCE EXAMINATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last winter, the threat of a nationwide boycott of some college basketball 
games was averted when the Justice Department arranged for federal mediation 
between the Black Coaches Assn. and NCAA leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with the academic school year under way across the country, it is 
increasingly clear that the threat will cloud the 1994-95 basketball season. 
</P>
<P>
 The gulf between college administrators and black coaches was exposed this 
week when Congresswoman Cardiss Collins (D-Ill.) supported BCA assertions that 
standardized college entrance examinations are racially and culturally biased. 
</P>
<P>
 NCAA leaders deny that. 
</P>
<P>
 Surrounded by some of the country's leading black coaches at a Washington news 
conference, Collins called on the NCAA to abandon the use of the test as a 
requirement for athletic eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have to realize that the NCAA is the largest governing body for 
athletics, not education," Collins said. "Why the NCAA uses this test is beyond 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 In aligning with Collins, who heads the Subcommittee on Commerce, Consumer 
Protection and Competitiveness, black coaches have found a powerful ally in 
their long fight to increase opportunities for minority athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue today are stricter academic requirements for freshman athletes that 
will be implemented next August unless the NCAA membership unexpectedly changes 
its course of action at January's convention in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 During a meeting this week with Cedric Dempsey, NCAA executive director, the 
coaches expressed continued concerns about the NCAA's Propositions 48 and 16, 
legislation that establishes eligibility requirements for freshman athletes. 
They claim the requirements have a disproportionate impact on athletes in 
football and basketball, sports in which a majority of blacks compete. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the existing guidelines, known as Prop. 48, an athlete must score at 
least 700 out of 1,600 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test or 17 on the American 
College Test, and have a 2.0 grade-point average in 11 core high school courses 
to be eligible. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Prop. 16, passed at last year's NCAA Convention, a 700 SAT or 17 ACT 
score will require a 2.5 GPA in 13 core courses. But Prop. 16 also offers a 
sliding scale. For instance, if a student scores 900 or 21 on the respective 
tests, the GPA is lowered to 2.0 in the core courses. 
</P>
<P>
 USC basketball Coach George Raveling noted that some colleges, below the 
Division I level, do not use standardized test scores for admission. 
</P>
<P>
 "And they've shown no noticeable decrease in the quality of students or the 
success of the students," he said. "The standardized test is just an instrument 
to keep minorities in their place, just like voter registration." 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to challenge standardized testing, Collins assembled 13 
academicians last spring to analyze the NCAA's statistical studies. 
</P>
<P>
 Their conclusions, announced at the news conference, supported contentions 
that the tests are not good predictors of academic success and should not be 
used for eligibility requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 "After looking at the data, it just seems to me that Props. 48 and 16 
certainly have the veneer of being a quick-fix PR campaign more than anything 
else," said Russ Gough, an ethics professor at Pepperdine University who was 
one of the analysts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think 48 or 16 are having any impact on restoring academic 
integrity." 
</P>
<P>
 The NCAA, however, is expected to continue to use standardized tests in its 
admissions formula. 
</P>
<P>
 "What people don't remember is every opportunity denied is an opportunity 
created," said Jerry Kingston, an Arizona State economist and member of the 
NCAA Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Kingston, an expert in analyzing graduation rates, said that when a black is 
denied a scholarship because of academic deficiencies, he or she usually is 
replaced by another black student. 
</P>
<P>
 The NCAA's powerful Presidents Commission is supporting legislation that would 
modify Prop. 16 to admit partial qualifiers with 2.0 GPAs in core courses but 
test scores as low as 600. A partial qualifier is allowed to accept financial 
aid and can practice with his or her team, but cannot compete as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the membership usually supports the Presidents Commission, it will 
have five other options to consider, including adopting Prop. 16 as it stands. 
Among the proposals that will be presented during the convention is one 
eliminating freshman eligibility standards altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 That might be the only acceptable scenario for the coaches, who are planning 
strategy before the season begins in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're very, very close to doing it," one source said of a boycott. "They're 
using it as leverage in talking with the NCAA." 
</P>
<P>
 Collins and the coaches, who will meet again in October, also have discussed 
the possibility of seeking an injunction to stop the NCAA from enacting the 
eligibility requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph N. Crowley, NCAA president, said the BCA's strategy could backfire. He 
wants the debate on academic eligibility to focus on the merits of proposals 
and nothing more. 
</P>
<P>
 "The BCA boycott does not enter into the discussion," said Crowley, president 
of the University of Nevada. "The threat of a boycott would risk producing a 
result that the black coaches are interested in." 
</P>
<P>
 Crowley said the report by Collins' analysts will have little influence on the 
membership because the debate over the use of standardized tests is a long one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some institutions use them, some don't," he said. "I don't know if the truth 
has been discovered yet."

COMMENTARY; HIS LIFE FINALLY HAD BECOME GOOD AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE LUPICA, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Lloyd stood at the top of the steps outside St. Dominic's Church in 
Oyster Bay and watched as the casket slowly came through the double doors. 
There were several pallbearers now, more than when the casket had been brought 
to the church two hours before. Three of them were Bjorn Borg, John McEnroe and 
Jimmy Connors. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a time, back in 1979, when they were ranked No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3 
in the world in tennis. No. 4 was a gifted child of New York City named Vitas 
Gerulaitis. Now Borg, Connors and McEnroe carried Gerulaitis' casket out of St. 
Dominic's and into the gray morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "You should have seen Vitas last week in Seattle," John Lloyd said quietly, 
then looked away and broke into a small smile. "You should have heard him." 
</P>
<P>
 Connors has a circuit for players over 35. Borg is with him and Lloyd and some 
other stars from the 1970s and '80s. Gerulaitis was on that tour too. And 
perhaps the last big laughs, the last great cheers from a tennis career filled 
with both, came last week in Seattle for him. There was this doubles match, and 
even with Borg and Connors in it, the show belonged to Gerulaitis. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the first set, I said to Jimmy, 'The other three of us might as well 
not even be here.' " Lloyd said. " 'This is Vitas' room.' And Jimmy said, 
'Aren't they all?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The last room the other day was a church with a high ceiling in Oyster Bay on 
Long Island. They had come from tennis and television and New York City nights 
to mourn Gerulaitis. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was in his prime as a player, when he was such a good man and a very 
bad boy, he resisted sleep as much as anyone ever could, because he was always 
afraid he would miss something. 
</P>
<P>
 He resisted sleep all his life and then died because he took a nap last 
Saturday afternoon in a friend's pool house, into which carbon monoxide was 
being pumped from a broken heater. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerulaitis died quietly in the night at 40 during a time when his life finally 
felt like morning again. 
</P>
<P>
 "My boy had plans again," his mother, Aldona, had said at the wake. "My boy 
had plans." 
</P>
<P>
 Gerulaitis had battled cocaine for so long. But in the last couple of years, 
he had come back from that and put his life back together and found a new 
career in television. Had found all of the old light. All the energy he had 
once poured into tennis and parties and the sheer breakneck rush of his life he 
now poured into golf and charity work everywhere. His mother was right. He had 
plans again. He had prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 He was born in Brooklyn, grew up in Queens and even attended Columbia 
University for a while. He came from public tennis courts all over the city and 
Long Island, and the Port Washington Tennis Academy. He owned a mansion in 
Kings Point once. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember this big blond streak," Mary Carillo said, remembering the first 
time she saw Gerulaitis when they were both teen-agers at the Port Washington 
Tennis Academy. "He was the most dazzling thing I'd ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
 Carillo, from ESPN and CBS, made the church laugh with stories about 
Gerulaitis, because he was still in the room and that meant you had to laugh. 
She told of a pajama party he threw in some Pittsburgh hotel on his 21st 
birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Jimmy Connors was up there after Carillo, telling about a time when some 
fan in Huntsville, Ala., mistook Gerulaitis for Borg, even with Borg in the 
same elevator. Gerulaitis signed Borg's name and when Connors asked him why 
later, Gerulaitis smiled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Always give them something to make them happy," Gerulaitis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Connors, who is as tough as there ever was in tennis, finished his eulogy this 
way: "He was my friend and I loved him and I'm going to miss him." Then Connors 
cried. Because you also had to cry in Gerulaitis' room at St. Dominic's. 
</P>
<P>
 Connors knew how far Gerulaitis had come back. Connors had always been a good 
friend, even in very bad times. Now Connors could see that the magic with 
people that Gerulaitis had taken out of New York and all over the tennis map 
was back. Maybe the fans came to see Connors and Borg. Once they were in the 
house, they fell for Gerulaitis. They always had. 
</P>
<P>
 When the applause came, when he won another audience over with all the 
one-liners, he was young again. He loved all the charity work with all of his 
great heart. He had flown a red-eye flight from Seattle to get to East Hampton 
on Saturday afternoon and do a clinic at an event run by Jack Whitaker and his 
wife, former tennis star Nancy Chaffee Whitaker. The size of the audience never 
seemed to matter to Gerulaitis. It was an audience. He would cast his spell 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was tired when his clinic was over, and wanted to go take a nap. He 
hugged Nancy Whitaker and said goodby. And that was the last anybody saw of him 
until he was found dead. 
</P>
<P>
 So there was a different goodby at St. Dominic's. Finally, after hymns had 
been sung, after Carillo had quoted the last marvelous lines from Camelot and 
Ruta Gerulaitis had read a simple prayer for her brother, there were Connors 
and Borg and McEnroe moving into the center aisle. 
</P>
<P>
 And suddenly it was 1977 again, when Borg and Connors and McEnroe and 
Gerulaitis were the Wimbledon semifinalists. The Borg-Gerulaitis match was won 
by Borg, 8-6, in the fifth set. Afterward, Gerulaitis was full of one-liners 
and sass, and filled that interview room with as much fun as it could ever 
know. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally some old Brit in the back said, "Vitas, you're pretty chipper for 
somebody who lost the match." 
</P>
<P>
 Gerulaitis, 23 that day and sure he would live forever, shrugged. "This was my 
winning press conference," he said. "I hated to waste all this good material." 
</P>
<P>
 The other day was about a different kind of waste. Those in St. Dominic's 
stood at the end and the organ music came up and a parishioner sang again, in a 
clear and haunting voice. There was a slight pause, as if neither Borg, nor 
Connors, nor McEnroe could believe he was here. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the three top players in the world once picked up No. 4, and started down 
the aisle, all laughter gone now from the church and the morning, only memories 
of laughter left behind, and memories of a short, full life.

 What happened to Hart High's football team, the one with the no-huddle, 
two-minute-scoring-drive offense? 
</P>
<P>
 The normally high-scoring Indians used a ball-control running game to beat 
Westlake, 20-7, Friday night at Newbury Park High in a game matching teams 
expected to contend for Southern Section titles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a good running back and a great line," Hart coach Mike Herrington 
said. "We wanted to control the ball. We didn't want to give them the ball 
because their offense has a lot of weapons." 
</P>
<P>
 Hart's main weapon was running back Ted Iacenda, who gained 115 yards in 29 
carries. Quarterback Steve McKeon ran for 56 yards in 15 carries. He completed 
seven of 10 passes for 121 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The story was Hart's running game, which was keyed by an offensive line that 
averaged 40 pounds per man more than the Westlake defensive line. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love these guys," Iacenda said of the Indian front line. "I wouldn't trade 
these guys for anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake used two quarterbacks, as Coach Jim Benkert planned. Brian Shubin 
played the first half and a few plays in the second. He completed 11 of 23 
passes for 134 yards. Scott Spruill played the second half and completed seven 
of 15 passes for 68 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Billy Miller, Westlake's preseason All-American receiver, caught nine passes 
for 93 yards. Mike Liebin caught six for 109 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 But Westlake (2-1), which averaged 45 points in its first two games, could not 
move the ball in the second half, when it needed to come back. The Warriors did 
not score and gained only 90 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not invincible," Benkert said. "We just made too many mistakes against 
a good football team." 
</P>
<P>
 Hart took total control with its first drive of the second half. The Indians 
drove 63 yards on a 14-play drive that took 7 minutes 49 seconds and ended with 
a one-yard run by Iacenda. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors had a pair of costly mistakes in the first half -- a fumble and 
an interception in the Hart end zone -- resulting in a 14-7 lead for the 
Indians at the break. 
</P>
<P>
 Shubin fumbled the snap on the game's third play from scrimmage, giving Hart 
possession at the Westlake 35. 
</P>
<P>
 Six plays later, McKeon took the ball 20 yards for a touchdown on a bootleg, 
giving Hart a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake came back with a trick play, a 37-yard touchdown pass play from 
tailback Jason Victor to Liebin, tying the score with 4:50 to go in the first 
quarter. Victor took a short pass from Shubin, but was able to throw the double 
pass because he was behind the line of scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians then pushed the Warriors around on an impressive ball-control 
drive. Hart moved the ball 85 yards in 15 plays, 14 of which were runs. The 
drive, which ate up 6:10, ended with a five-yard scoring run by Iacenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake had several chances to tie the score before the half, but the 
Warriors had a drive ended when Todd Renfro intercepted a pass intended for 
Miller in the corner of the end zone. The Warriors had moved the ball to the 
Hart three. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors later lost the ball on downs at the Hart five and the half ended 
with Westlake at the Hart eight. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got a little flustered offensively when things didn't go our way," Benkert 
said. "We're used to things going our way."

NOTRE DAME CRUISES PAST GLENDALE, 38-0

 Notre Dame High needed only one half to decide Friday night's nonleague game 
against visiting Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights muscled their way to touchdowns on their first four possessions 
then called off the dogs en route to a 38-0 victory that improved their record 
to 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior quarterback Ryan Bowne, who completed eight of 10 passes for 93 yards 
and a touchdown, led Notre Dame on scoring marches of 62, 53, nine and 50 yards 
as the Knights built a 28-0 lead midway through the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame was headed for a fifth touchdown shortly before halftime when 
fullback Don Ebenhoch fumbled at the Glendale four-yard-line. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter. Glendale (0-3) had yet to complete a pass or make a first down -- 
something the Dynamiters finally accomplished late in the third quarter on a 
13-yard completion from Jeremy Callister to Tommy Lee.  
</P>
<P>
 By that time, Notre Dame's reserves were in the game for good. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we played pretty well in the first half," Notre Dame Coach Kevin 
Rooney said. "We threw it a little bit, we ran a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
 Tailback John Garcia, who rushed for 57 yards and two touchdowns in 13 
carries, capped the game's opening drive with a five-yard touchdown run. 
Ebenhoch, who led all rushers with 69 yards in seven carries, accounted for 18 
yards on the drive -- 12 on a draw play. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowne connected with Troy Garner for a 13-yard touchdown pass on the first 
play of the second quarter to make it 14-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than two minutes later, Bowne ran nine yards on a bootleg for another 
touchdown to give Notre Dame a 21-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Following Glendale's third futile possession, the Knights drove 50 yards in 
seven plays to take a 28-0 lead on Garcia's 16-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale moved the ball with a little success during the second half, but 
never threatened to score. Callister completed only five of 13 passes for 60 
yards -- 35 on a pass to Lee in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Backup Mauricio Pena was unable to complete a pass in three attempts. Tailback 
Jason Klintworth led Glendale with 31 yards rushing in nine attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame outgained Glendale, 252 yards to 103.

BROWN WARMS, THEN TAFT GETS HOT, 27-14 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 After sitting out one game with a shoulder injury, Taft tailback Jerry Brown 
was back in form in Friday's 27-14 victory over Crenshaw. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot, 195-pound senior got off to a slow start, but picked up his pace 
in the second half to make up for a sluggish performance in the first. 
</P>
<P>
 He rushed for a dismal 16 yards in 10 carries in the first two quarters, but 
finished the night with 78 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown also made an interception in the fourth quarter and contributed a key 
66-yard punt return 23 seconds before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really picked up the level in the second half," Brown said. "I guess I felt 
more warmed up by then. Right now I feel real good and my shoulder is great." 
</P>
<P>
 Taft trailed, 8-7, when Brown's 66-yard return set up the touchdown that gave 
the Toreadors a 13-8 lead.  
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Dayon Shaw threw a 27-yard pass to Dashon Polk and ran one yard 
for a touchdown on the next play. The Toreadors failed on a two-point 
conversion try. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw opened the second half with a six-play, 71-yard drive that was capped 
by Brandon Seals' 33-yard touchdown run. Seals led Crenshaw with 103 yards and 
two touchdowns in 15 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite having numerous chances, the Cougars (2-1) couldn't score after that. 
Taft (2-1) took charge in the fourth quarter, scoring two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 The first of Taft's decisive scoring drives started at the end of the third 
quarter and ended nine plays and 72 yards later on a five-yard touchdown run by 
Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, they have a great team," Crenshaw coach R.J. Garrett said. "There's no 
doubt about that. They definitely showed us that tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Taft scored its last touchdown with two minutes left in the game, when Shaw 
pushed his way through the middle from the one-yard line on third down.  
</P>
<P>
 Shaw completed six passes for 44 yards and rushed eight times for 33 yards and 
a touchdown. Taft's Clay Carter gained 56 yards in five carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's interception came when Crenshaw quarterback Ricky Lumford tried to 
throw a 40-yard bomb to Seals with a little over two minutes left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown smacked the ball with his right hand and caught it with his left.

 Alemany 7, Simi Valley 7 -- In a game in which neither team could sustain 
consistent offense, Alemany (0-2-1) and Simi Valley (2-0-1) fought to a tie at 
Alemany. 
</P>
<P>
 Alemany scored in the first quarter when running back Danny Hardgrave fumbled 
and teammate Jose Gonzales recovered in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second quarter, Simi Valley tied the score on a 14-yard touchdown pass 
from quarterback Tim Bennett to wide receiver Anthony Tauriello. The key play 
in the 84-yard drive was running back Chris Miller's 66-yard run to the Alemany 
18. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley's Tim Wolleck's 53-yard field goal attempt was blocked with 10 
seconds to play. JOSEPH WRIGHT

 Ronnie Jenkins blistered Camarillo High by rushing for 356 yards and three 
touchdowns in 20 carries to lead Hueneme to a 47-29 nonleague victory Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenkins scored on runs of 90, 65 and 48 yards.

<P>
 Camarillo (1-2) scored first on Roth Valencia's 34-yard run in the first 
quarter to cap a six-play, 66-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
 But Viking quarterback George Jones struck back quickly, connecting with 
Rashod Cousins for a 13-yard touchdown play after a 40-yard run by Jenkins. 
Jones added a one-yard scoring run late in the first quarter to give Hueneme a 
lead it didn't relinquish. 
</P>
<P>
 Valencia rushed for 168 yards in 25 carries. MIKE JOHNSON

SMITH SCORES 4 TOUCHDOWNS TO SPARK KENNEDY TO VICTORY

 The North Hollywood High Huskies got to see more of highly rated Kennedy 
tailback Antwane Smith than they wanted Friday night. A lot more. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, a junior, stormed past Husky defenders for 290 all-purpose yards and 
four touchdowns as the Cougars crushed North Hollywood, 37-7, in a nonleague 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the first half we had a problem missing blocks," Smith said. "But our 
passing game was working so well that it took a lot of the pressure off me and 
opened things up." 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy (2-1) led, 12-0, at the half and piled up 214 yards. Smith opened the 
scoring with an eight-yard run up the middle and Cougar quarterback Dan 
McMullen connected with Damian Thompson on a 44-yard touchdown pass play. 
</P>
<P>
 Husky quarterback Jesus Acosta finished the half without a completion in eight 
attempts and suffered an interception on his last pass before intermission. 
After Smith ran for his third touchdown four minutes into the third quarter, 
North Hollywood and Acosta made a small comeback. Operating from the shotgun, 
Acosta passed 37 yards to Bruce Gage to cut Kennedy's lead to 18-7 with 11:30 
to play. 
</P>
<P>
 But North Hollywood (0-3) made the mistake of sending the ensuing kickoff in 
Smith's direction and he raced 93 yards up the middle for the clinching 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw daylight, found the hole and just knew I was going all the way," Smith 
said with a grin and a shake of his head. 
</P>
<P>
 With the game well in hand, Smith added his fourth touchdown on a 15-yard 
sprint around end, and backup tailback Adgar Maneses ran 58 yards for Kennedy's 
last touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith finished with 175 yards rushing and McMullen completed 11 of 23 attempts 
for 171 yards and one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Acosta completed five of 19 passes for 87 yards.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sylmar High Coach Jeff Engilman encapsulated his team's performance with one 
word. 
</P>
<P>
 The word, an adjective more likely heard in the locker room than the 
classroom, seemed surprising considering his team's 32-0 victory over El Camino 
Real in a nonleague game Friday night at Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't feel good right now," said Engilman, soured by his team's poor 
offensive showing in the first half. "I'm going to go home and have some Tums." 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar running back Durell Price had 158 yards in 10 carries and two 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spartans (3-0) held El Camino Real (1-2) to 79 yards. MIKE BRESNAHAN

senior was removed with 8:19 to play after scoring again on a pair of one-yard 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Bryan Paul completed six of 14 for 105 yards, including a 41-yard 
strike to Tyler Dritz with 37 seconds left in the first half to give Moorpark a 
21-12 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark's Jose Ceja recovered two fumbles and deflected a pass that led to an 
interception by Dritz. GERRY PRICE

 Littlerock High defensive tackle Mike Kieffer sacked Barstow quarterback 
Bryson Gardner on the last play of the game to preserve a 28-28 tie Friday in a 
nonleague game. 
</P>
<P>
 With 12 seconds left, Barstow opted to run a play from the Littlerock 27 
instead of going for the field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lobos rallied from a 28-point deficit to tie it on Bruce Johnson's 
one-yard sneak.

CHAMINADE SACKS GRANADA HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chaminade High dominated every phase of its 28-8 intersectional victory over 
Granada Hills on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 A strong rushing attack, a long touchdown pass and a defensive effort that 
included nine sacks left little doubt why the Eagles have started the season 
with a 3-0 record. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaminade quarterback Tom Racius completed 15 of 29 passes for 282 yards, 
including a 70-yard scoring pass to senior Dino Dinielli. The score gave the 
Eagles a 21-0 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Dinielli caught four passes for 131 yards and also forced a fumble in the 
second quarter while recording one of the Chaminade sacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Granada Hills quarterback Bryan MacLean completed 12 of 25 for 208 yards, but 
the sacks gave him minus-66 rushing yards. MacLean hit Eric Carpenter with an 
18-yard pass in the third quarter for the Highlanders' only touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Giovannettone scored Chaminade's first two touchdowns.

LINS MOVES CRESPI IN PASSING LANE, 28-13 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Crespi High quarterback David Lins looked at Canyon's defense on film and his 
eyes got as big as saucers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They play a loose three (defensive backfield) and rush only four people," 
Lins said. "I felt pretty pumped when I got out here." 
</P>
<P>
 He played like it. Lins led Crespi to a 28-13 victory at Canyon High by 
completing 26 of 35 passes for 285 yards and a touchdown. The Cowboys couldn't 
stop Lins, who completed passes in bunches: seven, five and six in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon's concern with Lins -- who usually hooked up with wide receivers Jeff 
DeFinney (12 receptions, 114 yards) and Wayne Emerson (seven catches, 107 
yards) -- opened up the Crespi running game. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamian Barbour was the happy recipient of several huge holes. The junior 
rushed for 166 yards and three touchdowns in 23 carries. He raced 59 yards for 
a touchdown on the first play of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Canyon is usually a crazy team -- they go all out on every play, they jump 
over piles," Lins said. "They weren't like that tonight. Maybe scoring on the 
first play had something to do with that." 
</P>
<P>
 The Celts (2-1) routed the Cowboys (0-3) in total offense, 462-225, but it was 
anybody's ballgame at halftime. Crespi led, 14-13, before putting the game out 
of reach in the second half with a strong defense that held Cowboy quarterback 
Ahjeron Palmer to six of 18 passes for 55 yards. Palmer gained 74 yards in 10 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading, 7-0, in the first quarter, Crespi had first-and-goal at the two when 
Barbour fumbled and Canyon's Nathan Blade recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 After Blade's recovery, Canyon made it 7-7 by moving 95 yards in four plays, 
Palmer racing 46 yards for the touchdown on a bootleg. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon's Jeff McKinley (eight carries for 61 yards) scored on a six-yard run 
in the second quarter, but after a two-point conversion pass failed, it was all 
Crespi. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbour had a 16-yard scoring run to make it 14-7 prior to McKinley's score, 
and Barbour added a one-yarder in the fourth quarter. Lins' lone touchdown pass 
was a five-yarder to Todd McLean in the third quarter that made it 21-13.

LEE CARRIES ROYAL OVER VENTURA, 16-13

 Running back Jerome Lee rushed for 185 yards in 19 carries, including a 
55-yard touchdown run, to lead Royal High to a 16-13 victory over Ventura in a 
nonleague game Friday night at Moorpark College. 
</P>
<P>
 Royal (2-1) jumped to a 16-0 lead, scoring on its first three possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 The first touchdown came 1 minute 40 seconds into the game when Christian 
Broussard, who finished with 46 yards in five carries, scored on a 12-yard run. 
The drive was highlighted by Lee's 61-yard run to the Ventura 12. 
</P>
<P>
 After forcing Ventura (0-3) to punt, Royal marched to the Ventura 26 but 
settled for a 45-yard field goal by Matt Pitstick. 
</P>
<P>
 The Highlanders, who held Ventura to 145 yards, again forced a punt. Royal 
marched 95 yards in seven plays and capped the drive on a 55-yard touchdown run 
by Lee. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars got on the board with 45 seconds to play in the first half when 
quarterback Erik Olson (five of 11 for 69 yards) combined with Aaron Davis on a 
21-yard pass. 
</P>
<P>
 After Ventura's Ramsey Jay returned the second-half kickoff 78 yards, Davis 
scored on a two-yard run.

ANTELOPE VALLEY RUNS INTO REAL CHALLENGE; HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL: BAKERSFIELD 
FEATURES ALL-AMERICAN RUNNING BACK STEVE WOFFORD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL LAZARUS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With two shutouts in two weeks, defense is the reason Antelope Valley High's 
football team is undefeated. But an All-American running back will provide the 
Antelopes with their stiffest test when they play Bakersfield, the third-ranked 
team in the state, tonight in Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Kickoff is at 7:30 at Bakersfield College. The game is expected to draw a 
crowd of more than 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming off a 14-0 victory over West Bakersfield and an 8-0 victory over 
Hesperia in its season opener, Antelope Valley, ranked 16th in the state, must 
contend with standout running back Steve Wofford. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Wofford gained 142 yards in 16 carries in a 45-14 victory over 
South Bakersfield, establishing a Central Section career rushing record. 
Wofford has 4,675 rushing yards. In a season-opening 31-7 victory over Garces, 
the 5-foot-10, 175-pound Wofford gained 171 yards in 18 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's just the best running back in the state," Antelope Valley Coach Brent 
Newcomb said. "He's got an excellent line in front of him and they've got great 
athletes everywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley may have to face Wofford without one of its best defensive 
players. Caleb Smith, a All-Golden League lineman in 1993, is questionable 
after injuring his right foot against West Bakersfield. X-rays of the foot were 
negative but he was held out of practice early in the week. 
</P>
<P>
 When the teams met last year in Bakersfield, Wofford had 171 yards in 32 
carries but was upstaged by Antelope Valley tailback Jermaine Lewis, who gained 
247 yards and scored two touchdowns in 28 carries in a 19-16 defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis, a junior, has gained 188 yards in 36 carries this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley quarterback Trymon Redick completed three of six passes for 95 
yards against West Bakersfield after attempting only one pass against Hesperia 
because of a finger injury.

DROUGHNS RUSHES FOR 278 YARDS IN ANAHEIM'S UPSET OF IRVINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The clock ticked down to zero and Terry Henigan turned to his team and yelled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Go over and congratulate them," he said."They kicked our butts." 
</P>
<P>
 Nice to see Henigan doesn't watch a game through rose-colored glasses. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim did exactly what Henigan said. The Colonists, who have a one-man 
attack in Reuben Droughns, knew exactly how to use him in their 20-7 upset of 
third-ranked Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Droughns right. Droughns left. Droughns right up the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a simple game plan, and the Colonists executed it -- and executed the 
Vaqueros at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anaheim junior rushed 31 times for 278 yards and three touchdowns Saturday 
at Glover Stadium as the Colonists (3-0) made believers out of at least one 
Orange County power. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to gain our respect," Droughns said afterward to reporters. "You've 
got to admit it -- everyone doubted us. No one thought we could do it." 
</P>
<P>
 OK, nobody thought you could do it, Reuben. Especially against Irvine (2-1), 
which was ranked No. 3 in the State Division II rankings by Cal-Hi Sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just happy to be on the same field with a team of (Irvine's) caliber," 
said Anaheim Coach Allen Carter before the game. "We just hope to have a 
reasonable score and give a good account for ourselves."

NEW COUNTY SECTION PLAN TO BE DISCUSSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Members of the steering committee for the proposed Orange County high school 
athletic section will meet with the Southern Section executive committee 
Wednesday to answer questions regarding the break. 
</P>
<P>
 The executive committee is seeking responses to a list of questions submitted 
to Orange County officials recently.The questions concerned finances, playoffs 
and strategic planning. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee's main concern is finances, according to a section member. Those 
concerns are also held by officials at the Anaheim Union High School District 
and the Fullerton Joint Union High School District. Of the county's 15 school 
districts, they are the only two which have not passed a resolution supporting 
an Orange County Section. 
</P>
<P>
 The support of those two districts is considered necessary to form a section. 
</P>
<P>
 After meeting with the steering committee, Southern Section officials expect 
to draft a proposal for an Orange County Section and submit it to all Southern 
Section schools in the next two weeks. The motion will be voted on at the 
Southern Section Council meeting Oct. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the proposal will go before the State Federated Council on Oct. 
28. 
</P>
<P>
 An official said Orange County's small private schools will likely remain in 
the Southern Section.

COLLINS SAYS HE'S HANDCUFFED; FOOTBALL: INCREASED ENFORCEMENT OF 'CHUCK' RULES 
HAS KANSAS CITY CORNERBACK FRUSTRATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After nine seasons in the NFL, Mark Collins figured a cornerback with two 
Super Bowl rings could catch a break now and then. 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry, not this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins says he and the rest of the Kansas City Chiefs' secondary will be 
covering more than just the Rams' receivers Sunday at Arrowhead Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 They also will be trying to cover up downfield contact with receivers under 
the watchful eyes of game officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The league has decided this season to enforce more strictly rules regarding 
illegal "chucks" -- contact by a defender against a receiver that does not come 
within five yards of the line of scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
 That means physical cornerbacks such as Collins, who are often vulnerable 
covering a wide receiver one on one, must keep their hands to themselves after 
taking six steps downfield. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no doubt that's what the league is trying to do," said Collins, a 
former Cal State Fullerton standout. "And there's nothing the defensive backs 
can do about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Offense sells tickets, and with the new TV contract, the league wants 
high-scoring games." 
</P>
<P>
 And the league is getting those high-scoring games after a season-long field 
goal-kicking contest last year: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Teams averaged nearly 21 points last week after 23.3 in openers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Nine quarterbacks threw for 280 yards or more and seven receivers caught 
more than 120 yards in passes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ten teams scored 28 or more points last week, compared to five in Week 3 of 
last season. The Raiders and Minnesota each scored more than 40 points last 
week compared to none in Week 3 a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Arizona is the only team to be shut out this season, losing, 32-0, to 
Cleveland last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Kansas City quarterback Joe Montana is sympathetic to the cornerbacks' 
plight this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Wait a minute. A quarterback feeling sorry for a cornerback? 
</P>
<P>
 "This was becoming a defensive league and people weren't happy with it," 
Montana said. "It's great for the offense, and that was the intention -- to get 
more points scored because that's what people want to see. 
</P>
<P>
 "You would like to see it be fair, but that's not the case." 
</P>
<P>
 Other defensive players and coaches have echoed Collins' frustration and 
Montana's sympathy. Ram Coach Chuck Knox brought up the issue after the first 
week of the season. So has Ram nickel back Robert Bailey and cornerback Todd 
Lyght. 
</P>
<P>
 Rules state that a defensive back can use his hands only to defend or protect 
himself against impending contact caused by a receiver. A defender can't 
"chuck" a receiver or extend an arm to cut off or hook him, causing contact 
that impedes and restricts the receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 Example: San Francisco cornerback Deion Sanders bumps Flipper Anderson with 
his left arm as they were racing down the sideline in last week's game. 
</P>
<P>
 Result: Penalty flag -- Pass interference on Sanders. Rams gain 31 yards on 
the play. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's really frustrating," Collins said. "But there's really nothing you can 
do about it." 
</P>
<P>
 But there is something that can be done, Montana said. Put a heavy rush on the 
quarterback.

<P>
 "With the new rules, everybody has a tough time if you don't get pressure up 
front," he said. "I feel for all the cornerbacks around the league." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite changes in the rule interpretations, Collins and the Kansas City 
secondary haven't had too many problems this season. 
</P>
<P>
 They have intercepted six passes, four more than their opponents, and 
cornerback Dale Carter, with some help from Collins, shut down Atlanta wide 
receiver Andre Rison, holding him to three catches for 72 yards and a touchdown 
in a 30-10 Chiefs' victory last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City lost defensive backs Albert Lewis and Kevin Ross in the 
off-season, but Coach Marty Schottenheimer thought he upgraded his secondary by 
signing Collins, an unrestricted free agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins, 30, had received interest from Seattle, Tampa Bay, Detroit, New 
England, San Diego and Denver, but when it came time to sign, he placed winning 
as a priority along with money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I shopped around a little," Collins said. "But it wasn't a hard decision -- 
Kansas City has an excellent chance of winning the Super Bowl, and I thought 
that was as important as how much money I could get somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I already have two rings, but I want a third."

Q&A; 'WE LITERALLY LIVE BY WHAT WE PLAY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sir Neville Marriner leads the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields on Sunday 
at the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts. The UK/LA Festival concert 
includes the Overture to Mozart's Die Zauberflote (The Magic Flute), Elgar's 
Enigma Variations and Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto, with 17-year-old soloist 
Leila Josefowicz. Marriner founded the Academy in 1959 and is its music 
director. He also founded the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra and was that 
ensemble's music director for a decade, then served as music director of the 
Minnesota and Stuttgart Radio Symphony orchestras. He was knighted in 1985. 
Benjamin Epstein spoke with the personable Marriner by phone at his hotel room 
this week in Tokyo, where the orchestra was on a two-week tour.

<P>
 Question: Do I address you as Sir Neville? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Answer. I respond to almost anything. If you wanted to be incredibly formal, 
it is Sir plus the Christian name. But Hey, you! is quite enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. The Academy of St. Martin in the Fields is the most recorded chamber 
orchestra in the world, having made more than 1,000 recordings. Last year, the 
orchestra earned the Queen's Award for Export Achievement. Was that an honorary 
award, or were there precise criteria? 
</P>
<P>
 A. The precise criteria were simply that you come in the Top 10 of export 
achievements. Perhaps the most surprising part of our export drive for (the 
evaluating committee) was our gramophone records and the fact that the money 
earned stood up so well against industrial and commercial enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What are the drawbacks to being the most recorded chamber ensemble in the 
world? 
</P>
<P>
 A. The most forbidding aspect is playing in some of these extraordinary 
foreign places, where the acoustics are abysmal, conditions are awful, and the 
orchestra has been traveling all day, and you go on stage, and the audience has 
only heard you on the gramophone where acoustics are good and (the performance) 
flawless, and your challenge is not to disappoint them. To keep up that 
standard under the most awful conditions is our biggest challenge.  
</P>
<P>
 Q. What toll do you feel the studio takes on performance?  
</P>
<P>
 A. If you get into the habit of playing to four walls and a red light, it can 
(result in) the most tedious performance. One of the qualities we look for in 
our players is spontaneity, and vitality, and this is something you have to be 
able to turn on every time the red light goes on. We do many recordings as if 
it's a (live) performance, and we take it warts and all. 
</P>
<P>
 Jascha Heifitz made recordings in London years ago, and the recording director 
stayed up the whole night correcting all the little mistakes. Heifitz 
immediately ordered him to put (the mistakes) back in -- and in so doing made 
many musicians very happy. I think the days of perfect edited performances are 
dead and gone. I don't think the public wants them any more.  
</P>
<P>
 Q. It would seem that being so involved with recordings, always having one 
eye, or ear, as it were, on posterity, might even threaten to drain spontaneity 
from your live performances. 
</P>
<P>
 A. I just hope not. For a long time, because we made so many recordings, it 
was assumed we spent most of our lives in the studio. The Academy in fact does 
150 to 180 concerts a year . . . so by far the largest part of our lives is 
still on stage, in public. One reason we make so many records is that we don't 
have any government support. The orchestra lives by its wits; we literally live 
by what we play, so we depend very much on recordings (for our livelihood). 
</P>
<P>
 Q. And concerts, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 A. Even if we sell out every seat (for a performance in London), we lose 
20,000 pounds. We take in 25,000 pounds at the gate in ticket money, but each 
program, including three or four rehearsals and one performance, costs about 
40,000 to 50,000 pounds to put on. So you're up against a deficit every time 
you give a concert. 
</P>
<P>
 We do one week of recording to three weeks of touring. The Academy could tour 
every week of the year if it accepted all the invitations. But the average age 
of our players is 32 to 35, and many have young families. If we want to keep 
the best ones, they can't always be away. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. As it is, it sounds pretty grueling. 
</P>
<P>
 A. It's a pretty heavy schedule. But none of the players has contracts. 
They're under no obligation to accept everything, and we're under no obligation 
to keep them if they don't. We'll pay them well, but we cannot offer any 
security. Most orchestras prefer the security of a contract. (The Academy) is 
fairly unique, certainly in London, where there are so many alternative 
opportunities, chamber and otherwise, for the players.  
</P>
<P>
 But this sort of exposure is exciting for them. Perhaps later in life, the 
fiddler will want a concertmaster position, there will be house payments, and 
children to support. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Q. You recently celebrated your 70th birthday. If there were to be a 
retrospective of your life on your 90th birthday, for what aspect of your 
music-making would you like to be remembered? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Yes, I'm the geriatric one, the exception to the rule of Academy 
youthfulness. 
</P>
<P>
 My general philosophy is that I'm very much interested in the structure, the 
bones, of the work, and that it doesn't get obscured by sloppy playing or 
indecisive balances within the orchestra. I like a certain amount of clarity. 
Rhythmically I prefer music with vitality. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Many listeners find a certain elegance in your style of music-making. What 
do you find? 
</P>
<P>
 A. You're always so disappointed in all the things you fail to achieve (that) 
it's very difficult to think positive in retrospect. You always hope tonight's 
performance is the best you've ever done. You always come away with some 
anxiety. You know that occasionally you can hit the spot, but it's always in 
the most unlikely places, in Timbuktu, where nobody cares. . . . Then you'll be 
in Carnegie Hall, and it's televised, and you'll probably fall flat on the 
face. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What are your passions apart from music? 
</P>
<P>
 A. (My wife and I) have a house in Devon, down in the country, which I've 
become increasingly obsessive about. You start in your poverty-stricken days as 
a young musician, you buy a 16th-Century cottage, the best you could afford, 
with just a few acres around it. The years go by, now there are 30 or 40 acres 
around it, you restore it as a grand affair (and) pretend that you are a 
landowner. When we can, we escape down there. The English countryside being 
what it is, they don't have the foggiest notion what I do for a living. This 
makes me very comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What's the state of the Academy? 
</P>
<P>
 A. We have a small ensemble of about eight players that spends a lot of time 
roaming around Europe playing chamber music. We have another group the size of 
the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra, directed from the concertmaster seat by Iona 
Brown, and a similar group doing more contemporary music directed by Kenneth 
Sillito. Any less than 40 players, if they're good, they can do without a 
conductor. I suppose I'll conduct anywhere from 40 to 100 players. 
</P>
<P>
 We'd recorded pretty well everything from the earlier Baroque to the mid-19th 
Century, at least once, (as of) about 10 years ago. The only place we could go 
was forward, and to do that (we had) to become a Romantic-sized orchestra. The 
bigger symphonic writers is where we are at the moment. We've also added opera. 
At least once a year we record an opera, and every four or five years we take 
part in a production.  
</P>
<P>
 Our players don't want to be buried in an opera pit. They're extroverts, they 
want to be seen as well as heard. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Is there any repertory left that you'd like to explore? 
</P>
<P>
 A. There is a lot of opera to do of course, and in fact, here in Japan the 
Academy is playing the Brahms symphonies for the first time. But we're not 
rushing into the studio -- there are 192 Brahms cycles already on record. For 
the sake of our education, we do these things. We will probably play Mozart and 
Beethoven cycles forever, but Brahms, Shostakovich, Sibelius, we just do the 
occasional one.  
</P>
<P>
 Q. Is there repertory that you don't feel particularly well suited for? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Personally, I'm not sure I'd be a very good Mahlerian or Brucknerian. I've 
tried this, and I always feel my arms aren't long enough. There's a sort of 
spaciousness and a tongue-in-cheek sentiment about that music I find quite hard 
to achieve.  
</P>
<P>
 Q. What size Academy is coming to Cerritos? 
</P>
<P>
 A. I believe we're bringing 78 players, a sort of symphony orchestra without 
passengers. Normally speaking, you think of 92 players. When I (conducted) the 
Gewandhaus (Orchestra of Leipzig), they had 160. Because we don't have 
contracts, we don't have to carry quite so many. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Will 78 players suffice for Tchaikovsky? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Yes they will. We'll make quite sure they do, even if they lose weight 
doing it. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Academy of St. Martin in the Fields performs works by Mozart, Elgar and 
Tchaikovsky Sunday at the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts, 12700 Center 
Court Drive, Cerritos. The concert begins at 7 p.m. Tickets, $25-$50. Phone

AN INSTRUMENT FOR THE GOSPEL; POP MUSIC: ANDRAE CROUCH, WHO PERFORMS SUNDAY IN 
LAKE FOREST, USES HIS VOICE AND VARIOUS STYLES TO SPREAD THE WORD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BUDDY SEIGAL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If Andrae Crouch were a secular rather than a gospel artist, he'd almost 
surely be a household name. With a list of awards, credits and achievements to 
rival even the biggest artists in pop music, Crouch has enjoyed a productive, 
high-profile career, particularly for a performer in his chosen genre. 
</P>
<P>
 Crouch, who performs Sunday at Saddleback Church in Lake Forest, has earned 
six Grammy awards, three Dove Awards (the gospel equivalent of a Grammy), an 
Academy Award nomination, plus assorted honorariums from such organizations as 
the NAACP, ASCAP, McDonald's and Billboard magazine. Among the artists he's 
worked with as a songwriter, arranger and producer are Michael Jackson, 
Madonna, Quincy Jones, Elton John and Diana Ross. 
</P>
<P>
 He speaks with unbridled enthusiasm when discussing his music and religion -- 
which, essentially, are one and the same to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been times when we've been playing, and people who were sick were 
totally healed," said Crouch in a recent phone interview from an associate's 
home in Los Angeles. "I love a song that will usher in the very presence of 
God. Then there's no Andrae; there's no fabulous band, there's no greatness of 
ours. I've had hundreds of concerts like that, and that's what I try to 
achieve. I don't want people to walk away saying, 'Andrae Crouch is great,' I 
want them to walk away feeling something different. The difference is: I try to 
exalt God and not myself. When you do this, there's a freshness, you know? I 
try to usher him in, and then people's needs are met with just a song." 
</P>
<P>
 Crouch's music has always stood apart from the familiar, traditional black 
gospel sound of such artists as Mahalia Jackson, the Dixie Hummingbirds and the 
Mighty Clouds of Joy, even as they all share a commitment to Christian themes. 
While Crouch often uses gospel song structures as a base for his songs, his 
excursions into salsa, reggae, world beat, disco and funk have made his sound 
more accessible to mainstream ears, accounting in part for his popularity and 
busy schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Crouch, who refused to divulge his age, said he grew up listening to the 
Beatles, Otis Redding and other pop radio staples as well as the music 
performed at his parents' congregation, the Christ Memorial Church of Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother's father was Jewish, so she was very conservative," he said. "She 
liked little, pretty music -- orchestral-type things. My father was out of 
Texas, so he liked soul, foot-stomping music, yet it had to be biblical. It had 
to be a good song; it couldn't be just somebody's concept. If you can't prove 
it in words, it ain't gospel. Soul music is just an expression of the mind, but 
your spirit has to be made alive -- that's the real part, the part that God 
speaks to." 
</P>
<P>
 Crouch began writing songs at age 14. His first album was released in 1971, 
already showing signs that this was a man determined to stretch the boundaries 
of what defined gospel music. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have always said that I was out there," Crouch said, laughing. "Now 
they accept (my albums) as gospel music, but when they first came out, they 
were looked at as no-no's by the general public." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Crouch worked steadily as a recording artist from the time of his debut, 
releasing 14 albums through 1984. But Crouch's latest release, "Mercy" (Warner 
Bros./Qwest) is his first in a decade. He cited his busy schedule behind the 
scenes and financial trouble on the part of his long-time label, Light Records, 
as reasons for the hiatus. 
</P>
<P>
 "There really wasn't a company I wanted to be with," Crouch said. "They seemed 
down the totem pole as far as where I was coming from. But Quincy (Jones) made 
a deal, and he said he really wanted me to be with Qwest Records, so that's 
when I recorded this one. I had probably written 450 songs during the period of 
not recording, I didn't lie dormant. When you're a singer and a songwriter, you 
have to be singing. I don't write according to a project, I write according to 
what's in my heart. I always sung in my parents' church whether I'm recording 
or not." 
</P>
<P>
 All the acclaim and accolades have made Crouch a happily fulfilled man. But he 
still seeks a higher level. 
</P>
<P>
 "You think if you win a Grammy or something, you'd be the happiest person in 
the world," he said. "All those things are nice, OK, but I'm in the place now 
where I'm just happy God has given me a gift. The things that I've achieved 
have been his will. Now, I want to see what happens when I say, 'I don't have 
no goals but yours.' That's where I am now. I just want to receive Him and be 
obedient." 
</P>
<P>
 * Andrae Crouch appears at 6:30 Sunday at Saddleback Church, 1 Saddleback 
Parkway in Lake Forest. Tickets are $8 advance, $10 at the door. (714) 
581-5683.

THE FALL AND RISE OF KEVIN AND BEAN; KROQ'S MORNING DUO HAS SURVIVED TOUGH 
TIMES AND IS CLIMBING IN RATINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a first shot at the big time and, by most reckonings, a long shot too. 
</P>
<P>
 They had never done morning drive-time radio, which calls for a distinctive 
style of fast-paced, infectious and attention-getting chatter. They had never 
even worked together as a duo. 
</P>
<P>
 So when Kevin Ryder and Gene (Bean) Baxter hit the airwaves in January, 1990, 
loyal listeners of KROQ-FM (106.7) went ballistic, writing hate letters and 
dismissing the pair as a cheap knockoff of the hit morning team at KLOS-FM 
(95.5), Mark and Brian. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was the much-publicized murder-confession skit a few months later 
that eventually blew up in their faces and compelled them to pay $12,170 in 
fines to Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and to spend 149 hours doing 
community service. 
</P>
<P>
 Their ratings sagged, from a 2.5% share of the audience to 2%, or about 63,000 
listeners per average quarter-hour. Bean began casting about for a new job. 
</P>
<P>
 And why not? Any one of those setbacks would have been enough to kill the 
career of most radio personalities.  
</P>
<P>
 But Kevin, 32, and Bean, 33, have not merely recovered, they are now enjoying 
the greatest popularity they have ever known. Their 5:30 a.m.-10 a.m. show 
ranked ninth in the latest Arbitron ratings, reaching an estimated 4% of the 
audience, or about 100,000 listeners per quarter hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you get a lot of points in this town for just staying on the air," 
Bean said. 
</P>
<P>
 To some extent, the pair -- who worked for the same rock station in Phoenix 
before coming to KROQ -- is benefiting from the success of the entire station, 
which overall ranked third in the most recent Arbitrons, thanks to the current 
wave of popularity surrounding alternative rock. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kevin and Bean have clearly caught on among listeners who like the mix of 
music and easy bantering. They also are the on-air announcers for Fox 
television network. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're genuinely entertaining and though they do have their share of bizarre 
stunts, they're not wacky morning deejays," said 25-year-old USC student Matt 
Greenberg. "Their show isn't filled with crazy sound effects and zany antics. I 
like the way they play off each other." 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent morning, the pair, clad in trademark shorts and tennis shoes and 
resembling overgrown class clowns, launched into "show-biz news" comments, 
typical of their smart-alecky patter. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, you see weirdos in the world of entertainment sometimes and you try 
to figure out how did that happen," Bean said. "For instance, the guy who's 
stalking Kathie Lee Gifford from jail. How do you pick Kathie Lee as someone to 
stalk?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, let's say you want to stalk and you list a hundred people -- how is her 
name on the list?" Kevin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, because of their low ratings, the two created a reputation for 
themselves as underdogs, carving out an anti-star image that fit with the 
station's identity as a kind of cool club for people fed up with commercialized 
pop music and hyped-up, predictable radio. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a big part of why they're doing better now instead of trying to be 
like a Mark and Brian is because they've created a show that fits KROQ, that 
includes playing music," said program director Kevin Weatherly. "They are two 
extremely funny and talented guys, but they were basically doing the wrong 
show." 
</P>
<P>
 Much to their relief, the allusions to that other pair at KLOS have subsided. 
</P>
<P>
 "Four-and-a-half years down the road, they finally have their own identity, 
instead of being the clones of Mark and Brian," said Trip Reeb, KROQ general 
manager. "Though, to be honest, when we hired them, we didn't necessarily think 
it was a bad thing." 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to hear a lot of comparisons in the beginning because we were two 
young white guys who were doing largely a talk show," Ryder said. "When we 
first started, we used to have to throw out good ideas because Mark and Brian 
had already done them." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, as Kevin and Bean's ratings have climbed, Mark and Brian's have 
dropped, so that the KROQ pair is just behind the KLOS duo, who once were No. 1 
in the market. With their newfound success, it's hard to believe there was a 
time a few years back when the pair thought their days on Los Angeles airwaves 
were numbered. 
</P>
<P>
 On a June, 1990, broadcast, during a segment Kevin and Bean concocted called 
"Confess Your Crime," they secretly arranged for a friend of theirs -- Doug 
(the Slug) Roberts, now a KROQ deejay -- to call in and pretend to confess to 
having killed his girlfriend. So realistic was the bit that the news media 
started calling and the deejays kept up the facade. After NBC's "Unsolved 
Mysteries" did a segment on the mystery caller, about 400 tips were called in 
to sheriff's investigators.  
</P>
<P>
 The following year the hoax was disclosed and an angry news media, feeling 
hoodwinked, repeatedly portrayed the duo as callous publicity-seekers who would 
do anything for ratings. The hoopla led to an investigation by the Federal 
Communications Commission. To mollify the FCC, Ryder and Baxter made 
restitution to the sheriff's department and agreed to perform community 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 Reeb temporarily suspended the pair and joined them in an on-air apology, but 
he maintained his belief in them and kept them on, to the surprise of many in 
the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin and Bean look back on that period painfully, refusing to discuss it at 
length with a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those weren't the happiest days of our lives," said Kevin. "We knew at the 
time that we were (in trouble). We knew we did a dumb thing. We screwed up and 
it got away from us." 
</P>
<P>
 "It just happened to be the most public mistake of many mistakes that we've 
made at this job," said Bean. "But that was 4 1/2 years ago. The fact that we 
haven't gotten in that kind of trouble again shows that's not the kind of thing 
we do."  
</P>
<P>
 (The pair finished their community service -- half of which was spent at a 
homeless shelter and the other half doing speaking engagements -- about six 
months ago.) 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin and Bean met in Phoenix and were drawn to the idea of working together, 
but they figured they would start out in Tucson or, if they were really lucky, 
in Albuquerque. "And maybe someday we'd get to come to L.A., if it worked out," 
Bean recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 But a friend who knew KROQ's former program director talked them up and the 
station decided that bringing in a pair of unknowns would be in keeping with 
KROQ's alternative, and slightly renegade, rock image. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair credit the success of the station -- and the alternative rock music 
it plays -- for much of their current popularity.  
</P>
<P>
 "The music is great, the listeners are great," Kevin said. "There's not a lot 
of ratings pressure. They pretty much leave us alone. Still, we're not dumb 
enough to think this (popularity of alternative rock) will last forever. Pretty 
soon it'll be Paula Abdul again. But the good thing is it'll still be fun to do 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 And fun remains the primary impetus for doing what they do.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's why we wanted to do a show together," said Kevin. "Because we crack 
each other up."

 We are born with or we acquire passions as various as mountain-climbing or the 
collecting of porcelain, rare books or sports statistics. Leonard Feather's 
passion was jazz. It touched him early, even before his teen years, and it 
never flagged or left him. When he died Thursday just a week or so after his 
80th birthday, he was completing work on a revised and expanded edition of his 
"Encyclopedia of Jazz," the standard reference in the field. It now becomes his 
monument and legacy, the centerpiece of his wide shelf of authoritative 
publications on the art form he loved. 
</P>
<P>
 I knew Leonard's work before I knew him: from "Downbeat," the magazine that I 
subscribed to at an early age, from liner notes he wrote and albums he 
produced; and soon after I joined The Times as entertainment editor in 1965, I 
asked him to become our jazz critic. He and his wife, Jane, and their daughter, 
Lorraine, had moved to Los Angeles from New York not long before. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly 30 years he reviewed performances and festivals, profiled musicians 
and bands and wrote uniquely well-informed essays -- pieces of history, really 
-- on the state of jazz, which often seemed parlous as a commercial venture no 
matter how good the music was. Jazz clubs rise and fall (I can't begin to 
imagine how many different smoky venues he attended over the decades), yet the 
invalid, like the stage, keeps recovering, as he reported. 
</P>
<P>
 We went to jazz events together from time to time, and occasionally I thought 
it miraculous for him to be so patient when assaulted by what sounded to me 
like the honkings of diseased geese, from which tempo and melody had been 
banned. But patience is what any critic most requires, right up there with a 
gift of words and a fund of background. Leonard had all three, and I marveled 
always at his ability to convey in words what the music had sounded like, and 
to make clear why it was good and important. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By definition all critics are meant to be disagreed with, and Leonard was no 
exception. Musical tastes tend to be passionate indeed, never more so than 
among the fans of traditional jazz and the Big Band sound. Leonard bowed to no 
one in his love of the shaping pioneers of jazz -- Louie and Jellyroll, Bix and 
the Duke. But he admittedly had little time for the past recaptured; his 
musical gaze was forward, to the turf beyond "The Jazz Me Blues" and "In the 
Mood." 
</P>
<P>
 What muted his critics, so far as they were muted, was the fact that he was a 
doer as well as a listener, a pianist-composer-arranger-conductor-producer who 
wrote the first jazz waltz the Ellington band recorded. 
</P>
<P>
 His ears were color-blind, to mix the senses, and he reviewed the playing, not 
the player's race. But he also insisted that segregation had been a blot on the 
jazz escutcheon, and he admired the few bandleaders in the '30s and '40s who, 
like Artie Shaw, had defied Jim Crow and hired black sidemen. I admired not 
least Leonard's courage in being able to criticize those he knew well. When at 
a certain moment he felt that George Shearing -- whose sponsor he had been when 
Shearing emigrated from England -- had strayed from jazz too far into a svelte 
commercialism, he said so, but the friendship endured. 
</P>
<P>
 The life of the jazz critic is not easy; it is a life without sinecures or 
much security, and for that reason among others the number of really able jazz 
critics is very small and always has been. Their number is now diminished by 
one, and one of the very best, as well as a friend whose loss I mourn.

A BLONDIE ENTERS THE WORLD OF JAZZ; POP MUSIC: FOR DEBORAH HARRY, COLLABORATING 
WITH THE JAZZ PASSENGERS MEANS MANY THINGS INCLUDING A NEW WAY TO COUNT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Deborah Harry, jazz singer? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the blonde of the rock group Blondie is trying her hand at jazz -- and 
not the familiar standards style that pop singers usually stick to when 
crossing over, but the complex, arty style of the New York group, the Jazz 
Passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 And, yes, she knows it's a stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them, 'For 20 years I've been counting (the beat) to four and now you 
want me to count to six," Harry, 49, joked, speaking by phone from her New York 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would love to sing with them in the future, but we haven't even done one 
show yet," she said. "Who knows? They might fire me." 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the conversation, in fact, she'd had just one rehearsal with 
the group, preparing for the brief concert tour. How'd that go? 
</P>
<P>
 She laughed and repeated her first evaluation: "They might fire me." 
</P>
<P>
 Not likely. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy Nathanson, the co-leader of the Jazz Passengers, said in a separate phone 
interview that Harry needn't worry. She may not be experienced in the kind of 
music the group performs, but she's catching on quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she's going to be great," Nathanson said, adding that what Harry 
lacks in jazz experience she makes up in dramatic instinct. "It's hard stuff 
for her. . . . (But) I think the really great jazz singers from the '40s were 
really great actresses and it's hard to find that among jazz singers now. . . . 
Debbie is bigger than life and that makes these songs work." 
</P>
<P>
 The Jazz Passengers' music is marked by complex group interplay, sometimes 
drawing on the circus and art-theater music experience of saxophonist Nathanson 
and his co-leader, trombonist Curtis Fowlkes. The group grew out of the pair's 
late-'80s tenure with the arty jazz group the Lounge Lizards, fronted by 
saxophonist/film director John Lurie ("Stranger than Paradise," "Down By Law," 
"Mystery Train").  
</P>
<P>
 "The style is new to her," said Nathanson, 43. "Some of the things come 
easier, some will be rough." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a lot to learn," Harry said. "There are different time signatures and 
a lot more for me to listen to and pay attention to and be distracted by. But I 
think I'm ready."  
</P>
<P>
 The collaboration began earlier this year when Harry was asked by record 
producer Hal Willner -- best known for his eclectic tribute collections to the 
likes of Thelonious Monk, Kurt Weill and the music of Disney -- to be one of 
several guest singers on the band's new "Love Songs" album. It's the 
Passengers' sixth release, but first with vocals. (Others guesting include 
gospel-soul singer Mavis Staples, jazz-pop crooner Jimmy Scott, pop-rocker 
Freedy Johnston and young singer-songwriter Jeff Buckley.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Harry, who knew of the band from their common travels in Manhattan's downtown 
art scene, jumped at the new challenge. The chemistry on the one song they did 
together -- a playfully angular Nathanson composition, "Dog in Sand" -- worked 
so well that Harry agreed to sign up for a dozen concerts to help promote the 
album, including Wednesday at the Coash House in San Juan Capostrano and Friday 
at LunaPark in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry will share the live vocal duties with lsome of the band members, and at 
Nathanson's suggestion, they may do a jazz arrangement of "The Tide is High", 
the reggae song that was one of Blondie's four No. 1 pop singles. 
</P>
<P>
 The teaming is pretty much an even exchange, artistically and otherwise. The 
group gets a vacallist with character whose pop notoriety can help bring back 
the music to the attention of the people who might be otherwise unlikely to 
hear it. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry whose last album, 1993's "Debravation" was not a big seller and is now 
without a record contract, gets a chance to expand her artistic chops. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm experimenting with freedom and maybe I'll come up with something fresh," 
she say. "Or maybe something stale. Maybe stale will be hip." 
</P>
<P>
 Though having had a sporadic music career since Blondie broke up in 1983, 
Harry's remained active, recently doing short concert tours. 
</P>
<P>
 And she's continued her pursuits as an actress, having recently shot "Heavy," 
a low-budget drama that also features, among others, Shelly Winters and Evan 
Dando of the rock band Lemonheads. (Harry's most visible role in recent years 
was playing Sonny Bono's be-wigged wife in the John Waters satire "Hairspray.") 
</P>
<P>
 In terms of name value, the balance is weighted in Harry's favor, but 
Nathanson's not concerned that Harry's presence will overshadow the Band's 
music. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a different kind of combination," he said. "These are pretty corny 
times, so who knows how people will take it. I like it. It's really honest."

ROCKER STILL RAUCOUS AT 40; RICHARD BUTLER IS MAKING FUR FLY WITH NEW BAND, 
LOVE SPIT LOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BUDDY SEIGAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Take heart, graying new wave fans. 
</P>
<P>
 At the age of 40, Richard Butler is still snarling with the proudly arrogant, 
adenoidal whine that made the Psychedelic Furs a mainstay of the alternative 
scene from the late '70s into the early '90s. With a new band, Love Spit Love, 
and a new album, Butler's sound and vision remain basically unchanged. Even as 
he eases into middle age, Butler still produces music that any purple-haired, 
alienated teen-ager can relate to. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I still have the soul of an angry young man," Butler said, laughing, 
in a recent phone interview. "My father is like 73, and he's still an angry 
young man." 
</P>
<P>
 Love Spit Love, which appears Sunday at the Coach House is a group that should 
please mourning fans of the Furs, who went the way of most rock 'n' roll flesh 
after the end of its Spring '92 tour. Along with Butler's icy, love 'em or 
loathe 'em vocals (inspired in no small part by Johnny Rotten) remain the 
layered, droning blankets of sound that characterized the Furs' style and the 
disaffected, consciously vague lyrics for which Butler is known as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the sort of things I'm writing about are basically the same," Butler 
said. "I don't intend to write boy/girl sort of love songs. My lyrics tend to 
be about, like, being godless, not believing in romantic love and looking for 
something to believe in, which we're doing all the time, I think." 
</P>
<P>
 One thing that sets Love Spit Love apart from the strictly stylized Furs is 
that the group takes a few more musical chances and spreads itself a bit more. 
Compositions on the recently released "Love Spit Love" album range from the 
aggressive, punky "Seventeen" to the acoustic guitar-based "Codeine" to the 
psychedelic, raga-like "St. Mary's Gate. Butler stressed that his leaving the 
Furs was a direct result of a need to spread his musical wings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided at the end of the last tour that I didn't want to do another Furs 
record," he said. "I wanted to do something that would go in different 
directions, something that I didn't know what it was going to sound like ahead 
of time. I felt I wanted to be with something where I could change directions 
without (band members) going, 'That's uncharacteristic,' or 'That's not a good 
idea.' When a band's been around for like 10 or 12 years, it's like you know 
what to expect, and I didn't want to do that anymore. We don't pull back from 
the sort of things that the Furs would pull back from doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Helping Butler achieve his goal, in no small part, is guitarist Richard 
Fortus, a lyrical and versatile powerhouse of a musician who is as effective at 
painting delicate, journeying sound photos as he is at cranking out the 
aggressive crunchers. (Love Spit Love is rounded out by drummer Frank Ferrer 
and bassist Tim Butler, a Furs alumnus and Richard's younger brother.) It is 
Fortus' contributions, more than anything, that seem to flesh out the new 
group's more ambitious designs. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortus and Butler met when Fortus' group, Pale Devine, opened for the Furs on 
its final tour. The two became fast friends, and, according to Butler, that 
friendship was more important in Fortus' selection as his new guitarist than 
was his musical talent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was picking people for this band that were nice people," Butler explained. 
"That took priority over being a great musician. There's no use starting up a 
band that's going to fall apart in two years time because everyone decided they 
hate each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Butler grew up in London during an era that produced a plethora of legendary 
English groups, such as Cream, Jethro Tull, Traffic and Led Zeppelin. Still, 
Butler found himself drawn to the dark musings of America's underground scene 
rather than the better-known and more celebrated music being created in his own 
hometown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I listened to the Velvet Underground a lot," he said. "The Velvets were 
especially influential on a lot of the earlier Psychedelic Furs stuff. They 
really got cacophonous, and I think the Furs got a lot of ideas from that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Echoes of the Velvets' sound reverberate in Butler's music to this day, 
darkness and estrangement being themes he seemingly never tires of exploring. 
</P>
<P>
 Feedback for Love Spit Love from longtime followers of the Furs has been 
unanimously encouraging, according to Butler, who just might be hissing his 
venomous vocals into the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 "The response I've gotten from Furs fans has been great. You know, 'I was 
(ticked off) when I heard the Furs had broken up, but I really like this 
record' seems to be the consensus. But musically, I think this group is a lot 
more dynamic, and I'm looking forward to taking a lot more chances with it." 
</P>
<P>
 * Love Spit Love, along with Factory and Gigolo Ants , appears at 8 p.m. 
Sunday at the Coach House, 33157 Camino Capistrano in San Juan Capistrano. 
Tickets: $15. Information: (714) 496-8930.

INDIE LABEL STARS AT 'ALL VIRGOS ARE MAD'; POP BEAT: 4AD-A-THON WILL FEATURE 
BANDS, ALBUM ART FROM LONDON-BRED COMPANY TO TIE IN WITH UK/LA FESTIVAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Some of the most valuable rock 'n' roll over the years has been served up by 
small, independent labels -- from Sun Records in the 1950s to Stiff Records in 
the '70s to Sub Pop and Matador in the '80s and '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 But few of these indie labels have been as identifiable -- aurally and 
visually -- as 4AD. Over the past 14 years, the London-bred company has coupled 
spiritual, dark and surreal music with its own style of abstract album art and 
presented it all with handmade care. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is featuring some of its most celebrated bands and art during a 
weeklong 4AD-a-thon titled "All Virgos Are Mad." 
</P>
<P>
 The fest runs from Tuesday to Oct. 2 at various Westside venues and includes 
performances by such bands as Throwing Muses and the Wolfgang Press and an art 
exhibit featuring the work of in-house designer Vaughan Oliver. A 
limited-edition CD of rare and previously unreleased 4AD tracks will be 
available at most of the events. 
</P>
<P>
 "Creativity is a gift," says Lisa Germano, the former violinist for John 
Mellencamp who now records for 4AD. "But when most labels try to market this 
gift and make hits, strangely enough, creativity is the very thing that gets 
destroyed. For me, 4AD's greatest quality is that they promote creativity and 
uniqueness."  
</P>
<P>
 The label has inspired a fanzine, is the catalyst for a computer bulletin 
board on America Online, and has served as an inspirational wellspring for many 
of today's underground groups. 4AD introduced the art-rock world to the chaotic 
and intense clamor of the Birthday Party; the sheer, ethereal harmonies of the 
Cocteau Twins; the sci-fi surf buzz of the Pixies, and the 
medieval-meets-Middle-Eastern mantras of Dead Can Dance. 
</P>
<P>
 Label founder Ivo Watts-Russell was a record-store clerk in London when he 
started 4AD in 1980 as a "development" label for Beggar's Banquet, one of 
England's most successful indie labels. The label's first significant album 
release was "In the Flat Field" by the moody goth-rock band Bauhaus. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole '70s punk explosion influenced me," says recent expatriate 
Watts-Russell, 40, during an interview at his Los Angeles home. "The 
first-generation punk bands were being gobbled up by the majors very quickly 
though. So to me, in 1978-79, the more experimental side (of punk) was very 
exciting. People were pressing out their own singles, selling it off the back 
of their car, and there was an audience for it . . . an enthusiasm. I just 
wanted to be part of that." 
</P>
<P>
 "All Virgos Are Mad" (a reference to the astrological sign of both 
Watts-Russell and Oliver) is an attempt to get back to the label's original 
grass-roots ethos. "It's not anything too grandiose, it's just showing 80% of 
what the 4AD label is," says Watts-Russell, who timed "Virgos" to run with 
Oliver's already planned art exhibit at Pacific Design Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want it to be a big, elaborate showcase. We did something similar in 
London last year called '13 Year Itch.' It was very small, but a lot of fun. I 
thought we should do this in America sometime. Then Vaughan was approached to 
take part in the UK/LA Festival, so we said, 'OK, we'll do something too.' "  
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Germano, Pale Saints, Kendra Smith, Red House Painters and Lisa Gerrard 
of Dead Can Dance will play electric and acoustic sets at the two main "Virgo" 
venues -- the Troubadour in West Hollywood and McCabe's in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4AD artists will also make daily appearances at Arons Records in Hollywood 
and the Virgin Megastore in West Hollywood, as well as play daily on KCRW's 
"Morning Becomes Eclectic." 4AD will screen Dead Can Dance's new performance 
film, "Toward the Within," at Pacific Design Center the first three nights of 
the festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Watts-Russell is both skeptical and appreciative of the respect his label has 
garnered. "On the one hand it's frustrating when people refer to a 4AD sound -- 
is it the Pixies or is it Dead Can Dance? But on the other hand, when people 
describe something as '4AD-esque,' I find it quite flattering, though I'm not 
sure what it means. It's like they've created a genre that doesn't exist." 
</P>
<P>
 * "All Virgos Are Mad" concerts are Tuesday through Thursday at the 
Troubadour, 9081 Santa Monica Blvd., West Hollywood, and Friday through Oct. 2 
at McCabe's, 3101 Pico Blvd. , Santa Monica. $18 and $17.50. Information: (310) 
535-1714. 4AD (MUSIC GROUP)

 Doughnut shop -- A Sept. 15 article concerning a doughnut shop in a Van Nuys 
mini-mall incorrectly characterized an action taken by the Board of Zoning 
Appeals. The board called the mini-mall's parking lot a nuisance and put 
restrictions on mall operations. The doughnut shop, Orville's Originals, had 
not been declared a public nuisance at a hearing in July and no restrictions 
were put on its operations.

 Wrong player identified -- A story Friday incorrectly named Wayne Campbell as 
the Los Alamitos High School football player who injured an assistant coach 
during the first quarter of Thursday night's game against Carson after the 
coach was critical of that player.Campbell was not the player. He was not 
involved in the incident, and he remained in the game. School officials said 
Friday they would not disclose the name of the player involved. The Times 
regrets the error.

MUSIC REVIEW; ROYAL NORTHERN COLLEGE SHOWS A WIDE RANGE AT USC

 Why do things the usual way? 
</P>
<P>
 That is the question the composers, performers and producers involved in the 
Royal Northern College of Music's music theater/instrumental program Thursday 
night must have asked themselves. It certainly wasn't business as usual. 
</P>
<P>
 A wide-ranging 20th-Century agenda featured unusual combinations and 
imaginative presentations as key elements in the Manchester musicians' second 
offering in Bing Theatre at USC, part of the UK/LA Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 That the music itself and the performances didn't consistently live up to the 
high concept seemed of secondary importance -- though hardly negligible. 
</P>
<P>
 Most satisfying from all aspects was Judith Weir's opera in three acts and 12 
minutes, "King Harald's Saga," for unaccompanied soprano. Based on an Icelandic 
saga that tells the story of the Norwegian's invasion of Britain and subsequent 
defeat and death at Stamford Bridge just 19 days before the Battle of Hastings, 
Weir's opera effectively conjures a feeling of time and place, the singer 
taking all roles and mellifluous music slipping quickly high and low: The 
soprano is both bard and siren.  
</P>
<P>
 Camilla Johansen gave an engrossingly dramatic, liquid-voiced performance, 
roving over the stark setting of platforms and the ribs of a ship. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Oliver's "The Waiter's Revenge," cleverly conveys the vicissitudes of 
a restaurateur with wordless music -- rhythmic anxieties, whining complaints, 
lyrical flights -- for six unaccompanied vocalists, and the RNCM performers 
strutted vitally through it. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuel Barber's short opera, "A Hand of Bridge," for voices and chamber 
orchestra, proved an amusing melange of the thoughts of its four card players, 
who, of course, aren't thinking about the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon Holt's purely instrumental "Kites," for quintets of woodwinds and 
strings, seemed a run-of-the-mill catalogue of contemporary twitterings, 
squiggles, shrieks and snaps, but the dispersal of the performers across the 
stage on different levels, and the projection, in changing colors, of 
developing cloud formations on a rear scrim, gave the work a spacious, lacy, 
almost hypnotic quality. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Bliss' lively, neoclassical "Conversations" (1920), for mixed 
instrumental quintet, suffered from a merely orderly run-through and the lack 
of its descriptive movement titles in the program. 
</P>
<P>
 The concert, repeating tonight, opened with a crouching, quite naked Mary 
Hitch attempting, as Lady Macbeth, to wash off the blood, in Alison's Bauld's 
"Banquo's Buried," for soprano and piano. But even that startling opening and 
Shakespeare's words couldn't focus the composer's improvisatory noodlings.
